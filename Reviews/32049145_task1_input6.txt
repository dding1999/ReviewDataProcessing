$REVIEW.: After a few weeks, the internal power supply in the unit failed.  I suppose if you are like me, and leave your computers and peripherals powered on all the time, this radio is not the thing to have.  So, it wouldn't power up at all.Several emails to the seller were finally returned with the message that I should contact the manufacturer directly (gee, who would know).  Several emails to the manufacturer were ignored; finally, a request for a receipt and an offer to replace it if I sent it back.  But, from the discovery of the power failure to the time the manufacturer offered to take it back was SEVERAL WEEKS.Operationally, before it failed, I disliked it so in one respect.  It offers the user the ability to scan one's disk files of music.  Once you point it to your files, it will scan and catalog them.  The process can take an hour or more.  But, beware, don't power your unit down or it will lose all that information.  And, as you try and play your network-stored disk files, there is a very loud click between each song.

$REVIEW.: The video card arrived quickly and was packed well. The PNY card doesn't boast a super frame rate or blistering graphics processing power, but it fits my older AGP motherboard slot, and meets my requirements to a T. It uses a gorilla sized heat sink instead of the more common electric fan for cooling. Both of this card's predecessors went to their reward because of fan failures after years of almost constant running.The VCG62256AEB provides an excellent picture to a Samsung 22" LCD monitor. Installation was easy, with only the tight quarters of a four-slot motherboard hindering a perfect installation. Ubuntu and XP Pro recognized the card and used hi-res drivers immediately. XP performance was further enhanced with an update to the latest Nvidia drivers.This weekend I added a Windows 7 triple-boot to the same computer. Win7 recognized the card, worked immediately, and ran smoothly from the start. The card is an excellent buy, solid performer, and easy to install. PNY has already sent the rebate.

$REVIEW.: I was looking to extend my in-home network by placing a switch and a wireless network extender at the far end of my house (on a different floor from my router, to boot).  Rather than go through walls and floors, I decided to go around them (along the outside of  the house).  And I needed an outdoor ethernet cable.This is a great price for outdoor Cat6 ethernet cable.  It came quickly (kudos to the seller), and was clearly marked as Cat 6 cable.  The connectors are as pictured.  It was the advertised 100 feet in length.  When connected between the router and the switch, it carries the signal. And so all is right with the world.If you have a few things that are likely to stay in place when you use them (television, streaming box, desktop computer), an ethernet connection will always give you the best signal.  And if you are constrained by aesthetics (or a spouse with aesthetic sensibilities) from drilling through floors and walls, consider running your ethernet outside, with an outdoor cable like this.  It will take a bit of time, but it will make you (and others in your household) happy--and reserve your wireless capacity for roving devices (phones, tablets, laptops and the like).

But it has always held up.For everyone out there looking for a new hard drive this is a good choice, although i also have a maxtor drive and think that no one makes a more dependable amd reliable drive than maxtor this drive is a nice and little cheaper option.ONE QUICK TIP.........No matter what drive you buy your computer probably has a 5400rpm drive (this is the speed that the drive spins) (revolutions per mintue) spend the extra 10 or 20 bucks and get a 7200rpm you will notice a huge increase in performace from your system anytime you access your hard drive (moving large files, playing games,etc.) I have seen some benchmarks where a 7200 gave a 15% increase in system performance than a 5400rpm  !!

$REVIEW.: Purchased the Nikon 55 to 200mm after carefully researching. It is to augment the capability of my D 60 Nikon camera.Physically the lens body is very light weight plastic. After having rather heavy SLR lenses over the years this was a little bit of a surprise. Not as rugged appearing as some of my old lens. However I don't think that is much of a concern...no lens holds up well to mishandling. Have already taken numerous images with this lens and results were very sharp, great color and no appearance of flare. I would rate this on a Par with much more expensive SLR FILM camera lens. The zoom mechanism is very smooth. The price of this lens is really a bargain compared to past equipment I have purchased. At this point in time I believe NIKON to be manufacturing some of the best digital SLR lens on the market. NIKON is also extremely competitive on pricing. The main reason I decided to go to NIKON lens system over Canon is the competitive pricing, excellent reviews, and actual posted images I have seen. All of my other digital cameras have been Canon. Bottom line: if you are looking for excellent "reasonably" priced optics...buy NIKON.

$review_text.: Here is a Jan 21 2012 update

 These minis are all running well


 I started to count my sales for last year (2011)  I sold 97  upgraded  2011  mac minis

 Most were the base model not a one was defective!  Everyone worked out of the box and worked after the mods I did
Three minor problems in all
Two were my fault I loosened the fan wire when modding the mini on one and I had a ssd connector work its way loose after a mod..
The third problem was a loose fan connector in a sealed box

 I now load a free program istat widget and check the fan speed first off


I have to say they work at the highest percentage on any mac mini from 2006 up until 2011.Today is Nov 21st an update these minis run really well
I purchased over 50 base models to upgrade and sell all 50 worked and are still working pretty good considering most of my sales are to a famous auction site


No returns speaks for itself


Once you add the 8gb ram they are a very nice piece of gear


I have also been testing them with thunderbolt add-onstorage like the promise pegasus and the lacie little big disk

These options give a mini pretty much endless storage and allow easy upgrade of hdds or ssds externally

My minis are dual booting windows and lion

I would boost to 5 stars but 2gb ram stops me from doing it

Still the durability is remarkable 50 for 50 is amazing for a computer
Most are 44 to 46 good out of 50.First off I buy upgrade and mod mac minis been doing this since 2006


 I have done a lot
 This is the base model I purchased 2 of them
 1 from amazon the other from apple.
The one real flaw is it comes with 2gb ram..
 The machine needs at least 4gb ram
 I would say buy 4gb for about 40 bucks or buy 8gb for about 60 bucks
 Search amazon use  , ddr3 8gb ram 1333 ,  for the search  you will get lots of hits


 As for how does it work well with 8gb it is fairly quick in fact its  geekbench test scores are more then 6000 vs 4000 for the 2010 hi end mac mini


 What does this mean?The CPU is much faster then any older mini


 This allows you to do cpu work quicker


 Handbrake is a popular program it did a 10 minute 1080 p cartoon in 14 minutes using only 40 watts of power
 the fastest older mini does it in 22 minutes using 38 watts
 So if you want to use it for handbrake it is good after you put in some more ram

 Many have said where is the dvd player as it does not have one and you need to add on external one

 Well you do ! so it is another 40 to 60 bucks for one if you need/want it
once again search  {external dvd rom}  on amazon lots of hits.SO THE RAM ADD ON IS A MUST 4gb or 8gb
 The dvd  is  an optional buy , some people don't need it.Once you add the 4gb or 8gb ram It runs netflix at 720p well
 It runs youTube pretty well at 720p


 I think that is my internet connection not my mini as my mac pro is not much better for youtube!  I would have given  IT 5 stars (if it had 4gb as stock) as I like the small form factor and low power use


 As I said it used 40 watts when doing handbrake and watching a dvd at the same time

 I used kill-a- watt meter to take reading


 What held me back was it does not run well on 2gb of ram


If you buy it with just the stock ram and don't upgrade the ram you will see many spinning beach balls


So 569 at amazon and some ram brings you to  610 or so

 This is the lowest price to get into a real mac with a real osx and not just mobile apps like iPad etc.

$review_text.: One of the biggest places people waste money is on cables.  Almost any electronics store you walk into will have a shelf full of cables all priced ridiculously high and all offering amazing features and benefits.  Paying full price for cables is stupid and rarely leads to better quality picture or sound.However, when purchasing budget you should be aware of build quality.  There are many budget cables that while they perform well often are poorly made with loose fitting boots or thin cut prone jackets.  I am happy to say that this cable has neither problem.  This is simply put one of the best examples of budget cable done right.  Thick strong jacket with an attractive and well designed connector.  Please, don't waste money on monster cables or other expensive cables.  Pick this thing up, plug it in, and don't look back  100% A+++ perfection!

I feel more re-assured carrying my Asus Transformer tablet in this case than in any of the last three cases that I have used. The tablet fits in the sleeve very snugly and the whole setup feels very secure. The various inputs and buttons line up perfectly with the cutouts in the sleeve. I love the felt lining on the inside, which is smooth to the touch and gives the screen added protection. No complaints about this seller.

$REVIEW.: Ok I was a little leery about buying these because of all the 1 star reviews but I went ahead after I saw you could buy them directly from Amazon as the vendor.  I believe the people who are rating these 1 star are purchasing them from 3rd party vendors.  If you click on the link that says 23 new from $6.16 1 used from $9.99, click on the underlined words: 23 new.  This will take you to a new page that shows all the different third party vendors that offer this item.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FOUND IN THE THIRD COLUMN TITLED SELLER INFORMATION -  Some will show VENDOR NAME fulfilled by Amazon, or just the Vendor Name, BUT THE ONE TO LOOK FOR JUST SAYS AMAZON.COM.I have bought many things from Amazon and I always look on that second page to see if Amazon has a listing and I always buy direct from Amazon if they are listed.  Sometimes you pay a few cents to a couple dollars more but it's worth the piece of mind.  Amazon has always taken care of any problems (there have been very few) and they've even just shipped me a new product without me having to send the old one back and that was without me even asking.Suffice it to say you'll get what's pictured as long as you buy direct from Amazon and not from a third party vendor.  And there will be some who read this and won't be able to figure it all out.  For those people they either need someone who is internet savvy to help them learn how to shop online or they simply need to go to a brick and mortar store and do their shopping.

They fit in a tight space on my computer work station and I was able to get rid of much bigger, bulky speakers  I had. All I want is sound for news videos, so these work OK. If you're looking for a rich bass for music videos, these are probably not the speakers to choose. They sound a bit tinny. When it comes to news videos, though, they serve the purpose and the price is right.

$review_text.: This was purchased with the Anker USB 3.0 Express Card in order to upgrade my old Asus mother board to USB 3 as well as being able to access the higher capacity SDXC cards that my camera uses

 When installed there were some issues that I thought were driver related but after talking with tech support the problems pointed to the Anker card


 After that was resolved I had no more electrical problems
 The only other issue is that the card slot for the CF cards is tight


 There are spring plates on each side that make it a little hard to insert the card unless it's perfectly aligned
 Pushing too hard could cause some pin damage so I very carefully wiggle the card gently until I feel the card sliding freely

 Other than that it's a nice product.

 The original works great, never any problems, but the latest ones intermittently have problems with my Panasonic GH2
 The camera will complain that it could not write to the card


 I need to shut the camera off and on again, sometimes several times, to get the issue to clear up


 I've taken to just formatting them frequently and have avoided problems since, but it's unfortunate.I've had some issues with my GoPro also not recording..
it will just stop in the middle of a video
 I'll hit the record button and it starts again as if nothing happened

 I'm not sure whether the GoPro or the card are at fault

 All in all the experience has been one of distrust whether I'll be able to take pictures or video when I need to

 99% of the time it works, but it is inevitably that at a crucial moment I'm stuck power cycling the hardware.I don't believe I've had any issue with the Transcend 16gb card I bought.

$REVIEW.: The ESP-950s are very nice electrostatic headphones, and if you can get them for hundreds off of the $1K manufacturer's suggested price, as I did, they are a great value.Pros:  They sound great.  Very accurate from bass through the mid-range, with an emphasis on mids.  The bass is excellent, but not overdone -- these aren't for bass heads.  They love human voices, guitars and pianos.  They are lightweight.  They come with their own amplifier (you have to use it, or a Stax amp with a modified cable).  The whole rig is &#34;portable&#34; in the sense that you can run the amp off of batteries, but it won't fit in your pocket, so I would classify it more as &#34;movable&#34; from room to room, and flexible because you can drive it from an MP 3 as well as any source outputting analog via RCA jacks.  Koss puts a lifetime warranty on the system.Cons: They are made of plastic and the earpads are &#34;pleather&#34; or naugahyde, or whatever you wish to call fake leather.  Not really uncomfortable, but they do get a bit warm, and for the price a nicer material could have been used.  The volume control is dual, i.e., separate for left and right channels.  This allows precision tweaking of the left-right balance, but it is also a pain in the rear if you just reach over to tweak the volume and you end up changing the balance because you didn't turn both the inner and outer rings the same amount.  And you will change the volume a lot with these headphones, because they have a relatively narrow &#34;sweet spot&#34;.  They need to be driven a bit to hear all of their capabilities (like most quality speakers and headphones), but they do not like to be over-driven.Pro and Con:  They are very revealing.  This is a good thing, in that they reveal everything good about a recording and the source of the analog signal received by the amp.  They also reveal everything bad about the recording and source, and since much of today's music is poorly recorded, and MP3s at low-mid bit rates make poor recordings even worse, much of the material that many of us listen to does not sound very good on these headphones.  It isn't really fair to blame the headphones, but they are a bit more unforgiving than many headphones out there.  If you listen exclusively to low-res MP3s of modern pop/rock, you will probably not be overly happy with the ESP-950s.  But if you listen to CD's or SACDs or high quality, high-bit-rate digital recordings played through a quality DAC, you will enjoy these headphones.
$SUMMARY.: An excellent value if you catch them at the right time

$review_text.: I'm very happy with the quality, sturdiness, and compactness of this tripod


 The weight is a bit more than I would like, but didn't want to spend more than $200 for the carbon fiber model to save 0.5 lb


 The price is a bit high, but there really is no alternative at this price range.I took off one star because the quick-release plate must be attached to the camera with an allen wrench or screwdriver


 This is very inconvenient.

They only issue I had was the initial setup


The &#34;easy button&#34; option wasn't available on my router so I had to manually log in to the device to configure

The issue I had was using my Macbook Pro which caused the device's internal software problems

I switched over to a PC and had no problems with the set up program

$REVIEW.: Received product on Friday afternoon.  Charged fully until green light came on.  Paired it to my iPhone which went fine. Played it for about 10 minutes to make sure it was working. At low to mid volume there seemed to be a rasp or buzz coming from the left speaker but on high volume it sounded okay.  Went to use it on Sunday afternoon and the red needs charged light was on and it played for about 10 seconds before going dead. I'll charge it again and see what happens. The product itself seems okay and it sounds pretty good at high volume in the shower but the power out USB port is just stupid and unnecessary and what in the hell is the purpose of a power button on the front and another on off switch on the back? Ridiculous.  If it doesn't hold a charge this time, I'll see how good their customer service is. Until then, I'll leave it as a one star review.Edit:  I purchased this item from 1saleaday.com and not Amazon.  Amazon's customer service has always been stellar.  DO NOT purchase from 1saleaday.com.  I contacted them about returning the item for exchange or refund and they, of course, directed me to the manufacturer, hipeusa.com.  hipeusa.com's website has shown an "Under Constructions"(yes, that's verbatim) message for weeks now.  I emailed 1saleaday to explain that it is not possible to contact the manufacturer and they sent me another email telling me to...you guessed it,contact the manufacturer.  I'll be contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding both hipeusa.com and 1saleaday.com.  If I can't get my money back or a working product, I'll at least put a dent in their BBB rating.Edit 2:  1saleaday.com still won't take any responsibility and hipeusa.com is still "Under Constructions".  DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR BUSINESS AND DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IN IT'S CURRENT DESIGN. Do the smart thing and if you do want to at least try it out, buy from Amazon. They will stand behind the transaction after the sale.Edit 3:  I  am going to give them one star back.  Apparently my speaker will hold a charge.  I thought it was broken because it is one of the most stupidly engineered products I've ever bought.  It has a "standby" button on the front that basically does nothing other than turn the unit on after you've physically turned  it on using the switch on the back under the small rubber cover.  If you leave that switch on and just use the stand by button on the front, you'll get about two days of stand by and 10 minutes of actual play time before it needs charged.  You have to actually turn the unit on or off using the back switch for it to hold a charge.  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. If you are reading this Hipe (you may be out of business as your website still has "Under Constructions" after abouta month):  Your idea is good. A bluetooth speaker for the shower is a practical thing that people would love...if you do it the right way.  Step one, fire your current engineering staff. They are idiots.  Step two, use one button on the front to turn the unit on and off.  Step three, get rid of the switch and USB out port on the back. Nobody is going to charge something from the battery in this thing. It's a waste of money.  Reinforce the micro USB charging port on the back so it doesn't eventually fall into the speaker rendering the unit useless. Under the rubber cover on the back there should be a charging port and a light to let you know when it is charging and when it is fully charged. THAT's IT. KISS - Keep it simple stupid.  Price them at $25.  Or $30 if you want to be a scrooge.  You don't have to pay me anything for these ideas. Just send me a speaker that doesn't seem like it was engineered by a preoccupied four year old and we will call it even.Edit:  This company is just straight up shady.  As of October 3rd, their website still just says "Under Constructions" and if you look through all the five star reviews, you will see a ton where the reviewer only has that one review.  A classic indicator that HipeUSA is posting their own five start reviews to try and offset all the one and two star reviews.  Buyer beware.Edit 1/19/13:  The speakers in this unit have slowly degraded and now buzz and crackle at almost any volume level.  They are currently asking $50 for this piece of junk!!!If you want a simple shower speaker that works as it should at a reasonable price, buy a FreshETech Splash, available on Amazon.It holds a charge forever, has worked flawlessly, sound quality and volume are acceptable for what it is and it costs less than $20.  I can't speak for the longevity but I could buy almost three of these for what one HipeUSA unit costs.  The only negatives are the controls are hard to read in the shower and the charger cable is proprietary.  I can easily live with both of those things.

Had Hulu, which was a plus for me.  has many channels to choose from.  Though the interface wasn't as slick as the boxee, IT WORKED!!!I've had it for about a week and am extremely happy with it.

Thanks to Netgear for solving my home network spotty WiFi dilemma.==================Update May 11, 2012: I just added my DirecTV DVR to this switch and it works great too. No more spotty connectivity issues with WiFi anymore. My wife's PC is connected to the Powerline AV drop in the kitchen. I ran a speed test on my iMac, then ran the same test on her PC. The Up/Down speeds are identical. There is no speed loss between my iMac connected directly to the router and my wife's PC connected through the Powerline AV.

$REVIEW.: I would consider this flash an OK intermediate needs flash.  Its great for the new 70D or Rebel that has a built in flash.  I say this, because in order to use as an off camera slave flash, you need the built in flash as the master.  This flash is an optic slave unit only.  Should you have a second 320EX and be using a 6D or 5D with no built in flash, the 2nd unit will not master.  The TTL works well and that's a good thing, because there is no other adjustments for manual use available.  Also note that the flash has only two manual positions for mm coverage by physically pulling the head of the flash out or leave it pushed in.  There is no manual ability to adjust output manually.  The LED light is great if you are in a dark place and need a light to search through your camera bag for small objects or light up the trunk of your car in a dark parking lot, as a video light, not so good.  Any subject more than 3' away quickly become dimly lit objects.  As I said, good on camera Canon branded flash for point & shoot, but other than that not so good.  Even though its been discounted over a $100.00 already, you'd be better off spending the same money on a Yongnuo product and have the manageability options one needs on a DSLR.

$review_text.: As with any piece of expensive, portable technology, this new iPod requires a hands-on test drive
You need to get a sense as to just how portable it really is, whether it's solid enough for the journey, and, in the case of the iPod with video, just how good the screen really is under various light conditions


I've only had a few moments to check it out, but I'll share my observations
(Having had my nano screen break under normal usage on the very first day I owned it, I brought to the table a real concern about fragility, by the way

Apple, thankfully, replaced the broken nano with a new one, as they have acknowledged an apparent defect with some of the screens.)First, as you would expect, form and fit are first rate

The iPod seems to get smoother and more seamless with each generation

As with the nano, I think the scroll wheel has hit the sweet spot, too.Second, it seems more substantial and durable than the nano
Part of that has to do with the astounding thinness of the nano
There seems to be quite a bit more screen protection inherent in this iPod/video's design (and it is, after, considerably thicker than the nano, but still thin -- the 60 GB version is as thin as the 4th generation's 20 GB model, and the 30 GB is 30% thinner than that).Third, the screen is great

Clear, bright, and easy to read at a range of viewing angles (not that the latter is all that important for most iPods, but video changes all that ...)
I must say, however, that it pales in comparison to the Sony PSP's gorgeous widescreen as a platform for watching videos


(The PSP's larger screen is a wonder, both for games and movies

Apple has obviously decided -- at least for the iPod -- to sacrifice optimal screen size for portability
More on that in a second.)Fourth, the slightly sour note

Once you've held the nano, used it, it makes this iPod feel too wide and heavy

Wide to a point where it doesn't easily nestle in the hand


It's the screen, of course, that is responsible


This is where you'll need to pick one up, hold it, check it out
It may be awkward to put in an armband for sports, for example
I found it consmetically less attractive because of that width, but, of course, you'll need to be the judge
Videos look great on it, as do photographs and album art

It's a great platform for catching with Lost -- or Desperate Housewives

But video comes at a price, of course


(Perhaps Apple could have changed the orientation of the screen so as to keep the width in check

Maybe

I'd have preferred that, I think.)The iPod/video is a compromise platform where, as Steve Jobs put it, video is "icing on the cake." It may be a bit too much icing for some, given the physical effects it had on design

For those folks, the nano is absolutely perfect, and rumor has it that the nano's capacity will get a jolt upward in the spring if the 2 GB or 4 GB models don't hold enough for your liking.Another very nice product from Apple.

What I wanted to add though as a 1) small 2) simple and 3) easy to use MP3 that was compadible with the [...] format.  So in doing my research between audible and amazon I found that this was the cheapest and smallest player that would do just that.  I load one book at a time onto it and use enjoy the audio quality of the books.  The play button doesn't get hit accidentally as would happen with my iPod so I haven't had to go looking for a my spot.This is a pretty pointed review since I haven't used any other feature than the audiobook function which is the sole reason I bought the player.

There are a few key aspects any SSD(solid state drive) seeker should expect and will get from this SSD.  This was one of the fastest and most reliable drives out there when I bought it. The installation was extremely easy, transferring data was ridiculously fast (over 100GB in roughly 30 minutes). I have dropped my laptop many times since installing it and it is still performing like new.  My boot up time has been reduced to less than 15 seconds when it used to be closer to a minute and overall OS performance has been greatly enhanced.  I have also bought a Crucial SSD in the past, which I was pleased with, but not like this SanDisk.  The SanDisk is much faster on bootup and overall task time.  Though SSDs are expensive when compared to HDDs, the performance increase is phenomenal.  Unless I deem it absolutely necessary to buy a HDD, I will be buying SanDisk SSDs from now on.

$REVIEW.: For what this is meant to do, it's awesome.  I was skiing down a mountain nearly full speed and having a phone conversation and the person I was talking to didn't hear any white noise at all.  They've some how found a way to isolate the voice from the white noise that you'd otherwise hear using any other headset device.  It was pretty remarkable -- not sure why other bluetooth headsets haven't been able to figure it out yet.  In terms of listening to music it could be better.  The sound quality is decent, similar to a medium/low quality set of in-ear headphones, but the convenience of having the headset in the helmet more than makes up for what it lacks there IMO, and it's not designed or sold as a superior audio experience.It fit perfectly in my Smith helmet, almost as if it were designed around the helmet or vice versa.  Was super easy to set up with my phone and convenient to use.This materially enhanced my ski experience, both for listening to music and for talking on the phone.  Well worth the $200 if you're on the slopes more than a few days per year.  Couldn't be more happy with the purchase.

$review_text.: I purchased the Pink nano of this model two months ago and here is my review.  I upgraded from an 8GB Red 3rd Generation nano to the 16GB Pink 4th Generation nano because I completely ran out of space on my 8GB one.  The most obvious difference is the design, the 4th Gen is much longer than the 3rd Gen one, which really wasn't an issue with me.  For the most part I like my new nano except for a few things. First off, battery life is terrible.  After listening to only a couple of hours of music the battery is already half used up.  I have to charge it all the time.  The 3rd Gen nano def held a charge for much much longer.  Another thing I have an issue with is that the 4th Gen nano will no longer charge on my iHome.  I don't know what or why Apple did this but the new nanos won't charge on older iHomes, which I think is ridiculous because I'm not going to go out and buy brand new equipment just because Apple slightly changed the charging design, but it does still play music from the ipod, it just won't charge it while it's on the the iHome.  Before anyone says anything, yes I already knew that the 4th Gen nano is not supported on my iHome, but I bought it anyway.  The last thing I don't like is that the "shake" feature is a little too sensitive.  A few times I forgot to lock it and I went to put my ipod into my bag or pocket and I guess it shook and it went into shuffle mode, which was a little annoying as I had to go back and find my song.The things I do like are that it's very light and it comes in lots of colors to pick from. Unfortunately Amazon does not sell it in Red, only the Apple store does, so I bought it in Pink instead to try to match my red earbuds.

$REVIEW.: I have been listening to these headphones constantly for the past week and am very impressed


 As I have larger ear canals, I find earbuds difficult to keep in for portable use, and impossible for workouts
 I've been through two other sets of clip-ons and these are by far the most comfortable and best sounding


 The ear clips fold outwards unlike other clip-ons and allow you easily to wrap the phones around your ear and lock in place


 Although they are extremely secure (I'd recommend them for any gym-goers/runners), they are so light and soft it's hard to feel they are there -- and they remain unoticable for long use unlike my others which would chaffe and get tight
Moreover, they have a small and slim profile and I can wear under a hat without them bulging out.As far as sound goes, these headphones are unmistakebly Audio-Technica: ultra-clear highs and mids with somewhat recessed bass, with a surprisingly responsive attack


 It's crazy, but I actually prefer them to my Denon D2000s for classical music
 These headphones sound excellent with classical, folk and rock; they may not offer enough bass for Rap, Hip-hop for some, but I enjoy them more than my other portables for any kind of music since the clarity is so good.It's worth noting the cord from the phones is about 2' long, and there is a 3' extension that can be attached
 This allows you to either go short and carry/attach your player in your breastpocket, or go longer


 A nice carrying case is also included in the package and detailed instructions/specs.

$REVIEW.: I recently moved my Mother from out of state to be near me.  Family members where she previously lived wanted to stay in contact.  I selected and chose to review the Flip MinoHD model M2120 to record and send video messages from her to those family members.The Flip MinoDH is a completely self contained compact video camera.  The install file for the supporting FlipShare software is stored on the camcorder, and can be installed to a host PC as needed.  The Camcorder has recording and playback capabilities as well as a mini HDMI port, on the bottom, for playback using your TV's HDMI port.  A cable free USB connector flips out from the top to charge the battery or to manage recordings.  A tripod mount exists on the bottom center, plus the included wrist strap connects to the Flip's side.  A soft black cloth storage case is used to protect and store the Flip MinoHD when not in use.The FlipShare software, once installed, will manage all the Flip's recordings.  One can select to copy then erase recorded files from the flip to a computer or copy and retain them based on the software's settings.  While the software can see the recorded files, they can be played in widescreen format, emailed, uploaded online to FaceBook, MySpace, YouTube, or other web sites, sent as a video greeting card, or uploaded to the Flip Channel, a private sharing web site.  Recorded files can be trimmed and spliced together to create movies.  Additionally the recorded files can be used to create a snap shot by selecting a frame within the file, or recorded to DVD.The Flip MinoHD isn't perfect, and has a few concerns worth mentioning.  The Flip MinoHD's USB connection method may require removing other connected USB devices.  On my PC, the USB ports are side by side.  When connecting the Flip MinoHD to my PC, I must remove another USB device.  However the USB ports are separated on my laptop, eliminating this problem.  Displaying the files on a TV is great for sharing at home, but comes with additional expense of purchasing a mini HDMI to HDMI cable.  There is no extending the memory or changing out a dead battery since both are contained within the camcorder.  Plus, the Flip MinoHD doesn't have an option to film and view in portrait mode unless you don't mind cocking your head to the side to watch.Expect the camcorder to shut off automatically if kept still and creating a long recording.  I put the camcorder on a tripod and set it up to record a ceremony while I went to do other things.  During the recording, it just shut off, presumably to save recording space or battery life.  This is a great feature to limit accidental recordings.  However, I found no method to override for times when this situation is purposeful.The Flip MinoHD is simple to use, from filming to using the included user friendly software.  It's small size, 4" tall x 2" wide x 5/8" thick, makes carrying and storing convenient while on the go.  Plus the recordings are excellent for a camcorder in this price range and size, even in lower light environments.  Expect more visible grain when the light source is lower than normal.The Flip MinoHD does what it promises, and for its price, does so excellently.  I can easily record videos to share privately with family or on social media sites with friends.  Sharing and managing recorded files is easy using the included FlipShare software.  If you are looking for a convenient camcorder at an inexpensive price, consider the Flip Mino HD.PROS:Simple to useConvenient sizeEffective recording deviceUser friendly softwareCONS:USB connector may prevent other USB devices to be connected simultaneouslyMini HDMI cable not includedBattery and memory not accessible

$REVIEW.: I was concerned about getting some 3rd party battery but this seems to be the genuine article.  I am using it for a Thinkpad W500.Original battery label said 7.8Ah.  This battery says 7.14Ah.  voltage is the same of course.  Label also says, "Manufactured for Lenovo - Cell origin, Japan - Further processed in China."  It has the 41++ mark on it.  Seems to work OK but I have only had it for one day.  No "not Lenovo" warnings come up in Power Manager.  I don't know why the difference in ampere-hour ratings -- Maybe they simply became more honest?  They added a watt-hour rating to the label and Power Manager reports it was, "designed for - 84.24 Wh" and the fully charged capacity shows, "Full charge capacity - 86.73 Wh"I did a calculation just before finishing this review.  84.24Wh/nominal 10.8volts = exactly 7.8Ah not 7.14Ah. Oh well, I'm not too concerned about it since it seems to work OK.

Build quality fine (for the price it oughta be) though the screen is not really daylight viewable, at least on a motorcycle.I suppose for the average idiot this is just the ticket but no satellite view, map configuration, processor speed or really any sort of customization are deal killers for me. When will one of these mfrs. come up with a waterproof, daylight-useable GP with the equivalent of Google Maps and a more user-changeable feature set?

I can confirm that it DOES work with Windows 7 64-Bit. You just plug it in and the drivers are downloaded for you (you will need to have some other connection to the internet to do this, if you don't you might have to load them off of the disk). This card is ultra sensitive and picked up 10+ networks that none of my other cards were able to see. Eventually I plan on buying an N version of this card but I use this for network penetration testing and so far this is the one that is most supported by the Backtrack suite of testing tools.

$REVIEW.: I bought this drive to increase the internal storage capacity of my MacBook Pro from its original 500 GB to a higher capacity as well as to increase the speed of file transfers to/from the stock hard drive. The first step in this upgrade was to install the replacement hard drive, a Western Digital WD Scorpio Black 750 GB 7500 RPM drive, into a StarTech external hard drive enclosure. I then formatted and partitioned the WD drive into two volumes, one to contain the OS X 10.6.8 operating system and all of the related files that I use for my normal work, and the second volume to contain later versions of OS X (Lion, Mountain Lion, or Mavericks) which I intend to try out to see if they are worthwhile to adopt as my primary OS. An over-simplified summary of the upgrade process is given below.I cloned the contents of the original 500 GB drive to the first partition of the WD 750 GB drive using Shirt Pocket's excellent Super Duper! application to accomplish this and then switched the two drives between the laptop and the StarTech enclosure. After completing these tasks, I then verified that the computer booted up and operated normally and reliably from both the WD 750 GB internal drive and the 500 GB external drive.In normal operation, I observed that no noise or vibration from the WD drive is noticeable, and any decrease in battery charge life which might be caused by a slight increase in the power required to spin the platter at the 7500 RPM of the WD Scorpio over that required by the original 5400 RPM drive is negligible.My computer operations require that every week or so I transfer files ranging from ~30 MB to upwards of 5 GB in size back and forth between my MacBook Pro and my desktop via firewire. In these instances and in other situations requiring the transfer of lots of data to and from the laptop hard drive, the increased speed of this drive is a noticeable and welcome improvement over the previous configuration.I recommend this drive to anyone who desires better performance than is normally available from a standard 5400 RPM laptop hard drive.

$REVIEW.: We have a couple of Canon ELPH cameras, and have been using various cases for them, including a really nice one from Crumpler.  I always love the simple, clean lines of Caselogic products and this one is no exception.  The case itself is very good quality, with a nice plush finish on the interior to protect those delicate (and scratch-catching) LCD screens on little cameras.  It has other clever features like the snap on the belt strap can be supported with your finger so you aren't pushing it into the camera to snap it shut (easier to see than to describe in writing).  Also, rather than opening up like a clam shell, the case has gussets in the bottom that keep the contents from falling out when opened completely.  It makes it slightly more difficult to use, but the security this offers is definitely worth it.  When worn on a belt, this will prevent the camera from flopping out onto the ground when you unzip the case.Also included is a lanyard type strap for around-the-neck if you are into that sort of thing.  If you aren't it is easily detachable with a little clip.The only down-side I can find for this case is that there is only one zipper.  This means that you can't close the zipper and have the camera's strap sticking up through the top of the case.  Its a minor flaw, really, consider the other benefits of this case and its relatively low price.

$REVIEW.: I have had this monitor hooked up to my Mac laptop and Windows7 machines for a few days now and wanted to share a few thoughts.Overall this is a good inexpensive monitor. Large screen, VERY bright, etc.  1920x1080 (1080p) video and down looks great, as do games. Text however (like for development or writing) looks terrible at 1080p (no clean edges to the text, fuzzy).  However, if you change the screen resolution to 1776x1000 the text is fine.  Go figure.There are a good number of adjustments, but not exactly intuitive.  The screen is super bright... too bright. It is almost making my eyes water looking at black text on a white background if I don't turn the brightness way down.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Large screen, for a reasonable price. If you are planning on using this for development however, just be aware you aren't going to get the full 1920x1080 pixels.

$review_text.: Arrived on-time, factory-sealedAfter receiving a new HP with a wired mouse and keyboard, it was time to cut the cords. This keyboard caught my eye with its great reviews and clean, sleek design. Once it arrived, I learned I could unify it with my Logitech M510 mouse as well... but that was just icing on the cake.This keyboard has everything I could ever need: nearly limitless battery life (with cool Solar App to check how much light intensity the panels are receiving), a laptop-like feel to the keys - buttery smooth and quiet. Worked right out of the box with Win8 64 and unifying the two devices (mouse and keyboard) onto one receiver was effortless.The keyboard feels durable yet is the thinnest I've ever used. There is no wasted space on this thing either - grabbing it with one hand may lead to unwanted key presses or thumbprints on the piano-like gloss so handle with care! Also, be sure not to leave it on black office chairs...if there was anything to gripe about, it would only be two minor annoyances: Volume control keys are shared with F9 (mute) F10 (vol down) and F11 (vol up) as long as you press the function (FN) key first to utilize them. I liked having the volume controls as separate buttons on older keyboards. The other is that, because it's so thin and spends the majority of time on my lap, it's a tough keyboard to use with games with elaborate control schemes (ie: Planetside 2). Given time I'm sure it'll get adjusted to.What a great buy... thumbs up!

It is a fantastic stand - it holds the iPad very firmly in portrait or landscape modes in the little slot, and is surprisingly sturdy when the iPad is laid on the circular part for a more horizontal orientation.My only gripe is that the felt lining picks up lint and debris and is difficult to brush clean. But for a solid stand that doesn't let the iPad wiggle even a little bit, this is a winner.

$REVIEW.: I have had many GPS's looking for the perfect GPS, none exists but this Magellan comes close even thought its semi bare bones, its a GPS and nothing more than a GPS. The lane assist features is what I look for in a GPS and this one with highway signs with arrows is OK but my Tom Tom with the big green arrows on the highway lanes is the best I've found. This Magellan has very nice features such as a ding dong or dong ding letting you know the very next turn is the one to take, this removes any confusion from when to turn. The verbal instructions are top notch and much more informative than any other GPS I've owned. Some minor items I would like to see would be a wider lane graphic for the road your travailing on, its very tiny as is. The turn arrow on the top left corner has a weird left turn arrow but you get used to it. The POI's are extensive and the menu's are easy to navigate, lots of great information included on this unit. This GPS is a basic model and not a lot of bells and whistles but it has all of the important features like detours and street avoidance at your fingertips while traveling. All in all if I could only have one GPS unit I guess its this one although I'd love to combine some Tom Tom features with this Magellan, now that would be one great GPS.

$review_text.: I read so many positive reviews on this grip, yet was concerned because of the two or three bad reviews.  I thought maybe the bad reviewers simply got a lemon due to poor quality control.Here is the truth: The first grip I bought was indeed very loose.  The clip that secures the Vita wobbled, even when in the locked position.  I thought that maybe I, too, got a lemon.  And since Amazon makes it so easy to return items (5 stars to Amazon service), I simply returned it for a replacement.  Well, the replacement was exactly the same.  Unless I am extremely unlucky, then this is simply a badly designed accessory.  The only thing I can figure is that the positive reviewers don't mind if their $250 device wiggles loosely in the grip, and might even fall out.Given the price, you can't expect too much.  But honestly, if it is unusable, then there is no acceptable price, because you will just be throwing your money away.  I left it at two stars because, evidently, some people may not mind the loose fit.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these mounts for use on my Stand Up Paddleboards.  They are easy to install and hold well.  I have not had my GoPro detach from my boards at all.  The only downside to these mounts is that they are a permanent mount, and once affixed to the board, cannot be re mounted.

I ordered both the non glare and the clear, not sure what works best.  After I put on the clear screen I decided to return the non glare.  The service at customer service was very friendly to facilitate the return.  No hazzle at all.  The clear screen does not distract from the Ipad 3 high resolution.  Definitely recommend to buy from MyGear if you are in the market for a screen protector for your Ipad 3.

It didn't see the hard drive at first, I restarted and it did find the driver and I saw the drive. I started to browse the folders and the drive disappeared. Restarts, different ports (USB 2.0 & 3.0) couldn't make it work again. I pulled out my SATA to USB 2.0 device and it worked fine. This is going back.The USB cable is really short -- 12 inches to be exact, which may make it so that the hard drive has to dangle in some situations.There isn't any kind of switch to stop communications between the device and the computer.

They are as good as (maybe better?) my custom built, 3rd order crossover, speakers. If you compare them side by side with the high end speakers, and want accurate reproduction, with low distortion, these will not only save you money, but will give you a better system. You don't need a boom-box (subwoofer) with these. Very neutral and natural sound. Not much for snob appeal, but who needs it.

$review_text.: Bottom Line:  Sound quality that compares well with $100 and $200 headphones...for under 30 bucks...an amazing bargain for people who like "around the ear" headphones.I have never owned the PERFECT headphone

 Some were too heavy...some too flimsy...some had too much bass or thin treble

 The Sennheiser HD 202 MK II headphones are amazingly good headphones at a bargain price

 Although advertised as "on ear" headphones, the pads fit entirely around my ears and rest against my head, not on my ears.No headphone is comfortable for two or three hours of listening, but I find the "around the ear" design to work best for me, as they don't press my ears against my eyeglasses frame
 And, the "around the ear" type does a good job of sealing the headphone to the head, providing the clearest bass and blocking out extraneous noise.The Sennheiser HD 202 is adjustable, by sliding each earpiece up or down


 I set them for a "loose" fit, as that is more comfortable for long listening sessions
The headband is likely to loosen up as time goes by, making it easier to get a loose, comfortable fit.I want headphones that reproduce voices in a natural way, whether a male baritone, or a female soprano

 The HD 202 does a very good job with voices...they sound natural without the false added warmth some headphones provide


 The unique characteristics of a singer's voice is created by how the singer produces a fundamental of a note, and the harmonics of the note.With the HD 202, the voice fundamental is very natural and accurate, but the harmonics seem slightly muted...likely due to a combination of my own treble hearing loss, and the HD 202's lack of an artificial boost in the treble region.The HD 202 produces bass with accuracy and control

 Many headphones produce a heavy, loud bass, but every note sounds much the same


 When listening to Paul McCartney's bass playing, it should be obvious that his bass line often is an inventive variation of the melody of the song...not a soggy series of "thump...thump...thump..." The HD 202 has bass clarity and accuracy that is superior to headphones selling for much higher prices, including some of the mega-expensive headphones.A lot of folks will be irritated by the TEN FOOT long cord of the HD 202


 This long cord is designed to let you plug into the computer at work and walk around the office, or plug into the TV at home and sit on the sofa ten feet away


 But, if you are going for a walk, you need to wind up the extra eight feet of cord and stuff it in your pocket

 I wish it came with two cords, a short cord and the long cord.The package included no instructions and no information about the Sennheiser two year warranty

 Although that information is available on-line, it would have been nice to have a warranty certificate in the package, along with a toll free number for getting information or arranging for service.If you like "around the ear" headphones, and accurate sound, not phony "rocked up" sound with boosted bass and "brightened" treble, you will like the HD 202...and you would struggle to find a significantly more accurate sounding headphone at five times the price.

$review_text.: On the surface, for the price this is a good plasma set with 3D capabilities
 The picture *is* generally good


 The problem is with the quality of the panel itself
 I've had 2 of these, and within 20 hours of use both units had pixels start to die

 The pixels weren't dead out of the box, things were fine for the first few days, then they just started to die off on both units


 And these big televisions are a colossal hassle to repack and return, and that's if dead pixels are even covered at all (LG doesn't cover them)

 You get what you pay for, I suppose


 Next time I'm waiting an extra 6 months for a higher end model with better panel components
 $800+ down the drain.EDIT:  An LG technician came out to my residence to diagnose the problem, and apparently having *6* dead pixels and 3 spots of residual dirt *underneath* the screen is "a completely normal part of the manufacturing process and should not affect my enjoyment of the set."  I will never be purchasing another product from LG
 Frankly they make me sick.EDIT 2:  It's now been another month, and I now have a white stuck pixel in addition to the aforementioned defects

 LG still won't cover it


 What a disgrace


 Ugh.

$review_text.: Absolutely horrible!  The application process was a nightmare, with pretty much pointless instructions on a tiny little piece of paper (the instructions are generic and refer to all their products rather than providing specific instructions that would apply to the product you are using it for).  The die cuts didn't even line up properly, and despite following the foggy instructions, using plenty of their &#34;spray&#34; (which was a little scary since it mentions avoiding getting it on your face and to avoid any inhalation but yet says to spray copious amounts on your hands and the product... how toxic is it?), and the squeegee wasn't particularly effective at removing the bubbles.  Not to mention, the liquid gets everywhere and I had to keep stopping to try and soak up anything that was dribbling off the sides of my expensive tablet, all the while freaking out about the fact that apple would probably laugh in my face and tell me I voided the warranty if something was to happen to my device as a result of using this application.  It was also very expensive so I feel like I certainly wasted my money on something that obviously has issues (based on the other review I see here).  I would avoid this like the plague!

 Mine has one star too, because of current situation that may not be resolved to my pleasing

 New Hp - 15.6" Pavilion Laptop - 8gb Memory - 750gb Hard Drive - Natural Silver was ordered thru deal2u, may have changed name to Jays_DVDS, since other name no longer attached to my item, charged to credit card, refurbished was sent & received

 I have a problem & I think others might have a problem too, with listing New available and substituing refurbished because "discovered" new not in stock

 You be the judge, if you think it might be a problem for you when you spend a large chunk of hard earned change
 Think about it

 Having to ship something back and start a new search will also not be to my satisfaction, but it looks like I will have no choice

 This has set my search back nearly 10 days and now I have no hope of getting what I want in time for days off during Christmas
 Top it off with I might have lost opportunity elsewhere to get what I ordered and that opportunity may be someone else successful search

I thought my search was over

 A waste of my time and I don't have alot of spare time, so this is not pleasing to me


 Seems I can't insert a product link on this item, although I haven't had that difficulty before unless item has been removed

$REVIEW.: The bluetooth adapter installs easily and works well. The problem is the time latency in the actual communication. Unlike land lines, cell phones generally add about 1 to 3 tenths of a second of latency (delay between when you say and they hear, and vice versa). If you are both on cell phones then double this. Well if you use the Ooma Bluetooth you can add another half a second or so to that. It was literally bad enough that I decided to just unplug the device and call it money lost for the lesson. Don't take this as an indictment of the Ooma, I'm happy with my Ooma box, but the Bluetooth is just not gonna work out...

I've been very happy shooting stills mostly in auto mode and video.  Camera can do a lot more if you ask it to.I'd definitely recommend this camera, or the S2 if you want to spend a bit more for more MPs and other features.  I added a 1 GB flash card and two sets of rechargeable batters, neither of which I could do without.  You'll need at least a 500MB card if you plan to shoot much video.

The sound is great too.But this thing is hard, annoying, and slow to get to you songs. Unless you gave only like 100 songs, you will be bored just trying to get to a song because this thing takes about 10 seconds to get through 100 songs. Also the screen is allitle blury and hard to read. The headsphones that come with this is AWFUL. The FM radio comes in allitle bad. Also its allitle big and bulky.Dont get me wrong, this is a great mp3 player. I would just suggest and ipod. I own and ipod but am not and ipod freak. I just like the ipod better because its alot easier to use and is more portable. If you want a mp3 player that has alot of features, get this one. If you want a easier to use, and more portable mp3 player then get the ipod. Both are good though.Iriver fans feel freen to mark no at the bottom......

$review_text.: This little amp really has impressed me!  It is small enough to move around and the sound quality is good.  I'm not an audiophile, so good is good enough for me.I had a party at my house and had this little amp hooked up to some old speakers I had lying around.  It was playing music from my phone via a 3.5 mm male-to-male stereo cable (not included).  People wanted to move out to the garage and it was a very easy to pick up the speakers and amp and move the whole set-up.  People could hook their phones up to the cable and play music from their phone as well.For about 22 dollars, this little amp was a great investment!
$SUMMARY.: Great little amp

$review_text.: UPDATE 12/07/13: Here I am with this set another year older and still working beautifully with the original bulb. AMAZING!! UPDATE 10/17/12: Well, I just thought I'd commemorate entering my third year with my Mitsu HDTV and it's still working like a CHAMP!!!  Still using my original bulb and still getting that same excellent picture for an average of 11-12 hours each and every day!I'd like to make two points clear at the outset.  One, I have always been a bit suspicious of glowing reviews I've read out here, suspecting somehow they had been written by people associated with the company producing the product being reviewed.  And two, although I have purchased other less expensive items online, I have always had a great fear of buying large ticket items, such as this television set, online.I had resisted buying an HDTV mainly because I wasn't comfortable with the drawbacks inherent in each type of set, e.g. burn-in for plasma sets and dropped pixels for LCD sets, plus the fact that the picture on most of these sets gradually deteriorated as each day went by. My current set had been a 45 inch Mitsubishi DLP television, whose picture was still as sharp and clear as the first day I turned it on back in 2001, despite the fact that the original lamp had never been replaced. So I was definitely a Mitsubishi fan, despite some of the problems I'd read about with certain of their earlier DLP high definition models.But the thing which really motivated me to finally purchase a Hi-Def set was the day I watched my first 3D demonstration at a Best Buy store.  It was amazing and all I could think of after that was watching my favorite sports teams in 3D. So I began a long and very arduous research process, mainly online.  It finally brought me to this particular Mitsubishi 3D ready set, despite the negative reviews given to certain earlier Mitsubishi models, whose warranties Mitsubishi did extend for two additional years. And, it seems as though many people bought these Mitsubishi sets without ever being aware that, under varying circumstances, they may have to replace their lamp from time to time.At any rate, I eventually took the giant leap of faith and ordered my new Mitsu 73 inch HDTV from Amazon.com.,  mainly because I had made other smaller buys from Amazon.com with no problems and I have to admit I liked the idea of free shipping and no state taxes on a large ticket item like this, which saved me around $260.00.  Anyway, the big day arrived and while I had had many earlier concerns over how the delivery would be handled, I was delighted to find how smoothly the actual delivery process went.  At the time of purchase, the delivery was scheduled for 7/22/10 between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM.  They actually arrived at 10:15 AM on 7/22/10.  As I was extremely relieved to find, the two men handling the delivery actually brought the stand and set inside my apartment, in that order, and carefully unboxed each item.  They then gave me plenty of time to carefully inspect each item for any exterior damage.  They then carefully placed the set on the stand and even turned on the set to make sure the initial blue screen appeared.  So, it turned out all my delivery fears were absolutely unfounded.  The delivery could not have gone better.After they left, I waited for a bit and then began hooking things up.  After plugging everything into my new surge protector and making the required connections, I turned the set on and went through the required set-up routine, making all the picture settings which had been recommended on several Hi-Def forums for the earlier version of this model.  These seemed to give me a very nice initial picture, although I feel I may have a bit more tweaking to do to suit my individual preferences. But after briefly watching some college football and professional golf, as well as an episode of The Sopranos, I believe all my research has been well rewarded and that I have purchased the perfect set for me. There have been a few who told me they would never have anything to do with Mitsubishi sets, but as I told them, I will remain a fan until such time as this set proves me wrong.  In addition, I will mention that I did purchase a SquareTrade extended warranty for this set, as I would have done for any item costing this much.  The cost was little enough to provide peace of mind for four years.  And, as I later learned, my Visa card automatically extends the warranty for a fifth year.So I suppose this review is exactly the type that would have inspired me to believe it was written by a Mitsubishi employee.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I just feel I did my homework and bought this item from a reliable E-tailer and hopefully, I will be enjoying my new Mitsubishi 3D HDTV for many years to come.I'm back with some additional information as I've decided to include the basic settings I've come up with to obtain what I think is an excellent picture on this particular HDTV set.  They are as follows:Color 40, Tint 27, Sharpness 31, Color Temp. Low, Video Noise Med., Edge Enhancement On, Deep Field Imaging Off, Smooth 120 Off, Picture Mode Natural, Contrast 33, Brightness 31.  I might also add most of my viewing is done in pretty dim lighting, which I think very much contributes to an optimum picture.I'd also like to add that the 3D picture on this set, using the Panasonic DMP-BDT350 3D BluRay player, is absolutely phenominal.  My only other experience with 3D television viewing was at a Best Buy Store where I watched a 3D demo on a 55" Samsung LED set and the 3D effect with this 73" Mitsubishi is far better.  It is true that the more immersive the experience (the larger the screen), the better the 3D effect is.  Now I am simply waiting for my upgraded (HR21 and above) DirecTV receiver so I can begin viewing some of their existing 3D sports channels.Well, here it is in my second week and I just received (finally) the DirecTV receiver (HR21-200) I needed to receive their on-air 3D programming.  After calling DirecTV to activate this new receiver I hooked up the Mitsu 3DG-1000 adapter kit, chose 3D programming on my Mitsu 73738 HDTV menu, put on my 3D glasses and sat back to enjoy some of the most amazing television I've ever seen.  I watched a 3D program on Channel 104 called The Universe and after watching the asteroid belt head directly into my living room, followed by a close-up of the surface of the sun (which appeared to be hovering about six inches above my coffee table)I knew I was hooked and hooked BIGtime!!! And if that wasn't enough to do it, I then watched some lions and a cheetah roaming the veldt, with their heads occasionally poking into my living room, and that absolutely finished off the job!  I am now officially a 3D addict!  Lower prices and more extensive 3D programming be hanged!  I bought now and I'm glad of it! Now just bring on my first 3D football game!Just another note to mark the passing of my first month with my new Mitsu HDTV.  Everything still working great! I have been very much surprised to find a group of people out here who are definitely anti-Mitsubishi.  Some of their reasons seem no more substantial than possibly having to replace the lamp in a Mitsubishi set.  To my way of thinking, that's kind of like buying a Hummer and then asking the dealer what kind of gas mileage it gets.  If you're spending $2,000 + for a great 3D HDTV and you occasionally have to replace a hundred dollar part (which incidentally will restore your set to having the same great picture you had on Day 1) then that's no biggie at all.For you people out there who have DirecTV, I might suggest when you set up your new 3D receiver that you pick the "Non-natural" option in the video set-up.  If you don't, every time you switch programs to one with a different resolution, the screen will briefly go blank and you will hear eight or nine loud clicking noises before the new program begins. After awhile it became very irritating so I decided I'd rather do without it.Well, here I am back again at just about the end of month two with my Mitsu 73737.  Everything still works fine.  I'm mainly here to comment on the 3D programming I've watched during these almost 60 days, particularly the sports programming.  Tennis was a disappointment. Since the camera coverage is usually from behind one player and because most players spend their time at the baseline, then you're not going to get much change in depth, which definitely diminishes the 3D effect.  Plus, the court itself is flat, unlike the rolling hills of a golf course.  Golfing was very enjoyable to watch in 3D because everyone is constantly moving around and changing depth in relation to the camera positions.  Motocross X Games were fun; watching those bikes do 360s high above uneven ground.  Basketball offered pretty good effects but football was my favorite of all, especially when covered with multiple cameras, including overhead views.  There was one particular pass play during the Va. Tech./Boise St. game where the pass came right at you into the end zone.  Really great 3D effect!  But the one sport I'm still really anxious to see is Boxing!  I think that might turn out to be the best sport of all for 3D viewing.However, I feel the features made especially to demonstrate the 3D effect remain the best source of amazing 3D programming.  There is one in particular and it features various jungle animals, including a rather large snake, which uncoils directly toward the viewer.  I defy anyone to sit and watch this snake move directly into your room and toward your face without unconsciously moving backwards and/or putting your hand up to protect yourself.  I've watched it 4 or 5 times now and I still can't just sit there and watch it without physically reacting.And for you videophiles out there who complain because these particular Mitsubishi HDTV sets use the checkerboard format for 3D viewing, which reduces the resolution from 1080 to 720 for each eye, I can only say it's a totalnon-issue as far as I'm concerned and I doubt the majority of viewers could even tell the difference anyhow.  In fact, it reminds me a bit of the audiophiles from back in the day when Hi-Fi first appeared who complained because a certain speaker's upper limit was too low, when in truth, most listeners couldn't even perceive sounds in that particular range to begin with.Since I've just hit my one year anniversary with this set, I thought it only appropriate to briefly summarize my experiences over the past twelve months with  my Mitsu 73738.First of all, I am amazed at the reduction in price of this set since I bought it in July of 2010.  I paid just under $2,000.00 and thought I was getting a real bargain.  At the under $1,200.00 they are going for today, I simply cannot understand why anyone would be buying a 55" LED set and paying more for it.I have been using my set 9-11 hours each and every day since the first day I  turned it on.  I am still using the original bulb in my set and to me the picture looks every bit as sharp and clear as it did the first day I turned it on.  This goes for the richness of the colors, as well.  The only odd experience I have had with this set at all is the four times (by actual count) when I turned it on and the picture appeared with either a green or reddish tint.  I turned the set off and then back on and each of the four times it then came back on looking exactly as it should. I kind of consider this a personality tic unique to my set.I have tried to pay attention to the comments and inquiries that have appeared in this thread over the past year and by doing so I feel I have learned some valuable information, particularly from RAINIER ROCKS.  This individual really knows their stuff, electronically speaking.  They helped me update my firmware, thereby allowing me to view 3D media without the adaptor that was originally required.In summary, I am still enjoying this set every bit as much as I did the first day I turned it on.  This goes double for the 3D programming.  It still brings a goofy grin to my face whenever that damn snake uncoils into my living room and I find myself instinctively leaning backwards.  I can't help but feel vindicated in buying this set when there were any number of naysayers who advised me against having anything to do with a Mitsubishi big screen set.  And, if anything I have written here over the past year has helped anyone in any way regarding this particular HDTV, I will really be pleased.  I would make this buy over again in a heartbeat!

Read a few reviews, some which were not very good but enough that said it was a good little machine
 Well I got it home, plugged it in hooked up the HDMI cable to my Samsung LED TV and was instantly blown away, 1080p video without any configuration

I spent about an hour taking all of the crapware off of the computer and then install XBMC


 I can watch full 1080p video with this little machine, no need to upgrade ram, (although I may just do so since I have a spare laying around.This computer is so small I have it installed in the wall between the studs so it's completely invisible.Cons: NONE

$review_text.: I don't understand the negativity in some of the reviews of this item
 I was extremely pleased with the cover and am ordering another one for an additional Kindle Fire I just purchased

 The leather is smooth and a pleasure to handle


 The straps to secure the Fire to your hand,(if you wish to use them) and the strong clips that hold the Kindle in the case add to the solid feel and ease of use when I'm reading or playing games
 The stand function (despite what I read in other reviews) is really easy to set up and comes in handy when watching television programs or movies.The other cases I've priced are not quite as sturdy (especially the cheaper ones)and don't have the multifunction capabilities that this one does
 I expect it to last a long time....it has that kind of quality feel, and I recommend the cover to protect your Kindle and make using it even more fun.

$REVIEW.: I dumped Dish last year. Got tired of paying over $100 a month for the few channels I watched. I purchased this antenna to replace a marginally effective indoor antenna. I took the dish off it's mast and used a pair of pliers to bend the mast to fit the u bolt for the antenna. I then screwed the existing cable into the antenna and had coverage through the whole house.  There were a couple splitters on the lines that acted like filters and blocked the signal, a quick trip to Radio Shack and I had compatible replacements. I now receive all local HD channels in every room.

I purchased it at a fraction of the cost of a canon grip and, for the most part, it has been fantastic.Over the course of a year, the vertical shutter button has become mildly sticky. The plastic seems a little on the cheap side too. But, lets put things in perspective; This cost $45 and the canon version is over $200.You will love this grip.

$review_text.: This is an outstanding keyboard for your wireless home theater.  But you may save big with the $25 version!  I honestly had to do some digging around so I could figure out exactly what to do with this keyboard.  Once I got it though, it installed easily and it found all my devices quickly and easily.The downsides as I see it are price and limited devices that connect with it.I have an OPPO BDP103 BluRay DVD player and the K830 quickly and easily connected straight to it - but not every key is logically mapped to the OPPO.  The GREAT thing is when you are on services like Netflix it makes it so much easier to enter search terms and navigate with a full keyboard and being BACKLIT is huge!  Nothing worse than trying to figure out a remote in the dark or search for a flashlight to see your remote.That said - most of my devices come with smartphone apps now that control them - totally eliminating the need for a keyboard like this...I'm giving four stars for quality, design, convenience and awesome &#34;cool factor&#34; for a home theater room.I'm taking off one star for the fact that it doesn't work with enough devices (if you are apple tv or roku or similarly synced to a standard type device this will not be as big of a deal) as I would like and the fact that there are so many apps that already come with the different home theater components which starts to make the K830 a dodo device.  It just doesn't have a huge need or niche right now and I imagine it will only get worse over time. :-(

$review_text.: Would definately purchase again if the need would arise, although I do wish for one change in design.  If the cord entered the strip from the side or top instead of the end and if the reset for the 15amp breaker was located on the side or top as well then this would get 5 stars.  Construction is attractive, solid, and quite usable.  The spaces between outlets allows for even large transformers.  The brackets snap onto the power strip so installation is a breeze.  The power cord borders on being too long, but I needed it for this installation so just be aware of the 15ft length.  The cord is of a heavy enough gage that I feel more than comfortable with the power strips 15 amp capacity.

$REVIEW.: First, let me say I am not paranoid, but in the words of Sherlock Holmes, " when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth".  What I have deemed to be impossible is that a major manufacturer would design, build and sell such an unimaginable piece of refuse as the D-Link WBR-1310.Why do I believe that to be impossible? Because I cannot believe that D-Link would make a router that:- can't hold a connection, wired or wireless for more than 15 minutes- creates a randomly disappearing wireless network that cannot be connected to on a daily basis- can't be made to function properly, even with the assistance of their tech support- needs a hard reset 2-3 times a week- has a setup wizard that works. Kinda. Sometimes. Well, ok, not really.- needs to power cycle to provide a connection. Or wait an indeterminate amount of time.I am quite knowledgeable about routers and networking, which makes me think that D-Link has hidden cameras on me and my friends and family are in on the joke.  How funny to make the guy that people turn to for their "tech" needs to look like an idiot because his simple wireless network just won't work right. However crazy that sounds, it has to be more plausible than D-Link putting the WBR-1310 on the market.I know this product is a few years old, but my hatred of this router has been such that I held out that Amazon would allow a 0 star rating.  Since that doesn't seem likely and I feel the need to protect the public from this excrement in a plastic case with wires, here is the crux of my review:Under no circumstances should you buy, accept as a gift, connect to wirelessly or even be in the general vicinity of this router.

$review_text.: Apparently a popular christmas item. Sony is out and Amazon has me back ordered a month. But I can wait at the $329 price point vs. getting it now locally for $399 + 6% sales tax. Have been using a good computer 5.1 speaker system in a apartment situation for past 10 years. But it doesn't have DTS, as this Sony does. Will be mating this with Sony bluray player BDP-BX1 and Samsung LN40A750 TV. Don't understand the negative reviews here. Folks must not be understanding the manual. It appears the sub woofer bass level IS easily adjusted. Also looks like I CAN get 5.1 sound via HDMI. Just got to set it up right. However using an optical connection is no biggie and what I'm used to. Looking forward to playing with this unit and will add to this report after it arrives. Sooner than later, I hope. Also intriqued with theLogitech Z-5500 THX-Certified 505-Watt 5.1 Digital Surround Sound Speaker Systemwhich looks very tempting indeed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 1/31/09: Canceled order.

I have always changed over to DD-WRT firmware on these to get the added features.I can say that loaded with DD-WRT firmware, [...] this router is a powerhouse.  It is exceedingly reliable, has some of the better signal ranges I've seen.  Out of the 20 or so of these I've worked with I've only had one fail, better than my experience with any other brand/model of router.Also, after you change to DD-WRT firmware and find you need to switch back it's also extremely easy, just load the firmware through the web UI and off you go.

In my case, it lasted several months until I found it was out from the key ring. A good news is it was in my pocket and so I did not lose this drive but I think this design flaw will expose users to lose the drive from a key ring. It is not a small issue as you may lose your entire privacy in the drive because of such a basic design issue.I strongly hope SanDisk to recognize its importance from the security perceptive, rethink about its design and fix it soon.

$REVIEW.: I have heard of the ROKU for a long time and finally bit the bullet and bought one for personal use.  I have 3 kids that are at home during the summer and figured this would be a great device to keep them entertained.  True to form, it is perfect...I can rent from Amazon, play from Netflix and voila..my kids have something different to watch at the press of a button.We have decent cable modem service at home and I have a Apple Dual Band Extreme basestation...so i get pretty decent wireless speeds.  However, I noticed that the Roku just didnt perform up to speed on Wireless-N and worked much better with Ethernet and, believe it or not, networking over power lines (netgear ethernet over power adapters used).Lets face it...there is a lot of data to be downloaded when watching a movie and thus wi-fi may not be the best solution...especially when viewing high definition content.  The ROKU is probably not to blame here...but that being said MAKE CERTAIN you have enough bandwidth from your ISP and a GREAT connection from the ROKU location to your router/switch etc.4/5 for me..because I feel there is a bit of room for improvement.

$REVIEW.: Great sound for the price. Granted, for audiophiles there's much better out there but these still hold their ground for the price you pay and the quality they offer.Pros: Great build quality. Great sound and design. Comfortable for long hours.Cons: Not very good range. Disconnects instead of readjusting when signal is weak in about 20 feet. So this is not very good for VOIP purposes. Besides, it's uncomfortable chatting when you can't hear yourself speak with headphones that seal your ears. The logitech H760s that I've owned for over a year now, are considerably better with range and pretty much set the standard for wireless freedom imo but those are not very comfortable for longer hours.

$review_text.: The Slingbox is a great Idea
I use it on almost a daily basis, and it has been especially useful on my last ski trip where I got to watch all my premium TV channels on my laptop 400 miles away from home.However, the quality of the picture is disappointing


When watching the slingbox remotely at about 360 kbps, I have to be at least 8-10 feet away from the screen, otherwise the picture is unbearably blurry
I use Comcast high speed internet at the slingbox location and at the receiving location and the programming frequently freezes or loses quality
It can get very annoying
However, as I said earlier it is still pretty handy and I do enjoy watching my cable when I am not at home!

$REVIEW.: You can probably find other headphones with similar sound quality with this price, but the Bose has one thing I absolutely love about: it won't block your ear canal! Most in-ear headphones I've seen seal the ear canal, which is pretty bad for the ear in my opinion. Despite this, it doesn't compromise sound quality. The one thing that might annoy some people is that because part of the headphone speakers stick out of the ear, if you crank up the volume all the way, people around you might hear your music a little bit... again not a big deal to me, and it's worth the extra comfort I get out of the headphones not sealing up my ears!Also most other in-ear headphones I've tried make my ears tired after prolonged use. Bose in-ear ones feel very comfortable and I don't feel any discomfort after hours of use. The pointy tips make it stay in your ears even if you're running.Sound volume is somewhat lower than other headphones when I max out my ipod's volume, but honestly for all practical purposes if it were any higher, it would sound painful to the ear (these sound much louder than the older generation Bose in-ear headphones by the way).Overall great sound quality, base, and comfort in a small package.

 If you can find the original version they are great, with excellent sound quality

 However if you get stuck with the fake ones, they have horrible sound and very poor quality
 The copies are so close to the actual that its difficult to tell if you have the originals as even their packaging is copied by the pirates.

$REVIEW.: I've owned a Jukebox Recorder 20 for about 3 months now and I love it.  I had previously purchased an E-digital MP3 machine but I returned it because the interface was too flaky.The Archos machine works as advertised.  I've never measured, but I'm sure you can get a good 8 to 10 hours out of a battery charge.  It takes a while to understand how the playlist function works, but once you get that figured out it's fantastic to be able to group your music together in any way that suits you.  The Jukebox shows up as a storage device in Windows Explorer so you can just drag and drop files as you see fit.  You can even use it as a portable hard drive, and you can record directly to the Jukebox from any audio device.  No computer necessaryMy only complaint is that the machine seems to &quot;hang&quot; occasionally.  When it does this the only option is to turn it off and back on (it takes about 10 to 20 seconds to &quot;re-boot&quot;).  I sent an email to Archos on this issue but, as expected, they didn't even bother to respond.All if all, this is a great little machine.  400 CD's in the palm of your hand!

$REVIEW.: It's a sound card. If you are only using on board audio from your motherboard and you are looking to upgrade on a budget, this will do wonders for you. Many people will tell you the difference between a sound card and the on board sound is insignificant, but the benefits of having a dedicated board for ANY component is obvious from a basic stand point.The card can produce 24 Bit/ 96kHz and if you have nice enough headphones and speakers, the difference will be world changing. For only ~$30, you can get fantastic audio for your PC. This isn't some sort of specialty card and if you're looking for studio sound or audiophile quality, you might want to look elsewhere.But, if you just want to upgrade your audio to the next step, this is certainly going to offer you what you're looking for!

$REVIEW.: I bought this little tripod hoping that it would have similar flexibility and grip to a Joby flexible tripod-- but on a smaller scale. This Albinar tripod is pretty limited in it's flexibility though. The legs are bendable coiled metal, but they only bend so far. The range of motion isn't much more than what would be expected if the legs were simply rigid and hinged at the top (like a conventional tripod). Put more bluntly: You can't coil these legs around a railing, fence, pole, etc, so what is the point of making them bendable in the first place? The only thing that you can do is bend the legs a little to make the position level.I'm giving this tripod a few stars because it's cheap and makes a decent little table-top tripod. But I'd recommend a Joby if you want the ability to grip objects.

$REVIEW.: I'm a labeler -- always have been and always will.  I print address and shipping labels on my desktop printer and for everything else, I use a handheld.  I had a Brother handheld for years that I passed on to a family member when I switched to aDymo LabelManager 160handheld.  When I saw the Dymo LabelManager Wireless PnP, I was intrigued and decided to give it a try.PROS:- Prints many label widths up to 1 inches- Prints graphics and logos- Works well wirelessly- Easy to set up- PC and Mac compatible- Easy-to-use softwareCONS:- Very expensive- Loud cutter- Poor graphics printing unless clip art- Wasted tape at the marginsSETUPSetting up the Dymo Wireless is very easy.  You just insert the battery and label cartridge, then plug it in to your computer.  My Windows 7 PC saw the Dymo right away and installed the proper drivers to allow it to work locally via the USB cable.  Once connected over USB, you can set up the wireless connection.  And in case you need it, the Dymo's MAC address is printed on the bottom.  To use it wirelessly, you just add the Dymo to your computer as a network printer.  By the way, it only works on 2.4GHz networks, not on 5GHz.SOFTWAREThe Dymo labeler itself has a "lite" version of the labeling software built-in to the unit.  When connected over USB, it shows up as a drive.  You can then browse the drive and launch the label software.  For more advanced features, you can download the full desktop version of the Dymo label software, currently on version 8.5.The software is pretty straightforward and simple to use.  You can change fonts, insert graphics, use a border and save frequently used labels for future use.  With the software, you can also check the battery life of the Dymo Wireless and it even tries to detect what label size is inside the unit.  There's not much in the way of design creativity, but it gets the job done and the labels come out looking clean.  I only wish I could reduce the left/right margins more so there wasn't so much wasted tape.HARDWAREThe Dymo Wireless looks just like theDymo LabelManager PnP, which is USB-only.  It sits vertically on a built-in stand and doesn't take up too much desk space.  The power button is on top and the cutter button just below it.  In the back is the USB port, reset switch and WPS wireless button.  There's also a cleaning tool that's attached to the inside of the cover, which is a nice convenience.  Overall, the unit feels solid and well built.  The cutter, however, is pretty loud when it cuts.  The cutter on the 160 handheld is much quieter.PRINT QUALITYI found the print quality to be acceptable.  Text looked good in different fonts and sizes.  I tried printing some high res photos as logos and they turned out very poor, unfortunately.  The clip art that's included in the software, though, looked fine.  I'd recommend sticking to clip art and simple graphics if you need to print graphics with the Dymo Wireless.BATTERYThe rechargeable battery inside the Dymo Wireless is a proprietary 1,500 mAh lithium-polymer battery.  I would've preferred support for AA batteries, personally.  Dymo recommends removing the rechargeable battery if you don't use it for more than a week.  On the plus side, the battery is user replaceable, though I'm not sure where you can get one at the moment.  You can charge the battery via the USB port on a computer, or using the included USB wall adapter.  It takes a couple of hours using the wall adapter and up to 8 hours when connected to a computer.  I haven't used the Dymo Wireless long enough to know how long the battery lasts between charges.  I did, however, plug it in to my portable USB battery pack and was able to get it to charge just like I'd charge my tablet or smartphone.CONCLUSIONI really like the versatility of the Dymo Wireless PnP.  TheDymo LabelManager PnP(USB-only) labeler was very popular, so adding wireless capabilities seemed like a logical next step.  However, I question the Dymo Wireless' value at twice the MSRP of the wired version of the same labeler.  Unless I'm completely missing something, the only new feature is Wi-Fi.  I can see how being able to share it in an office environment would be beneficial, but that's a significant premium.  If your work environment prints labels in high volume and by multiple people, the Dymo Wireless is a good solution, as long as the price doesn't scare you off.  But if you have a small office or need a labeler for home, the wired version of the LabelManager PnP probably makes more sense, especially if you're on a tight budget.

$review_text.: I am letting you know I did not purchase from Amazon though I wished I did.  First off this system is a lot larger then it looks for a mini system, and yes its 900 watts not 850 watts as it is listed on Panasonic's website which I called and they verified that it is indeed 900 watts. I am in a very small room, well not to small but this system makes my walls vibrate with crisp clear base. The system is phenomenal for its size and my only worry was that my ipod 5th generation would not work but it does using the USB on the system. It has Aux in to allow you to hook up to Tvs, dvd players ect. I am just going to say this because Amazon has great low prices its a solid investment..
$SUMMARY.: This system packs a punch!

$REVIEW.: This is a fantastic looking, well built and very simple turntable that produces very good sound. It's a quality product and it sounds great. It is however, really really minimal. To change the speed, you need to move the belt. When the record's done, there's no auto return. When you move the arm over the record, it doesn't start, there is a switch for that, under the turntable.That said, I do really like it, maybe it's good to get off your butt when the records done and play something else!

$review_text.: Works great.  It wasn't at all difficult to get used to and definitely eases strain on my wrist.  Also, I love that my hand seems to be able to find it more easily without me having to glance over to the side for it.The only downside is that I can't click to go back a page.  Maybe future versions will have that function.  The &#34;right click&#34; functions work as normal.I'm sure I'll continue with this style even when this one wears out.Note: I paid approx $12 in August 2013; have used it nearly daily for the past 4 months.

$REVIEW.: I bought the Sportster 5 radio for my wife and I also wanted her to be able to use it around the house- not just in the car.  This boombox looked like a good simple, plug-n-play solution.  And it allows my wife to move her radio from room to room.  It comes with 25 feet of cord on the antenna for convience but also wraps up neatly on the back of the boombox.  The antenna thens locks into a slot on the top rear of the boombox.We are able to get a good signal in the house without placing the antenna outside.  That may depend on where we live.  It seems to work better when boombox is not placed right next the window.  We occasionally have to move the boombox around to get an adequate signal.  But it works well and in places where I wouldn't think it could.The sound quality is good- fm radio quality.  The boombox has good frequency range and does not sound tinny.The unit will operate on 8 D cells but I have not bought batteries yet to try that mode out.The boombox is nicely designed and very attractive.  My only dislike is the power cord.  Its a little unwieldy for a portable type device.  It has a computer like power cord- the adapter box with a short 120VAC wall cord and then a long low voltage wire that plugs in the back.  I would have preferred the voltage conversion built into the unit so that the boombox could have had just a simple wall cord.

$review_text.: I have a Linksys wireless router WRT54G for about 6 or 7 years and I thought it was time for an upgrade so I went for this E2000, but the main reason I purchased this model was because of the supposed range of N over G.The thing is my bedroom was in the edge of my previous router (WRT54G) and my Ipod Touch 4G (which have Wireless N capability) was constantly dropping the connection). So I read that 802.11n had better range over 802.11g and decided to make the step which it wasn't a priority because all wireless devices in my home besides my Ipod and Blackberry Torch (2 other blackberrys, 1 PS3, 1 Wii, 1 laptop) do not have 802.11n.The thing is, I am having the same issue, my Ipod is dropping the connection, I even tried setting the E2000 to broadcast only in Wireless N mode and still have the same issue, later I learned that Ipod Touch 4G is not 5GHz band compatible (which explains why it suddenly does not detect my router when I set it on 5GHz), if I knew that before, I probably wouldn't purchase this router now as I said before it is not a priority.However, I do recommend this model, and more over the E1000 to take the benefit of the 1 Gbit wired switch. It is easier to set up than the old WRT54G. Remeber to turn off the Guest account if you do not use to have visitors requiring wireless access to th eInternet in your home.

$REVIEW.: This is my 2nd MP3 player, my first being an Ipod Nano.  I got this one because I decided to give Play for Sure a try--and have fallen in love with subscription music afterall!!  I chose this one because it was on sale, relatively cheap, 1gb, small, and seemed to be sturdy built. I have synced it almost daily for a month now and played it to death at work.  It has worked without a hitch.  The only drawback is that it uses an AAA battery that does not last very long, but that is par for the course with these cheap flash units.  The sound is decent, and  it has an FM radio and microphone.  There is a round button on the front that contains the menu, pause, forward and back controls. Often times I must press a button twice to get it to go forwards or backwards.  The unit automatically  shuts off if you pause for very long, which is actually good considering the battery life.  I use it with Napster and it takes a while to sync, but that is OK.  It has a dedicated volume control and a hold button that feel solid and well made.  The screen is smallish but well lit and colorful with a  simple menu.  I absolutely will buy more Sansa products after my experience with this one!  Now I kinda wish I had not bought the Nano and had instead gotten a bigger Sansa for my play to go subscriptions.
$review_summary.: great little player

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately when you install and try register it under an version of Windows 8, it tell you that your Product Key is not compatible with a trial version of the software.  What it really means is that they won't let you install it under Windows 8.After talking to Norton Support, I learned that Norton only will offer a corporate version of a backup solution for Windows 8 devices.  So you need to call and negotiate an annual support contract.  I guess Norton no longer cares about backup solutions for the non-business user.

$review_text.: Well, i have tried Shure e3c's and UE super.fi 5s and have settled into my new ER4Ps happily. These are the ticket. About me, I am a music [roducer and audio engineer and scrutinize every speaker, headphones mercilessly. The Shures I found to have well defined mid range but a weak low end. The ER4Ps have the most fat, well rounded sound out of any earbud I have ever tried. The entire frequency range is well defined with none overshadowing the others. You will definitely hear the subtleties in music. The attack is very impressive. When paying close attention to vocals, I can hear the room the singer was in. (Listen to some Queen and hear Freddie like you've never heard him before!) The natural reverbs really come out like never before. I compare all headphones to Sony MDR-7506's, the over-the-ear studio standard. These run with them just fine and are portable so as to go with your ipod nicely. The background noise reduction is great requiring less volume to enjoy your tunes (aka longer battery life). The three flange earpieces are a bit uncomfortable but the foam inserts offer great noise reduction and are comfortable too. I could keep going on. Finally an earbud for the pro's. I purchased mine here through Blue Proton for $153.95. They responded quickly and I had my order within three days of placing it. I would highly recommend going thru them for the best price with great service.

$review_text.: I purchased an open box Onkyo TX-NR609 before this at a too good to be true price.  The Onkyo had issues with display and control but I had it long enough before returning to be able to make a good comparison:Yamaha Pros:- Sound is phenomenal.  This is the best sounding receiver that I've owned (in recent years another Onkyo and Harman Kardon)- Fairly easy to set up.- YPAO settings can be overridden which the Onkyo's couldn't.Negatives:- The manual only comes on CD- The Android app doesn't work very well with DLNA.  I'm having to turn on the TV, select my server, and then select my playlist before the app will show the DLNA content.  The Onkyo app seemed to work better.- YPAO setup did a pretty good job with distances (expect the subwoofer which is came up to 1').  YPAO was way off in the volume though.  I have a sound meter which I used to check and reset.- TV and Android app graphics look better on the Onkyo.- No Wifi dongle available.I know that this sounds like a lot of negatives but, I do prefer the Yamaha.  The sound of the Yamaha blows the Onkyo out of the water, which is the most important thing.

I cannot seems to find a way to do the initial setup with an iOS device
Their app only allows viewing (with sound) and setup after the initial setup using a Mac


I do wish that there was some way to have it self discover as the DLink range extenders do.There is static on the audio as some other reviewers have mentioned and the mydlink site is very rudimentary with no options for storage of photos or video

Resolution is OK.  My particular unit had light leaks around the edges and hot spots.-GPS does not work on the TF201-The TF201 suffers from a serious issue with its sqlite implementation.  Things that use sqlite, such as web browsers, incur delays of hundreds of milliseconds per sqlite access.  Web browsers and other apps frequently hang for up to 10 seconds at a time, causing the system to present the "Wait / Force Close" dialog.-Way, way over-priced compared to Asus' other tablet, the Nexus 7-Worst RMA experience of my life.  My device is currently out on RMA and we are approaching 4 weeks and counting.The following is my bad experience with the Asus RMA system, but won't necessarily happen to everyone.  It does, however, illustrate that they are not interested in working with the customer and will do what they can to weasel out of doing repairs.One of the first things I did with this tablet was unlock the bootloader in hopes I could fix the sqlite problem (which I could not.)  Unlocking the bootloader to install a non-Asus firmware voids your warranty, which is annoying, but was presented clearly.After unlocking, I thought I'd try the warranty service nevertheless to get the terrible display replaced.  I figured the worst that could happen is that I'd lose the shipping cost.  Unfortunately for me, Asus did the warranty service despite the voided warranty.  When they returned the device, I found the bootloader relocked, and the power button had been damaged in such a way that the tablet would no longer function.  Now that they've damaged the device, they are refusing to do any further service because the unlocked / relocked bootloader.Asus has given me excuse after excuse as to why they won't service the device.  For instance, why is this not covered under the 90-day repairs warranty?  "Because that repair was on the DISPLAY and the power button we broke is not part of the display."  Seriously, that is what they told me.I have purchased lots of Asus stuff over the years and liked them pretty well.  Too bad, they've just lost a customer for life.

$REVIEW.: These binoculars are an excellent product for the price.  They are bright and clear with great magnification, seemingly beyond the 10x they are rated for.  The carry strap is comfortable and rubber coating provides an easy grip.  The front lens caps remain affixed to the binoculars and the rear cap is permanently fixed to the neck-strap.  I haven't yet tested their waterproofness (I am not one to go dumping items in buckets of water or dragging them over the ground, I let normal usage take its toll).  The focus is smooth, easy to reach, and runs in the same direction as Nikon camera lenses.  They have a good, solid feel in the hand.  Some people don't like the twist-up eye-cups, but I think they're just fine.The binoculars are a little larger than one might expect, but not in any way awkwardly so.Why only 4 stars?  There is definite distortion around the margins, making the view slightly fish-eyed.  This is mainly noticeable when scanning.  The carry pouch must be kept on a belt or something when the binoculars are used.  It does not have its own shoulder strap.  The eye-piece protector is a single unit covering both eyepieces and comes off easily when the binoculars are not in the pouch.  Like many binoculars currently there is no tripod fitting.  If you want to mount the binoculars you have to buy the clumsy Nikon binocular tripod accessory.On the whole excellent binoculars that could use just the slightest tweaking to make them stellar.

$REVIEW.: I have Sony VAIO Laptop with Intel Core 2 Duo P7450 2,13GHz processor and 4GB DDR2 RAM. This laptop is use for watching movie, working with documents, searching internet and all other things except playing new games. It was working fine but I noticed that boot time wasn't fast enough - around 2 min 45 seconds. First I upgrade memory to 8GB - see improvement but not so big. When I install this HDD there was WOW!!! Boot time is now around 35 - 45 seconds. I didn't reinstall system, just move image from old HDD to Kingston SDD and place it in my laptop. It is like new laptop right now and there is no need to buy new one for me. To copy image to Kingston HDD I used free version of Acronis Backup & Recovery. If this software is not coming with this HDD then I believe you can download from Kingston website or find in the internet. I had two partition on HDD and I use Paragon Alignment Tool to properly aligned partitions. Windows 7 automatically recognized this HDD and disable defragmentation which could damage any SDD HDD. If you have older laptop but don't want to spend 700-800 USD for new one just buy this HDD and you won't be disappointed. HyperX Series is top series of HDD from Kingston and also is quite high in benchmarks compering to other HDDs, There is one product which has little bit better write/read ration - Samsung 830 Series 256GB SATA III with similar price but I decided to buy Kingston as it is well known maker for SDD HDDs or memory sticks. I also have other SDD HDD which I bought before and no one ever fail - you can relay on the brand.One more remark - if you buy this and install just go to Kingston website and check if there are any updates available.

$review_text.: I bought a couple of &#34;off-brand&#34; batteries for my trip to Germany back in 2011, and was frustrated that even with overnight charging, the batteries were not lasting very long in my Nikon D90.  In fact, I carried two of the off-brands and the OEM battery that came with my camera. The batteries drained very rapidly, even though I turned the camera off between shots, and didn't use any of the editing features of the camera.  Imagine my embarrassment when my batteries died, and I had to borrow my friend's iPhone to take photos.  I certainly didn't buy a Nikon to use an iPhone for photos!!!  In a few weeks, I'll be leaving for Israel for the International Festival of Lights, and wanted to make sure I had reliable power.  While the OEM batteries are almost 3 times the price of the generic, you certainly get what you pay for!  I charged my Nikon battery over a year ago, and when I put it back in my camera today, it still had an 83% charge!  That's something I didn't expect from any battery, and certainly not the generic.I will make sure that if I need a new or spare power source, I will stick with the Nikon battery and use the OEM charger.  Why buy a camera with advanced capabilities, just to be frustrated by a battery that can't handle the demand?  I guess the only way to sum this up is to use that old clich&eacute;: Pennywise and pound foolish!

It has an indicator for whether or not it's grounded, which is helpful in an older house. I haven't had to replace any of my equipment on it yet and it has weathered a handful of power outages under mild loading conditions without any issues whatsoever.The only downside is that the protector itself is somewhat large, but it is thin enough that it could be mounted on the side or back of an entertainment center and be out of sight and out of mind, keeping your expensive electronics safe.

$REVIEW.: Not bad, I am saving it for another strap that I am waiting on and going to modidy to my liking with a different type of quick release method.... giving it a 4 stare due to the threads not being as fine as they should of been... I threaded it first into an old tripod adaptor to make sure the threads worked before I screwed them into my camera body.... I slowly threaded it to the adaptor and it straightened out the threads.  kinda like rethreading it.  it works fine now. but I am waiting for a neoprene neck strap with a special type of quick release I ordered to make it cleaner looking and more user freindly.  Like the concept though... not bad product for the price... not sure what the others are talking about when they say to order the real deal stainles steel for more money.... Lol... its a solid piece of threaded steel  and it works.  I dont see the reason to pay more for the same product.

$REVIEW.: I am a long time Sennheiser fan, having used their products for many years for home theater, iPhone, PC gaming, and DJ applications. This is by far my least favorite set of Sennheisers, and I returned them back to Amazon.1) There is no excuse for the lack of optical connections in 2013. I get the feeling these headphones were designed in 1995, given they have a standard Yellow / White cable and a 3.5mm standard "small" headphone jack connector. These are the lowest end connectors on the market.Most of you buying these headphones are likely looking for home theater applications. And most receivers / TVs sold in the last decade use "optical" connectors, which are based on optical fiber. Using an optical connector, I have much more control and far superior sound compared to the connectors sold with these 170s.2) The build quality is disappointingly cheap feeling for such expensive cans. Very plasticy and pretty ugly. I do appreciate the light weight, but the ugly looks are not appreciated given these are on display in the living room.Look, Sennheiser has never been known for having good looking headphones. But the lack of optical connectivity is the reason whey I sent these back. I rarely return items so I questioned whether to give these one star....but figured that was too harsh.
$SUMMARY.: I have used Sennheiser for 15 years and this is the first disappointment

$review_text.: I bought this camcorder to record the birth of my daughter and must say was very happy with the results
I think it looks far better than the previous Panasonic range and has the OIS feature
They also have improved the LCD screen over the last model, which had that awful plastic hinge with a 2.7 inch widescreen display

 The camera side is pretty crappy with a resolution of around 1/2 megapixel
What's bizarre is that the camcorder recognizes the new SDHC format, but what's the point of a high capacity card with such a dire resolution camera? Don't expect any loaded software either, it's up to you to make your own arrangements in that department, also no remote for when showing on the TV


Apart from that, a very nice, easy to use little camera.

$review_text.: After throwing away my Razer Blackwidow Ultimate after about a year and a half of use due to it being too dirty and basically unclean-able, I was looking for a day to day use keyboard that would at worst be cheap to replace. I thought I would try this.First of all, I am still totally a Cherry Blue devotee and still strongly prefer mechanical keyboards for serious work or play, but for casual use am open to other keyboards.This keyboard way surpassed my expectations. It does take a bit of getting used to the rubbery bottoming out and the fact the keys can sort of flex a bit, but Logi seems to have taken care to still give these a less mushy response initially which is amazing considering the waterproof design. After a few weeks I can probably type 90% as well on this keyboard as my mechanical ones, and it doesn't feel unpleasant to use. More importantly, my keyboard is clean, not only because it is easy to wash, but this design is just intrinsically easier to dust off.

The lens mount hasn't failed, and I imagine Sony knows how to engineer and test something like that.If there was one thing I could change, it would be that the video quality, while excellent, would be better if it supported 1080p60 at higher bitrates, even if that was outside some arbitrary standard.Otherwise, a great camera.

$review_text.: I like this device a lot. Contrary to what some people have found, mine works fine with a Lenovo X60T, and I have found Kensington tech support very helpful.  Regarding the short cord, consider: the nature of the device is such that it generates heat.  Do you want something that generates heat sitting on your desk or floor, or hanging two inches away from the wall so it has air circulating all around it?  To me, this seems like a no-brainer.The main thing is that it is light and powers everything, so you need only one brick for all your devices.  For example, if you have a device like a shaver which doesn't have a ready-made tip, you can find a tip with the same volt/amp specs (tech support was helpful here) and make your own tip.  Then when you travel, you don't even need a separate adapter for things like shavers.  Overall, 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: There is nothing much to distinguish this bag from other mediocre bags. It is canvas, with a poorly fitting lid which cannot keep the dust out, and little protection for your possessions from bumps.It is an unpadded (by design) cloth bag in which you dump in stuff that needs carrying around. Do not expect your possessions to be protected from the minor bumps that happen in daily life. It is not designed to provide bump protection, there is no inner padding. So if you expect that your bag might get bumped, and your equipment needs protection, this may not be the ideal bag. Further, the lid does not cover the top properly unless you take care to spread it out by hand every time you close it; the two catches are really hard and both hands to open. A dusty breeze will get dust inside, a bit of rain soaks the canvas (unless you spend time and effort to waterproof it first).TO get it up to grade as a camera bag that protects as well as carries, you should consider an upgrade with:>water-repelling spray>inside padding for the camera>easier to open catchesOr you can just get a camera bag that already takes care of these basic requirements.One of the big things that people mention is that the inner and outer dimensions are nearly the same. That is true. That is also true for a paper or plastic grocery bag.In its favor, the bag looks nice and curves to your body when you carry it.Edited May 9 2010: My comments on the lack of padding need retraction for the current version on sale. I see that the current version includes a short 4 compartment insert.

$REVIEW.: The new Retina MacBook Pro is outright gorgeous in terms of its form factor and screen resolution


There are several improvements in this version compared to the 2011 MBPRO 13" that I owned previously:SIZE - Feels significantly lighter and thinner

Somewhere between the MBAir and old MBPRO


It's almost a full pound lighter than the 4.5lb older MBP


A much more portable feel to it compared to the old MBP.RESOLUTION - No question, the resolution is what this device is all about

Refreshing new look as the screen is incredibly crisp (and that's an understatement) with it ridiculously high pixels and also more on-screen real estate to work with
The screen is less reflective compared to its predecessor, making it easier to work in bright conditions.PORTS - Great improvements in my opinion - addition of an HDMI port and moving the second USB port to the other side, giving a USB port on both sides

Makes using them slightly easier
Firewire port replaced with an extra Thunderbolt port


Ethernet port and optical drive eliminated.MAGSAFE 2 - Original MagSafe connector replaced with MagSafe 2 connector

I personally am not aware of any advantages of the new connector in terms of charging/data transfer speed, but this was annoying because I had to buy another $80 MagSafe 2 charging cable for my office - I leave one at home and one at work.SPEED - Flash storage makes using this device significantly faster


Boot up time and loading time for apps is super fast

Opening up the screen from standby takes less than a second.BATTERY - not sure of the battery specs but I get about the same use on this as I did with my older MBP
If I am away from a wall outlet, a full charge is god enough to get me by the day with 20-30% battery remaining


This could of course vary depending on personal usage.STORAGE and RAM - The rMBP comes with 128GB of flash storage and is also available with a 256GB configuration at an additional $200 or so

A device with higher capacity storage can be configured but that pushes up the price pretty quick and pretty steep


The processor is a 2.5GHz dual-core i5, the Apple rep told me there was no option to get a quadcore processor for this device

Only upgrade possible was I think a i7

If the storage or processor is a deal breaker for you, consider getting the 15" rMBP which comes with a i7 quadcore processor and 256GB flash storage
Performance wise or based on configuration options available, the 15" fares significantly better than the 13" but it is quite a bit more expensive.Bottomline - the 13" rMBP in my opinion offers a good balance across all MBP and MBA devices - it offers fantastic portability (only slightly thicker than MBA) and great performance (falls short of rMBP 15 but better than other models).At the end of the day, whether or not to buy this device is entirely a personal decision based on several factors


IMHO, if portability is a major factor for you, the MBA might be better suited though I think if you try both devices side by side, the difference is insignificant


If performance is a must-have in terms of computing power and storage, the 15" is definitely the better option with the additional $500 price tag 

If you don't care about either and just need a good functioning Mac, the older version MBP would be perfect and it's much cheaper at $1199


That being said, once you see the resolution and form factor of this rMBP, it would be difficult to go back to the old MBP!

$review_text.: Found Known Issue: Answer = DriveLink aka MirrorLink is junk; to solve it we all wait for ARliberator[...]Another thread dealing with the same thing, but searches only pull it up if you put "galaxy" note 2 [...]Pioneer must be hoping that ARLiberator comes out soon, bc this stereo is junk while trying to use mirrorlink. It's a pile (insert cus word) at the moment that is a good non-touchscreen device, that has a few icons to select - radio, dvd/cd, bluetooth, or rearview mirror display.  Sales will not be good if it does not change.I also understand why the system is closed as per regulations of the road and what Pioneer is allowed to put out to the public. You don't want everyone playing with a screen of their phone while driving. What I found using the MirrorLink app, that did not even mirror on the screen yet unless in MHL (non-touchscreen mode atm) = I have to hit 1.) the head units' being safe "ok" button at start up, 2.) connect via bluetooth if it does not connect (since it's (insert cus word) compared to the BT35-HON's automatic connection but it is understandable if MHL will be your connection and not BT 3.) hit ok on my phone for the bluetooth code...(sometimes after you have already paired it before)  3.) open drivelink, 4.) hit "Agree to DriveLinks' warning", when the drive link app opens 5.) hit discard to the automatic weather info audio/screen (cannot be turned off), 6.) hit discard to "continue listening to what ever mp3 that you last listened to" (not bad if that's what you want) just to get to the MirrorLink/DriveLink home page that only works in landscape mode which means I then have to 7.) turn the phones' rotate screen off or turn it in landscape mode bc Mirror Link won't resize, 8.) then once mirrorlink actually works I can use their 3 icon home page that is barely customizable, use their very hard to navigate music program which requires I use the right side slider to scroll through songs vs a flick or drag of the finger, and only 3 artists/songs/albums showing at a time, So to play an MP3 that I was not last listening to I have over a dozen steps usually. WT_? Safe? Even Pandora requires 9 steps to get to a second screen of the mirrorlink icons which requires use of a > symbol to the next screen of icons vs dragging the finger/screen. Who the ___ designed this junk... a bunch of old rich guys who run a company and old ladys sitting in a room who are too slow to keep up with the times - C.C.C.??? Thinking of this group that built this junk program reminds me of a documentary called This Film Has Not Been Rated - about Movie Ratings/old ladies sitting in a room watching a movie to decide if it's ok for their children and counting how many cus words it has or dirty pictures it flashes. The CCC ( Car Connectivity Consortium) needs to count how many times they make me touch the screen for warnings!What I did in my car with the BT35-HON and just my phone - Turn on key, hit Pandora put the car in gear. Or hit music icon, see 8 artists, scroll with a flick of the finger, hit artist, hit first song, put the car in gear. Or turn on car hit "driving app" and hit one of the 8 icons on the home screen - That's it.In the end MirrorLink is (insert bad word here) and I have now spent 2 days trying to get it to work, only to do enough research to find everyone has the same problem, and is just waiting for ARliberator. Pioneer must be praying for it also so that MirrorLink is not their default end product. The other option is to have an apple device, itunes, no micro sd card, sync all music, jailbreak to avoid more of the apple dance (put your left foot in, put your right foot in and shake it all about) and never also be able to carry a spare battery for flights/ change it without sending it in, or have wifi charging.  Once all that is done with your apple device then set it to wifi and use my phones' hotspot. I can't stand apple after switching to Android though and would rather hit my self in the face. But I'm preaching to the choir if you are reading this MirrorLink thread :)But I digress. Please ARLiberator save us from our dismal lives

Although it's no iPad, it's perfect for my needs, and offers lots of features the iPad doesn't.I was shopping for a solution that could allow me to:DrawTake notesBrowse the net and consume mediaTake pictures and edit them and draw on themEasily sync to the cloud to share with my laptopThis does all of those things, and the included pressure-sensitive Wacom stylus and digitizer make drawing and note-taking a pleasure instead of a pain. The experience is very similar to that on tablet PC, but this tablet is much more portable, lighter, less expensive, and lasts for hours and hours on a single charge, unlike my tablet PC which lasts 2-4 hours max.If you're looking for a pleasurable drawing and writing experience, and don't need to run Windows software, this is probably the tablet for you. You just have to make sure to explore all the apps available and choose the one you like best. Fortunately they're all $5 or less so it's not expensive to explore.If you're interested, here's the apps I use on this tablet:For note-taking and doodling:LectureNotes: it's got tons of settings you can adjust for just the right experience, and it can sync to any cloud drive or Evernoteor S-Note for its integration into the OS and ability to easily sync to Google or Evernote, although its proprietary .snb file format makes it impossible to collaborate with non-Samsung devicesFor drawing in earnest:Sketchbook Pro, although this app is annoying because it forces you to hold the tablet in landscape format, which is the opposite of what a real sketchbook offers. Sketchbook Mobile lets you draw in portrait mode but has fewer features.or Photoshop Touch, although this has the same landscape-only irritation, and it's especially bad because it forces you to hold the tablet in only ONE position, which is upside down to how I'd like to hold it. On the other hand, it's got great image-manipulation tools which makes it easier to integrate photos and such into drawings.All in all, a good investment for the price, and as more apps become available for stylus use, the experience should just keep improving.

$REVIEW.: Using 4 of these in a Synology DS414 NAS Drive Station (see separate review).They are fast, quiet, and run cool.  The price is pretty good too, though the sweet spot seems to be the 3 TB model.  I splurged for the 4 TB, since I wanted to go ahead and &#34;max out&#34; my DS414.Not much else to say about these drives.  Western Digital is the way to go.  I've used Seagate and others in the past, and always come back to Western Digital.  Their equipment is more reliable, and they have a pretty good warranty process for those times when you cook a drive and cause it to fail... (most drives fail because they are not adequately cooled, or in the case of spindle drives, they are moved while running.)I give this product the max 5 stars, since it works better than the competition and is backed by a solid company.Enjoy!

$review_text.: At last I found a notebook that is light to carry, no battery woes, higher resolution, unbelievable speed and performance and a far more superior design compared to its contemporaries in the market

The speed and performance of the Apple MacBook Air is attributed to the Intel Core i5 processor

Since I am a web designer I wanted a faster processor that can ensure rapid graphics, the Intel HD Graphics 4000 processor does this job fine

Data transfer is done at lightning speed thanks to the Apple Thunderbolt technology.The MacBook Air also provides two USB 3.0 ports that ensure quicker transfer than its predecessor

The multi-touch track pad is absolutely fun to work with especially which rotating images
The HD webcam gives better image resolution making my web chat real

Overall a great notebook to work with.

$REVIEW.: I've started shooting some weddings.  Though this is less imperative than the Quantum Turbo 3, it does make the camera more imposing and you know that you're not running out of juice midstream.  The extra set of controls and shutter are convenient.  When the camera is obviously more geared up, the subjects are more eager.  Works for me.  Comes with a AA battery holder, but you'll want to use the actual Canon batteries, so order an extra one (you already have one in your Mark II.)  It should be said I have large hands and the extra size and weight feel pretty natural to me.  Though I give it 5 stars, this is by no means essential; after all, you could have a second battery with you charged and ready.  This accessory is &#34;look and feel&#34;, not functionally essential.

$REVIEW.: the suction mount's adjustable angles maybe only fit some cars' windshields but would also unfit for other cars'. i've tried and tried to put it on 2 of my cars, but no matter how i tried, the screen of the c330 would only face downward. i've unscrewed the two screws and tried to reverse the position of the upper holding part, but it just won't do. the only way to make this stupid suction mount is to attach some 3m double-side stick strips on the suction cup and glue it on the dashboard. but by doing so, the whole mount simply became so high like palm tree grow out of the dashboard. believe me, i've tried every angle to suck it on the windshield but it just not right.

$REVIEW.: These little speakers have a decent kick for the price. The subwoofer is about half the size of an average shoe box. The satellite speakers are about the size of a can of soda. I have some speakers already and wanted something that could give a little more bass. The subwoofer delivers decent bass. At its loudest with a really &#34;bassy&#34; song it doesn't quiet make my heart jump but I can feel the floor vibrate a little. Overall satisfied with the product for what I payed.

$review_text.: This is not a photographic item.  Other adverse reviews are not adequately critical of just how bad this item is.It screws onto 58 mm lenses.  That's about the best that can be said of it.It takes 62 mm, not 58 mm, lens caps and filters, which should be disclosed up front.  That doesn't matter though, as the off color bluish ghosting and image degradation is so severe, it's unusable for photography.Also, the way the rear is designed, it could easily damage some filters or lenses, making it harmful to install, never mind the worst so-called photographic product I've tried in years.

$review_text.: I have to admit I was skeptical when I first ordered the Military Shield. I had ordered one for a previous tablet and it was a bit of a disaster and I wound up returning it. I was comparing this one to the Skinomi brand and looking at all of both of their products, ArmorSuit had the most high-scoring reviews so I chose them. The installation went much more smoothly than I expected. I think the key is to make sure you get both the screen protector and the screen good and evenly covered with the spray so that there are no dry spots - dry spots are where the shield will stick and make it impossible to align. But if both are nice and evenly wet the shield is easy to slide around into place. There were quite a few streaks after installation but the instructions say not to worry, to let it sit overnight. I did that and by the next day 95% of all the streaks were gone. The day after that there were no more bubbles and no streaks and I could barely tell the shield was even there. I am pleasantly surprised and so far a very happy customer. I would not hesitate to buy another ArmorSuit MilitaryShield.

$review_text.: If you have an iPod or iPhone and want to play it through your audio system, then the Pure iPod dock is the best of breed.Much earlier I had gone through a number of different iPod docks, all of which, including Pure, suffer from the inability to neatly replicate the navigation of the iPod and iPhone in a dock format. However, the earlier docks had a high failure rate and most have disappeared from the market.Most of the docking devices seem to come as an integrated playback system including inadequate speakers and lack a quality and convenient output that can be routed to an audio system.  The Pure dock is a quality product with very good intenral DAC as well as TOS output if you want to run the output through a separate high-quality DAC device.The Pure dock may seem to be pricey at $100 but it is a quality and convenient input device to an audio system for either the iPod of iPhone.One caveat - the Pure, so far as I know, comes only with the older (pre-iPhone 5) connector.

$REVIEW.: I have the Survivor case for my Verizon iPhone and have been using it for a couple of weeks. Here is what I found:The good: It will protect your phone, no doubt. My phone has fallen from waist height several times and spent an hour in a half inch  puddle on a rainy night in a parking lot without showing any ill effects. 4.5 stars for protection (being water resistant rather than water proof is the missing half a star)The bad: The camera flap. Ugh. My iPhone having friends scoffed when I said I didn't plan on using the camera function of the phone much. The camera on my Blackberry was awful, and I just got along without it using point and shoots when I needed. They told me the camera is pretty decent on the iPhone, and I will want to use it. I didn't believe them and bought the Survivor case knowing full well that using the camera would be a pain. Well, I like the camera and would like to use it more, BUT the flap covers the lens and flash and is somewhat challenging to open. More important, it is moderately challenging to keep open and prevent from blurring the bottom right corner of my photos. If you want to snap a photo of a building or a landscape, there won't be any issues, but I'll use my SLR for that anyway. Trying to get your camera out to snap a photo of the famed Chupacabra before it runs into the underbrush? Yeah, not so much. Even if you manage to get a shot of the thing, the rush it took to prepare the phone will make a quality photo nearly impossible. Not interested in hunting mythical beasts? Your kid doing the cutest thing ever will be equally impossible to get. The hard case doesn't have a screen to protect the lens, so cutting off the flap will result in a serious access point for dust and water to get to the phone itself. I would not recommend doing this. Either accept the flap or get a new case. 3 stars for access (the other flaps are pretty good)The ugly: The reason I know the case protects the phone (see above) is because it falls out of the belt clip on a regular basis. The clip is truly terrible and should not be considered as something you will use if you buy this case. Adding in the fact that the case makes the phone too large for most pockets and the silicone case makes it extremely difficult to remove the large piece of equipment from any pocket in which it does fit, should make one very wary of the lack of a functional belt clip. Something this big needs to be worn on the belt, not put in a pocket. If you carry a purse, this is obviously less of an issue. 1 star for carrying convenience (the one star is because the clip doubles as a stand)The annoying and worth considering: A drawback to the protection offered by the raised (1/8 or so) edge around the screen is that the edges of the touch screen can be hard to use. Dust also collects in the corners and is hard to remove. The silicone cover collects dust too and is generally unappealing to look at.Here's to making informed purchases.

$REVIEW.: I wasnt sure about getting this one since all the reviews I read as I quickly went through them were for the model that took batteries. I wanted the model that that claims to hold a single charge for 140 hours .  Finally i settled on this keyboard after looking at all the ones on amazon. I ended up buying the model that you simply plug in to a usb port to charge.So far ive had this keyboard for only a few days. For the ammount i use it, Iprobably wont need to charge it for weeks but we'll see. Itested it out by using it to write several reviews on products i bought on amazon. I never wrote reviews because i didnt feel like using my phone to txt them out. Im using this keyboard to write this review as well. I saw some people say that the space bar gave them issues. it wouldnt register sometimes.Ive noticed this too but i see what the problem is. As you can tell its happened twice in this review. When ever i start a sentence with i. and i use shift to make it a capital , Iwill hit the space bar to fast before the letters can go back to lower case and it wont register the space bar, as it just happened in this sentence. Its a a easy fix by simply slowing down when typing.Its def not worth taking a star away from though. The keys have great feed back. They are spaced far enough appart you arent hitting the wrong one. and ive never had a issue as ive seen people report with others where they press a letter and end up with ggggggggggggggggg a ton of them. Ive seen it say connecting to blue tooth in the middle of using it but they keyboard kept typing away with no issue.Granted this is my first blue tooth keyboard so i dont have anything to compair it to. but if it keeps performing the way it has been in the last few days i would highly recommend buying it.

It bounced a few times across the cement before resting in a small puddle.  Thought it was a goner, but after wiping it off it worked like a champ. Solid durability.  One of the addresses I have gone to was not found by the system, yet when I got there the street did show up on the internal map.  It was a fairly new road (about 3 years old) but thought if the road was shown why couldn't it find the address?I'm mostly happy with the unit; I will use it primarily for travel to strange cities as part of business trips.

$review_text.: The Hub itself is nicely-designed. Ports are spaced out well enough that you don't generally run into a situation where 1 USB device is blocking the port for another.The two, additional ports that are spaced out from the rest work well with over-sized USB dongles like my Belkin N150 WiFi b/g/n device.The unit has two, large rubbery pads on the bottom that are adhesive so you can attach it to the surface to prevent it from sliding around when you install/remove peripherals.The USB Cable is of good quality and supple enough that you can twist it up pretty easily (important for me since I wanted to hide the wiring due to limited real estate in my Raspberry Pi case.) and it is permanently connected to the hub. It is not removeable. (I like that)The power brick, on the other hand, is an unknown...as in there is very little writing on it other than the sticker saying "Made in China". The specifications of the power supply unit show it to be a little underpowered. 500mA * 7 = 3.5A while the power brick is only rated for 2A.I've had no problems thus far with mine, but it is something you should remain cognizant of...I'd have rated 5-star except for the underpowered wall wart. It works great with my Raspberry Pi, which is finicky where power supplies are concerned...

$REVIEW.: I should preface this review by saying that I am not an enthusiast when it comes to speakers and home theater systems.  Until moving into a new home that was wired for sound a couple of months ago I had never had external speakers for sound, though I did often visit friends and family with home theater systems and acknowledge that their sound quality was vastly superior to mine.  Net net, I appreciate what sounds good to my own ear, but I'm not someone who spends a lot of time comparing technical details when making this kind of purchase.  If I personally like how something sounds that is sufficient to me.Before receiving this home speaker system I was using theBose Acoustimass 10 Series IV home entertainment speaker system - Black.  This set was certainly not going to get me any cred with my audiophile friends, but I was happy with the sound quality even when playing movies rather loud.I found the set up of the speakers to be relatively straightforward and the directions detailed enough for anyone to set up and operate the system.  The only thing I would have wished was that the answers to the troubleshooting section were a bit more precise.  Thankfully I didn't need to use them, but had I, some of the answers to the troubleshooting questions would definitely have to have been googled in order for me to make sense of them.  It's not a huge deterrent, but it definitely made me appreciate that a lot of the gadgets I purchase assume a very low level of technical knowledge and write their directions accordingly.Once I had the speaker system installed and allowed for the 15-20 hours of operation time for it to be working at maximum efficiency, I was pretty satisfied with the sound quality.  For me, it sounded comparable to my existing set.  Though perhaps I would have noticed slight differences if I'd been able to do a true side by side comparison.  But to my ear, the sound was just as full and clear as it was with my Bose.  Even when using it to play various genres of music I never had a problem with it sounding dull or flat.I think my favorite aspect of this theater system though is how small the speakers are relative to my bose, especially the subwoofer.  For this Canton set it measures 9.1" x 14.2" x 16.5" vs. 16.33 x 8.13 x 25.33 inches for the Acoustimass Module that came with my Bose set.  I'm sure some would chide me for thinking about style as well as sound quality but since my living space doesn't afford a good place to hide the subwoofer, smaller for me is better.  The Acoustimass Module was such an eye sore, very bulky and outdated looking and no where near as easy to hide as Bose's marketing made me believe.  Granted this set doesn't have the high end, glamorous look of some of the home speaker systems I've seen in friends' places or model homes.Overall, I think this is a solid set for the money from a sound quality standpoint (at least to the average, casual listener) and those who want speakers that blend in/are discrete will appreciate the small size of the various components.
$SUMMARY.: Solid set for the $ and love the small size of the subwoofer!

 It did the trick with most of my pictures
 The only reason I give it 4 stars its hard to tell when things are set right and some of my shots came out with weird shadows

 I would still recommend this though!

$review_text.: Our family loves the Roku.  We are now buying the Roku 3, and are kind of mad we didn't know it was out already.  Of course, with construction, who can keep up to date.  But, nonetheless, the roku is amazing.  Roku on it's own sucks.  The crackle, zazzle, pop whatever channels are horrible.  What do you expect for free, though?  However, paired with Hulu Plus (7.99 monthly) & Netflix (7.99 monthly) as well as your selected sports subscriptions, there is nothing that beats it.  We cancelled cable tv and couldn't be happier.  Give it a shot & don't base it on the device alone.  The device functions as it should, but you have to understand that it's a medium to making content more accessible at an affordable price.  So don't just the roku on its own if you don't have it paired with at least Netflix.  GREAT BUY!
$review_summary.: Roku, I love you

$REVIEW.: So glad to finally get my PS4 after seeing nothing but positive reviews and within the first hour the disc drive fails. -_- What luck. This pissed me off even more than usual because 1) It was only the first day and 2) This happened with my PS3 80 gig that my mom paid almost double this price on both the first and replacement consoles. Sony needs to pick up the ball.Update: Sony has sent me a replacement and it works like a charm. Disc drive is fully functional.

$review_text.: I'm not someone who listens to music professionally but I was willing to pay a bit more to replace my headphones that cost half as much to get the great sound everyone was talking about.I am underwhelmed by these and really didn't notice any improvement. I know this is contrary to other reviews.I also find the cord is too short and don't like the fact that the jack is straight and not 90 or 45 degrees like on many other headphones. This causes it to bend more if it (and my MP3 player)is in a pocket or something. This can damage the MP3 player jack.The hard case and folding makes it nicer for traveling.

$REVIEW.: Being someone who doesn't watch a whole lot of TV or movies, I didn't want to spend too much when shopping for a new TV. At around $300, after searching around, I decided this was the TV for me. The TV itself looks pretty nice and the glass stand makes it look more expensive that it actually was. Definitely a big plus. As for video quality, I am really pleased with it. There is some bleed from the backlights when the screen is dark, but it is not something that has bothered me too much. Sound isn't that great although I will add that it is better than the other TCL tv I had which was the model before this one.Overall, I think this buy was really worth it, just don't have super high expectations considering the price.

$review_text.: Ok, It's been a month now since I purchased this great product.  For the price and quality you cannot beat the results.  Granted, is a MANUAL lens.  Give yourself time to understand the mechanics of it, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Play with it and have fun.  The lens is strong and very well made.  This is not a toy!!! - it delivers great results! Now careful, its heavy!  So respect it when is in the tripod or monopod. Seller sent it faster than expected, very well packed, and overall I'm very satisfied.  This is one that you can feel happy to know that you have a super telephoto for a fraction of what ultra-expensive lenses will cost for this range.  I'm very happy and proud owner of a Rokinon. Seller made it happen for me. Description was accurate and to be honest - I love it. I've been taking photos for more than 25yrs and by far its a good purchase.  BUT like I said before - take your time to understand the mechanics of it. Once you get to know how to zoom and measure apertures and synch with shutter speed you will see the results. Excellent purchase. Very satiesfied w/ seller and product! Txs! P.S and the moon has never looked better in my eyes than with this lens!!!

$review_text.: I just installed this dual drive in my media center PC (I got it from another vendor --- sorry Amazon).  WD encourages refreshing your operating system when installing this drive, especially if the amount of your data exceeds the capacity of the SSD, and that only makes sense.  However, I had just done a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit on my system so it wasn't necessary.  My computer specs are an Intel i5 Core i3 3220 on a Gigabyte H61M-USB3H Board with 8GB of G.Skill 1333 RAM and Intel HD 2500 graphics.  The motherboard is SATA2 capable, and the SSD I tested against is a Plextor 128GB.I followed the included instructions to the letter to set up the drive, which is a simple matter of inserting a key-like device in a USB port and downloading Acronis software (for the cloning) and WD software (to partition the drive, necessary or you won't have access to the full capacity).  I didn't find one important step mentioned in the instructions: after connecting the WD drive to the computer you need to go into computer management and initialize it or the Acronis software won't be able to see it; I couldn't find that in the booklet although it's discussed on the WD site.After initializing the drive the cloning process went without a hitch, as did partitioning the drive with the WD software, and then all I needed to do was physically swap the drives.  When everything was set up I ran a free program called AS SSD to benchmark the new WD drive and compared it to my Plextor SSD.  Read times are where SSDs really shine, and the WD sequential read time was 255 compared to the Plextor's 253, pretty much a dead heat.  The Plextor was faster with sequential write times though, 196 vs. 137 on the WD.  Those read times are very good for a SATA2 board like mine, and translate in fast boot times, quick application launches, and faster level load times when gaming, all advantages of an SSD over a traditional HDD.  Also, using this dual drive in a laptop is going to show a significant improvement over a standard SSD that has to read files from an external drive attached via USB, making the built-in 1TB of storage is a huge plus.  If you have a computer that is your primary work machine and it has only one hard drive bay (like most laptops and all-in-ones), and you want the benefits of an SSD for booting and loading apps, and an HDD for storage, than this drive is a very good, albeit spendy, choice.
$SUMMARY.: Very good option if you have only one drive bay in your computer

$review_text.: Extremely impressed with the TZ3. This gem should get 5 stars on construction and finish alone. Just holding it in your hands it screams quality and feels like a tank. Love it. It seriously feels like a $700 camera. No exaggeration. I was a little worried about it not being able to fit in my jean pockets before buying it. Women may have issues with really tight jeans but for us guys no problem. It fits fine. I seriously cant believe I can carry around a camera with a 10x zoom inside my jean pockets. Truly remarkable. The 3" screen is amazing. You can practically enjoy your pics right on screen w/o even printing them with the High Res output. Navigation is so easy on this camera. Something not surprising though if your already coming from another panny (FZ7 here). Picture quality is great. I tested it out today on standard and I would say its just as good as my FZ7 in daylight and better in lowlight (indoors). Image quality is great, and if you need extra sharpness you could always use the camera on "Vivid mode" or add a little with some post processing. The pics in Standard and natural mode PP very well. The wide angle is something new to me. Took some neat shots that looked very nice with the extra viewing angle. Very distinctive and after having this i'm not sure if I could go back.If your looking for a do it all camera this may very well be your tool of choice. Combine it's extreme versatility coupled with excellent image quality, superb lens, build, and finish you have yourself a winner.
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic, extremely versatile camera

$REVIEW.: For the price, this is a pretty good camera


 The audio is not very good but you can hear it

 The night vision is not what I hoped for with the number of LEDs this camera has and it seems to be focused instead of defused across the viewing area

 And occasionally I have to reboot it to get the night vision to come back on in the evening


 But even with these negatives the picture is clear and crisp even at night, without the dreaded halo


 The pan tilt works well


 Even though this is an indoor camera, I have this camera outside under an eave and so far it is doing really well
 So despite the couple of issues i havebhad with this camera it performs pretty well and you can't beat the price.

This piece of garbage can only play about a third of the music I loaded on it, constantly 'loses' album artwork and has to be managed by the incredibly unfriendly, and unpredictable iTunes software. Apple has done an exceptional job marketing garbage and getting young people to prefer the Apple brand but as far as pure operational capabilities, this has to be one of the absolute worst media players out there. I'm sorry I decided to try Apple again - it will be the last piece of Apple junk I will ever buy again....will be selling this soon and going back to purchase a Zune player - this iPod is total junk....

$review_text.: The Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery for anyone's Apple and Android Device. The Astro E5 size is exactly the same size as it predecessor, the Astro E4. The weight of it is pretty heavy holding it in your hand but not anything that is noticeable if you have a bunch of stuff in a bag with this battery in it. The on/off button is quite easy to press and easily pressed if it is stuffed into a bag. The flashlight in the external battery is a big plus. It is a bright LED light that works well if the power is out or looking for something in the night. The light is easily turned on because of the easily pressed on/off buttons. The flashlight is activated by pressing 2 times fast on the on/off button. This battery has 2 USB ports. One is 5 volts at 2 amps and the other is 5 volts at 1 amp. There are 4 LED's that tell how much power the battery pack has left for charging other devices. The battery has a smooth, shiny, reflective and stylish finish which looks awesome. The finish on the battery also attractions a lot of fingerprints which could make the battery look bad if not cleaned every so often.This battery has a massive 15000mah lithium ion battery in it that is packed in a small casing. This battery is smaller than most other external batteries I have researched in the past which is ideal for packing in a small bag. I use this battery to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPod touch 5. I can charge both these devices simultaneously.This product is ideal for someone who travels a lot and uses a smartphone for their business when traveling. This battery is also good for people who go camping and are not around power that watch movies and play games on their device for long periods of time. Other than the buttons being easily pressed this is the perfect external battery for those looking into buying one to use for a long trip or power your friends device and keep your devices charged in case of a black out.The Anker Astro E5 is closely comparable to the Astro E4.Anker Astro E4 13000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7... (This has a 13000mah lithium ion battery) Both of these batteries look identical from the looks to the locations of the ports but the Astro E5 has a 15000mah battery that puts it over the top of the Astro E4.Overall the Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery that can charge your smartphone to 100% and do it again 6-8 more times and has a modern look most smartphones have today. You won't have to worry about your phone dying for more than a week when using this external battery.So far i have charged my iPhone 5 twice and it still has 4 LEDS.Another Update: i have charged my ipod touch 2 times and my iPhone 5 3 times and it now has 1 LED and can still charge my devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent battery pack that has tons of power to go around

$REVIEW.: These are great headphones for listening to music on portable devices.  The have soft ear pads rather than in-ear plugs, making them more comfortable as well as safer for your hearing.  Not only do they fold up, but they come with a (faux) leather carrying case which easily slips into a daypack, purse, or coat pocket.  Sound quality is excellent.  I've used mine for over 3 years, and they've stood up to the rigors of travel quite well.  The joints still work and the ear pads are intact with no signs of wear.

$REVIEW.: These are the best fitting in-ears for my ears I have ever tried. Usually in-earsfit is very poor for me leading me to instead opt for headphones whenever practical, but these are good enough where I could wear them indefinitely without qualms, while still offering decent sound isolation.The sound quality on these is decent and balanced and about average for name brand under $20 in-ears for this generation. Perhaps a bit subdued on the very high and low ends, but that is better than distorting. They are moderately efficient so you should be able to use these with most portable audio devices without worrying about external amplification even in loud environments, but they are not as efficient as some other in-ears.Overall, excellent deal at $5 and these could be competitive with nearly any other under $20 in-ears while being very likely far more comfortable.

$review_text.: The Sangean PR-D5 AM/FM radio may be just the radio for you...or not.  It all depends on what you expect from your radio - for instance, do you expect to leave it on a table or counter-top most of the time while moving it from room to room only occasionally?  Or, do you need a take-with-you portable for your active lifestyle?  Is most of your listening FM stereo, or tuning in ballgames from distant AM stations?  Are you an AM DXer who enjoys logging those distant stations when conditions are favorable, running up and down the frequencies for hours hoping for a record catch?In addition to this Sangean, I also purchased the C. Crane CCRadio-EP via Amazon on the same day.  They are very different units, and each has its strong points.  You may prefer one to the other based on some issues mentioned in the first paragraph.  Their prices are about the same.The Sangean is a digital model with 5 FM presets and 5 AM.  It has two small stereo speakers, clock functions, and is easy and convenient to use.  The Crane is an analog radio, having no presets or clock functions, a single (but larger) speaker, bass and treble knobs, selectable AM bandwidth, a neat lighted dial, and a fine-tune adjustment for AM.  Both have very sturdy FM whip antennas, and both have excellent AM antennas, as well.The Sangean has the largest built-in ferrite bar AM antenna likely to be found in this size radio.  At almost 8" in length, it does a nice job of receiving AM.  The Crane's AM antenna is their twin-coil ferrite bar model which can be somehow elctronically manipulated with the radio's separate fine-tuning control - sometimes it allows you to hear stations which were buried in noise much more clearly.  If you are an AM DXer, or do a lot of listening to marginal, distant AM stations, the Crane has the edge due to its analog design and its special antenna.  However, the Sangean is no slouch at AM - better than most, even - but one notch under the Crane in this regard.The Crane also has the advantage for someone on the go, for one simple but important reason - it has a carry handle.  Carrying the Sangean is very awkward, and the grip it provides very tenuous - the owner who carries it often will sooner or later drop it, and that is pretty much inevitable.  Could be damaged from a fall.  The Crane handle flips down and hides in a nice recess.Both radios sound good...but again different.  The Sangean is a leaner, but more refined stereo FM sound, while the Crane has a bigger sound with a bit deeper low end, which I hesitate to refer to as 'bass' for either radio.  Both provide FM stereo with headphone use.  For near-field listening (such as sitting at hand on a table) the Sangean sounds better to me with its pleasing stereo presentation.  Outdoors, or further away, the bigger sound of the Crane suits me better.The Sangean has a sexier look, the Crane looks more traditional.  Both are very good at reception - about the same for FM, with the Crane having that AM edge.  No handle - what was Sangean thinking?  I really love both of these, and between the two they fill my needs nicely,  while out-performing every other radio in the house from a reception perspective.  While I recommend either, I also can suggest both.  Works for me, and my wife loves the Sangean.EDIT Update:  After a year now my PR-D5 still looks and sounds like new, and I've come to have more respect for its sound quality, too.  Like the RDS, as well - had not previously realized that so many stations broadcast that info.  After the tornadoes hit Moore, about 5 miles from my home, we were without power 48 hours or so and this radio with the Crane became our main source of entertainment and information.  I put the Crane on the floor in a corner with bass up and treble down to use as a quasi-subwoofer while I set the Sangean above it at ear level for the stereo sound - it was quite nice.
$review_summary.: Very Nice Radio.

$review_text.: I consider the built-in iPad2 keyboard to be one of the worst designs ever and having this external keyboard/case turned my iPad2 into a usable tool.It is now like a super light notebook computer on hand at all times, instead of just a toy.I was hoping the function keys would work during remote control of my various desktops using LogMeIn.  They do not, however LogMeIn senses that I have a hard keyboard and displays all my missing function keys where the software keyboard would normally be, so I can live with that.  It is difficult however to remember to NOT hit ESC because that key takes you to the iPad2 home screen.The bottom lip of the backing (see photo) has velco which attaches anywhere you want on the bar above the keyboard.  The two really nice things about this setup is that it tends to stay together when it is on your lap.  If you move and the iPad2 tetters or topples, it stays together, no big deal.  Secondly it allows you to browse it in portrait mode quite easily (as long as you have the space and are okay with a non-slanted display).The iPad2 sits far enough way from the 4 corners and 3 of the sides to offer decent drop-protection, but it is right up to the edge of the 4th side, so hopefully if I do drop it, the iPad will not hit the ground on this side first.I charged the keyboard from the USB port on my notebook computer without any problem.I like the elastic strap method to hold the case together during transit.I like having an elastic stylus holder at the spine, always ready for quietly taking notes during meetings.I have not had any problem with the iPad2 recognizing the keyboard at any time.It does not turn off my iPad2 automatically when closing it, so you have to remember to turn it off yourself first if you do not want accidental screen touching or keyboard input in your open App.There is a hole for both the front and rear cameras.The cable that comes with it is a standard micro cable that works just fine in my HTC Thunderbolt, Kindle Fire, Logitech wireless mouse... always nice to have another one of these cables at the ready.

$REVIEW.: How can something be worse than bad you might ask
I ordered this product on Jan 24, 2013 from Amazon
I was told it would be shipped from China and I could expect a longer delivery time


 It finally arrived on Feb 26

The tablet did turn on but could NOT be charged
 I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact the seller
 The seller responded that I would have to ship the item back to China at my expense which I did ship it back and kept my proof of mailing and it cost another $30.96


 I shipped it back on March 1, 2013
 It is now May 1, 2013 and the seller via email keeps telling me they will refund my money (less $30.96) "as soon as they receive the item"
 Well, guess what? After 60 days I do not believe they will ever receive the item.So this is how it can be worse than bad

 Amazon will do nothing and the seller will do nothing and I have lost my original purchase price plus another $30.96 so that I might be able to participate in this scheme
 The seller is better off sending crappy product that gets returned
 He is out nothing.WHAT A SCAM AMAZON HAS ALLOWED BY PROCESSING MY PAYMENT AND OFFERING THIS PRODUCT - AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

I just make sure the things I just copied to it are turned off before unplugging (same as my older flash drives)

I had the Canon bag open up and drop a lens on the road and wanted something that offered a little more protection for my new 70-200.I wish this bag was a little bigger, but that's probably my only gripe.I fit my 550d with grip. Sigma 30mm, Tokina 11-16, and Canon 70-200.I also wish that I could use the Hammock system with my 70-200 while keeping the lens hood on, but sadly it will not pull through, so I lied above and that is my second gripe.Not enough room for lens hoods in the bag. And can't keep my lens hood attached to the 70-200 while in the hammock and be able to pull out the camera/lens.Other than that, great bag.

$review_text.: I am so glad I stumbled upon this power supply before I purchased all my parts. It is GREAT quality, plus it's modular.Pros:-Sweet design, cool black and red cables (video card power cables are red)- Modular!- Well made- plenty of cables for someone running crossfire or SLI(2 cards)-80+ gold????? At this price and wattage simply unbeatableCon:It shipped with the power switch on, now this isn't really a con but delayed me in building my system because while doing the external build every time I tried to boot up I would switch the power supply off because I assumed it shipped off, but in reality I was switching it off every time I switched it on. First time build mistake.Overall, I will buy EVGA power supply again.You should too.
$SUMMARY.: Will recommend to my friends.

$review_text.: I'd rate it down for the price, but I try not to do that as I feel it unfairly rates the device itself.  I typically use Lexar Memory cards and also typically Compact flash (I use these in a Nikon D800 camera with dual cards slots SD/CF).  But lately in my testing, SD Cards are catching up to CF cards.  So this SD Card in my testing gave realtime results at 61.6 MBs Write and 86.5 MBs Reads.  That's faster write times than even my 100 MBs Lexar CF cards.  Now throw price back into the mix and you have a smaller, cheaper, memory card with better write speed than Lexar's Pro CF cards.I have yet to test it in sub-zero temps so I can't speak to the durability yet, or compare it to the newest line of SanDisk CF cards, but I'm seriously considering going all SD after using this card.

$review_text.: I think this is a great TV, especially for the price. The picture quality is amazing, and easily customizable. You can hook just about anything up to it. The only thing you can't is a separate stereo system, so you'll need to use an entertainment system, or hook up a stereo through the one of the other components (which isn't difficult) if you want that. If you're mainly watching TV, and not movies, there is no need to hook up surround sound, as the unit's sound is just fine. Overall it was more than I expected it to be.

If you look at the factory cable you will see that the ground connector section, at the base of the plug, is somewhat long. On these replacement cables that same section of the plug is very short; consequently you will get audio but no video.

$REVIEW.: A point I want to get across first is if your reading this, you have to decide what kind of photographer you are right off the start.Are you someone just starting?Are you a casual shooter who just wants good pictures and either is considering this first an entry level dslr or has one already but is considering a size reduction?Are you a legacy lens shooter who knows about and is looking towards using vintage glass via adapters?Are you a professional/semi professional protog looking for a second/third back up or travel focus camera?The reason why I wanted to start with that is because this camera, can be your boon or our bane largely on what your exceptions coming in.--The Causal ShooterSimply put for image quality, kit lens quality, auto focus speed,this camera will be on par with  t3i,t4i,t5i or the 3000 series from Nikon, epl/ep series from olympus easily plus or minus some pixel peeping tid bits

This particular APS-C sensor is fantastic at low light while providing plenty of resolution  for a crisp decently large size print, cropping, and obviously way more than needed for any sort of online social media sharing


Just let it be known that while smaller, it gives up almost nothing in terms of image quality, don't let size fool you! However, on the subject of size, it comes down to this
It's a smaller, much more compact camera than any DSLR out on the market, and thus way easier to carry around
However a reduction in size does obviously mean a reduction of ease of use


The Nex 6 has more than plenty of buttons and wheels for easy access for most controls, however a dslr simply always has more features and more dials, buttons etc to make it more quicker for setting changes on the go
Thus if your very casual shooter looking for very simple controls towards a nice photo, than the NEX series may be just for you
It gives you all the same ability and quality of a dslr just without the fluff


 I also forgot to throw in that with the NEX on board flash, you can tilt it upwards to create a bounce flash that is far better than limiting you to a direct flash alone like other cameras.--Current Entry Level DSLR OwnersThis moves on to those who may already have a entry level DSLR and is considering a switch

This is a tougher situation but what you need to ask yourself is if your someone hoping to grow with photography, or simply looking to scale down
If your one of those people who bought a dslr hoping for those nice images you see other people have but eventually realized the bulk and the amount of buttons and knobs that you never bothered to learn just gets in the way then I'll say a sideways move to a NEX series camera is best for you

Your not giving up any image quality while reducing your size and again ridding of the fluff.Now if your someone who does want to grow with photography, then you need to seriously consider Canon, M 4/3, Pentax and Nikon systems before you make this jump

I'm not going to lie, the brands simply has much much more to offer in the long run than the E mount at this point
Entry level lenses, mid level IS lenses, L lenses, TTL Flash, etc etc at a much better price point than any E Mount, or full frame E Mount gear currently


For example, Sony wants roughly $300 for a 50mm F1.8 while Canon offers a 50 1.8 for $100? 50mm F1.4 for $330?  You get the idea.--Legacy ShootersI personally use my Nex 6 so that I can use the plentiful amount of old legacy lenses out there


If you don't know already, due to the short distance of the mount, your able to use adapters to mount any, and I do mean almost any, film camera lenses , and if you wish modern af lenses (although with no af controls outside of the contax G and A Mount I believe) to your Nex

I currently shoot Konica AR, Canon FD, and a few C Mount, Eos Mount, and Olympus mount lenses and all I have to say, it's the most joyful thing in the world


Obviously they are plenty of times where I wish I had autofocus due to the speed of the subject in which I'm taking my photo, however by shooting manual, I've grown to feel like I'm being more hands on with my photography than simply pressing a shutter button and calling it a day


No dig towards modern AF since well, obviously it's almost better in every way hence why we have it, but having old film lenses, and plenty of them is a joy to use


They render extremely nicely on the NEX 6 sensor (I previously owned a Nex 5n) with no resolution problems as seen on the Nex 7

The extra dial at the top makes it much easier to control shutter speed all the awhile the thicker body and grip of the 6 makes it much easier to balance the weight of the camera since most film lenses are quite heavy
My only grip is that the third wheel that is offered on the NEX 7 would've been nice for say exposure comp or quicker iso change but the downside is that NEX 7 Sensor pushes just a few too many MP and you lose the low light performance of the 6 , which for me personally, I find myself shooting far more often with not enough light than plenty.--Protogs looking for a 2/3 back up or travel cameraWhile I want to recommend this camera to you, I might have to say you should at the very least consider the competition
I think it's somewhat agreed that the NEX sensor is amazing, maybe second only to the AA less filter sensor of the fuji line, however the controls, the software, even the lens options, if your use to shooting cameras such as the 5d, 6d 70d etc your going to run into a situation where it baffles you on how limiting the NEX can be at times
Auto ISO almost always checks you in at 3200, histogram menu appears only to take away other information from the screen instead of allowing you to see it all at once or picking and choosing

Like I mentioned above, the price of lenses is insane, there's a massive premium compared to other brand lenses

Limited battery life, sd slot is housed in the same door as the battery slot, no weather sealing, I don't think I need to go on since if your one of these types you most likely already know the spec sheet by heart


The one thing I will say in the NEX favor however, is look at it's price point


For the images you get say NEX 6 + 35 1.8 (~$1046 going by amazon prices as of 2/1/2014 vs $1300 for a 23mm F2 Fuji X100s vs $1300 for body only EM1) the closest thing may be the $800 for XE-1 with Kit vs $748 for NEX with Kit in which case it's nearly a coin toss


In the pixel peeping wars, I believe the XE-1 wins out by a air with a bit better sharpness and obviously better rendering due to the lack of AA


However, it must be said that at what point are you going to need that extra pixel of sharpness? If your making life size prints, then by all means your going to need superior glass and rendering but if you already have a better camera for that then wouldn't anything not your primary camera not as good? This I believe will be hardly left to what sort of subjects your planning to shoot, and how each camera handles to you overall.-- Last wordsNow, I did notice I made no mention of the direct competition in that the M43 sensors cameras


Make no mistake, Olympus and some Panasonic cameras are amazing, especially the OMD Em1, the EP5 etc

I would love to have their 5 axis stabilization but for me personally, with their 2x crop factor, their higher price tag, and their (although such a touch) lower performance in low light high iso, I found the NEX series a better value for price point
M43 does have a much better system in that they have an amazing selection of extremely quality glass

Some bodies and lenses are weather sealed and honestly with enough light in the scene, they perform just as well as any non full frame sensors but overall it's just not for me.

I used $1300 to buy the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro w/ Windows 8.1, i7, 8 GB RAM, & 256 GB SSD from Best Buy.The C720 resolves all the issues I had with the C710 & Samsung Chromebook 11.6".Plugable USB 2.0 ethernet adapter - works greatCable Matters USB 3.0 ethernet adapter - works good[*Not sure if USB 2.0 runs warms, USB 3.0 runs cool, Plugable is a better device, Cable Matters is a weaker device, Chromebook runs better on USB 2.0, or runs worst on USB 3.0.  I had favorable results with the Plugable USB 2.0 ethernet adapter.]HDMI to monitor - works great, letters & images are very sharpMouse - use any mouse brand except Microsoft brand.  Other mouse brands works good as you can change the speed, but the Microsoft mouse has a lot of lag and doesn't work well.  Google may hate Microsoft, but I like their mouse devices.C720 improvements over the C710Screen - clean & clear.  The C710 screens except for the last batch of C710 had very obvious vertical lines and the screen would fade on many occasions.Keyboard - sturdy and no flex as the top is one piece.Sound - excellent, very clear.SD card reader - It is on the right side for those with storage anxiety.Good but not greatHead phone outlet - too tight for my iPhone headphones, but it works.HDMI & USB 3.0 outlet - too close together and I could not properly plug in my Amazon HDMI cable & Cable Matters 3.0 USB hub, but the HDMI & USB plugs are pretty fat.Tips for this ChromebookWhen connected to a monitor, closing the laptop will make the laptop go into "Dock Mode".  Too bad Chromebook doesn't have a virtual keyboard.  To type, I had to open the laptop screen to type.  Dock Mode would be great for watching videos.Mouse cursor with a monitor connected - switch the cursor from laptop to monitor & vice versaIf the cursor is on the laptop, move the cursor to the top right edge of the laptop screen, move up, and the cursor will show up in the top left of the monitor.If the cursor is on the monitor, move the cursor to the top left of the monitor screen, move up, and the cursor will show up in the top right of the laptop screen.I love this laptop for $249, upgrading to more RAM is not needed.  Video streaming on Crunchyroll is great, there is no buffer, stop & play is almost flawless, skipping to different time is very quick, the image is very sharp, and doesn't run hot.  With 4 GB of RAM, it is quick and doesn't need to upgrade.  Boot up is in-line with the Samsung Chromebook as it will boot up in less than 10 seconds and shuts down in 1 second.  You don't really need a big hard drive since everything will be saved to Google Drive.If you thought about buying a cheap machine for web surfing, document & spreadsheet, you should compare all your options, Windows full version, Windows RT, iPad, Android, & Chromebook.  Just remember, Chromebook will never slow down as the Chrome OS is installed and updated constantly.  I just saw that the Microsoft Surface 2 w/ Windows RT will also have Outlook.  With Chromebook, you get free Google Docs, Sheets, Calculator, Calendar, Play Music and many more.  You can also add apps from the Google Web Store.

 I'm going to have to revisit my 2.1A chargers to make sure they can really handle this device - it seems to take overnight to get it recharged.The coiled cable which comes with it is extremely short, so the coiling is mainly an accommodation for orienting the two devices
 It barely stretches more than one foot.The pouch cannot realistically carry the cable or tips, but the pouch's mesh construction is good for keeping the battery cool in a pocket if charging or discharging.

$REVIEW.: I always take the unit out of the car

I disliked the windshield marks (a thief magnet) that were left on the windshield using suction cups


So I began my hunt for the perfect mount

This GPS is sensitive enough that it does not need to be on the windshield

I think I have discovered the best possible mount


It's available on amazon:[...]or search amazon for ARKON APGN-VSMThough not obvious in the picture the top part slides off the bottom part


Search forARKON AP032-VSM to see the bottom part without the top part.There is one limitation to my mount procedure
The bottom part MUST be mounted HORIZONTAL so the top part can just slide down into the bottom part.When you order the AKRON APGN-VSM you get both parts


The ball snaps into the Garmin supplied powered mount perfectly and the supplied suction cup is not used.The bottom part (with the screw holes) is designed for screw on mounting
I did not want to do that so I filled the hollow area on the reverse with epoxy to create a FLAT bottom
Be sure to let the epoxy dry overnight and sand to a FLAT bottom surface.Then it's a simple matter to use double sided sticky tape - eg: "Power grab on a roll" to just press the bottom part of the mount to the dashboard


Be SURE the retaining hooks point UP so the top part can just "slide from above" into the bottom


Let the double sided tape "cure" for 24 hours prior to using


Use alcohol to clean the area prior to installing


Then cover the epoxy with 2 strips (side by side) of the double sided sticky tape (Power grab on a roll).It takes exactly half a second to install or remove the "top part" when it is installed (via the snap ball) into the factory powered garmin cradle

If the road is VERY VERY bumpy use the tension of a rubber band to "pull down" (just a little) on the Garmin powered speaker to stop it from bouncing out
But, I almost never have to use the rubber band.I was only able to find a flat area on the upper left of my honda civic's radio area to have the tape hold about 2/3 attached but that has proven more than adequate.The "bottom part" is almost invisible and really looks like "nothing at all" and if you pull slowly and carefully the tape I used will come off without any marks - but I can't guarantee you will have the same results.

I found this item on Amazon and it seemed to be the one people liked, overall, the best.  For roughly $13 it is AMAZING to me what this little cylinder does.  3 AAA batteries later, I have a device which is unbelievably compact and portable, which, when coupled with my iPhone, is MORE than adequate for a large living room full of people to hear, VERY CLEARLY, what I am playing for them.Look, this little speaker isn't going to power a disco dance floor or music for a wedding reception, but if you need something to be able to hear your content from any sort of portable player, you won't be disappointed in the least by this little powerhouse.  I must also add that to me, its tonal quality, absent much bass (hey, what can you really expect from a 2" driver?!), is superb overall in view of its dimunutive stature.For what it is, you can't go wrong.  Just order it!

$REVIEW.: This product is a really cheap buy, I used to own a few cheap iPod nano knock off MP4 players back when the iPod video came out and wrote a top 100 guide for them on ebay back in the day

I bought this expecting to get a similar product but boy was I wrong.Lets start off with the design

It is shaped like an iPod shuffle but boasts a touchscreen with an AM radio and video playback

The constuction is bottom grade
It makes those Mp4 players I used to own look like like top of the line products


It uses low quality plastics and it looks like it was designed in a hurry

The metal portion of the player is low grade aluminum but is sturdy enough for normal use
The touchscreen is less then usable

The touch layer sits too high off of the display and you have to do finger smashing to get it to register


The display has poor color reproduction and is such a low resolution that watching videos on this is little more then a novelty trick.SoftwareThe interface is severely limited

The arrows do not do anything, it's a cheap trick to make you think it does more then it really does

It says it supports folder browsing to organize your music but only makes a list of all the songs on the device with no folder browsing

The radio does ok but it does not pick up radio stations very well


for a 1.8 inch screen it should have enough space to browse your music with no problem, but the resolution is so low that you cannot even read half of the song names.Audio - The audio amplifier is so low powered that even at maxed out volume the audio can barely comfortably be heard in a slightly noisy place like a gym


The signal is dirty as well


As mentioned the Audio player does not even allow folder browsing
It just loads a single list of all the songs onboard.This product is little more then a scam using outright lies to get you to fork over some cash


If you want an overglorified iPod shuffle then you should be happy with this product, otherwise if you are looking for a feature rich device at a steal of a price then you can do way way better for about 10$ more
I would give it a little higher reguards if the touchscreen wasnt an absolute pain to use


The only person I would consider giving this to would be a young child looking for a toy to play music and videos, that is if they can muster up the strength to press the touchscreen.

$review_text.: I had been looking for a small home theatre system that did not require wires spider-webbing themselves under carpets, through the walls, and into the basement.  In considering a few 2.1 options, I really liked the Denons (S-101 and S-301), but the prices were -- and still are -- ridiculous.  However, in my research, I came across the Sherwood system.  I have had the Sherwood VR-670 for nearly a year, and the DVD player component is not operating properly.  Inexplicably, the drawer will not open after several attempts, then mysteriously opens.  The system has caused stops/starts in every DVD I have used in the last several weeks.  And, trying to reach service or technical assistance is nearly impossible.

$REVIEW.: All I can say it WOW!This is the most responsive keyboard I have used on an Ipad!It is so easy to use, that instructions are not necessary! Setting up the Bluetooth is extremely easy, and the iPad recognizes it within seconds!Not only is it extremely easy to use, but the special keys that it has make it so easy to use without actually touching the iPad screen!The key I love the most is the wake up/sleep key, I find myself using that key a lot!It also has EXTREMELY CONVENIENT keys which include brightness control, volume, itunes play buttons, copy/ paste, physical keyboards, and even search!The price is worth every cent just for the keyboard itself!The case is also very nice, its a hard plastic shell, protects it all around!The tilting is amazing for a school setting!The New Trent keyboard case is THE BEST COMPANION for college students!What I did not like, is that if you have it in a 45 degree angle, and if its vertical, the ipad will outweight the case and cause it to fall, I am not sure how if this is fixable but if it could be fix this would be simply perfect all the way

I use my Ipad in horizontal mode so this does not bother me at all.Pro Tip: If you keep the soft rubber cover that is on top of the keys when you first open it, it will help reduce the keys noise! This is helpful when there is just too much to type and you are in a classroom.New Trent simply got the best keyboard in the market!

$review_text.: My green Amzer case arrived today and as expected the color is a bit lighter than pictured. That's OK though because its a crappy picture! I had already purchased the red case which is slightly lighter, but still a very acceptable red. There is no variance in fit or quality with the Amzer TPU cases, a trait that is common among cases in this price range. The green case looks great and fits perfectly with my Tech Armor screen protector. I absolutely love the Amzer's recessed power and volume buttons. They feel as if they're not even there, yet are very accessible and work perfectly. This only adds to the super smooth gel feel of the case, while not sacrificing grip. I could do without the lanyard holes, but I can't say they stand out to where they bother me.Simple/Cheap/Protective/Stylish Accessorizationalism!

$review_text.: The video quality is truly amazing on this device.  I cannot give it full marks as I have been unable to get the software for the PC to function as advertised and the device is rather bulky on the windshield.  I have been unable to contact the support people for this product as yet.  Remember to purchase a class 6 or greater micro chip as it does not come with any memory.  It would also be a good idea to purchase a spare power cord AC for setting it up using a TV or other video screen.  The only other option is using the USB cable for power or discombobulating your car wire set up every time you want to play with the settings.  (things they don't tell you in the sales material).  Its also like having a cop riding along with you when you are consious of it running.  Rolling through stop signs, speeding and running amber lights just ups the guilt level with big brother in the car. It has a quality feel to it and does not miss a thing including your comments of other drivers (it also catches all your wifes backseat driving comments :-)).  It is also hard to believe all the technology that can be built into such a small device.  USB, HDMI, GPS, high res camera, laser pointer, mute switch, remote control sensor, DC input, etc.  And it all works every time!  Would I recommend it? - absolutly!

$review_text.: What can I say? This is a brilliant product, super affordable and extremely flexible. Literally! I've replaced my Canon-brand plastic hoods with the ones by Zeikos, and I've never looked back. You can keep these hoods on at all times, they collapse/expand in a second, and they provide good bump protection for your lens. I never enjoyed screwing/unscrewing the plastic hood; now I don't have to do it: if your camera fits in a bag, it will fit there also with the rubber hood on. And then there's the price. Oh the price! It's like a sweet music to my ears. In the world of photography, where you have to pay double digits for every tiny plastic implement, this cheap and very useful product really stands out. Highly recommended!

E-TTL works very well for off-centered subjects

High speed sync works for all shutter speed from 1/125 to 1/4000s, making fill flash very easy
Also, 2nd curtain sync provides very creative control in night photographyThere's not a whole lot to say in a review about a flash
There are better flashes for more money and flashes with less features for less money


I bought this flash to replace the onboard flash of my Elan IIE
It greatly outperforms the flash on the camera body


Also, if you use larger diameter lenses like the Canon 28-135mm, the flash on the camera body is slightly obscured by the lens itself


The 380EX is an ideal mid level flash for the Canon EOS system


If you're trying to learn more about flash photography and want to experiment, you can't do much because it's totally automatic


The higher level model (420EX, 550EX) offer many for features for a price.Thanks for your time...

$REVIEW.: Must say I loved this TV though it pixelated during jumpshots and quick motion.  After reading reviews, I returned it for the Samsung LN46A550.  The pixelation was still evident but not as much.  The colors, clarity, and the remote are definitely better on the LN46A550.  The location of S-Video inputs, sound, and overall cosmetics is much better on the 4665f.  I probably would have been happy with either TV but stuck with the 46A550.  The biggest difference between the two is the sound.  The sound sucks on the 46A550 but was a non-issue for me since I have separate speakers.

$review_text.: I'm pretty critical when it comes to optics and many lenses that I have tried before did not pass muster, especially wide angle lenses (which have a much more challenging task than standard or telephoto lenses), but this one is in a class of its own.  It's not the fastest with F/2.8, but I doubt you can find a sharper one.  There is no noticeable (looking at 100% on monitor) corner or edge softness wide open on a crop body (have not used it on FF yet), which so far I have only experienced with telephoto L glass.  Same goes for coma.  Decent bokeh.  Blur circles show only slight distortion in corners and stay fairly smooth and round when stopping down.  So I give the optics a 10/10.Mechanically it seems fine.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It is pretty tight but materials are on the same level as the much cheaper 40mm F/2.8 STM.  However, that should be sufficient for most uses.  Manual focus ring is precise but does not have the smoothest feel.  Altogether a 6/10.I have not much experience with image stabilization as this is my only lens with IS (I briefly owned the 24-105 IS Zoom, which is my only comparison).  I have never missed IS so far even shooting with a 400mm on a crop body, but after a few test shots handheld at 1/8 sec I might change my mind. It allowed me to take some nice handheld closeups in low light that I would not have attempted without a tripod previously. I find it much more effective than the IS on the 24-105 zoom.  Autofocus is on par with any other USM lens I have used but struggles just a little in low light.  I'd give it a 8/10 here.In summary, a great lens that feels good on the camera and will get plenty of use.  A little pricey but for close to perfect optics still a good value ((really good value with current sales going on).

Maybe because I've used a lot of Canon digitals, I'm used to the controls and menus, but I do find them pretty simple and easy.  I like the iso/burst mode and other controls handy on the backadn also the larger screen is a nice.  I also looked at the Nikon D40, but thought the 10mp vs 6mp could be handy at times (MP is not everything, but with a large enough card, it can't hurt either).  Buy a big memory card because you'll want to shoot a lot!  Quality is first rate and Canons other lenses work perfectly with it.

After buying this dock, my speeds shot straight up to around 110+ mb/s transfer on average depending on file sizes and such. But it sure did make a HUGE difference! Not only that, but I use this drive as my secondary drive since I have a SSD as my primary. I keep all my programs on my SSD and leave all media and such on this drive. Not only is this drive faster now, but with USB 3.0's 5gbps speed... I am able to store my steam games on the drive and play them with ease so I can leave more space on my SSD.Note: Steam allows you to have multiple locations for your games. So I have my most played games on my SSD and other games on the external. Games that also have long load times (like Skyrim) I also keep in the SSD.

Even placed on top of the kitchen cabinets and turned all the way up, they put out crisp, clear sound that is well balanced. Both the high and low ends are well handled by these speakers, yet they are considerably smaller than other desktop speakers we own. Unfortunately for laptop owners, these are not USB powered, making them a less convenient choice, but they are an excellent option for desktop users, or those who generally set up their laptop in a setting near an outlet.

This device is specifically designed for the individual, like myself, who had their iPod sitting on the seat next to them or on the dashboard, connected to their stereo via an auxiliary input orcassette adapter. So contrary to some reviews, an aux-in on your car stereo is not mandatory for use, making this device usable in older cars with a tape deck and newer cars with the aux-in port.In my mind, the primary benefits of using the liquidAUX instead of simply manually controlling your iPod while in the car are two-fold: 1) Safety, 2) Ease of use.Safety: I consider myself a pretty competent multi-tasking driver, but even still anything that keeps my hands on the steering wheel and my eyes on the road has to keep me safer. My wife has pointed out that I swerve a little less and keep a more consistent speed - signs of not being distracted - since using this device.Ease of use: The liquidAUX wireless remote that is mounted on the steering wheel has four buttons: Play, back, forward, and shuffle. The first three are obvious and any remote would be lacking without it; but the fourth, shuffle, is my favorite. In the car, I love to use shuffle to listen to random songs from either my entire collection or one of my playlists. Often I find myself reminded of an album that I love or haven't heard in a while. I wish I could take shuffle off and finish the album. To do that on the iPod, I would have to go into the settings menu, then take shuffle off (at least five seconds with my eyes on the iPod and not on the road). That's what the shuffle button does with one click. If you get to an album you want to keep listening to, hit that button, and you will continue on that album or artist. Then when you're sick of it and want the shuffling to continue, hit the button again, and off you continue on random again. All of this without even touching your iPod. So the LiquidAUX provides safety and convenience. Of course, you are still able to control your iPod the "old-fashioned way" while connected to the LiquidAUX...just make sure you do it at a red light ;-).The box comes with a charger device that connects from the cigarette lighter (DC Power) to your compatible iPod (basically everything but a shuffle) or iPhone. There is a small wireless remote control (battery included) that mounts to your steering wheel for easy ability to control your iPod without being distracted from driving. Finally, the charger device has a 3.5mm output to connect to your cars auxiliary in (an extension is included in case your aux-in is further than a few inches from your cigarette lighter.My car does not have an aux-in so I was concerned that I would not be able to use this device. But the headphone jack on the iPod still outputs audio even while under the control of the LiquidAUX, so I am able to connect to my stereo using a cassette tape adapter. This does make for quite a few wires, however: 1) From charger to iPod, 2) charger to aux-in port, 3) iPod to cassette-adapter (only if you don't have aux-in on stereo). This would be my number one foreseeable complaint. But these are also features that make the LiquidAUX not confined to a single car. Take it with you in a rental car on vacation, use it in  a friend's car on a road trip, or swap it between your vehicles. I could not be happier with the LiquidAUX; it is engineered excellently to do that for which it was designed.
$SUMMARY.: Easy to Use & Adds Safety Flexible and Customizable Design. Better Than I Expected!

$review_text.: Ear buds kill my ears. I can wear them for a while but will suddenly be compelled to jerk them out and vigorously dig in my ears. They are just too irritating for me to use for more than an hour. My brother in law is on the phone all day and recommended these. I haven't been sorry I got them. The silicon pieces that hold them in place are not intrusive at all. I've worn these on ten hour flights with no discomfort. The Marine Corps ruined my ears as far as hearing high fidelity, so I can't comment on the audio quality, but they sound wonderful to me. After using them for a while, I bought these for both my sons and they use them all the time too. One is a music purist and he says the comfort and fidelity are great.

I have a 42-inch TV that weighs around 22 pounds on it. In retrospect, I wish I'd gotten a stationary one. The company did a good job building the thing though, very solid materials, etc. If you plan on moving the TV much, I'd avoid it though.

$review_text.: I don't think the picture really does a justice to show how ugly that green/aqua blue strip down the middle and along the border of this case really is. I would HIGHLY suggest getting this case, but in a different color. I spent about 45 min yesterday coloring over it with a black permanent marker because I would not want to be seen with this case as a 22yr old guy at a college. Am I blowing this out of proportion, maybe, maybe most guys will be comfortable carrying this around but honestly I can't see a guy or girl wanting this color, it just looks weird.Pro's:Case is stretchy yet a good fit for my samsung nc10.USB Mini mouse and USB hub look and work great.Seems at least water resistant which although I'm not particularly clumsy is still a plus.Con's:Really all I can say is that the color is just terrible. If they would have just done a green or blue it would have been fine. But this is just some kind of aqua blue that I've never seen anyone have on their person, on a backpack or really on anything you would carry with you or wear.Conclusion, great case bundle. Bad color.

The recharge cycle is pretty good even at max power. The plastic its made of feels  and looks resistant and nice. Its really easy to use. The led screen is really useful when shooting at dark places. If you are planning to use it remotely you should now it has a built-in transceiver. If you have a pair of youngnuos' wireless tranceiver/trigger you will need only one for the camera that way you can use the other one for a non wireless speedlight and have two remote speedlights.  For the price i paid it was a really great purchase. Totally recommend it.

$review_text.: I just Bought Two of these gems. As mentioned... great case, good color temp perhaps a bit too much cyan in the blue range. Diffuser card could be better with shadows, but for the money cant do better... I have more expensive 1x1 litepanels, 2 Vidpro units and 2 mini litepanel fixtures, this one at 100% is as bright or brighter than any of them.Build: One of my 1x1 litepanels took a fall from the top of a light stand flat on its face and kept on shinning... this little guy is a Decent build but as mentioned, don't drop it, esp down a mine shaft. Light dimming, it does a good job from 10% - 100%. Batteries are the Sony (NP-F570) style which I have many. The chargers are well built and have led meters showing charge rate. The light has a led battery meter showing charge left and a sheet for approx running time...So why 4 stars you ask - -  Where is the CTO card.. ???  I mean even a full CTO is better than NONE!!

$review_text.: I didn't really use it for anything else, I just recorded my calculus lectures (with my professors permission) for a few hours two to three days every week. If you start recording video and then close the screen, the battery it comes with can record a 3 hour lecture and still have half a battery charge left. The video quality was sufficient to see the blackboard from about 10 to 20 feet- ish away, and the microphone, so long as the room is *mostly* quiet, will pick up everything you need to hear. A bit expensive, but completely worth being able to study from the actual lecture.

$REVIEW.: It also somehow corrupted the system restore database.  Installation is two part, the wireless part UI does not even start right. I have to configure that on XP system. Using the method on the Linksys system to configure the wireless found out the WEP method it support using different key length than our wireless AP -- which is not made by Linksys. By the WEP standard, the WEP-64 key length is 13, and WEP-128 key length is 26. This Linksys printer server using WEP-64 max key length 10! We already have the access point programed with max WEP64 key length 13, so this device will not work, unless we re-program the access point and all the devices and notebook communicate with the AP. Why Linksys does not allow the max length the standard specified?Second part installation is the printer server driver installation, which hang at 99% compeletion on Vista.  After reboot the system, it shows the driver installed, but it does not work with a failure sign on the driver on Vista.Try to remove the partial install by run Vista System Restore to get rid of the Linksys driver to the OS change. However, the system restore can not run successfully, this Linksys installation corrupted the system restore database!Can not believe After a year Vista release, Linksys still making device that is not Vista compatible!

$review_text.: I just got my Nuvi 360 and I must say it deserves the high reviews it is getting.  This is one of the first pieces of electronics gear I have picked up in a long time that is intuitive to use and is well engineered. Mine came with the most current maps and firmware already loaded.The only criticism I can find in the short time I have been using this are these: and they are minor considering the current price.#1. Even though the maps are the most current level - in the new area I live in NW of Des Moines, it doesn't know a lot of the newer streets.  Not a big deal as I know where I'm going here.  This is a problem with all GPS software - the maps are always behind the roads being built.#2. The speaker distorts a bit on it's highest level.  I realize it is a very small speaker - but for the most part it works good for it's size.#3. I agree that the Bluetooth could use some improvement.  It does sound scratchy and people on the other end constantly hear an echo.  Once again this isn't a deal breaker for me.  Since this was only a couple of bucks more than the 350 model - I consider it icing on the cake.#4. I agree a QWERTY keyboard for input would be a much better input device. Once again, not a big deal, but I'm surprised they didn't go this route.#5. I would like to see the ability to reorder your phone list by last name instead of first name in the Blue Tooth software.#6. Getting at some menu items should be quicker.  Sometimes you have to go through 3-4 menu items to find what you are looking for.  An example of this is seeing how long a trip is by mileage.#7. I'd like to have the option of setting more than one way point.  I know this is on the newer 700 series models now.For the money this thing is selling for now - it's a steal. I can live with the small faults it has for the low price it is currently selling for.  I'm most amazed at how well this thing locks onto the Sattelites.I was locked from the inside middle of my home!Some people have complained about the build quality.  I think it is very well built and the size is just right.  I wouldn't want it any bigger.  I'm impressed with the extras it comes with including a carrying case, AC  + DC adapters, and multiple mounting kits.  The picture viewer and audio book capabilities are very nice and you get two free downloads within the first month.Bravo Garmin for a very well engineered and easy to use product.

$review_text.: The first device I had, kept disconnecting green light steady even though it had a good signal it wasn't receiving it.  Returned that device to Walmart the next day.The replacement worked albeit slowly for about a month and a half.  Then I started getting intermittent flashing red lights after it charged.  Re-seating the battery always fixed it, until one day it started flashing 7 times then turning itself off.Now the story of Virgin Mobile begins...They sent me a replacement device.  I got it a week later (after a FedEX mix-up).  This device was activated to someone else's account and could not be activated to me.  They sent me another and a few days later I received...AN EMPTY envelope, with a return envelope (not big enough to return the device and charger).  Their response was that they had to investigate why I received an empty envelope and not a device.  This will take 3-5 days, now it has been 10 days and I have not heard from them.  When I called back all they can say is that it is still an open ticket.  Then they say it might be out of stock and it will take 3-5 days.  I can't get a straight story.  This reminds me of the Roseanne episode where she sent in her bills with no check or one's made out to another company.The worse part is, despite the slowness and the fact that it doesn't always catch a phone signal indoors. It has been invaluable to me.  I use it with my laptop and ipod touch and it has made my life better.8-11 Added 2 stars.  After all the troubles last winter, I think I had 4 or 5 replacements, (later found out some of the trouble is due to poor charging cords).  I finally have a device that works and has worked for a few months.  It is slow, but absolutely a wonderful device and service is much cheaper than Verizon.

$REVIEW.: I bought these cards primarily for the gray neutral tone card.  The cards seem very durable (the exact same size as a credit card, but almost twice as thick).  The only part I wasn't crazy about is how thick the lanyard is -- it could have been a much thinner lanyard.  I replaced mine with one that I had gotten from a trade show (or somewhere else), that also has a quick-release.  The quick-release is nice, but I find it easier to just pull the entire lanyard out over my head.I understand this can be used for both video and photography.  I use if for photography, and here's why I think this is a must-have for anyone who takes photography a bit more serious...Unlike the human eye, cameras don't automatically "neutralize" the to lighting in the environment.  That's why cameras usually have those lighting mode options (incandescent, fluorescent, cloudy, etc.) -- it's to help the camera shift the color tone to try to neutralize the color cast from the light (e.g., fluorescent emits a greenish light, while incandescent emits a yellowish light).  The "Auto" feature also just tries to guess at the color casting by trying to find something neutral in the image.If you're an intermediate or advanced photographer, you'll probably want to shoot in RAW format because you can do A LOT more adjusting in post-processing.  RAW images capture the light as the camera sees it, no processing added (so they often look even worse at first than JPEG images do).  RAW requires that post-processing software make the adjustments to white balance, and so on.  That's where this awesome little card comes in...  The neutral gray card is used to tell the post-processing software what a neutral color looks like with the given lighting conditions.So, how do you use it?  While taking shots out in the field (or studio), whenever lighting conditions change (e.g., going from indoors to outdoors, using a flash vs. no flash, sunlight to shade, etc.), take a photo of the gray card in the light (just hold it out a foot or two in front of the lens, and SNAP!  (it doesn't even have to be in focus)  Later, after uploading the RAW images into your software, use the eyedropper for the white balance (or whatever your software has) to set the white balance to the gray card -- yes, set the "white" balance using the "gray" card ("white balance" is kind of a misnomer for photography -- it should actually be "neutral balance").  Then copy the white balance settings from that photo to all other photos shot in the same lighting conditions.  This will cause skin tones, etc. to be set properly without needing to fuss with the temperature and tint settings.Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: When I received this speaker I was very suprised by its size. From pictures I thought it was a small hollow plastic "toy" speaker made to look like a stage speaker to use with music games but it's actually a good size with heft. For reference it's about the size of a small subwoofer enclosure with dimensions around 12x10x10. The build quality of this thing is quite high. It has a solid feel to it as opposed to being hollow. The corners on the casing are protected by rubber blocks. There is also a built-in handle which is very useful for transport since many people may not always want it cluttering up their entertainment area all the time.This is basically a 2-way speaker that could operate in mono or stereo mode. When in mono mode you could switch it to output the Left channel or Right channel, while in stereo it mixes the L/R channels together. The mono mode is very useful because it allows you to use two of these speakers each handling a separate L or R channel. The unit has standard RCA audio inputs as well as outputs. The audio outputs allow you to daisy chain more of these speakers so you're not limited to just 1 or 2 speakers. The amplifier is built-in and is rated 40W RMS. As mentioned it's a 2-way speaker with a 1" silk horn tweeter and 6.5" paper mid-bass driver. The volume knob is nicely sized and when rotated is buttery smooth. There's also a built-in unswitched AC outlet so if you decide to add more speakers you'd only need one wall outlet since you could daisy chain the rest. When on, the orange LED lights up to let you know there is power which is quite useful for those days when you might forget to turn it off.As for sound quality, it is very clear. Vocals are clear and highs are good due to the silk horn tweeter. Bass isn't very strong but reasonable while midbass is clear, this is probably because the cabinet is an acoustic suspension design. The unit is able to play fairly loud but a separate subwoofer is highly recommended if you plan on sending full bass loaded music to the speaker. This speaker could also replace a bookshelf sized speaker and since it has its own amplifier you don't have to worry about needing a separate receiver or amp. This speaker works well with game consoles as well as computers.
$SUMMARY.: Nice rugged amplified speaker for game consoles

$review_text.: The drive rails included are not even mentioned in the sparse instructions. They are plastic with plastic pins that are pushed into the screw holes in the drive to be used in this enclosure. They are so tight they are quite difficult to install. That part is still okay. However, if I ever decide to reuse the enclosure or re-purpose the drive, I can't imagine the pins won't just snap off in the holes making the rails useless to reuse and the drive unable to accept screws for another purpose. I imagine this is a cost savings but very short sighted.

$review_text.: I absolutely love the looks of this cover.  It looks like a slim, old-fashioned book, marbled paper with leather spine and corners.  It even has ridges on the spine like great old books used to have.  According to the product description, it is cloth, and the feel is luxurious and classy.What I like less is the lack of practicality of the design.  If I were to never take my Fire anywhere, it would work just fine.  The fabric on the inside is soft, and there is a pocket on the inside front cover.  I'm not so crazy about the 4 elastic loops that hold the Fire in place.  To me, they don't seem as secure as the design of my older cover.  There is no flap to keep the cover in place, although it does seem to be magnetized, and there is no loop for a pen or stylus.  So, since I do take my Kindle with me, I am not comfortable with how secure my Fire would be in a purse or bag.While the product description on Amazon lists this cover as one for the Fire, the packaging says it also works for the Kindle Keyboard.  Not so, at least not on my old Kindle with keyboard.  I tried my old Kindle Keyboard in it, and couldn't even get the elastic loops to fit around the corners.  The KK is much too large to be practical for this cover.  Perhaps someone else could make it work marginally, but I couldn't.  This isn't so much a problem for buyers on Amazon, where the description doesn't mention use for the Keyboard, but for someone shopping in a brick and mortar store and trusting what the packaging states, this would be a real issue.Edit:  It is hard to keep up with the variously named versions of the Kindle.  Apparently, my old Kindle with keyboard is a Kindle 2.  The Kindle 3, a kindle with a keyboard, is now called the Kindle Keyboard.  So perhaps this cover will fit the Kindle 3, renamed Kindle Keyboard, but not necessarily Kindles with keyboards, as with my Gen2 Kindle.  Confusing, isn't it?I am in love with the looks of this cover but it just isn't the right one for me and for the way I use my Fire,So, despite the gorgeous looks, I don't like the impractical design for anyone who takes their Fire anywhere.  Five stars for looks, 3 for design equals a 4-star rating overall.

$REVIEW.: Both large and small IDE/PATA connectors fit drives very well, and allow decent transfer rates when connected via USB 2.0


The indicator light is helpful to gauge activity, and the inclusion of a power adapter for both molex and Sata is a great convenience


Build quality on the data connector is acceptable, while the power adapter is solid, but lighter than expected.Windows 7 takes more time than usual to mount drives connected through this, but once mounted, reading/writing is reliable

I'd recommend this over any cheap IDE enclosure for a hard drive, out of sheer convenience, superior build quality to other cheap alternatives, and multinational support.

On most of my devices I tend to go with clear because I don't want to pay a lot of money for a really good screen and then put something over it that makes it slightly hazy. There are times when dealing with glare is more important, though, so I gave this a chance.It does add a bit of a haze. It's nothing intolerable or outlandish, though.These are much tougher to get on cleanly than the more premium brands like ArmorSuit that use liquid to help you get the protector in place. On the other hand, those give you one shot and this puts 3 in the package, so it kind of makes up the difference.These pretty much do what you expect. They don't perform any miracles, but they don't fall flat either.

$review_text.: This unit works very well
 I wish it acquired its satellites a little more quickly


 I may drive a block or more before it can plot a route

 I have learned to turn the unit "on" first thing before I put on my seat belt, etc
so it is ready more quickly
 Naturally, the route it chooses is not always the one I would have chosen
 I read the manual, but do not remember that it told me I can push the thumb wheel once at any location for a couple of seconds and it catalogs that location
 I can give the location a name

 It is easy to learn to use
 Practice makes perfect and helps me to appreciate it even more
 My wife is not very technical, but used it in a city she knows somewhat

 The Garmin allowed her to find several places so well that she got more accomplished in the time she had than she could have any other way
 We found restaurants and florists by using the option to locate other businesses nearby our destination, even though we were yet many miles from that city

 When we programmed our home location from over 300 miles away I expected the mileage display to give the distance to our home, but it gives the distance to the next merger with a second interstate highway
 The time of arrival estimation  is unbelievably accurate.Once in a while the programming can be frustrating


 For example, if you tried to program a city name and the city is not recognized by the Garmin, you might try to program the intersection of two highways near or in that city

 Or, drive in the general direction of the city and it will appear in the list of available cities once you are nearer


 Once you enter a state, the Garmin has a one track mind and asks you for a city rather than for the first of the two streets or roads in the intersection


 I have had to turn the Garmin "off" and wait

 Even then this is not guaranteed to work.Use the back arrow to go to another screen without interfering with the navigation
 Push the back arrow again to get to the visual for the navigation.I should also say this is the first GPS unit I have owned.

Then realised, I will be in the water alot and quite possibly would need some juice for my cell and GoPro.As a long standing customer of New Trent, I didnt hesitate to get the ruggedised version of their charger. Held up well going down the rapids, zero issues while charging.I use the galaxy s4 as well as GoPro for that trip. When it was done charging my phone for the 2nd time it only lost 25% of capacity.Highly recommend.

$review_text.: LOOKS:The Leviton In-Ceiling Loudspeakers are good-looking and easy to install. I was happy about the color, as white speakers are exactly what many interiors need and it seems more manufacturers are starting to figure this out.SOUND:These speakers carry a very good sound range from upper bass into the high treble range. But that's where they stopped being exciting for me. They have almost zero bass/lower register sound at all. Don't rely on these speakers for full-spectrum sound, you will be disappointed and will need a woofer somewhere in the loop.PRICE:For the money, these would be good speakers to add to a system that already has a woofer incorporated. Similar-sized speakers at this quality level are usually cheaper, however, and a quick check on Amazon would reveal that there are many 6.5 inch speakers for less. The problem is that you'll be hard pressed to find them ready to install into a ceiling, be the correct color (or paint-able as these are) and be 2-way speakers. So, buyer beware.I'd recommend these speakers to those who are not audiophiles or extremely picky about sound quality. For an everyday system, they are a good buy.

After you apply it, you'll find several air bubbles. Don't despair! Try to work out as much as you can and then wait. The rest will eventually take care of themselves. When you clean, take a barely damp rag and rub across the screen when the tablet is off. Rub dry immediately and it'll be as clean as new.  I'd definitely buy this item again.

$review_text.: bought this for my mom to have a small, portable, light, inexpensive tablet to have vacation pics & videos handy for viewing.  I set it up for her & have messed with it off & on for a few weeks now.  Overall, if you are just looking for a very good, basic multi-media player(mp3s, videos, pics, e-books), this gets the job done as advertised.the good...*  good screen(box says display is 800x480 with 1080p output via hdmi), seems durable.  i'm used to touchscreens so many times i've absent-mindedly touched the screen to get it to do something.  it has held up well despite my bone-headedness.*  mp3s & pics play well, no problem.  plays videos continuously, no need to start & re-start.  plays multi-video formats out of the box.  some high-end tablets cant/wont even do that.  e-book reader and fm-tuner options as well(haven't used either extensively to be honest)*  haven't tested the hdmi-to-tv option yet, but it includes an hdmi cable for it(along with a usb cable, power adapter, protective pouch, stereo earphones, and a remote).  instruction booklet included is thicker than the 1-sheet instructions for the big tablets.*  multiple useful features: micro sd card slot for expandable memory(box says max 16gb support), hdmi out, video out, usb port for easy "drag & drop" to your device.the 'iffy'...-  unintuitive controls.  not difficult or complicated, just unintuitive.  but you should be able to get used to them.-  mp3s displayed by title(and features album art and basic visualizer), pics show up as pics, but videos are just listed with no indication of which is which.  maybe there is a way to name them or better identify them but i havent figured it out.-  battery life is only a few hrs or so for heavy video use.  in fairness, it charges pretty quickly and actually charges while usb connected as you're transferring stuff.-  amazon description says "gaming apps".  where?-  kinda thick, but very light in its defense.-  no internet, touchscreen, cameras, or apps.  not really a con at all, just clarifying.(note: i bought mine used/like new on amazon from warehouse deals for $68+free shipping. got it in a week.  done business with them before and will do so in the future.  the coby 4gb 7" multimedia tablet and 'warehouse deals' vendor both recommended)

$review_text.: Apple's commercials never actually show anyone typing on the iPad screen to input data

That's because using the on-screen keyboard is awful


The Logitech keyboard cover connects via bluetooth


The battery lasts for weeks, and easily recharges via micro USB cable

The keyboard is small, but this is to be expected, given that it matches up to the iPad dimensions


When the iPad is placed in landscape mode, the keyboard's magnets connect to it in a very secure manner
When using the iPad in portrait mode, it's a bit less secure, but usable on a flat surface.The magnets connect securely to the iPad, and the magnets will turn the iPad off and on when opening and closing the keyboard against the iPad
It works well with my iPad 3


I don't have a later 2012 iPad (aka iPad 4) to test.I have a bit of trouble hitting the backspace key when typing
Otherwise, it makes a great notebook replacement


The iPad/keyboard combination only weigh a couple of pounds.I'd highly recommend it for the business traveler and road warrior.

$review_text.: This is probably the best timesaver a photographer using Pocket Wizards could buy. It works just as advertised giving you 6 f/stops of control over remote flashes. I use it with Canon 580II and it really does let me dial up each flash (up to 3 channels) independently. The only potential problem I can see is that the dials are fairly soft in the clicks. Meaning you can easily spin a dial if you brush it against your sleeve. Over time this may get looser - but I will expect warranty work if it does :-) Other than that, it locks on solid to the TT1 and permanently lives on my camera now.Being able to control individual flashes power when they are in locations you'd need a ladder for is great! I can change power depending on model and check the results after the shot without having to move away from the camera on a tripod.

Everything fits inside leaving the outside compartment for whatever else, for me that's usually a small digital camera and the camcorder manual.  The padded compartment separator is velcro'd in place so you can arrange it wherever you wish and that's what makes this work so well.  Shoulder strap's included. No wasted space.  This case works so well for this camera and accessories that it appears to be designed with the camcorder in mind. Great price too.

$review_text.: I know there are just too many reviews for this product but I believe anything that has many reviews is either something that is hyped up a lot and falls drastically below peoples expectation (Read a bad product with many bad reviews) OR a really good and balanced product that people would like to share their thoughts on and encourage other people to invest in and share a similar experience
Fortunately this falls in the latter Category

I wanted to share some of the good things and also give some points on areas where this will not deliver.Firstly, if you ignore the noise canceling feature of these Headphones and go on the quality of sound then these by themselves are one of the best headphones that I have heard

Some people in their review have complained about the lack of bass but I feel this is incorrect


The Bass was ample without it thumping and I feel that the sound was very balanced without the need for me to tweak any of the equalizer settings on the source (Flat - This is how the audio was recorded)

The highs were crisp and mids could be heard which is something a lot of high end headphones miss on
And I wont elaborate much on this and waste your time because there are many other reviews that have detailed the sound quality of these cans
Trust me sound is a very personal thing and it may sound right to you or may not and this is again true for any headphones that you get in the market these days

I am no Audiophile but these sound just right to me.I asked a few people what Noise Canceling means to them 4 out of 5 said that all outside noise should be canceled


So based on the specs of these headphones if the outside sound level is 100, 85 should be canceled out and only the 15% should be audible to them when using these
Show me a set that can do that and I am willing to shell out 10 times the price that I paid for these


No headphones in the world can do that
I would suggest to everyone to read how Noise Canceling really works and there are many articles on this some written for laymen and some quite technical (Wikipedia and How stuff works) and I will attempt to cut the technical out from this review
Noise Canceling works well with Low Frequency sounds but it does not work with High Frequency sounds or sound whose frequency changes constantly (Like people talking or Voice of any kind)
I put these to the test in front of an air-conditioning unit and in noise cancellation mode all I could hear was a very very low hum (Very negligible, almost silent)


When I turned off the noise cancellation I felt that the way these fit so snugly on my head that even with this feature off there was some kind of noise isolation but not to the degree when I had this feature on

I could still hear people talking though because the frequency of their voice is dependent on many other factors and this changes constantly
So in short the Active Noise Canceling circuitry cuts out the low frequency noise and the way they envelope your ears or sit on ur ears isolates the high Frequency


Audio Technica claims that these cut out 85% of ambient sounds and ambient is the keyword here as in most cases this refers to low to mid level frequencies


I believe that these really work in cutting out these sounds not 100% but certainly 75% to 85%
The real test will be on a flight and I will update this review if I feel these dont perform there.The build quality of the phones is excellent, they feel solid
The case that they come with is also well constructed and though it does take some real estate in my bag I feel reassured that my investment is very well protected

Some reviewers have mentioned that the left side just fell off in a few days and I dont see how that can happen
Maybe they got a bad piece to start with and my recommendation to them would be to get these from a reputed seller with a good return policy
But I would also tell these people to go ahead and give them another chance
With that said they are not as heavy as I expected them to be but be warned like any other over the Head Cans they need some getting used to and you might get tired or feel uncomfortable if you wear them for too long like on a long flight
90% of the headphones that I have bought have gone wrong on this front
The build quality could be anything from cheap plastic to a wire that after getting snagged on the desk has just snapped in the middle somewhere leading to one of the sides not working (Happened to my Shures and its one of the most irritating things that can happen to anyone)


These cans overcome these problems by providing a removable cable, similar to the Bose QC series


This feature in itself convinced me to get these headphones

I dont want to be spending 100 dollars or more on a set that stop functioning because of a bad cable or a cable gone wrong due to my mishandling

If these go wrong on the cable front throw the cable away and get another for less than a couple of dollars which makes buying these a 100 times more fulfilling.Like many other reviews I am not going to make this a deathmatch between the Bose and these
If you can afford the Bose then I would say go for them but at $99 you cant go wrong with these and if one does go bad you can buy three more sets for the price of one Bose QC3


These deliver what they promise.UPDATE: These work very well on a flight too


They killed all the engine noise when connected to an audio source and they killed about 80% of it in standalone noise cancelling mode


One thing to note is that they do become a tad uncomfortable when worn for 2 hours (As I did on the flight) but like I said before I think any over the head cans would be uncomfortable when worn for too long.

$review_text.: I did not realize that usb 3.0 is such a big deal. After i got this in the mail, I sat down with my motherboard specs to figure out which ports were 3.0. I plugged the hard drive in (I got the 2 tb in white) and transferred over 100 gigs of movies in under 5 minutes. For some reason it does take a little longer to transfer things if they are in sub-folders. I typically keep all my movies in one big folder, my bf keep his categorized. His took almost twice as long to transfer, and he had less on there. Still, 15 mins of transfer time for about 200 movies isn't bad.We got this because we typically watch movies on PS3, and we thought it would function like a normal USB flash drive. It does not. Our mistake.Ended up buying a monitor/audio cable to hook my computer straight to the TV. Works out pretty well.[...]

$REVIEW.: I have had no HDMI issues like some others have noted here.I changed out my Yamaha  RX-V675 for this receiver and it actuallysolved an HDMI issue I was having with the Yamaha. I have an Oppo BD-93 that always had problems with the signal setting up and recently a Windows tablet that was having very delayed responses to the video and audio over HDMI on the Yamaha. This receiver did not display any of those problemsStill getting used to the Audio setup though as it seems to auto setup pretty well and recognize the incoming signals without anytweaking. Which is weird for me since I am used to having to tweak things. Good example, my oppo plays DSD/SACD with bit stream out and it recognized and played the output in the correct format without any issue.Sound Calibration runs like most of these new receivers, still feel like these auto calibration units have problems getting the center channel right. So this might need some adjustment even after calibrationRemote works great. Unit has a &#34;Preview&#34; feature which will show other connected devices video in a small window and you can choose the input that way.Only caveat I would say is to pay attention to what HDMI connection you plug things into as this will help alot with the remotefunctioning as expected.

$REVIEW.: I was so looking forward to getting this bag. Case Logic bags are generally well made and while this one is well made it is far from a DSLR bag. My Nikon D300s barely fits let alone extra lens and accessories. The D300s is an average sized DSLR nothing small about it but definitely not the largest.When I think of a sling I think of convenience, a bag that I can carry on my back, side or front so that I can easily reach my camera. But if you watch their online video they only access it when it is lying on a table. Did they even try it out in the field?This is NOT a travel bag but one to take just your camera and a couple of small things for a few hours out in the field.It does not hang well more like dangling on the lower back with no waist straps to help support it.The flaps over the memory storage are a waste. I have no idea why bag mfrs even go to the trouble of putting memory slots in the bag. They aren't convenient.Most of us have pretty good sized tripods that aren't going to be carried by this thing.I store most of my equipment in a backpack: camera, 2 extra lenses, flashes, filters, etc. I also have a Kata Torso pack that will fit to the side or in front and will easily hold my camera and an extra lens or couple of flashes and batteries (unfortunately Amazon doesn't carry it any more).  With the Kata bag I can easily get to my camera not having to take off my backpack every time. But my Kata bag could use a couple of large pockets which is why I wanted this Case Logic.The bottom line: If your going out for a walk and want to take just your camera, wallet and cell phone this bag could work.  But if you are out to really take some photos this bag falls short.

$review_text.: Pluses: Great display (1080p). Really good audio/speakers. It's fairly quiet. It's not too heavy. It's fast. It's got surprisingly good battery life considering how dinky the battery is (about 2.5 hours for what I do). It's got four RAM slots and two are open.Minuses: USB3 is not working well. DVD drive is not blu-ray (you can get blu-ray on the Core i-5 model, but why not this one?). The power supply is big - my Lenovo i7 at work is maybe 2/3 the size. The keyboard is mediocre (lacks backlight, flexes in the middle, does not give enough tactile sense to differentiate the num pad vs. the rest of the keyboard). It's got an odd assortment of crapware some of which is not clear if you uninstall you'll be missing something useful or hardware specific.I was aware of the minuses except for the USB3 not working and would have rated it four stars. I rate it three stars due to the USB3 issue. When I hook up my WD external hard drive (WDBACX0010BBK-NESN), the ASUS will recognize it briefly then disconnect. The WD works OK on the USB2 ports, and USB2 devices work OK on the USB3 port. I cannot find any firmware updates to fix this.Upgrading the RAM is not hard once you figure out how to get to the RAM slots. The rubber feet need to be pried up to expose the screws beneath. With patience, than can be pried up 1/2 way to make it easy to put them back down. When the screws are out, nudge the bottom cover forward with your fingernails and you'll see the RAM slots and drive bay.I have no buyer's remorse, but think a three star rating is fair given the pluses/minues/price.

$REVIEW.: I have a 64&#34; TV, in which I set up one strip on each back side of the TV (4 Total).  It allows for great ambiance and isn't too bright (I've heard the whites are a lot brighter, so maybe just 1 would do in that case).  My only complaint would be while I enjoy the lighting in all it's beauty, it sometimes gets ruined by one of the strips coming off and then hangs down from the back of my TV.  It's difficult to apply any tape over it, as to not cover any of the LED's, so maybe clear shipping tape will do?  I also tried the Velcro tape as to be less permanent so it wouldn't leave residue behind my television, but the tape on the back of the strips would not stick to those either.  Great lights, just going to have to find your own solution to get them to stick

 Recharged it full, as suggested on the internet.Being 12 cell, it does last quite a lot longer, about 4 hours on my 1st try

 The original 6 cell battery, about 3 years old now, is lasting about an hour before needing to be recharged

 Very, very resonably priced compared to HP OE battery

$REVIEW.: My selection of the Panasonic Viera TC-L32C3, was primarily based on the reviews of others who had previously purchased the TV.  After a couple of weeks of use, I am very happy with the TV's performance.  Probably my only gripe has nothing to do with the TV, but the inability to operate the set, DVD and Cable from one controller.  The only other issue might be the TV's picture size.  At 32", back in the day, this was huge.  Today, however, it seems somewhat small by comparison.  Just be sure you'll be happy with the 32" diagonal screen size.

But then it dawned on me one day, that I work 50 hours a week, my girlfriend is a med student, and I spend all my free time playing computer games....so cable was a huge waste of $50/month for maybe 2 hours of entertainment from it. If I sleep 7 hours a day, thats 17 waking hours x and avg. of 30 days per month, about 510 hours I could possibly watch television. If I watch TV for 2 of 510 hours every month...thats 0.3% of my month watching TV. If I would have done this 2 years ago, I would be $1200 richer. Every year this lasts, I save $600 -($35/# of years, for the cost.)I used to think there was never anything good on TV when I had cable...now there realllly isn't anything good on TV unless you like low budget PBS shows.

$review_text.: Overall, I must say I'm highly disappointed with this webcam, though it does have some good features that perform well.  Perhaps I got a lemon, but all I can do is judge what I have received, and if this is representative of the quality level of this unit, Creative really needs to take it back to the drawing board.The GOOD --*  The 4 noise-cancelling microphones (and integrated hardware and software to do this) perform admirably.  I have NO complaints on sound quality.*  The bundled "Live! Central 3" software performs well, gives one a good preview of what one is going to see, or what the other person will see on Skype, offers a fair number of useful "tweaks" to the image and sound, and it has performed without any negative incidents on my computer (see bottom of review for my computer specs).*  The mount design is fairly stable and sits nicely and steadily on either my 23" or 19" monitor.  Good configurability in the design.*  Seems to work seamlessly with Skype, though at a sub-par quality level for the optics (see below).The BAD --*  This is a TERRIBLY noisy, grainy camera.  Knowing a bit about optics (I'm a DSLR enthusiast with thousands of dollars of gear and about 3 years experience with two Nikon prosumer camera bodies and many pro-level lenses, I know and use Adobe Lightroom, DxO, and Photomatix, the latter for HDR work of course), I figured the problem was low-light noise on such a small camera since my current office for my business is in my basement -- I have two 75W lights just over my head, and I thought that might be too little illumination for that camera.  So, I brought in a 300W halogen torchiere to place next to my desk, and, if anything, the noise is far worse.  The optical noise is frankly nasty and completely unacceptable.*  Autofocus of poor quality as well.  It never seems quite IN focus, so I switched over to manual focus, using the slider in the bundled software, and I can't EVER get the image in focus.  And, no, I don't have "soft focus" turned on.  The optics just seem to be of VERY low quality.*  Zoom -- this feature is nice, though it does hunt around a bit to center on one's face, but the problem is that even though it's 1080P HD, the camera can't zoom out enough to take advantage of that resolution.  So, it's almost impossible to have the camera center on my face unless I place the camera way off-center on the monitor, and that's just silly because my face is a full 24-26 inches back from the camera.  In optical terms, there's just an unacceptably narrow Field of View.  I don't see how this camera could be of much use for home surveillance while away or for any videographic purpose.*  My testing even started out badly when I Plug-n-Prayed the camera, as instructed -- doing so disabled my keyboard drivers and made the keyboard inoperable.  Upon restart, my computer straightened that out, but it wasn't an auspicious beginning.*  Even on optimal quality (largest file size), the hardware and software compression render a completely useless (to me at least) image/video stream that's best described as "smudgy."My conclusion is that this camera is very poorly designed, with the exception of the audio quality, and I think there are MUCH better choices out there for much less money.My system -- Dell XPS8300 with Intel CORE i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz (3.80GHz Turbo), 12GB RAM, Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, ATI Radeon HD 5700, THX TruStudio Certified Sound Card,ViewSonic VX1940w 19" Wide 2ms High-Res 1680x1050 LCD Monitor - DVI, andViewSonic VP2365WB 23-Inch IPS LCD Monitor.

$review_text.: oh my...let me start by saying that if this contraption doesn't win the award for worst design of  an electronic  device, the judges should be shot!!!  I've been a network engineer and server administrator for over 10 years and this thing took me almost an hour to put together.  Easy-open enclosure?  Screwless case?  Forget it!!!  Let me elaborate.  First you need to unscrew the bottom but be care when you loosen the last screw, 'cus the case is gonna spring like an old clock, then the end fall off and parts are everywhere.  Next you install the drive.  If it's SATA, you'll be scratching your head over why they put the connectors on the wrong side of the board....Oh I figured it out, it's so you are forced to install the drive upside down causing the wires to be kinked.  So far, so good.  Now screw the disk to the case then slide the whole thing back into the outter cover, which is still sprung.  Here's the best part, cus it's so time consuming and good luck doing it without a C clamp to hold the thing shut while you try to line up and tighten all 4 screws.  I hope you like hand cramps.  I could solve rubiks cube in less time (seriously).  It is working fine, I must add, although it's only been an hour.  I just hope I never need to open it again to replace the drive.Here's an update...still running fine after two days.

 The speakers of the TV are pointed down and it seems since it is hanging on the wall the sound has nothing to bounce off of so it is very quiet


 I have to turn the volume up very high to get decent level
 If i put my hand under the speaker it seems to get louder
 So I would not recommend this TV if you are hanging it on a wall
 Also the TV only has 1 HDMI port (the description when I bought it said 2).

$REVIEW.: This is my first projector, so I cannot really give too technical of a review.  However, here are the things I've noticed in the short time I've had it so far...Like others have said, it's bright.  I can use it in the middle of the day with blinds open and see perfectly fine.  From what I understand, the image will gradually get dimmer the more hours it has, but for now it's superb.It's very easy to use.  I've never operated one before and was able to use it right out of the box.  Plugged it in, connected my ps3 or laptop, and turn it on.  It automatically detects everything without issue.The image can get quite large.  So far I've been using it to generate an image about 8 ft wide with a good picture.  The projector is 14ft away from the wall.  Definitely much larger than any LCD or Plasma!I purchased this projector for a short term relocation.  I didn't want to have to ship a TV and figured if I bought a projector I could take it home with me in a few months.  It's easily portable, and this one comes with a case (unlike some others.  I also looked at getting the Optoma hd66 which is in the same price range, and I don't believe it came with a case and the viewsonic had a few more features).I haven't used 3D yet since 3D glasses are still quite expensive, but one day I hope to try it.If the lamp lasts 4000-6000 hours, I will be perfectly satisfied.  That should give me several years of usage, and at that point it'll be time to upgrade anyways (technology flies these days)!  Or, I could replace the lamp, although I still haven't found any bulbs online yet.  I use ECO mode as well, and the difference in ECO mode and standard is hardly noticeable.  ECO mode is plenty bright enough.UPDATE: Be sure to check the contrast settings if you don't see a proper picture.  The contrast setting automatically switched to 0 for HDMI input somehow and I almost returned it thinking the jack had become defective (only saw blank screen).  I'm not sure why it changed, but be sure to check if the image seems off even if you didn't change anything yourself.
$SUMMARY.: First Projector is a Win!

They are packaged extremely well, have great build quality, and the sound is very good.But for me, even with the largest of the 3 ear flanges, they are not big enough to fit my ears with a good seal. The largest rubber tip is just a bit too small.I tried all sizes of the included rubber ear tips. I tried the smaller ones, and tried jamming them deep into my ears. They popped out right out.I tried the large ones, and had the same problem. They dont stay in.I was very disappointed. I really wanted these to fit me. I love the quality and sound of these. The look is great and the cord is thick and long.They even come with a leather case.Too bad the dont stay in my ears.Earphone manufacturers need to include a larger variety of eartip sizes for us big folks.
$SUMMARY.: They don't fit me well.

It gives you session info either outdoors or indoors, and combined with an ANT+ or Bluetooth 4.0 heart monitor and a foot pod, is the ultimate device for training.Sadly, it was discontinued. Hope Motorola makes a better replacement sometimes.PS: It runs on Android and can be hacked ;-)

$review_text.: I can't see a single way to make a better camera holster. Has exactly every single feature I wanted, well made, looks to be extremely durable. If it craps out in the future I'll update this, but I doubt it will.UPDATE: No problems with this bag, but after a full day of carrying it around in work conditions I realized that any case designed for any camera this heavy should be a backpack, not a shoulder sling. This will severely limit the use of this item. At this point I can't say how much use I'll get out of it. It NEEDS backpack straps. Reducing it to four stars. Looking for something similar with backpack straps.

It feels well balanced and looks aesthetically proportional on a D700
This is my mid range "zoom"


Why have a heavy mid range zoom when you can easily zoom with your feet.

$review_text.: This is the first Sony product that I've ever owned that I was truely disappointed with. Its DVD player makes a high pitched whirring noise when playing, and stops frequently during chapter changes. Also, if there is the tiniest of scratches or smudge on the DVD, it will skip, stop, or simply not play it. On the bright side, the VCR works perfectly. One other major gripe, if the power shuts off for half of a second, you'll need to reset the time which is a pain in the butt. I'm a Sony fan, but this one is a dud.

$review_text.: My old Tivo died after 3.5 years and it was time to upgrade to the latest and greatest from Tivo.I have to say that I loved this new Tivo HD.WHY TIVO?Why did I buy another one?- I already had the Tivo wireless broadband device- Frankly my wife and I got so used to the Tivo interface that everything else we tried at our neighbor's houses felt clunky and clumsy compared to the TIVO easy to use interface.- Literally, TIVO's interface is light years ahead of cable provider DVRs.  Once you try it, you'll fall in love.  It's so intuitive and easy to use.SETUP (COMPONENT AND HDMI OUTPUTS)Setup was really easy although I used component out on the HD unit so I could get HD to my TV.You can do Component or HDMI to your TV.  It was pretty easy to send the sound over to my Bose sound system and had everything working within about 30 minutes of the box arriving.TIVO EXPANSION:This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.I'm somewhat technical and I had a spare giant hard drive at home with an ESATA interface.  I plugged it into the back of this HD Tivo which is supposed to be expandable and Tivo told me that it was an unsupported drive and that it could not be used.  Basically, the folks at Tivo want me to buy their branded drive - I think that's a bit petty on their part.  There's zero reason why I shouldn't be able to plug in an aftermarket drive into my Tivo (it was possible with the older Tivos but not with this Tivo HD).On a plus side, this Tivo is expandable if you buy a Tivo brand expansion drive.  I'm sure it's easy to install and I'll likely be doing that pretty soon.CABLECARDS:I called my cable company and they came and installed two cablecards into my Tivo so that it can unscramble digital channels so I'm up and running on that.  So, two cable card slots on Tivo.WIRELESS BROADBAND:I use the broadband wireless router to get tv guide updates.  It works fantastic and very easy to set up.TIVO and NETFLIX:Oh my, this is a marriage made in heaven.  Basically, if you're a netflix subscriber and have the wireless broadband (which I do) you can stream movies to your Tivo.  It's amazing stuff.  You go to your netflix webpage and add movies you want to watch to your instant queue.  Then you go to your Tivo and click on what's showing and you get a netflix folder and all your movies from netflix's instand queue are there (netflix has something like 15,000 instant movies and that's growing every day).  You pick your movie and hit play and the movie starts playing within seconds.  you can fast forward, pause, rewind, and even exit and come back a day later and pick up where you left the movie off.  It's fantastic.  It's much better than movie channels, you pick what you want to watch when you want to watch and all for a flat monthly fee.  It's frankly amazing.  I love it.  This alone makes an upgrade to a new TIVO worth it.  Really, try it, you'll be in love.OVERALL:Tivo is fantastic.  Tivo HD is fantastic too. My only gripe is that Tivo should stop worrying so much about after market upgrades and modifications and instead embrace it's tech saavy Tivo loyalists out there by providing easy path upgrades for hard drives etc.  The more Tivo (the company) embraces its customers, the more we'll continue to embrace Tivo.Did I say I love TIVO?  I LOVE YOU TIVO!!!  I have no idea what watching television was like before this magic box showed up in my living room.  If you've never xperienced this - try it, you'll never go back to regular TV.

$review_text.: I'm not happy with this unit.  It is simply not user friendly.It was purchased primarily for streaming HD content to my 42in LCD.  There are huge delays related to using Netflix.  From the Panasonic home screen you have to press the Netflix button.  Once pressed it takes on average 45 seconds for Netflix to even boot up and for all the movie cover images to be loaded.  Compared to 1.5 seconds on my iMac and Safari.  Then once you begin to browse in Netflix there's a constant 3-4 second delay after every button press on the remote.  So browsing is slow, sluggish and challenging.  Once you've found the title to play you hit the "OK" button and another 5-7 seconds passes where nothing happens.  Did it get the signal?  Wait...  count to 5. Okay there it is!  Finally it starts buffering a show which takes about 15-30 seconds.  The show starts very pixelated and then in another 30-60 seconds it begins to clear up and become HD.The rest of the "network" features are a bit lacking as well.  Youtube videos are played back in a small window on screen and when you search with keywords it's almost like it sorts the order of results using a "lease relevant" filter.  It was almost impossible to find an official music video of a very famous musician that would otherwise be the first option pulled up if I were searching youtube.com in Safari or my iPhone.A side note my last speed test showed an average download speed of 20 mbps from my cable connection - so my connection isn't the issue.The other reason I bought this unit was of course for the Blu-Ray playback.  Picture and sound are great.  Really pristine.  Only trouble is that more than 30% of the discs I've played so far have hung somewhere, requiring restart of the film, waiting through government warnings again, fast forwarding through previews, going through the scenes and finding where you last left off.  The memory feature will start you back where you left off, but only if you stop the playback by turning the player off manually.Take the issues of delay and disc failure into account before you buy this.  Try as many different players out before you buy - especially if you plan on using the streaming features.

$review_text.: edit 11/25/2012. A couple of weeks ago I walked to the Bose retails store. I informed them of my issue and asked for a replacement. They asked no questions and I didn't need to insist. It was a very smooth replacement. They even allowed me to keep the ear buds. The replacement unit so far has been working great. I might have had purchased a defective unit initially. I increased the rating to 3 stars for the extreme ease of the exchange process. I will update again in few months if I do or do not encounter a similar or another issue.I will be very short here. There are tons of reviews about Bose headphones. They have AMAZING sound quality. I have several bose products and I love each and every one of them. But here is the issue. For what was supposed to be a rugged premium sports headphones those headphones are not rugged at all. I payed that $30 extra to have the microphone and the volume Pause/play controls that the IOS users enjoy. Less than one month the controls failed. I have no control over the volume and I can't pause or play from the headphones. I inspect the connecter and it is already rusting!!!!! This is an embarrassment! How am I supposed to trust the replacement. How am I supposed to trust that those headphones will last after the warranty expires. Those are supposed to be sweat resistant workout proof headphones.My advice is not to purchase those headsets until more reviews from people who already bought them and used them for a while become available.

$REVIEW.: [[18 May 2013 Update]]  I'm writing to check in and advise this router has failed.  It actually failed in March 2013, I'm only just now getting around to doing some check-ins.  I started having the typical issues I have with consumer grade routers, after about 2 years of use (I really put them through abnormal consumer usage), I see packet loss anomalies, and maybe have to go through and do power cycles on a regular basis to clean things up.Not so with this router's failure.  This thing failed in an EPIC way I've never seen before.  It actually took my cable modem with it, by back feeding some signal out of the wan port, corrupting my cable modem's boot file!  I discovered this the AM of the failure; I woke up, had no internet, left it be, called Comcast a couple hours after it not being up and asked what's up?  The tech said, I show no outages, I may have to send a tech out.  The tech then took me through the usual stuff of hook up a computer directly to modem, etc, and that didn't work.So the initial assumption was line issue.  He then did something I've never experienced, he said unplug it, I want to try and push a boot file, because the port I'm on (upstream) really shows I should have connection.  Wahlah - the modem came up, downloaded the boot file and directly connected to the modem I had intertubes. So then he said, hook your router back up, boom!  It corrupted it right in front of us.  Needless to say, this router is now taking the celestial dirt-nap in electronics heaven.I am not adjusting my stars on it, because truly for how I punish a router, it lasted about as long as I expected and performed very well during that time, regardless of the way it failed.[End Update]I ordered this to replace a dying D-Link DGL-4500, the fancy one with the pretty display on top.  In general, this wireless router takes many of it's queues from the D-Link DGL-4500 with regards to it's web GUI for set-up and control.  I found it pretty familiar and the language it uses similar or the same in some places, so I understood how to set it up in my "unique" home networking environment rather quickly.To give you a grasp of what the router has to handle for me, there are 3 additional switches, with 17 full time on devices and another 10 intermittent use (iPads, etc) that must acquire DHCP from this router across my home.  It is the heart of everything on the system and all internet traffic goes though it.  A 24-port 1gbps TrendNet TEG-240WS comes off this router, has various devices running off it, then another 8-port TrendNet switch piggybacks off that for our home theater room, and a vintage Linksys WRT54g wireless router with everything disabled so it merely functions as a WAP for some dead spot wireless network coverage and to act as a distant switch for more stuff in another media room.  I actually no longer have this dead spot with this new router, but still need the switch.So far, this router has been running since it was delivered, flawlessly.  It stays relatively cool, has not had any detectable latency, and I have not had to restart it once, post it's initial configuration.  I think TrendNet could do a little more web GUI interface refinement.  For example, the DHCP list of devices on your LAN do not have the device names listed with them.  This made it a bit of a pain to have it assign specific DHCP IP addresses to devices on my network that rely on from the outside to the inside of my network communication from various control apps, etc.  I have to run around collecting hardware MAC addys for my devices.  TrendNet listens to it's users, and I've already called them and suggested a refinement.  In the past when I've done this, they've actually come through via a firmware update which is pretty cool.In Summary, the router is blazing fast, the wireless is stable and has a great (subjective) range on both it's N and G signals.  I can now get to it from my neighbors house across the street, I couldn't do this with the old.  My speedtests maintain a 8ms ping and 30d/4u mbps to my typical test server.  I would knock off .5 star of the GUI stuff, and .5 star for the $ value compared to something fancy and blinged out such as my old 4500.  I'm ok with function over form.  I don't think the added radio adds THAT much more to the cost; this router costs quite a bit more than what I could have just bought another 4500 for.

This is disappointing because i wanted to plug the speakers into my keyboard or monitor which have USB outlets and this is too large and unsightly for that.2) The cable is a nasty tangly sticky clear wire style very thin wire, im sure youve seen this kind before it is contributes to a wire rats nest very easily.3) Sound quality is poor, overpoweringly strong sound in the high ranges with weak mid-range obviously almost no bass (considering the price and size you would have to expect the bass problem). The simulated 7.1 is a gimmick.If you intend to listen to any music at all, dont buy it.

$REVIEW.: I got these headphones as a Christmas present last year
 I mostly pair them with an iPad and occasionally with my Macbook Air


 They have a few warts but are overall nice


 My first issue is with the behind the neck mechanism, it isn't adjustable, and I have a huge head so it's not exactly comfortable to wear them so that they cover both ears


 That said I primarily listen at work and need to have one ear out and I've gotten used to having them on one ear, and although they were uncomfortable to wear for long periods at first I've broken my ears into them
 I have yet to get the microphone to work on them either.That said I am actually really happy with the purchase
 I can leave my iPad at my desk and listen to the headphones while getting coffee or going to the bathroom which is VERY nice

 The controls are very handy so you can adjust volume or skip forward or back on the fly without breaking out the device

 Pairing is relatively straight forward although I find that I have to turn them off, kill bluetooth on the device, and then restart them to move between devices


 The battery lasts about 20 or so hours of heaving listening
 I can usually get close to two days of listening constantly at work, somewhat at home, and another 5-6 hours on a charge

 Sound quality is middling, if you're an audiophile you'll hate them, but they're a step up over any non ear cannal sealing ear buds I've used, and the bass is excellent for the music I listen to (indie alt) and for podcasts.This review may seem luke warm, and maybe it is

 However being able to listen to music or podcasts while pacing away from my desk, or putzing around, or exercising, or while working to work without having a cord get in the way is amazing


 It completely transforms the device experience and lets you focus more on what you're doing while listening to whatever you're listening to.The best example I had was that I was half watching training videos while listening to the audio over these on my iPad, which was hanging from a case on my porch while I dug post holes for our new raised bed garden yesterday
 I didn't have to worry about a cord, and if I felt like I was missing something I actually needed to pay attention to and wasn't remedial I could pause walk over and stare at the screen, rewind 30 seconds by hitting back on the headphones, and actually watch it again, then go right back to work


 Doing either task individually would have sucked, but doing them in parallel helped me pay attention to what the instructor was saying and took the boredom out of the physical task (yes I'm weird like that).This may be more praise for the wonders of stereo bluetooth headsets in general than this specific model, but as this is my first one, and it's stood up to all the abuse of a toddler can dish out, and been my constant companion for almost a year I have to say this unit itself is well worth the just under thirty bucks my benefactor spent on them.

$REVIEW.: Wanted a USB drive to backup data
 Had to have hardward encryption

 These little jewels are perfect

 Smaller and less expensive than the DataTraveler Vault series, but seems to use the same encryption, which I understand is top drawer


 Feels like a little block of metal; weight makes it seems so as well

 Has to be durable

 It is water-resistent too
 Kind of slow opening-up with its security software

 And it probably isn't all that fast when it comes to file transfers either


 But I basically only use this to backup a 1GB file on a weekly basis


 Nice to know that the data's safe

 And much easier than having to sofware-encrypt the file before transferring it


 Cap doesn't store on the tail end as a lot of drives do


 Not a problem, just make sure to keep track of the cap when its in use


 Best little secure USB drive I've ever used.

$REVIEW.: The first thing I noticed about this radio was how quiet it was! In the city there is almost always a ton of background chatter
With the squelch set just over the noise level only talk came through when there was talk that could be heard
I haven't had time to put the radio on the road but I'm impressed so far! It is made to move from car to car and does so easily
A magnet mount antenna and a 12V power port and you're on the air!Included are a &#34;rubber ducky&#34; antenna, alkaline battery pack, and rechargeable battery pack to turn the radio into a walky/talky


The recharge pack is the one point I'm not sure of yet
A power pack can be plugged into the side rather than taking batteries out and putting them back in for charging


What's not clear is which battery type can be used (Ni-Cd or NIMH)


Convention would be Ni-Cd


I will do an update at a later time when I find out more

$review_text.: I bought several pairs of these little passive speakers for some electronics projects. For what they are, they're good.....a cheap passive speaker.If you need more oomph than what your computer or ipod can provide, these do work great with a small t-amp. Very clear and detailed sound, if somewhat lacking in the low end. Hello! They're 3-inch speakers.I use a pair with my t-amp for background music in the living room, a pair with my ipod's headphone jack for background music in the bedroom, and I'm going to incorporate them under my canopy for patio music. For 69 cents a pair, you really can't beat them.

$review_text.: UPDATE 11/2010. I have tried a variety of Homeplug devices for streaming and none of them are working for me due to some sort of electrical issue with my outlet, however for many this will probably be a good option.  I am using this player connected to the internet with a simple airlink101 ap431w 54g access point. I have used this with both a Netgear wndr3300 and a wndr3400. I was having problems with the dlink dir0655.I get absolutely no breakup with VUDU HD movies or Netflix with the airlink+netgear combination. Those who say you can't stream movies with 54G are simply wrong. My internet connection is 15mbs down and 1.7 mbs up.I still haven't played a blueray disc on this puppy.=========================BD550 is feature rich, great picture and sound.  Software and partner support leave a lot to be desired.SOFTWAREFirst, the Display Settings is a mess.  You have choices for Auto, 480, 720, 1080 i & p respectively + AUTO.  If you select Auto or 1080p, then I do not get any sound on YOUTUBE.  Need to go back into SETTINGS and change to 1080i or lower. Now you get sound on YOUTUBE. Then go back to reset 1080p to watch VUDU or Bluray.  That stinks. I'm not really sure what AUTO actually does, but it doesn't seem to work.  This needs a software fix asap.PARTNER SUPPORTVUDU won't stream unless you change the DNS to 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.1 and LG recommends OPENDNS values.  You should use the VUDU DNS recommendations.  None of this of course is documented anywhere, so you can spend days trying to trouble shoot it.MISCWhy not put the BD USB slot in back?I am interested in other experiences you all may have had with this.

$review_text.: I am using this (along with some resistors) to persuade a current Mac Mini to operate &#34;headless&#34; (no connected monitor) and yet work correctly with Screen Sharing


If the Mini doesn't think there is a monitor connected, it won't turn on the video card, (to save power) and the Screen Sharing stops working correctly
By jumpering the analog RGB pins in the VGA end of this adapter with 75&#937; resistors, you can fool the Mini into correct operation.Believe it or not, that is the official Apple tech support solution!

$REVIEW.: I bought the official Canon BP-819, and it was a great improvement over the battery that came with my Vixia HF10.  But I still found myself running out of batteries at times.  So I decided to roll the dice on these Wasabi Power batteries.  I have zero complaints.  They work just as well if not better than the Canon brand.  I've had a set for a couple years now and never had a problem with them.  The original Canon BP-819, on the other hand, stopped taking a charge after about a year.  So I went ahead and bought another set of Wasabi Power batteries.  So now I have 4 of them, all for about what I paid for the one Canon brand.I recently bought a Vixia HF G20, and these work just as well in it.  For some things, like conversion lenses, it pays to go with the manufacturer.  But in this case, there's absolutely no reason to pay for an official Canon BP-819 as long as Wasabi Power keeps making these.
$review_summary.: Just as good as the Canon version at a fraction of the price

$REVIEW.: I am a video editor and often use my notebook for processor intensive tasks


A long project with multiple layers and effects filters can take several hours or even days to render and throughout the duration of this process my cores are running at 100%

I run a coretemp app to track temperatures on my T7200 chip and have observed a 10-15 degree C drop while using the Cooler Master U3
Setting the cooler up was simple and intuitive, I positioned one of its fans beneath the CPU, one beneath the GPU, and one beneath the HDD

It runs on USB power and the pass through cord prevents me from losing a connection

It took a little while to get used to the altered keyboard positioning but once I adjusted I found that I liked it better than flat on the desk geometry


The fans are whisper quiet and I have been using it non-stop for three months with no complaints


Rubber pads on the body of the unit lineup perfectly with the feet on my notebook and there is absolutely no slipping or sliding around


It is my understanding that the resources used for video rendering are similar to those used for gaming so this would be a wise purchase for gamers interested in preventing thermal overload and shut-down
I'm sure it will help my computer last longer and I only wish I had bought one sooner.

$review_text.: The Bad:  the umbrellas are not 40 inches (as described on the website), but are actually 33 inches, the "free bulbs" are far too dim for photographic portrait work, and not included are reflector housings to keep excessive backwash light from interfering with camera work.The Good: the light stands are reasonably well made, have fast release clamps for raising and lowering the height of the stands, come with light sockets that have long cords and solid umbrella holders, and the stands can be extended to 7 feet 6 inches if the leg supports are shifted upward.I consider this a good buy, except for the dim bulbs.  Indoor portrait work will require at least a pair of 85w CFLs, and then it would be best if you have a portrait lens that shoots fast (perhaps at  f2.8).What you will need to buy in addition to this kit (which will double the cost of the kit):  85w or brighter CFLs or socket strobe/slaves in the 40ws range, reflector housings, and optionally, reflective umbrellas (the included umbrellas are shoot-through diffusers, not bounce).Still, this is a good buy.

$REVIEW.: This battery is a fraction of the price of the OEM battery, and its life is as good as the original HP battery was when it was new.  Fits perfectly, form factor is indistinguishable from original battery.  What else is there to say?  It's perfect!UPDATE 4/2013 - I purchased this battery in June 2011, and it has performed perfectly for almost two years.  It appears it may be getting close to time to replace it, and I will certainly be replacing it with the same one!  Most laptop batteries won't last more than about 18 months when left plugged in and computer powered up constantly, as mine has been.  So for it to last close to two years (and it hasn't died yet) is beyond my expectations, especially for this price.I am well-pleased.

The end clips over the kindle with ease and holds fast with no issue. The kindle sits within the main clips just right. Not overly tight but tight enough where you know it's in there. No loose corner hold-fasts. The auto sleep/wake feature does indeed work as advertised. Has a place for a stylus as well. All ports and buttons are accessible as they should be.

Menu optionsare a breeze to figure out.I'm really excited about the battery life. Did a lot of thingsstarting from sync-up( of about 18GB ) out of the battery andI couldn't see any drop (!!) at all.Areas of improvments1. The polymer glove/belt clip. They can come up with somethingdifferent and sturdy, but its good.2. Having filled up almost to the brim, if the 'shuffle' optionis turned on, sometimes I was able to feel the hard-disk seekingthe song, when I hold the player @ in my hand.

Both USB plugs need to be plugged into your computer. One for power and the other for communication. I was able read and write without a problem. Later I hooked it to my Windows 7 machine and after 30 seconds Windows 7 saw it as a SATA Bridge with an unknown drive attached. I had absolutely NO access to the drive. It didn't even show up in the Explorer tree. After an hour of trying to trouble shooting I gave up.5 stars for the Box and it's Quality.Bottom line: Take your chance on connectivity. Would highly recommend the case however.OK! Update:Used a command prompt as administrator to find the problem:Diskpart is a program in Win7 that alllows you to look at your hard drives and to see their unique id names.It seems that the HD I'm using is out of an identical laptop so the manufacturer decided to give it the same unique name as the one on my machine -  not very unique of you ask me. This conflict caused the external hard drive to be Offline.Anyway by using Diskpart I was able to change one of the numbers on the external disk. I unplugge it then plugged it back in and was able to view, write, and delete to the drive.So, it wasn't Windows 7's fault after all but it would have been nice if windows would have given me a clue as to the problem.Research: How to Change the Disk Signature of a Drive Without Losing Existing Data or Reformatting.[...]Interesting reading.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased a Scepter 23" TV for my daughter's bedroom. The reviews for the TV complained about the tinny sound so I knew what I was getting into, but I was more concerned about the picture quality, which turned out to be pretty decent. For sound, I picked these speakers as the solution for a more robust sound without getting into major moula for a surround sound system since this is going into a limited space area in my daughter's bedroom. For the slightly over 20 trinkets, this was a good solution to a small TV with a good picture and horrible sound. Oh, you can use it with your PC or laptop or MP3 or Android device, too:)Update(December 2013):I picked up another pair on Black Friday from Amazon for my PC at work. I'm listening to Christmas music on them right now. I've got 100 Christmas MP3 songs and 500+ non-Christmas songs on USB drive. After the new year, it's back to my 500+ song playlist of Rock, Jazz, Classical and Standards:)

$REVIEW.: I'm a big fan of Amazon Basic cables.  In general, they work better than cheap Chinese knocks offs, while being much cheaper than OEM originals. I buy all my cables these days from Amazon Basics: HDMI, USB, etc.Unfortunately this particular cable didn't live up.  I have three.  One works fine.  One doesn't work at all (a first from Amazon). One works mostly but gives the dreaded &#34;this accessory isn't supported&#34; message on the iPhone.  Usually that message can be disregarded but sometimes for unknown reasons it just stops charging in the middle of the night.On the plus side, the cable is well made and strong. I've hade issues with every iPhone cable ever, including the apple ones that come with the phone, that eventually they start to fray around the connector.  This one is thicker and stronger than the one that came with the phone and I bet last a long linger before fraying.

(the ones above the Esc key).Bad:-keyboard is not really that great, to be honest and will take some getting used to.-why do you have to press the function key to get F5? The function keys at the top are much more commonly used than most of the stupid functions that have been mapped over them

There's a ton of empty space right above those keys, why not put your novel functions above them on new buttons?Unknown:-the battery life
I've heard good word of mouth on this so far, but it remains to be seen.

$REVIEW.: I bought this remote strictly for the IR receiver. I use Windows Media Center with a Harmony remote.This is NOT a MCE-certified remote. What this means is that it does not include all the functionality of a MCE remote. Specifically there is no hotkey (aka the "green" button) to let you launch WMC or to go back to the WMC start screen.This is a deal-killer for me. I cannot find a way to program this functionality into the Harmony. There are a bunch of hotkeys.... but none that replicate the green button.Don't buy this remote if you plan to use it for WMC.

$REVIEW.: The keyboard cover and stand paired up immediately with the iPad mini and works as advertized. I like the fact that it 'hugs' the iPad around the edges so that protects the unit from accidental scrapes and collisons. The keyboard is well made, and sturdy. I don't like using the onscreen soft keyboard, so this product makes typing a lot of more efficient and accurate. The keys are sized well, given the small amount of real estate.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a dual purpose cover/keyboard,. The only gripe I have, which is minor, is that it clips so tightly to the iPad that taking it apart can be challenging. However, I would rather this that a loose fitting unit that falls out.

Motorola did a really good job

Its' running the latest Google OS 3.1My only issue is the low available Tablet apps
I've found quite a bit of non-tablet apps that dorun well without issues on the XOOM, but there are a few that do run correctly
What's really niceis that the apps that do not run correctly do not crash the system

Sweet !!!I can uninstall the offending app without an issue


My hat is off to Google!On another note, I'm waiting for the external storage (micro Flash) support.The hardware interface is available, I guess it's just needs to be supported on the operating System.Hank

True, like the other reviewers said, the strap is somewhat 'meh'


The strap is not attached to the bag but is meant to replace the original camera strap


For me, the string part is kinda long and doesn't look good attached to the strap part
Well I put it on anyways so it matches

Case seems durable enough as I am certain to drop it a couple times and will probably last me quite awhile

I will give it normal use (mostly holidays and events) with some clumsiness

$REVIEW.: Update 5/17/13After ironing out the RTSP issues I ordered two more of these cameras and both work flawlessly in all respects
Apparently the initial camera I purchased had some issues with shipping or QC at the factory
The two new cameras joined my network and were set up as RTSP in minutes each
Both have completely sharp image across the entire viewable area


Dropping these cameras in place of the existing Foscams is like the difference between watching a black and white film from the 50s and watching a current release in iMax

30FPS day and night with the Hucam at 1280x960 vs 15fps day and 4fps night with the Foscams at 640x480
I simply can't believe these cameras cost as little as they do!I've now ordered some 3rd party CS lenses of various focal lengths to see how wide I can go
It would be absolutely stupendous if Huacam shipped these units with a variable focal length lens even if it was manually operated


Being able to choose a focal length from 3mm to 12mm would simply make this camera an absolutely irresistible deal.I don't plan to update the review with the lens testing so please post in the comments section if you want to know how it went.Update 5/12/13After several emails back and forth with the manufacturer we've isolated the RTSP issue down a bit

Turning down the resolution from 1280x960 to 1024x768 enabled RTSP streaming to the security software I use and another package I tried


They hope to isolate the nature of the bug and issue a firmware release to allow full 1280x960 streaming to all software, but once I made the change I decided to also try the intermediate res of 1280x768 and it worked as well; then found that 1280x960 now works!Also, the frame rate can be set to "auto" in RTSP mode without the camera hanging.Why all this fuss about h.264 and RTSP? Because this camera with h.264 uses 1/4 the bandwidth of my MJPEG cameras that are only 640x480
Better image quality, better video quality, much smaller data files: a win all around.As a result of all that I've upped the star count from three to five...but there are a few nagging problems that prevent a higher review.The image quality is very very good to excellent

The sensor is not blinded by the Sun or other bright objects, there is no significant blooming and no vertical streaks as with other cameras I have used


 Color rendition is accurate and balanced.The lens they shipped seems to be defective, there are significantly blurry areas in the image, mostly in the lower 1/5 corner of the image and a small amount in the upper right corner

At $200 I'd send the camera back but at this price its just a casualty of low cost, I'm sure but I am hesitant to purchase more if all the lenses will be blurry.Night vision is excellent

The large aperture and quality sensor allow for 30fps video even at night

 I can't speak to the effective distance of the built-in IR LEDs as I also have supplementary  emitters installed at my camera locations that make it all look like daylight in the IR spectrum, but from my limited testing indoors, they are more than adequate to "see" out to an effective range for identification


If you want to light anything up at 50ft, you simply need external IRs, no matter the camera in this price range.The shutter and aperture controls are quite fast to respond to changing in light levels; the camera handles sunrise and sunset without needing any recalibration from me or external software.The mount is the best I've seen for a low-cost camera


It is solid and once the two pivot points are tight there is no change of "sag" or other movement of the camera on the mount.The software on the camera is rather horrible
To use the interface all but requires Internet Explorer


Using Safari on the Mac, none of the controls or menus work

The disk ships with a plug-in that will capture the RTSP stream and allow IE to display it

The RTSP stream is supposed to be standard RTSP & h.264 but the required plug-in is the first evidence that is not the case
The instructions also state you can use the VLC plug-in for FireFox (on Windows) but I had no luck getting that working either.Owning a Mac and using Security Spy I am unable to get at the RTSP stream no matter what settings I use

Security Spy tries, but the camera is sending some invalid or malformed data and SS just refuses to "see" the camera's RTSP stream
I can use the camera in MJPEG mode, but image quality suffers dramatically.As part of the debugging process I installed iSpy and EvoCam in Windows
Neither was able to get at the RTSP stream despite extensive port and URL probing.The one way I found I CAN see the RTSP stream is to open it on my Mac with QuickTime Player or VLC, neither of which provides any real recording capability that the camera control software packages do.The user interface for the camera itself is simple and easy to understand (as long as you use IE)

Clicking generally causes an immediate reaction in the interface
As is common with the low-cost Chinese cameras, the software is generic and in this case displays all the controls for a PTZ camera despite there being no PTZ functionality


And again, the entire thing only works in IE, or a browser that lies and states it is IE (I use Safari on Mac OS X and had to change the user agent to IE 9.0 to access the camera's interface).Summary: If you want a high-res MJPEG camera there are probably lower cost options, and much simpler ones if you aren't using Windows

 If you want a hi-res RTSP/h.264 camera, save your money as this camera just will NOT do that for the intended use, no matter what the claims in the sale listing.Hopefully a software update will come soon to fix the RTSP protocol error and I can re-write this review with 5 stars.Oh..
I went to the Huacam website and sent in a request for support about this issue


The request was ignored

I finally used the "contact seller' option here on Amazon and got a response within a few hours, so if you get this camera and need support, go through Amazon.

$REVIEW.: This TV is fantastic. I use it with my Xbox One and for streaming TV using Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, and Amazon Video. The Apps on the Samsung TV are actually updated with a user interface that rivals that of the Xbox app.The picture is great, nice black saturation. Excellent for gaming (Although Game mode is a must for gaming, the response lag on Battlefield from playing on normal to game mode is significant). Motion lag from high action shots is non existent on blu rays and internet streamed sports (Xbox ESPN app).TV startup time is very fast (about 3 seconds). Although the Apps startup time from cold-boot could be improved (Netflix takes about 15-20 seconds to startup if I immediately press the Netflix button after powering it on).DLNA support is great for streaming any video files (Even my .mkv Top Gear Torrents play flawlessly) or audio.Wifi is very good too. It picks up the 5GHz band of my router as well as my laptop's wireless card and Xbox One do at the same distance.Overall I'm very pleased with this TV.

$review_text.: I was having trouble getting my iPhone to be properly detected by my Macbook
I kept getting an error, "A USB device needs more power." I found out that the AC plug hadn't been plugged into the hub all along


I didn't know but the hub can run without AC power which they call Bus Mode
To get my iPhone working, I had to first disconnect the hub from my laptop, plug the AC power back in, and finally reconnect the hub


They state the hub won't charge your Apple devices as fast, I don't mind.

$review_text.: These are a good deal for the money. Sound is quite decent, and they're very comfortable. The cord is way too long for use w/an Ipod Nano on your arm, so be aware of that; I wrap it around the nano to keep it out of the way, but it's a bit horsey. The noise cancelling is not great with these, but it's OK. I use them in a pretty loud health club, so wish they were better at keeping out the outside noise. Nice that they come in white or black. Overall, I recommend.

The sound is very balanced overall with good highs and bass.  The sound imaging is superb also, these headphones really add dimensionality to music that my other headphones did not, including the more expensive Shures that I own.

$REVIEW.: My son and I split a purchase of these for a trip we just finished and these babies far exceeded my expectations.  They're full duplex and have amazing noise cancelling ability.  I could barely hear his engine in the background, but no wind noise and his bike doesn't have a fairing.  Listening to music from my bluetooth phone was an unexpected perk.  I could have the phone buried in my tank bag, wrapped in plastic, and I could play, pause, skip forward and back songs using the Sena controls.  I put my zip-lock wrapped iphone in an exterior pocket and when I pushed the Siri button, I had access to all the hands-free features of that phone like dictating and listening to texts, turn-by-turn directions, "play some blues", etc.  I was surprised when I answered an incoming phone call by just saying "Hello?".  The caller didn't even realize I was riding a motorcycle.  I listened to music or talked to my son for about 6 hours each day and never ran out of battery.  I have a USB charger port on my motorcycle so I was ready to plug it in to keep using it if I needed to.We had low expectations since these units were near the bottom of the price range for communication devices and our old expensive units were so awful, but I have been completely blown away.  They are very clear up to about a quarter of a mile separation (line of sight only--can't talk around mountains).  The speakers are a little small so they aren't great at reproducing music inside a helmet.  I wear earplugs so they spent most of their time at high amplification settings.  I noticed them fuzzing just a few times when ambient noise was high and I had to set the volume to max.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  You could spend more, but why?

$review_text.: The speaker is stylish and looks good. It is larger than most of PC-connected speakers, specifically, it's deeper.It has two autio input ports, one to connect to the PC, the other one can be connected to MP3 player or other devices. But only one 3.5mm audio cord is encolsed with the package.The power cord is kind of short (about 3 feet only). So, I have to add extention cord for power connection.Sound is deeper from these speaker. Bass is weak (as expected) because no subwoffer. Mid and high sound are fair. The speaker performs quite well for most of my light music. I am not a game player, so I can not comment about how the game related sound and music from these speaker.However, I feel the price tag is kind of high for a set of PC speaker.

$REVIEW.: This camera is amazing - it has so many great features. One feature I really like is that the wall charger for the camera is very compact, doesn't have any wires, and doesn't require you to charge the entire camera on a tabletop like most models. For this camera, you just take the battery out of the camera and snap it into the charger. Also, when it's completely charged, it has a green light to indicate it's finished. The camera itself is compact and fits easily inside any case - I love how it has a slide down lens cover, which also turns it on when you slide it down.The photos come out crisp and in high definition and the zoom range is excellent and clear. The only problem with that is when you zoom in as far as it will go, the photos come out a little grainy. By far the best feature is the large touch screen on which you can view stored photos, adjust all the settings, and record video. It's extremely user friendly. The only thing I didn't really like was that when you record videos, the sound is poor on playback and there wasn't a setting to adjust that. But overall, this camera is well worth the money.

Usually with other ones your music ends up being part static alot of the time.With this fm transmitter I can literally transmit and play my music clearly on any station! Even the stations that come in 100% normally! I really dont know what other reviews are talking about. THIS THING IS PHENOMENAL! I never expected such quality for $20. I have bought a few GOgroove products now and they have all been great!I use it with my Galaxy S 3 and it holds it perfectly.Maybe I just got a fluke that is amazing but if you are considering it I would say give it a try!

$review_text.: I bought this 32" TCL LED TV and the 24" TCL LED.  I originally loved them both, but for some reason the 32 inch was uncomfortable to watch for long periods of time.I tried different picture settings, brightness, viewing angles, etc., but just couldn't stop blinking while watching it.  It's like my eyes were constantly trying to focus on the screen.  My wife said the same thing.  I kept the TCL 24", but the 32" went back and I bought a 32" Sony instead.  I can't specifically point out a reason why the 32" TCL was difficult to watch.  It may just have been that I had a defective model.The 24 inch TCL is still awesome, though.

If you are like me and have tens of thousand of negatives and want to be able to ever find one of them this is about the best filing option.  Put then negs in the pages then put the pages in those plastic three ring binder boxes then place the boxes in a four drawe file cabinet.  The fire proof cabinets are the best.

If your car doesn't have an Aux input, this is not for you.The sound is fine. It is indistinguishable from the sound when played by connecting the headphone jack to the car's Aux port.While playing it charges the device via your cigarette lighter.A set of standard audio controls are on the device.There are other, less expensive chargers, and you can get an inexpensive cable that goes from the headphone jack on the iDevice to a 3.5 mm male stereo jack. The controls on the iDevices  work just fine. If you want everything in one package, have a 30-pin dock device, and have some extra money lying around, this is for you.

$REVIEW.: I bought this product for my 40" Samsung Series 5 LCD. Because I was planning to upgrade it in the future to a 52", I went with the larger size.  (And the HRM-100 is definitely sturdy.)  However, my apartment already has pre-installed TV mount screws at 24" apart--a stud distance that is not that uncommon.  BUT, the Hercules HRM-100 mount only supports a narrow range of 11.75"-18.00".  I would not be upset *had they put this info in the product description*.  But they did not, and now I am paying $20 to send it back.

$REVIEW.: I was pleasantly surprised by these earbuds. I dislike the Apple's white earbuds that ship with the iphone, like many I find they simply don't stay in my ear & I am always pushing them back in. Those are ok for casual use (I keep them in my car). I also bought the "better" Apple earbuds, that cost about $70 and while those were ok - they started to develop problems after about 9 months of use. I wanted to replace those, but I wanted to either get a better pair or save $$. With these sony earbuds, I am happy to report I did both.Pro's:Comfortable fit using the medium silicone plugs. No complaints.Very good sound quality, I am not a serious audiophile but these sounds great. Good highs, mids and lows.Works well with the iphone 4, the mic works great for calls, double and triple click work ok also.Comes with a nice little pouch for storing the headphones.Comes with extra silicone plugs, small, medium & large.Love the price.Con's:The rubber cable that goes from the earbuds to the main cord is amazingly thin. I could not imagine it being any thinner. While they have held up for about a month now, I am constantly worried I will literally snap the cable if I pull on it too hard. I hope it's tougher than it looks. By comparison, the apple earbud cables feels twice as thick. The thin cord seems to make the earbud very prone to getting tangled.You only get one set (3) of the silicone plugs. I had worn out the medium Apple plug in about 6 months and there was no way to re-order. Sony doesn't seem to sell them separately either. They should have given you 2 sets really, how much could it add to the cost. Basically, when these silicone plugs wear out, you have to buy an all new set of earbuds. Apple was the same way tho. Your only option is to use a different size earbud which is not ideal.Sony put the mic and button control on the left side cord as opposed to everyone else, like apple who puts it on the right side. I dunno why they did this. It kept confusing me to reach to the left for the button or mic and so I just decided to put the left earbud in my right ear and vice versa. Silly I know, but I can't tell any audio difference and they fit fine - there is no difference in the earbud unit from left to right. I guess I have violated some sacred audio code by swapping the channels, but birds continue to fly, the sun comes up in the morning.Again, superb earbuds for iphone owners, only worry is that the cable is so thin I am afraid it won't last very long. I will update this in a few months.

Then, perhaps the angle of your hand might actually work better for clicking the buttons.  The left touch-pad button is way too big and is unresponsive for many things like re-sizing windows and moving them.  double-touch action is also flaky.The Good:  no mouse or keyboard wires.THe Bad:  The keys are too small, touchad is on right side of keyboard. Left touchpad button is too big and doesn't respond very well.  The touchpad latency isn't very good.It works, but not worth the $30 something I paid for it.

$REVIEW.: I have 2 Slingboxes,the Pro and Pro HD. I loved the Slingboxes but when a problem happens, if it's after the 90 days of support, then it's $30 per call not even per incident. That was so annoying that when I had a problem, I looked for an alternative and found the Vulkano, they have lifetime free support. I found the Vulkano to be frustrating to set up but support was so good and easy to get, I made a good decision to go with Vulkano. Works well to placeshift. I like the Slingbox player interface a little better but I was told down the pipeline they would address some issues I have. I would also like to, like Tivo, pause and reverse live tv, supposedly that too is coming. Like Tivo, Vulkano records well. There is room for more improvement and I believe they will come. The product as it is now is terrific, I love it.

$review_text.: Fantastically sharp lens.  I can capture all the hairs and pollen on a bee or on the stamen and pistil of a flower.  I have also used it for informal portrait work with great results.  Love it.  I use the manual focus when I'm in really close and then finish up with the autofocus to make the shot.  Works like a charm and the autofocus is spot on.  I'm using it on my Nikon D800E and can get huge enlargements even after cropping.  Sometimes I switch off and use it on my D300 for a 150mm equivalent.  In those situations I can more distance between my camera and the subject and still get excellent enlargements.  Yes, I would recommend it to a friend.

$review_text.: This scope is a mix of good and bad

 It has the best tripod and mount I have seen on a low-end scope


 The mount is reasonably rigid, moves smoothly, and has great slow motion controls

The objective lens is multicoated and well corrected for chromatic aberration, especially for an F10 focal ratio
So Meade gets kudos for two of the three things that make a good scope
On the other hand, the eyepieces are CRAP! Plan on buying a good 25 mm Plossl eyepiece (and maybe a 10-15mm) and you will be extremely satisfied with the result.The red dot finder is perfect for this type of scope, especially if you get a nice 25-30 mm Plossl eyepiece

The finder will get you close enough that the object will be in the eyepiece

This is far superior to a small aperture reticle finder that you can't see thru to save your soul


 Meade made the right decision with the red dot finder.With proper eyepieces this will serve as an excellent beginner scope that will whet your appetite for astronomy

Moon, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter are all within easy reach and will impress anyone who has never looked at them before
70 mm is big enough to render the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades cluster, the double cluster, the Andomeda galaxy, and even M13 as spectacular views under dark skies
That is about the limit though.All in all, the scope is worth the money just for the good parts


Spend another $50-$80 on two good eyepieces and you will have a fine instrument

Stick with the existing eyepieces and you will need to get a good knock on the head to see stars!Meade 07175-02 26mm Super Plossl Series 4000

$REVIEW.: It's an unique design.I didn't expect this charging station to have like a silicone &#34;casing&#34; feel to it. It feels more like a &#34;diving/rain suit&#34; added on to this charging station than feeling like one seamless product.The charger itself isn't that big, but the silicone base makes it larger. There's an opening on the bottom where the charging station's power outlet can be stored.Silicone personally makes it feel a little cheap, but I can see the benefit of avoiding scratches and such.1 port provides 2.1amps for charging tablets and the rest provide 1.0amps

$REVIEW.: We wanted to record off the air or cable

 This works with MS Media Center to record programs


 Unfortunately the 5.1 audio on broadcasts and cables become regular audio (stereo) and played back from computer


 I am not sure it is this card or the MS software is causing the problem

 It would be nice if the PC or this card has a TOS link output

 The remote works but you have to install driver that is included


 Media Center will work without having driver for this card installed, I think
 I had a computer update crash and lost the remote control

$review_text.: Over the years, I've been using various brands of UPS -- I've found out that my favorite brand is APC, as its quality is excellent. I purchased this UPS for a special home project, where I installed it in a wall tu support my cable modem, a wireless router and a switch. This is crucial for me as I need to have Internet access all the time.Installation was a snap. This unit comes with three special mounting holes that I used to attach it to the drywall using screws. It took me perhaps 30 minutes from start to finish, with a very solid result.This type of UPS ships with a user-replaceable battery that is easy to find. You'll likely need to change it between each 18 and 24 months. This happens with pretty much all the UPS I've used regardless of the brand. You might choose to get the battery through APC or from an OEM. I've had excellent results in both cases.This unit has two rows of power receptacles. The first row is simply surge-protected, the second row provides surge protection and uninterruptible power. The receptacles are spaced to make it easy to plug a big transformer in each row. It also includes RJ-11 jacks to protect your phone line. I've not tested this with DSL modems, so I cannot say whether this filtering will affect your data transmission or introduce noise in the line.This UPS has a circuit breaker that can easily be reset in case of need, although I've never had one of this breakers popping on me.

$review_text.: The first day after a stressful installation everything was working fine except I couldn't receive my emails through Windows Live Mail. The next day nothing worked. After 1-1/2 hours on the phone with tech support on my dollar, she determined the router needed to be replaced. In the meantime I fiddled around on my own and found out there were tweaks I needed to do that the tech didn't advise me on nor was it written anywhere. I am not a techie; wireless networks is a strange new world for me; and tech support talked in language that made me wonder if she was speaking English. Afterwards I went through numerous attempts on my own to tweak the computer, the router, and other programs, and by the grace of God I was able to fix them. I'm now getting email through Windows Live Mail and all my computers and printer are happy. Good luck, y'all, especially if you're a non-techie like me!

$REVIEW.: The faux Carbon Fiber covers fit nicely and went on with the effort you would expect to get all the sections properly aligned.  End result looks great to my taste.  So Carbon Fiber gets a 5.Like all Skinomi TechSkin screen protector technology, floating install works quite well, and small dust and bubble defects &#34;heal&#34; after a few days so the install looks perfect.  The screen protector technology then works fine for touch interactions.  But forget using this screen protector with stylus pens.  While the pen may seem to move around easily, it leaves permanent dents and marks whenever you press to select or happen to press down to make a thick line.  Because stylus pens damage the screen protector, this gets a 3.

$review_text.: Pros: Replaces all the remotes for your entertainment system, easy to set up, easy to use for even the extremely technically challenged. Touch screen and soft keys are really cool. Rechargeable battery with charging cradle.Cons: Won't control RF devices such as Wii systems. ( there are other harmony models that will though.)Free phone support is only for 90 days.( although you will probably never need it anyway.)This is my second harmony remote, and I can't imagine living without one. My first one finally gave up the ghost after many years and some rough handling. I went back to using multiple remotes for a short time, boy what a pain! I saw this baby on Amazon for 149.99 with free shipping, ( and the best part no tax} and jumped on it. Just run the cd on your computer, plug in the remote, tell it what brands of components you have, answer a few simple questions, and you are ready for stress free enjoyment of your home entertainment system.

$REVIEW.: Since the description of this product lists the iPhone as a cleaning option, I was eager to try it.  I have some specialized cleaning clothes from the eye doctor that do a pretty good job of cleaning my iPhone screen, but nothing else I've tried works very well or at all (just smears the finger prints around).  Even the little glasses cleaning cloths require some effort to get the phone screen clean.I must say the soft suede-like surface of this pad works really well, doing a quick and thorough job, BUT it is too wide for the iPhone screen if you have a surround case like I do.  You can use the edge of the pad, or bend it so that only a portion of it is against the screen. The pad doesn't want to bend as it's rather stiff leather, but it will bend (in one direction) and then does a great job although it's a bit awkward to hold in that position and of course the finger straps can't be used.  I'm not entirely satisfied with this solution as you can imagine, but am pleased to have a clean screen.For a tablet such as an iPad it would be outstanding, and it works well for my computer screen in its natural flat shape.You get three pads to a pack which is nice and I will certainly use this product even though I have to bend it for my phone screen.  Note to manufacturer: Please make a version that fits the touch phone screens when they are in a case since so many of us use them to protect our phones.  This is an effective method of cleaning and highly recommended for tablets and larger screens.  It can be used with smaller screens, but will require extra effort if that screen has a raised edge due to design or case.

$REVIEW.: Case Logic has always been the case of choice for many whether they have desired to protect their CDs or, in this case, a mini netbook or netbook.  Many on-the-go people take their netbooks with them to the library, their local coffee shop, and, of course when they travel.  Many airports are now equipped with free Wi-Fi high speed access and you not only find the business people carrying their netbooks, but also people who want to stay connected on a layover.  I have another sleeve I use, but Case Logic has one up on it in the protection department with the posh, thick quilted padding.Accessibility: ClamshellExternal Dimensions: 13 (width)  x 9.75 (height) x 1.6" (depth)Laptop Compartment: 11.5 (width)  x 8.25 (height) x 1.5" (depth)Fits: 9 - 11. 6" NetbooksMaterial composition: Both the interior and exterior and 100% polyester.PROS:+  The padded clamshell design is shock resistant.+  The internal stabilizing band will keep your netbook from shifting.+  There is sufficient storage space inside for a power source if you are toting a mini netbook.+  This attach&eacute; has sturdy, convenient, sewn in padded handles unlike many sleeves on the market.+  Very durable with thick, reinforce seams.CON:*  I always like to test anything I will be carrying media material in for water resistence.  I placed it under the faucet and it soaked water up like a sponge.  I was expecting the water to bead off, but was quite surprised at the rapid absorption of water.  Simply keep in mind that if it is raining you may wish to place this in a plastic bag.This case is an excellent quality case, especially if you are planning to travel.  I especially liked the durability that can be both seen and felt.  I have the black case that will not show stains as readily as the other colors.  The only drawback is that it is not water resistant, but Case Logic makes no claims in this regard and I cannot take away from the rating I feel it deserves because of this.  I simply needed to make people aware of this just in case they are thinking of taking their netbook out packed in this case during inclement weather. All in all, I'm quite pleased with this case and would highly recommend it to any on-the-go person looking for a durable, high quality case for their small netbook!

$REVIEW.: I read many of the reviews here before purchasing.  I was still hesitant but wanted something to not only protect the back of Ipod, but also the front.Please understand that I am newer to Apple and had never owned an Ipod until about 2 weeks ago and got the 5th generation 32gb Ipod.  I have had other brands of mp3/media players, including my old reliable, ugly brown colored Microsoft Zune.  I love the Zune and it still works well but definitely out of date. It is a brick of a device but very solid and I am not afraid to break it as it is built like a tank.  It is over 5 years old now and and wanted to update and Microsoft quit making them.I got the Ipod and had never held or looked at one except for pictures.  I found a deal and bought one.  To unpack the thing took some work and the box seemed quite small. Low and behold, I finally got it out and off the box it comes in and here is this tiny, thin Ipod.  It looked so fragile compared to the Zune and maybe 1/3 the depth.  It is awkward to hold for me as I am always afraid of dropping it.  Compared to the Zune, it is so thin and no bulk to it.  I know Apple diehards love this aspect but I want some girth to any handheld device.  To me, they just seem more durable and solid.  Anyhow, unlike my Zune, I also needed protection for the Ipod so like many, I checked out what Amazon had to offer.Let me first describe my uses for the Ipod overall and maybe it can help you decide on what style case to get.  My job entails much driving and car time.  I use the Ipod as a music player in the car and wire it to the stereo.  I have to lay the Ipod on part of the console which is normally hard plastic so it can get scratched pretty easily by getting knocked around.  I also have to carry the Ipod in my jacket or pants pocket for transporting.  I was looking for preferably a soft leather case that when closed, protected all of the Ipod if possible.  If I could not find a leather case, I had to settle for another material but not a rubber or a gel as I also want it to be able to be placed in and out of pocket easily without getting hung up. Gels also seem to attract alot of lint, dust and dirt.  I learned this from my cell phone - sorry, it is an Android!!!I saw cases that were plastic and rubberized as well as gel ones.  All seemed ok but then what about the screen?  I did not want to put on a separate screen protector and wondered about if a case was available like I had for my Ipad (Yea, bought one of those recently too).  After searching more I came across this Splash Flip style Ipod case/cover for the 5th generation Ipod.  There was also another brand that opened to the side but I did not care for the looks of it.  This Splash leather case was what I was wanting and searching for in a case.  It is soft leather and it covered the entire Ipod.  Holes were cut so you did not have to remove the Ipod to charge it or to take pictures etc...  It was spendy compared to the other cases, but this is leather and closest to ideal for me.Now, after reading reviews on this Splash leather case I was reluctant as some reviewers made it sound like the quality was not up to snuff due to stitching and other issues but they still ranked it high and the overall ranking on this case was very high.  The other savior is Amazon as if I did not like it or feel it was not good quality, I could always return it.  I also read about the slow delivery times which also did not thrill me as I needed something now and not later.  Well, I decided on this case and when I went to order it, I then noticed it was not a 'Prime' item which bummed me out and then saw what I felt was a high shipping fee.  Well, I decided i was not going to buy it.  I then saw it again while searching more but it was $2 more at base price but with 'Prime' style shipping which meant supposedly no shipping fees (but $2 more?) and 2 day delivery.  Sweet!  I bought it and I must say, I am very happy.It took a day for shipping, faster than normal 'Prime' shipping.  Very fast!  The case was not shipped in a box, but rather a padded envelope.  This was torn when delivered but luckily the case is in a plastic bag as well as it's hard plastic container , so it stayed put and did not fall out of envelope through the hole.  Boxed shipping would of been much nicer and safer as the hole was almost big enough for this to fall out.The case stunk a stinky, chemical smell that was strong when first opened but dissipated in a few hours.  The case is a beautiful soft leather that fits the 5th generation Ipod perfectly.  The holes for camera and flash line up nicely as does the holes for earphone jack and lightning plug.  The speaker holes are also uncovered....ok, 4 out of 5 of the speaker holes are uncovered.  Not a big deal.  As I stated before, you can charge it without removing the Ipod from the case and with the case closed.  When you open the case and fold it back, the Ipod it tilted up towards you a little (top to bottom) and not flat.  The screen is fully accessible when the case is open.  When closed, the case has magnets on the lower part and secures the top cover nicely.  The case will easily slide in and out of your pocket so less chance of it dropping as you are pulling it out.  Talking about dropping....the case may protect from small drops and bumps quite well but from any decent height or onto a solid surface like the uncarpeted floor, it may or may not protect very well.  This is not an Otterbox!  It should protect from day to day normal usage very nicely though.  As far as the seams and stitching, my case is great and see none of the flaws I have read others write about.  Stitching is even, lines are straight, case closes well and I see absolutely no negative issues with this case.  The only drawback, if there is one, is the girth or bulk.  It is a little thicker than my uncovered Zune or about a little more than double the thickness of the Ipod.  Personally, this is a plus for me.  I actually have something to hold on to. Some thickness will wear down with use, but I think if you plan on double the thickness of the Ipod, this would be pretty accurate.  Not sure if you can use the tethering strap or not that comes with the Ipod as I do not use it.Overall, I think it is a great case and although a bit spendy, a great investment or insurance for you expensive Ipod from day to day bumps and usage.  It looks and feels very nice as well as being practical to slide in and out of purses and pockets. Unlike the Ipad and although this case has magnets, it is only to secure the case closed and not for waking up the Ipod.  I am sure Apple has this planned down the road though for Ipods to be awakened without pushing a button.

$REVIEW.: I've been happily using this mini speaker for about a week now. This is a substantial feeling little unit that will rest securely on any surface due to the weight of the alloy housing. The sound is impressive, and intuitively you would not think such fullness and volume could be projected from this little thing.  I'm no audio expert, but I do listen to many varieties of music, and I like hearing it loud and with wide frequency response. The trebles and bass don't disappoint here for the size, and my tinny sounding devices are now usable audio players, as best as they can be in such a small package. The bluetooth works as promised -- just about 30 foot range.  So this mini unit has accomplished its purpose for me.  The only improvement I can think of might be if the control buttons on the bottom had better visibility, or could be identified by tactile symbols to make adjustments easier for people like me with big fingers and bad eyes.

He is a die hard COD fan and is extremely happy with the quality.  I was surprised at how far the IR emitter shines.  The only downside is that the IR emitter is red and you can see it.  Good quality too.  Make sure if you purchase these, you get the correct batteries,  I selected the ones listed in the package deal (others that purchased this item also purchased these...) and they were the wrong ones.

My M-Audio speaker sound was very good, but the sound quality of the Bose system is richer, more nature, and indeed better. For $100 bucks, I couldn't be happier. These are GREAT PC speakers!!! Finally, for all of the folks complainting about excessive bass in these speakers, SIMPLY enter the settings on your computers sound card and adjust bass, treble etc to your hearts content.

$review_text.: Update to Original Review:-------------------------I would like to add to my review. I drove my vehicle in New York City the other day. The GPS was horrible at knowing my position and direction in which I was going. Occasionally it would show me a few miles away from where I was but most of the time, my vehicle was shown to be traveling on water right in the middle of the river (and trust me, I didn't borrow it from Jesus). It was showing me going North-South on the Hudson river when I was traveling East-West on 45th street. Garmin surely has screwed this GPS product up.Original Review:---------------I absolutely loved this. My previous GPS nuvi 650 was stolen and now discontinued by Garmin. So I had to buy a new one.Compared to the 650, this has more features, is much sleeker, great the color of the body and good value for money. It has bluetooth which is very easy to setup (I tried with my RAZR phone and iPhone). The menu is pretty intuitive. Text to speech is enhance for different voices (earlier only American English had text to speech - I tend to love the Australian female voice.) It allows new avoidances like tolls .. which is important in NJ area.Having said that, the update changed a lot of good things. First of all, it was annoying to update the software because it is about 2GB and extracts to another 2GB - effectively, you need 4G of free space on your C drive. After upgrade, the recalculation of routes becomes slower (I like that so much when it detected deviation from route and recalculated in a snap). Also, now pretty much every place I go, the GPS takes me to the right street but screws up the house number. Luckily I can read numbers so I go up and down on the street till I find the number.I would love it if some day all GPSes start adding locators to their devices. GPS theft has become such a lucrative business now.

$REVIEW.: So I am a computer nerd
I know whats a good buy and whats not

This laptop I would say is a good buy


Just like with everything else there are pros and cons to this laptop.The model I have is the Toshiba C55T A5123 ( 500 GB HDD, 2.13 GHz Processor, 4 GB Ram, Touch screen capabilities )The only difference between the C55T A5123 and the C55 A5105 is that the C55T is touchscreen.The pros on this laptop are...Keyboard is nicely laid out (in my opinion) I really like how it has the number pad and how the keys are shapedI LOVE the mouse pad not to big not to small and the left and right click buttons are big :) way better than a all in one mouse padTouch screen on this laptop is a very nice touch for the priceSpeakers are LOUDThis laptop has pretty decent specs (4 GB Ram, 500 GB Hard drive, duel core processor clocked at 2.13 GHz, Screen is not to bad of a resolution 1366 x 768)Price is awesome $400.00CONSThere is only ONE ram slot which makes it harder to upgrade the ramCan be slow at timesA little bit big not as thin as some laptopsbattery life is only about 4 1/2 hoursSpeakers arnt the best if you have them to loud it distorts the qualityOverall I really do like this laptop:) its not painfully slow or to high priced


This laptop is fast for watching YouTube, going on Amazon, and overall fast on the internet

One thing that really bummed me out on this thing is it only having ONE ram slot

That means at most only 8 GB can be installed on this thing

I really do enjoy the texture on it and the touch screen its very handy when it comes to using windows 8

Honestly if your PC (laptop or desktop) dont have a touch screen I think windows 8 is useless

Without a touch screen it makes it harder to get around in the operating system, just trying to use the "charms bar" is a pain with the mouse and keyboard


You can get to the charms bar by pressing the windows key and C but I wouldnt want to do that all the time just to bring up the charms bar

Windows 8 on this laptop functions pretty well
Its snappy when it comes to booting up and loading programs and fun to use for the most part

I think in general windows 7 is better set up, the overall layout is attractive and built more towards using a keyboard and mouse
Windows 7 I think is more organized than Windows 8

In Windows 8 you have to swipe up to see ALL your programs and keep on swiping to the left to get to that one program you want to use whereas in Windows 7 you click the start button to see all your programs and they are all right there in folders
You click on the folder your program is in and its right there


You dont have to swipe 3 or 4 times looking at every single program just to find that one thing you want


In Windows 8 your programs are all categorized either by name, date installed, most used or by category
I also dont like how they try to simplify things like the weather app how its just a circle with lines

It looks childish and unsophisticated


They could of taken the time to make it look better
Windows 8 is a little glitchy sometimes but it has only been out for about a year and a half so that is understandable

It sometimes randomly switches me to different apps when I am on my desktop
I dont hate windows 8 at all I just think Microsoft could of done better

Maybe if Microsoft would of made a desktop version of Windows 8 and a tablet version

Putting back the start button in on the desktop and laptop versions and maybe making Windows 8 more graphical


I really did enjoy the windows being transparent in the Windows 7 operating system.I hope this is at least somewhat helpful and please forgive me for any grammar errors or miss spellings.Spelling is not at all my strong suit LOL

$REVIEW.: I was hoping this case would be a little bit better quality.  It is functionally okay.  The ipad is extremely difficult to get out of the plastic portion of the case once you get it in.  You almost feel like you are going to damage the ipad trying to extract it from the case.  The plastic enclosure isn't a great fit and I never could get it to snap together completely.  I had to remove the screen protector because it made my touch screen unresponsive about 30% of the time.  Very annoying!  All in all I think the case would protect the device fairly well if dropped, even without the screen protector.  That said, I wouldn't buy it again.

$REVIEW.: Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is a relatively user-friendly and full featured video editor. I had no trouble installing the software on my laptop (Windows 8 with an Intel Haswell i5 processor). So far, I have successfully edited and exported a few short movies based on home videos and the process has been pretty simple. Some of the included effects, like the montage options, are very nice. I have also briefly tested the live screen capture to see how it works and the quality was good. The software comes with 50GB of cloud storage as well, which is a bonus.Really the only drawbacks that I've noticed are the long installation time and (as other reviewers have mentioned) the fact that it catalogues all media on your computer. You can change which folders are included in the library by going to the Start Menu - - Control Panel and reviewing which folders are listed in the Watch Folder section. This is similar to some other software, like Picasa, that initially find all of your media, but I imagine most people would prefer to just choose which folders to include at the start, rather than having to remove all other unnecessary folders.
$SUMMARY.: User friendly software once you get past the bulky installation

Running a low level format on the drive right now to weed out any potentially bad sectors before using it as a backup to a RAID 5 array.- The fan is completely silent (even at the highest setting) over the noise of the 7200RPM drive and the blue LEDs are very subtle and not high school-looking.- The power adapter is 12V 2.0A which is enough for mostly any drive, aside from 10K-15K RPM drives perhaps.- The box states there is a thermal sensor that turns the LEDs from BLUE to RED once the temp exceeds 50C.

The case didn't fit any of my USBs nicely with out me thinking the elastic was going to CRUSH the USB and destroy it


Also, since the case isn't a hard case, and the USBs aren't offset from each other on each side, if you were to bonk the case the USBs would crash together and get destroyed
There is no extra protection this case provides
Of course I returned the product, but somehow it's my fault that the website doesn't give the dimensions of the actual HOLDING part of the case or say that this case doesn't really protect anything, I had to pay shipping to return it.You're better off putting your USBs in a dollar change purse.

$REVIEW.: Excellent pack.  I have another Targus pack, smaller in size and it's awesome.  I travel a lot, and one of the airport I go out of has free motorcycle parking, so I take advantage of that.  Even though this pack does not have wheels (another option I was considering), it is exceptionally well made.  Has three compartments for laptop, magazines, neck pillow, jacket and a smaller one to carry your passport, keys wallet.  A jacket flap is available with bungee cords and a very small zippered pocket to carry your earphones / ipod.  The two side pockets I use to carry external Anker battery with cords and the other one to carry medication and reading glasses.  The bottle pockets unfortunately are not too big.  On those I carry latex gloves or plastic bags (for when I carry food).  There is also a waist strap.  The handle is rugged.  Under the jacket flap there is a zippered mesh pocket, very handy for beanie hats or gloves.  On the flap itself there is a small zippered pocket that I use to carry my keys.  Add to that the Targus lifetime warranty which I've used on other backpacks and it's a great buy.

The micro-usb plug is very professional looking, but unfortunately it still hasn't cought on with most devices. However, I was able to charge my Jabra Blutooth Headphones with it.

To get rid of those awful and poor sound Apple factory headphones and to control either your iPod shuffle (latest version) or the iPod touch.I just used them on a 5 hour flight, they were great since I could use my noise cancelling headphones.The adapter looks well made, nice color (black), but the only thing that I did not rate it 5 stars is because you may get confused when turning up or down the volume with the center click, so you may get "pausing" your music instead of changing the volume.  An another thing, since they're black, you will have a little of a hard time guessing if you're going to push the up or down volume button.But I love this adapter for sure.

$review_text.: Too delicate

It broke before I could use it

Black plastic shavings fell out when I rotated it right/left

Then two tiny silver balls just fell out, which were evidently holding it together, because it separated at the wiring bend connection
I enjoyed the adapter for the 5 minutes it took to pry open the package, and the minute I admired it sitting on my desk prior to trying to use it
But I expect more than 6 minutes of anticipation and admiration from a device.This adapter, has been available for almost a decade from Amazon


I noticed the lowest reviews are more recent


A lot of manufacturing cost reductions can occur over a decade


Just saying.Belkin does offer a lifetime replacement guarantee, but I&#8217;ve already spent too much of my valuable time on this fragile device
Instead, I&#8217;ve opted for a retractable USB extension cable which actually has a smaller footprint where attached to the computer, doesn&#8217;t block adjacent ports in any position, can be laid, draped, or propped anywhere nearby, and doesn&#8217;t rain tiny balls and plastic shavings over my expensive equipment.I returned this adapter to Amazon and am awaiting my refund.

$review_text.: I bought this lens hood cause the canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 did not come with one from Canon. I use hoods on all my lenses, I feel they provide better protection then the glass filters some people use. Also with the lens hood you get reduced chances of flare, and brings more contrast to the subject your shooting which makes for a real nice photograph. I think all lenses should have a lens hood but that's my personal opionion.

$review_text.: The cool factor is very high and I definitely like this mouse

 I don't have any problems using it, like some have
 It works well on many different surfaces and feels good in your hand

 I thought it might accidentally flatten during use, but it hasn't done that.2 small complaints:1) I don't like that the usb adapter just magnetically attaches to the belly of the mouse with no little niche or indentation to secure it
It seems like it can easily slide off and get lost.2) It's probably not worth the premium price
 I also use the last gen folding arc mice, too, and they are very cool and lock the usb adapter in place more securely than the new one, and sometimes you can find a deal on them for $20.

$review_text.: I bought this mouse only to use with my macbook pro during hearings, trials, and educational seminars.  It does what it is supposed to, and the little wireless dongle is quite small and unobtrusive.  At times I have left it plugged in for days or weeks at a time.  The feel is okay, but not ergonomic by any stretch, but you wouldn't expect that in a tiny little travel mouse.  The bluetrack sensor is OK, but far from perfect, and the competing logitech technology is a bit better, as bluetrack has a hard time with reflective surfaces, like metal or polished wood desks.I like having this mouse with me when I'm traveling with my laptop, but I end up using the macbook pro's trackpad FAR more, even when I have the mouse out.  Not really this product's fault, but the trackpad is so nice, it's hard not to use.  If you have a Macbook with the glass multi-touch trackpad you might want to steer clear of this mouse, as its unlikely to sway your away from the trackpad.  If you have a different trackpad or one that is not multi-touch or that you otherwise find uncomfortable, then this mouse would make a good friend to your laptop.
$SUMMARY.: Decent, but a waste if you have a nice trackpad (like newer Macbook Pros)

This case fits the Kindle like a glove and the material feels good


The case automatically turns the Kindle on when opened, so no more need to press the power button, the Kindle is ready to use like a boot.I highly recommend this case over other more bulky, but slightly cheaper cases
It greatly improves the experience of using a Kindle.

$REVIEW.: This is a great head unit. I'm really happy with it. It's a great unit for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. However, there are a few problems that users might want to be aware of:1) The play/pause button is too small (same is true for the rew/ff buttons) and it's placement on the farther side from the driver was a poor design choice. This is a common problem with head units from all manufacturers. The big knob should be the play/pause button. On this unit the big knob simply lowers the volume way down (not mute), but the audio continues to play.2) The screen can be difficult to read during the day in bright light. The problem is worse when the color of the display is dark violet or dark blue. The good news is that you can fix this by selecting the color, but if you prefer either of those colors that I mentioned or if you like the color-cycling effect, this is an annoyance you'll have to endure.3) When you turn off the head unit, by pressing the power button, the clock does not stay on the display. If you want the clock to stay up while not playing audio, you have to cycle through all the modes (tuner, CD, USB, Aux, Bluetooth, Pandora, iHeartRadio, aha) to the &#34;Standby&#34; mode. In any of the modes you can get the clock (and only the clock) to be on-screen by enabling the &#34;display off&#34; display mode. In that mode the rest of the display will turn off a few seconds after you interact with the head unit, but the clock will stay up.

$REVIEW.: Use this on my Nikon D200 and  love the images. A bit soft wide open but stopped down just a bit and things are lovely. As this is a fully manual lens you need to focus, but then again the DOF is huge due to short EFL. Camera mostly meters well but you obviously have to beware of metering too much sky outdoors. Also found that making images rectilinear in Photoshop CS6 is not too difficult should that be your desire. The perspective distortion is actually fairly pretty as taken. Worth the price for a specialty optic.

$REVIEW.: If a product passes military standards than it is good enough proof for me as a US Army Vietnam Era Veteran who served overseas on two continents and depended on military standards. My prejudice aside I can honestly say that this cover is more than adequate and is an excellent protective cover for your IPad mini. Although I have not dropped it from 6ft. I have bumped it around roughly on hard objects and the cover absorbs the bumps and bruises just fine. I must say I was a little concerned that it might take away from the sleek and lightweight IPad mini but it is a tradeoff. The compromise in a pound heavier tablet is worth the security and peace of mind. The features I love are the multiple lock in viewing angles and the magnetic closing locks. This is an excellent product that is worth the money for protecting your investment in your IPad mini. Recommended for peace of mind that your IPad mini is safe from the everyday potential hazards of daily use or maybe an unforeseen drop from a table.

$REVIEW.: Just tried these speakers out and the sound quality is pretty bad (very tinny, as other reviewers have noted), but then what do you expect for $12. If you really don't have much money to spend on computer speakers, the maybe go for it. But if you really care about sound quality, skip these. I also have Logitech V20's and they sound amazing compared to these s120s --- spend the extra $28 if you can. And my wife has the Altec Lansing BXR1120, which are only $8 more than these and they also sound pretty good and better (although not as good as the V20s), so for tight budgets they would be a better value.

$REVIEW.: Alright Sandisk, I know you guys claim to have the fastest devices when it comes to flash devices, but when I see ultra I am expecting something new, something that is greater than anything that I have ever used.  As of right now I am moving my music onto the card, and it was about 3.11gb and the average speed is right below 6mb/second at 5.29mb/second.  I'll be honest, it is not faster than the polaroid class 10 card, but maybe my computer is not optimized for the microsdxc card.  Yet again, my computer is has 4 processors and 4gb of ram, so I am not sure about that, however this is not a class 6 device so far.  It may work better in a smartphone or tablet, but as far as transferring music to the card, it was not as fast as I hoped but then again, it is still fast.  It claims to be up to 30mb/second, however I experienced 10mb/second, for about two seconds then it went into a little over 5mb/second.I will update my review in the future when I get a smartphone and see how it transfers from card to computer, instead of computer to card because it very well may be faster transfering data from the card to the computer, but all-in-all I paid $50 for the lightning deal price and could not pass up as I expect to get a Samsung Galaxy s3 or a newer smartphone down the road.

$REVIEW.: In adding an SSD to my Macbook Pro 5.1 (late 2008 unibody) I saw that this option would allow me to use a small SSD boot disk and then use the old HD in this 2nd HDD caddy as the payload drive.  Installation was reasonably easy however the fit of this caddy was very tight in the body of the macbook.  The connecting cable was pressed down pretty firmly so I hope that in time it does not crease and fail.  Performance wise, this works very well, never had an issue with this in a month of service.This is a highly recommended accessory for your macbook pro if you are interested in using a 2nd HDD.I also used the Optical drive case to put the old Superdrive in and that functions perfectly as well so I have no regrets in using this solution!

$REVIEW.: OK, so what its not 1080P, put an HD signal into the thing and you wont be able to tell the difference.Great picture as you would expect from Viewsonic, the 10W speakers are adequate for a small room, andthe inputs are to the rear and not to the side which is a plus and makes cable management much easier.When I saw this price I figured it didn't have built in tuners, but there they are, and also includesa USB port which is a plus for doing instant slide shows. I also love the styling of this TV with thesquare edges and a proper weighted base which detaches easily if you want to use a wall mount. This ishow you do an industrial design.I see some people complaining about ghosting, but I haven't noticed any. This is a 60Hz TV so there is thepotential there, but Maximum PC Magazine did a feature on what they called a "scam" being perpetrated byOEMs on the 120/240Hz upsell. Their conclusion was there was no difference between these 3 refresh rateson an LCD HD monitor.Bottom line, this TV is a real bargain from a legitimate panel manufacturer with a reputation for quality,and I don't expect this price to drop much further. 5 Full Stars! BTW, when I wrote this review Amazonwas showing a price of $299, now its back up to $359....4 hours later? I've learned that was a posting byCompUSA, basically part of their well documented bait and switch marketing tactics.

$review_text.: First of all, these are great headphones for the price your paying. Will it be compareable to high end headphones such as Bose, or beats? Obviously not. but however it is compareable to many headphones within the 100 dollar range. Enough about that, let me explain this product so you can decide if it's right for you.One thing I noticed is that, not a lot of people really covers how each genre sounds in certain headphones. Keep in mind, some headphones are great for Hip Hop but end up being terrible for hard rock or heavy metal. So after I explain the details about the headphones, be sure to read about the sound it produces for each genre.Body - I bought these headphones in white/gray when they were first released. These are over the ear headphones. They cover your ear with a soft pillow-like material which is very comfortable. It's outer band is made of a plastic material which you can bend all the way and they still won't break, so they are very durable. Another thing great about the body is that you do not need to size it to fit your head, it stretches automatically and gives you the perfect fit, and I sure mean perfect. My overall rating for the body is 10/10Wire - The wire is really flase advertisement. It states that it will never tangle but trust me, after using it for a while they tangle and turn into S shapes all over which you cannot fix. This is the worst part of the headphones. Obvioulsy, this not might happen right away but I have been using these headphones for almost a year now and I already had to change the wire, which thankfully can be changed. Overall rating 7/10.Sound - Boy am I in love. I am not your average listener. I listen from Heavy Metal, Hip-Hop, Country, you name it. I am a huge music fan and everytime I bought headphones, I was always dissapointed that I would get amazing sound on Hip Hop songs but Heavy Metal would lack clarity or bass. Of course, it depends on producing but you can clearly tell if you alternate headphones. When I first got these headphones, I was astonished. This thing was giving great clarity, and great bass on both Heavy metal and Hip Hop. For people who listens to more pop music or songs that focus's on vocals, do not worry, the clarity on this headphones will make it seem like the artist is right there beside you. Overall grade 10/10Genres -Hip-Hop - Great sound. It provides clear vocals and gives you huge bass power which will leave your headphones vibrating...literally. 10/10Heavy Metal/Hard Rock - Although this is great too, but sometimes for rock songs these lack serious bass. However, if your listening to heavy metal, you will not miss a single bass drop and you will be able to distinguish every instrument and follow along clearly. I guess rock songs are produced to keep listeners attention on guitar and vocals, so it's not a big thing. 9/10Country - What can I say? The voice's are crisp, the instruments are clear, and the songs just sound great. 10/10Electronic/Dubstep - Just like hip-hop, great bass and clarity. Get ready for your headphones to vibrate. Don't worry, the bass isn't going to overpower the rest.Overall, these headphones are great if your a music fan in general. I've been using them for over a year and I have not had a bad experience with them other than the wire. The best thing about these headphones is that, once the music is on, you will not be able to hear anything else, so technically they can be noise cancellation.

$REVIEW.: I just recieved the Ipod nano 16 GB 4th generation the other day, and i just set it up, got the itunes program downloaded, connect the ipod,  kick back and relax. what ever songs i had on my limewire pro and Windows media player, itunes transfered them over to teir player and formatted some and sync with nano. after all this is done, i listened to the music., WOW!, it is clear and there is no hissing from the songs i downloaded, I still haven't made a dent in the music download. thias is how much is in 1 GB 8,192 MB = 1 GB, now times it by 16., now that is alot of songs.i was taken back with the nano at first, it is slightly taller than the original nano and it is slim. the only thing i don't like is the earbuds, they are so uncomfortable that my ears started to ache.I decided to use my Sony over the ear earbuds (they hook over the ear and the piece is inserted comfortabley).over all everything is awesome, except for the earbuds, they are made of hard plastic and don't sit right in the ear, they keep falling out slightly.The other reviews dis on the Ipod for one reason or another., well these people are Ipod challenged or they got a bad batch.I like electronics and always figure things out.so if you see mostly positive reviews then go get one for yourself.

$review_text.: The box arrived quickly - no issue with the purchase.  Everything was inside the box, except for the rubber feet for the speakers.  This is an issue, but a minor one.After I hooked everything up, I found two issues.1) It doesn't cross-connect different video types - for example I had an XBox with a RGB component? (or is it composite) video, and I couldn't get it to "route" through the component interface on the A/V receiver and go to the TV's HDMI input.  So I literally had to hook the TV  up to the AV receiver twice - one via hdmi, and once via component.  And even then, the sound wasn't playing.  It was very frustrating.  I thought I would have to switch the TV between different inputs, as well as the AV Receiver, etc..... But then I realized that I had apparently *bought* a component video connector for my XBox - the native output is HDMI.  So I hooked it in to the HDMI, and it worked great.Having said all of that, the problem still exists - if you have component and hdmi inputs, you are going to struggle with getting them all hooked up and communicating with your TV.  If you need that kind of solution, this is not the device for you, and it's not particularly obvious from the description page that this is an issue.2) When I hit 'blu ray' on the remote, it switches to the blu-ray input, and suddenly I can't adjust the sound type (Pro Logic, Dolby, etc).  I have to hid the 'receiver' button on the remote.  Which is a bit confusing and annoying.Other than those 2 1/2 issues, it is a great deal for the price.  Good form factor, nice design.  Speakers are a bit big.Oh, Inception, with the subwoofer going, looks great, and is impressively bone-rattling

$REVIEW.: I use this on my Olympus E-500, I was told buy a guy in a camera store that it wouldnt work with my camera, but I read another review on amazon by someone who was using it with their E-500. It works just fine, Im new to flash photography and I wish I hadnt waited so long to get a flash for my camera. I just set my shutter speed to the max sync speed and match the ISO and aperture from the camera to the flash. I use this on my camera, but mostly I use it on a light stand with a wireless trigger and a reflector kit. I have done two photo shoots and taken over 400 shots with it and it works great. Im not sure if this is a common problem with most flashes, but it seems to go through batteries like crazy. I can get about 20-30 shots and it starts taking like 30 seconds to charge up again. Im looking into getting the AC adapter for it.

$review_text.: Nowadays, security cameras have been essential for both businesses and residential. Having the security of knowing what is happening at all times is a great comfort having. HooToo has made the HooToo HT-IP210F Wireless IP Network Surveillance Camera as a way to maintain a secure atmosphere.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; IP Camera&#8226; Wi-Fi Antenna&#8226; User manual&#8226; DC power supply cord&#8226; CD Rom&#8226; Ethernet cord&#8226; Mounting Bracket&#8226; 4 mounting screws with drywall inserts&#9654; Accessories (Needs DC Power cord length and mounting bracket updated)The Ethernet cord is 56 inches with a thick gauged wire. Although the cord is short, this is definitely one of the better built Ethernet cords I own. The Ethernet cord will do what it is intended for and help setup the IP camera.The DC power cord is 57 inches with a 2.75 x 1 x 1.5 inch brick at the end of the cord. I would normally name this a con, because it would block neighboring outlets, but I would expect this cord to be attached to some sort of extension cord and not a surge protector.The mounting bracket has a 4 x 4 circular platform, with a 20 threaded screw that goes into the center of the bottom of the camera. This platform is guided by a 3 inch arm, which is almost able to maneuver in a little over 90. On the bottom of the bracket is the 3.75 x 1.5 platform that can screw into a wall. The mounting bracket is very nice if you need to place your camera in a position that is other than up-right.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Powerful high-speed video protocol processor&#8226; High-sensitivity &#8221; CMOS sensor&#8226; Picture total 300k pixels&#8226; Support PT control, Pan 320, Tilt 120&#8226; Optimized MJPEG video compression for transmission&#8226; Multi-level users management and passwords definition&#8226; Embedded web server for users to visit by IE&#8226; Support wireless network (WI-FI/802.11/b/g)&#8226; Supporting Dynamic IP (DDNS) and UPNP LAN and Internet (ADSL, Cable Modem)&#8226; Giving Alarm in case of motion detection&#8226; Supporting image snapshot&#8226; Support multiple protocols: HTTP/TCP/IP/UDP/SMTP/DDNS/SNTP/DHCP/FTP&#8226; Support WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption&#8226; Support 3G phone, Smart phone control and surveillance&#8226; Support Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome browser&#9654; HardwareThe camera is a little bigger than today&#8217;s webcams (8.3 x 4.9 x 6.6 inches; 2 pounds), with a matt black or white plastic design. The front has the lens, light sensitive censor, 10 infrared LEDs, network indicator LED, and microphone. The right side has the speaker, and back has the RJ-45 (Ethernet) port, Wi-Fi antenna, 5V power socket, audio output, alarm I/O pins, microphone output, reset button, and SD card port. The bottom has the specifications and threaded hole for the mounting bracket. Overall, this is an all-in-one camera that seems to have everything it should have.&#9654; Software SetupHooToo provides two pieces of software for this device &#8220;IP Camera Tool&#8221; and &#8220;IPCamClient&#8221;. Don&#8217;t worry if you are initially confused, because I was. After reading the manual, &#8220;IP Camera Tool&#8221; is the only tool required. Follow the following directions to install your camera:1. Install the &#8220;IP Camera Tool&#8221; and then restart your computer.2. Plug your DC power supply into your camera and power your device.3. Wait approximately 30 seconds for your device to be read4. Open the &#8220;IP Camera Tool&#8221; Program5. You should see &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; and &#8220;Subnet doesn&#8217;t match, double click to change!&#8221;6. Check the box &#8220;Obtain IP from DHCP Server&#8221; This will automatically setup your device that is connected to your router. If you want to change the user/password and HTTP Port then feel free to.7. Your device should be connected. Congratulations. Now, you will be redirected to a website that you can view your camera. If you want to make this device wireless then continues to step 8.8. After you are on your website i.e 192.168.0.12/main.htm, enter username &#8220;admin&#8221; and password blank (nothing here), click the Network tab and then &#8220;Wireless Lan Settings&#8221;.9. Click the Scan button under &#8220;Wireless Network List&#8221;10. Choose your network, key, and then click the submit button.11. Congratulations, you should now be able to use your camera wirelessly!&#9654; SoftwareThe website includes tabs for &#8220;Live Video, Multi-Device, Network, Audio Video, System, and Other&#8221;.&#8226; Live video- Self explanatory&#8226; Multi-Device- Upgrade device firmware, restore to factory settings, or reboot device. I would assume this would be used for multi-camera view, but it is instead used for factory settings.&#8226; Network- Basic network settings, wireless LAN settings, ADSL settings, UPnP settings, DDNS Service settings&#8226; Audio video- Reversal, mirror. This has no audio settings, but may have settings when an audio source is connected.&#8226; System- Device settings, alias settings, Date and Time settings, User settings, PT Settings, (LED) indicator settings, backup and restore settings, log, and MSN settings. Nothing really to note here other than it includes &#8220;MSN Settings&#8221;; an instant massaging program that has been discontinued since 2013.&#8226; Other &#8211; Mail service settings, FTP server settings, Alarm settings. I like that this includes settings for FTP and mail services so you can always be updated of the images from your work.Under the vertical tabs are options to change &#8220;Resolution, Mode, Bright, and Contrast&#8221;.&#8226; Resolution &#8211; 160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 x 480&#8226; Mode &#8211; 50 Hz, 60 Hz, Outdoor&#8226; Bright &#8211; 0 to 15&#8226; Contrast &#8211; 0 to 6Under that is a circular compass to move the camera whichever direction you want.

Although the website doesn&#8217;t look very appealing, it is very functional for the purpose of the camera. There are other supplemental software choices, such as Blue Iris, which use a very intuitive design, and give audio functionality, which the website doesn&#8217;t provide, for compatible devices such as this one, but cost extra money. These supplemental pieces of software, however, do not provide full functionality that the website provides, such as horizontal, vertical patrol, and setting one of the nine preset positions. Whether you like it or not, you will need to use the website at least a few times.&#9654; TestingI placed this camera in the kitchen, which is also the location of one of the entries of the house, for about a week. During this time, I noticed the camera did go offline a few times, which required me to reset the IP address of the camera, however these problems were very minimal. The picture is only 640 x 480, which isn&#8217;t HD by any means, but you can make out images clearly; whether it would be in light or night vision. I have yet to see a reason for using the full pan and tilt features, unless I would be using this for business purposes. As said in software, you would not be able to hear the audio through the website, instead you would need to use supplemental software, such as Blue Iris to listen to your IP camera. The audio on this camera, using Blue Iris, was very clear. I could literally hear a pin drop from the next room. Unfortunately though, as of today, I have not figured out how to use the speaker that is included on the side of the camera. I would like to use this as an intercom system, since the camera has a speaker and microphone, but have yet to see this function. In the end, if you&#8217;d be using this as a baby or child monitor, you would be able to tell if your children were in danger.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThe camera is very functional. It is able to listen and monitor images clearly, but it isn&#8217;t HD clear. If you are looking for an IP camera that can see individual hairs on your back then I&#8217;d suggest looking elsewhere, however, if you are looking for a security camera or baby monitor that performs well, then I would definitely recommend this camera. Because of the functionality and performance, I give this IP camera a 5 star rating. My only room for improvement would be for the included speaker to function, but I don&#8217;t find it a necessity.Pros:+ Able to be used during daytime or nighttime, with the ability to+ Includes several options such as presets, zoom in and out, and horizon patrol. These are great functional settings that optimize the camera&#8217;s capabilities.+ Includes options for FTP and mail service so you can monitor your home while you are at work.+ Antenna is able to bend in 360 degree motion to give the best Wi-Fi connection.Cons:- Could not get included speaker to function.- Software design is functional but is frustrating to use and isn&#8217;t very aesthetically pleasing; it is preferred to use supplemental software, which can be an additional cost.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.
$review_summary.: It isn&#8217;t HD, but it is clear. Speaker and microphone functionality is a great plus, but I wasn&#8217;t able to get speaker working.

Super high value due to price:performance ratio.Very easy to install and good hardware for connections.  The &#34;old work&#34; clips they use are very friendly and I have had no problems with them - even mounted and remounted a couple of times, being careful not to back out the screws so much that the tabs fall off.When I did my framing and prewired my space, I added blocking that made a sound box (without insulation) that these fit into.

$review_text.: This is an excellent hard drive and the best part is the on/off switch in the front, which later models eliminated.  However, it does have a "sleep" functionality that works well.  One flakey thing, though, is if you shut if off manually at the switch, when you shut down your computer, it "wakes up" the hard drive and you have to manually turn off the hard drive again.  Small problem, nothing to worry about.  Apparently the "sleep" trigger on the hard drive just senses any shutdown or wakeup of the desktop.  Overall, a great item to have with lots of storage space and is very, very quiet when its running.

$REVIEW.: I have used the LG BD590 for three months. It is unfortunate that the BD90's remote control doesn't have a working volume control. The TV cannot be turned off by the remote. Turning on the BD590 using the remote turns on my Samsung LCD HDTV; however, turning off the BD590 using the remote does NOT turn off the TV.  Connecting a USB flash drive (thumb drive) requires keeping the plastic front cover open which exposes the area to dust, makes the cover more prone to accidents plus it is awkward and unsightly ruining any design esthetic. The LG is not Mac compatible. The LG website says "With MyMedia, it's easy to bring your digital entertainment libraries within easy reach to the big-screen" That is not true for people with Macs. The LG BD590 is not Mac compatible for Media Link so if you have a Mac the BD590 will not play/display video, photos and music files from your computer. The BD590 Home Link feature cannot connect to an Apple wireless home network. Although it's not network compatible with Macs it will pick up the WiFi signal from an Apple Airport Extreme wireless router (but so does any wireless device including Windows computers.) Page 43 of the Manual says, "You can copy music, photo, video file(s)/ folder(s) from disc/USB storage device to the internal hard disk drive." However, the BD590 cannot read a Mac formatted USB External Hard Drive for copying files to the hard drive.  It should be noted that LG never claimed its BD590 was Mac compatible however there was no disclaimer on the advertising or box that the LG BD590 was not Mac compatible.  I would recommend the LG BD590 for anyone who has a Windows computer for transferring/displaying media files but their "MediaLink" does not work with Macs. While I've grown used to the on/off button and the open/close button placement by now, they are positioned counterintuitively since the tray that opens and closes is on the left next to the on/off button and the tray open/close button is on the side of the unit that is opposite of the tray. This may be picky but together with the issue of having to keep the front cover open if a USB flash drive (thumb drive) is connected for playing music or video media files, it shows poor engineering design. The ability to have unlimited streamed movies-on-demand in 1080i HiDef from Netflix for $8.99 using the BD590 has been so rewarding and unbelievably inexpensive that I haven't watched Cable TV for three months! Netflix streams TV series seasons too. Why pay $3 - $5+ per movie for cable or dish/satellite movies-on-demand when with the LG HD Network Blu-ray player you can have unlimited movies and TV series on demand for under $9? Of course you can do this with any internet connected DVD or Blu-ray disc player that has the Netflix service available but it surely works well with the LG BD590 because the wireless internet connection is so fast and solid. The free Pandora Internet Radio is a great feature plus ripping your own CDs to the hard drive is very easy and works perfectly seamlessly with the Gracenote database of cover art and track data. Watching You Tube videos on my LCD HDTV is a nice feature too. Bottom line: If you want a wireless, networked, internet connectible Blu-ray disc player with a hard drive this is the only unit available with an internal hard drive at this time (07/19/2010.)

$review_text.: I know these computers look best when naked, as does my iPhone 5, but a clear case is such a practical investment!  For $20, you won't get a better quality case than this one.  It snaps right on and doesn't add much bulk.  I wish the top cover came a bit closer to the edge, but it's close enough and I'm happy with how everything looks.  Since my dog walks all over my wife's laptop, I knew when I got this that I'd need some extra protection.  The keyboard cover and stylus are a nice added bonus.  Materials are durable and I look forward to using this case with my retina MacBook Pro!
$SUMMARY.: Best additional investement for your rMBP!

$review_text.: The Energy ESW-M6 800 Watt Mini Subwoofer is the best subwoofer that I have experienced

 I have a Mirage Omni S8 Subwoofer and a Sony SA-W10 Subwoofer
 All of them can put out the bass sound as loud as I need it, but the Sony lacks bass resolution


 The sounds are a little fuzzy
 The Mirage and the Energy subs both have a lot of bass detail

 The Energy sub has such realistic detail that the drums (and other instruments) feel very real


 The design has one active front firing 6.5 inch aluminum driver with very good power handling and is supported by two 6.5 inch aluminum passive woofers on each side
 I prefer front firing subs over downward firing subs, because the former are not affected by the kind of floor one has and tends to produce less shaking of the floor
 The passive woofers spread out the sound very nicely and add a noticeable dimension to the sound.I am amazed at how good the 8x8x8 inch speaker (800 watts!) cube sounds, since it is one of the smallest subs I have had

 The small size makes it easier to fit into a room, though the placement is partly dictated by the need to have open space around the side passive woofers.My set up presently includes two Polk bookshelf speakers and two Mirage Omnisat speakers (these radiate sound 360 degrees through a 70/30 reflection ratio for natural 3D imaging)

 The Energy sub kicked the whole system up a notch

 I set the crossover dial so that it would take in everything below 200 hz and set the volume about 1/3 up


 I ran Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells (the new version with a lot of drums), the intro bass line from the Beatles "Come Together", and Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On?" to test the bass sound
 The realism really showed up on the Beatles piece and was very good for the other two pieces

 All these pieces were played from Youtube Videos and, even though the sound quality of the original source was not ideal, the compositions still sounded very good

 I later on experimented with some Mellow Trance music ("Catch a Fall" by 4Strings) and found it also did very well
 Finally, I tested Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture Finale and could hear the Kettle Drums in detail.The aluminum drivers seem to allow it to handle a good deal of power

 I did not find any volume level that the sub could not handle (though I only pushed it up as far as I could imagine ever needing to go, this is not as far as some people might want to go).A few notes:  The Energy sub has the usual adaptive dials for phasing, volume, and crossover, but when it comes to input it does not have the clips for speaker wires or a high power pass through to regular speakers


 It has two RCA ports for stereo subwoofer input, with the left channel being for mono subwoofer input


 It is designed for the newer amplifiers that have special outputs for subwoofers


 I am not sure if it is a dual coil which can handle stereo bass input and can convert it to some kind of stereo output

 I was not able to test this, since my system only has a mono sub out


 I am mainly giving this note for those who might want to use this sub with a standard stereo amplifier (these are getting harder to find)


 It still might be possible to do this through using a headphone jack with a volume dial (and maybe even an adapter to lock into the RCA stereo sub inputs)

 The Mirage can take direct output from a regular stereo amplifier through wire clips, but also does not have a pass through to regular speakers
 The Sony has a pass through to regular speakers and so is adaptive to more amplifiers


 The Energy sub is the least adaptive in this regard and is built only to work with amps with a sub out (mono or stereo)

 When I opened the box, it looked like it was missing the power chord, but it was way in the bottom of the box, below the styrofoam packing material
 Both the Mirage and the Energy (related companies from Canada) have "elliptical surrounds" which do seem to add detail and resolution to the sound


 The Mirages are older and it seems that the Energy sub has improved and refined a good sub design to make it even better.Update 8/21/2013: My brother gifted me some Energy bookshelf speakers that perfectly match the cube subwoofer, the realism of the total system is the best sound that I have had

 The current configuration is the Energy cube subwoofer, the two Energy bookshelf speakers, two Mirage Omnisats (surround sound emulators), and a Dayton center channel all driven by a Sony 5.1 amplifier

 The Energy cube subwoofer has continued to produce high quality bass sound in this configuration without diminishing its quality at all


 I would recommend that people who get this subwoofer also match it with some Energy bookshelf speakers to get a perfect sound match
 They seem designed to work together seamlessly.

$review_text.: While I have not yet received this computer, I'm excited to get it and set it up.  This purchase has been made for my husband as a birthday gift and I will update upon its arrival and usage.  The reasons for this review is that I currently am using an HP Pavillion dv6, purchased two years ago through Amazon which still meets all of my needs and then some.  Many have noted that this particular model (g7) is not for gaming. I do not know what type of gaming is out there and what they are referring to, but I"m currently using the dv6 (as I type) and it more than provides for the gaming I and my husband like to do.  Both my laptop and the one ordered have the same gaming capabilities.  I cannot see this as being an issue for us.  (We both game on Pogo of which some games are very graphic intensive).  I personally have used/owned HP laptops for roughly seven years and have never had an issue worth mentioning.  The HD is second to none and delivers a quite enjoyable experience while watching a simple news feed or a full movie. Others have made comments regarding the wifi capabilty.  This model provides the same extensions as the dv6 and with the dv6 I can go next door (some 100ft away from the modem) and still work like I could in home.  Those experiencing problems 10ft out are beyond my understanding as to why, so do not let those comments deter you from considering this product based on that.Edit - As promised, I'd update after receiving this laptop.  Given we have had it over three months now, I must say my husband LOVES it.  Getting him to switch from a desktop to a laptop, was going to be a challenge for me.  The screen size meets the same size as his monitor and he's grown very used to being able to close the lid and have a clean looking desktop.  Setup was a breeze, taking down the old desktop, not so much.  I'm thrilled that he has grown accustomed to the ease of use with a laptop.  Re: Battery life - I think it must be a lot more than the advertised five hours, as when I'd dismantled the desktop and all of the wires, I completely forgot to plug in the power cord to the laptop, though had the line run thru the desk.  He used the laptop for several hours after set up, and again first thing in the morning for several hours.  Given he runs some high intensity sites and programs, there was still about 1/4 of battery power left before I discovered that I'd forgotten to plug it in.  I'm a bit jealous that his runs so much faster than my current model, but mine still fills the bill.The one con that I've found so far.  I had a major problem trying to lock the battery in.  For the first few months it would fall out if picked up.  I gave up as nothing I did would lock it in.  The other day I had to take his laptop and fix a mistake he'd made on it...and of course the battery fell out, AGAIN.  I have no clue what I did, maybe it was my frustration of having to deal with it again, but it "snapped" into place and no longer falls out.  All in all, he is very happy with this laptop, as am I - not having to clean up around a ton of wires anymore!

$review_text.: I have been a fan of the Koss headphones for a long time now.  They provide great quality at a good price, which is the goal for anything I buy.When I saw these conical shape earbuds, I was a bit skeptical, but between the reviews and my trust in Koss, I decided to pick some up.  I use my earbuds predominantly while doing things at the house like yard work, home projects or gardening, so they are used in a rough environment.Some of the reviews indicated twisting the cone pieces as you would foam earplugs help them fit better.  I did not find this to be the case.  I tried both ways, and found simply sliding them in was more then sufficient for staying in my ear and for producing the level of noise isolation I like when operating lawn equipment, etc.The sound is excellent, not a surprise with Koss.  If I were to complain about one thing, it initially would have been the in line volume control, which I had a odd tendency to bump while working and turn the volume down or up, depending on what position it started in.  Several weeks after buying them, however, I like the simplicity of being able to quickly cut the sound if I need to hear something or if someone is trying to talk to me instead of having to remove the earbud.Product was delivered timely, in excellent condition, and they have worked flawlessly.  In Koss I trust!!

$REVIEW.: These lights are good if you know what to do with them.  I'm a photographer and graphic designer that dabbles in video from time to time.  I did a couple of quick tests with these lights and here's my opinion:1)  These lights are bright enough for doing studio photography in a small, possibly medium sized, studio.  I work in a 10x15 foot studio space with three walls.  One side opens up into a 10x10 seating/interview area.  I know my 5D will work fine with the lighting so I tried my T3i instead.  I took several shots at f1.8 and 2.2 with a 50mm prime.  I metered at ISO 400 and was getting good shots at 1/125 and perfect exposure at 1/80.  It's worth mentioning that the only light source I used was these three lights.2)  Without changing the lighting or location, I tried some video work.  Shooting at 24fps, still at ISO 400 and f2.8, the video coming from the T3i was a little dark for my tastes.  Definitely usable, but I would have liked to see a better result.  To be perfectly clear, I wouldn't suggest these lights for 2-up shots in interviews...unless they are just supplementing existing ambient light.3)  As other reviewers have mentioned, the light stands themselves are mediocre.  But when you consider the price, they are better than expected.  I do notice that if I leave a light stand fully extended with the softbox on it, the top pole may bend after a while.  I would think this would take a while to happen...but I'm pretty sure it will happen if you aren't careful.  Luckily, these lights were never purchased for using as a hair/rim light, so I doubt I will have to be concerned with it.4)  Other people reviewing this (and similar products) mention softbox construction is a pain.  And I agree...sort of.  The first softbox I put together took me longer than I thought it would.  Close to 10 minutes.  But the second and third softbox went faster.  Regardless, if you don't have to take these apart, don't.  I would suggest leaving the softbox/light assembly together and just take them off the stand.  It will save you 20+ minutes of setup.
$review_summary.: Good if you know what you're doing.

$REVIEW.: Allow me to explain step by step. Everything worked as it should be as a dual HDD dock, except for 2 features. Hot-swapping feature and LED indicator.This dock does not allow its user to turn off and on a HDD individually. There are some dual/quad HDD docks that has separate switches, if you are looking for those kinds. Anyhow, the description obviously says &#34;supports hot-swappable,&#34; but I'm not sure what is the qualification for such &#34;feature&#34; to properly kick-in. I had to hook 3 of this docks up with Mac, and hot-swapping feature never worked correctly for me. In case you are wondering how I did it, I had a thunderbolt dock that had USB 3.0 ports, and I plugged the docks in through the thunderbolt dock. Computer supported USB 3.0 as it is, but I wanted to make cord-free and more portable environment.As for LED indicator, you wouldn't need a light, not even a single one, in your room with the dock on. That's how bright it is. It's bright, and it's blue. I had kids from neighbors knocking on the door on Halloween even without the decorations, saying they saw &#34;blue lights coming out from the window.&#34; I'm not sure why it has to be this extensively bright. It could simply be an indicator, and we already have a huge physical switch sticking out of a dock as well. I ended up putting two post-it notes to cover the indicator and the switch.It hasn't failed me, but it surely lacks the details.

$REVIEW.: It took quite a bit of trial and error before I could use these reliably during my lap swims, but now that I know some tricks it works great! I found the biggest issues are the waterproof ear buds and shape of the unit itself


The ear buds are long and if you don't get them far enough into your ears they will actually bend, cutting off all the sound

The shape and fit of the unit makes it very un-hydrodynamic when used normally

I'm a competitive swimmer at heart and swim fast, so I may need to be more careful about how I wear these than some of the more leisurely swimmers


Here is what I found works best:- use a lycra swim cap (way more comfortable than the latex ones anyway)- use the smallest ear buds you can get away with (keeps ear pieces more stable)- dry your ears with a towel before putting them on (better seal when dry)- put headphones on normally, except angle them up so that they sit vertically (back bar may touch the back of your neck)- pull the swim cap over the ear pieces- tuck the back bar under the bottom of the swim cap (keeps it from rubbing on your neck)- pull goggles into place, so that they go right above the ear pieces (holds them steady)Now they don't shift around at all and I can listen to music reliably, even when swimming butterfly or doing flip turns
I've used these headphones about 15 times now and absolutely love them


It's a whole different experience swimming laps to music


Sometimes I forget how far I've gone, because I'm spending more time enjoying the music than counting laps.

$review_text.: These cables are durable and do exactly what they are supposed to do. The price is a little higher than I would have liked, but that'll surely be a thing of the past once DisplayPort is as popular as HDMI. Regardless, it's a great cable and has been working solid for a few weeks shy of a full year. Definitely recommend!

$REVIEW.: Product is OK I guess. It records, and the movies are in good quality, but I was not informaed it was put together like a plastic model car!! It is SUPER light weight, almost like you are not even holding it! Second problem is I was NOT informed that I needed to put batteries in it. I usually buy things like this with a battery pack already included!! It eats the batteries fast also! Lastly, but certainly not least, you MUST have the FASTEST SDRam card in it or it will NOT record! So instead of buying a 64 Gig SDRam card for 25.00... You will have to buy a 28 Gig for 70.00 to make sure it is fast enough to process the movies, and pics!But above all, I give this seller a 5 star rating, because it is NOT their problem that I did not look into the product good enough before buying it!

$review_text.: These cables are simply wonderful.  They are nice red to match the usual cable coloring.  The latches work perfectly and I have never had a problem with any of them (I have bought quite a few).  As long as you aren't trying to man-handle these delicate electronics like a lot of people do, then the latches are awesome.  I have never had any data issues and the throughput is wonderful.  The connectors are also a standard size as well, I have had other cables in the past that were a little wide and don't fit nicely side by side with the power cables on drives.  These are absolutely perfect and I have already stocked up for my future needs.

$review_text.: My friend recently called me a &#34;digital hippie&#34; because I told him I was getting tired of listening to my digital music collection. While I take great pride in my music library - huge, completely lossless and maniacally organized - increasingly I've been feeling like the experience is a bit sterile. And I mean the actual experience of listening to music: paying attention to it, letting yourself get lost in it. Feeling the artwork and notes in your hands. In this era of instant gratification and diminished attention spans, my ever-growing digital collection has had the ironic effect of making it harder for me to focus on individual albums and give them the time they deserve.That's why I decided screw it, I am going to find a dedicated CD player, hook it up to the home theater system I have in my bedroom, and start buying CDs again. The Onkyo C-7030 immediately rose to the top of my list because of the more reliable single-disc operation, the decent price compared to audiophile alternatives and the plethora of positive reviews. I wanted something quality, but not in the hundreds or thousands of dollars range, especially for a technology like this.I have to add my praise to the pile now too. This player really is excellent. I have a decent Samsung home theater system (the HT-E6500W model with the vacuum tube amps), and it's nowhere near audiophile grade, but good enough that I could immediately hear the superior sound quality from CDs with the Onkyo hooked up. The bass especially filled out and came through stronger, and the rest of the spectrum just sounded fuller and cleaner. (In case anyone's curious I use the optical out on the Onkyo to send the audio signal to the Samsung BluRay player, which is then processed by the player's vacuum tube amps and amplified a second time before reaching the speakers. Bottom line: it's not like having a full component system but it sounds good.)I won't go so far to say that a CD player has really changed my life, but I will say it's renewed my love for CDs and I am hunting down discs for different reasons now: Maybe I never bought them when I was younger, or I'm replacing ones that were stolen from me years ago, or maybe just to have better copies and get rid of old damaged ones. Either way this Onkyo rocks and I highly recommend it if you're anything like me with your music obsessions.

$REVIEW.: This soundbar is very easy to use and has good sound quality


Recently returned 2 different polk sound bars (which were highly rated) and bought this one for 2x the price


I've used it quite a bit for 5 days now and I like everything about it
For me, it's worth the extra money to have something that has really nice sound and can be controlled from the tv remote or any smart device with the sonos app

I especially like that it can stream / play music without needing the TV or anything else to be turned on also.Lastly, I like the fact that in the future, if I ever want to expand my sound system,  I can just buy more sonos speakers and they will play nicely with each other.

$REVIEW.: Essentially, this is the entry-level, 16-bit audio Creative Labs sound  card. It has a built-in mock '3D' stereo effect, a 128-voice MIDI  wavetable, and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16-bit stereo, and that's  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesn't do anything wrong in itself  (it's plug-and-play, so if you're using Windows it should work out of the  box), the Soundblaster Live isn't much more expensive, and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and don't play many  new games it's a perfectly adequate solution, however.

$REVIEW.: This year was tough for the firewall/routers on the home network.  In ten months I exchanged a Linksys BEFSX41 (bricked during a firmware upgrade) for a Linksys RT41-BU.  The Linksys RT41-BU was replaced with a Netgear FVS114.  The Netgear FVS114 seemed better than some but not as good as others, so I decided to get another firewall/router. I am glad I selected the mighty Buffalo WHR-G54S.  I have to say that I am impressed with the Buffalo WHR-G54S.  Out of the box, the user interface is simple and the system does what it says (i.e. switch, router, firewall, an access point). If a person replaces the stock firmware with DD-WRT, the unit suddenly becomes the best value for your money.  All I wanted was a simple firewall/router combo with an access point.  I now have that in a machine that does not mind telling me what it is doing and why.

$review_text.: I happened to run into a bad stick of RAM; it happens.  I filled out the RMA this morning and had the advanced RMA approval confirmed this afternoon.  I actually then wanted to change the RMA from advanced RMA (cross shipment) to standard RMA (send upon receipt).  So I called Kingston support number provided in the email and without any menu tree I was connected straight to a rep who immediately changed my RMA to the type I wanted.  She followed up with an email while I was on the phone to make sure I had all the info for sending the RAM in.  She said new RAM will be shipped out next business day.I have always and will continue to purchase Kingston RAM.  Occasionally you might get a bad chip, but very very rarely from Kingston.  However, the RMA process I just went through was so quick, so simple; no complaints.  Anyone can and will sell you a product but how many companies provide this kind of support?  I was done with my RMA in 10 minutes of total time between filling out the online form and even calling in to change the RMA type.FYI: I had to RMA a Corsair RAM chip and the whole process took 5 weeks and coutless hours of my time. No comparison to Kingston.So, I thought to review the RAM based on excellent RMA service.

$review_text.: I'm no professional photographer, but I take my hobby very seriously. My current gear consists of a Nikon D300s with the Nikon 16-85 and Nikon 70-300 setup. I used to own a bunch of heavy 2.8 lenses, but I sold them a couple of years ago for the lighter load. People are complaining that this lens is heavy, which I find funny. My 70-300 is about as heavy as this one and my camera isn't light to begin with. I'm a petite 4'-11" woman and I have no problem using the 18-300 on my D300s.I've been using this lens for a couple of weeks now and I'm quite pleased and rather surprised at the great results I'm getting. I'm not one to carry around a tripod, so I'm basing this on hand held images. This past weekend I went to a local botanical garden here in Miami, FL and got some fantastic results (copy and paste the link in this review to see my images from this lens). Hopefully they won't delete the link. I hope that seeing what you can do with this lens helps some of you with your decision to purchase this lens. I'm more than happy with my purchase and at just under $700, this is a really good purchase. I urge you to take classes at your local community college and to read books and manuals about your camera. I've been shooting digital photography with an SLR camera since 2006. Know your camera and your gear...that's the best advice I can give you.[...]

$REVIEW.: My initial experience with the NP2300 has been quite good. In short, the sound quality and features described are as advertised.The unit has a fairly easy to navigate menu (though no key to quickly scroll down a long list.) Very good sound for small size, but there is a large power brick you'll need to lug around with the somewhat heavy device and no battery option. There is decent bass and other sound options (maybe too many artificially sounding "Living Sound, Full Sound, etc." options.) Actually, the unit is better better sounding if you're sitting a few feet away. The volume gets loud enough, it just takes a while holding down on the button on the remote to change.I was quickly was able to type in my wireless network information (including WPA2) via the mobile phone-type keypad on the included remote. Seems to be plenty of bandwidth when over 802.11g; signal distance seems good. There's a large list of Internet radio stations, including local radio stations, which I think by far is the most valuable feature of the device. All controls have to be done from remote (i.e. song changes), slightly inconvenient if you're not near the device.I use a Mac, so to sync my library, I had to use the included TwonkyServer. It works ok and seems well done, though did require some restarts of the services to get the player to recognize my computer on the network. Not an easy process. Uses up quite a few CPU cycles and memory once running, not ideal for constant running on a machine. I was able to get the device to find my iTunes playlists..though it took almost a minute for the device to pull them up. The server sometimes goes out and says unavailable, the device froze up once and I had to pull the power plug from the back. When I booted into WIndows via Parallels, it was already detected, so the device is clearly uPnP compliant as advertised, without any additional software installation. This function is probably better for Windows users...I'm not interested in Rhapsody and its monthly commitment, but might be good for some folks. The AUX input might be handy for some folks as you can plug in an iPod or other audio device and share the speakers.Screen is good quality, but where is the video or picture viewing if you're going to spend several hundred dollars. At this point, I'm thinking how is this any different from an iPod touch which gives you Internet radio options and you can store music locally, of which you can't do can't do on this device. It's not a bad device, and it works as advertised -- you just have to make sure it meets your needs.
$SUMMARY.: Interesting device, high cost

So much that I am selling it or giving it away


It's next to impossible to slip the iPhone into the slot with one hand, so I have to use both and it feels like I am man handling it to get the iPhone in the dock


Yes, I have the cover off

Then, when the iPhone finally does go into the dock, even when the the little plastic stand is down, the speaker always falls over

I don't think it's made well enough to support the iPhone in the cradle

The bass is too prominent

That's great for some songs, but not all
There are no controls to get more treble in the sound
 Also, sometimes a screen will come up and say that the accessory is not optimized for the iPhone even though it clearly is supposed to be


It has too many bugs

The body is too wide for the back USB ports, so needs to be inserted into the front ports, this keeps the spring door open, and could possibly let in dust. And even in the front, it can only go in the left port, so could possibly block IR port (I haven't tested). It will be better to get the small SanDisk Cruzer drives instead.Once inserted, Xbox had no problem seeing and using the drive, and it meets the Xbox performance requirements. Keep in mind that Xbox 360 needs this to be FAT32 formatted, so drives more than 32GB are not supported.

It turned out so well that we replaced an aging computer with a second EeeBox.What we like is:1. Windows XP (albeit Home version).2. Almost no "hijacking free soft ware".3. Quiet, just about no sound at all.4. Low power consumption, no heat (these computers are running 24/7).5. Baby foot print; we have them mounted on the back of their monitors.We have both a wired and a wireless network in the office and are using both. The "bookkeeping server" is also the server for the SqueezeBox that plays our music.We upgraded the RAM to 2 GB. Looking at the EeeBox it looks like Mission Impossible to open it.

$REVIEW.: In spite of it's small size this Bluetooth adapter has excellent range.  To maximize range you really need a class 1 device on both ends.  If you don't changing adapters may or may not extend your range.  For me the standout feature of this adapter is that it simply works.  Just plug it in to your Windows XP or later machine and watch while it's detected and supported with Microsoft's Bluetooth drivers.  No fiddling around with poorly integrated software or drivers that other adapters require.This will be adapter number three for me.  I've had the other two for what must be years now and they're wonderful devices.  Over time they've been used to synchronize contact lists on mobile phones when they're in range, with a Bluetooth headset, with the Logitech PS3 keyboard, between two computers and more.  Today they're still plugged in and going strong.For now I'm staying away from the Bluetooth 3.0 devices in spite of the reviews (there's one particularly well reviewed device) simply because I don't want to use anyone but Microsoft's drivers.  Third party drivers may have more features but I never found them to be reliable.Bottom line is that unless you need Bluetooth 3.0 features, this adapter is small, convenient, easy to use and reliable.

$review_text.: I bought this at a local store in Netherlands and used almost daily for two months in a row.Good sound, not great for sure especially the bass, cause probably the speakers can't handle that much power.Btw, one day came back home and found the transformer not working anymore but that was the only transformer affected in my house cause modem/tv/cable and other electronic devices didn't get any damage.Went to the store and off course, that's not cover by the warranty ...
$SUMMARY.: The transformer broke after 3 months and is not in warranty

$REVIEW.: I bought this at Walmart on sale for 45 dollars and I bought a dual ds12 subwoofer to go with the amp. I have a box that is made of 1 1/4 inch mdf and I have some insulation in the back to simulate what polyfill does. any who this thing will pound!. I usually have it in my car and it sounds great in there to the point of the hair trick working if you push it as hard as it will go, though I don't like to do that since it will get very hot if you do that. Just for listening I have the gain at about half and it sounds very loud. my car puts out 14.7 volts so it is pretty loud. As of right now it is running in my room at 13.8 volts of my 18 amp continuous power supply (pyramid). The bass is clean and I have had no issues with it. The 30 amp fuse if running off of 12 volts means 360 watts. 13.8 =414 so the 400 watt claim for peak power is accurate. I highly recommend this amp and the dual ds12 subwoofer. a warning though is running it high will get it warm, but it still will run even if it is piping hot!UPDATEI tried this amp with 2 dual ds12 subwoofers at 2 ohm and it ran fine! this is 2 ohm stable and with that its probably closer to 200 watts rms. I didnt try since i didnt have the second sub installed in the box. I love it though works great after punishing that amp.off of my 13.8 volt power supply it would pull about 11 amps at 4 ohms of clean sound so roughly 151.2 nominal so the numbers are accurate!this is a quality amplifier and it will give really nice bass to your car.

$review_text.: First off, I had an expensive pair of Beats that I purchased, but using them in the Gym became a hassle because they would slide off of my head when I would bench, sit-up or do pushups. So finding an item that would still give me a reliable audio sound as well as stay in my ear no matter what task I was doing became a huge stepping stone that I had to overcome. Another reason for this purchase was because I use my iphone that has a case on it for my workout music and finding an armband or sleeve that you didn&#8217;t have to take the case off of was not a very simple task as also.I have to say that this is probably one of the better earphones that I have used in a very long time. Not only does it conform around your ear, but the oval design of the earphone itself coupled with several ear tips creates a tight snug fit that will stay in your ear no matter what workout you do. These are better than the circle design that my iphone came with that would slide out whenever I would sweat.The only reason why I dropped this from a 5 star rating to a 4 star is because the neoprene sleeve is not really durable as it started ripping on my arm during curl, biceps and triceps sessions and the wire is really short. If you want to put your ipod, iphone or whatever you use in your pocket you have to use the extension cable it comes with. The only downside of the extension cable is that it has a L shaped input which doesn&#8217;t work well if you use a iphone that has a case on it for your workout. In order to use the L shaped extension cable you probably have to take the Iphone case off so that the cable can fit better.But, overall this is probably one of the best cheap decisions that I made which actually paid off.
$SUMMARY.: Well worth the price!

 the first thing that came out was the manual and a plug that was about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide


 written on it was D/C to A/C

 Also on the manual it had in big letters be advised this set must be connected to cable or an outside antenna


 That stopped me in my tracks called APEX to find out what the heck the plug was all about and they didnt even know


 It was bought for OTA kitchen for I don't have cable connection in there..


What in the world would you want to covert D/C Power to A/C power

$REVIEW.: I purchased both a 10000 & 5600 batteries. The 5600 works well so far. Charged my Samsung Galaxy 3 phone quickly. But the 10000 battery would not stay on. It powered up then power down after 5secs I messaged the company and they told me this happens 1 in 100 batteries. I returned it and opted to replace it with the 8400 instead. The 10000 was too big for me. It's like a portable hard drive. Can't fit in pocket and is heavy. My main use is for charging my phone so this needs to fit in pocket.UPDATE: I added a 4th star. Great customer service in trying to help with my situation. I replaced the non-working 10000 with the 8400. I actually got it a day earlier. Seems to be working. The size is perfect to fit in a pocket or purse.
$SUMMARY.: I got one of those "1 in 100 fail" batteries.

$REVIEW.: There are a lot of great ear buds out there nowadays, but I'll always love wearing big goofy headphones. There's just something about putting them on and sitting back while listening to a track you like. I got a chance to try out this pair by SMS recently, and given how much these things cost, I was hoping to enter a whole new audio world, like I was listening to some of my favorite music for the first time.Nope. Not even close.First, I gotta talk about the presentation, as they went an extra mile with the packaging. The headphones come in a big box with a slipcase. There's practically no chance of the headphones being damaged during shipping because of how much protection there is. There are all kinds of graphics on the box, including a nice one of a couple of Stormtroopers blasting away [and probably missing] at their target. In addition to the headphones, you get some stickers, a football-esque zipper case for the headphones, a Star Wars cleaning cloth, a certificate of authenticity and an owner's manual. All of this stuff is cool to have, and really makes you feel like you have a collector's item, but had it not been included, I'm sure the price would've dropped a little bit.So how about the headphones? I wore them while listening to all kinds of different things- jazz, Latin, metal, game soundtracks, folk, podcasts/old radio shows and more. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by any means. They seem like average headphones to me. There's nothing bad about the audio- these are good, quality headphones, but there's no way I'd recommend these to anyone, no matter how much their money is burning a hole in their pocket, at this price point. I have a pair of in-ear headphones from Brainwavz that cost 1/10 as much as these and they produce nearly the same audio quality. The difference being that this SMS pair sounds better because they cover your ears. I don't think these are any better than the big goofy headphones I used to wear in the mid-90s.Comfort-wise, they're good. I wear glasses, and there's a little bit of pressure around my ears where the temple tips are. After a while, you don't notice it that much, yet as soon as I took the headphones off after 20 minutes, I felt a big relief. Still, the ear pads are very soft and comfortable for being on ear. It's just funny seeing the product with your own eyes, then scrolling to the top of this page to see the stock image, which is clearly edited, smoothing out the ear pads for some reason. And for what it's worth, I really like the black and white color scheme. It's simple and looks good. The Stormtrooper helmets are raised, not just printed on. The headphones can be adjusted for bigger heads, as you'd expect, and there's even some padding on the band that goes on top of your head. The cable plugs in to the left side, and includes a microphone that also lets your pause, fast forward and rewind tracks.If you really, REALLY like Star Wars and want some stylin' headphones, I guess these are your only options. You could do much worse, as far as looks are concerned, but man...the price is just way too much. You may as well spend 1/3 that and slap some Star Wars stickers on the sides of a pair of headphones with the same audio quality. I doubt these are going to sell out any time soon, so a price drop is inevitable. When the time comes, I recommend the Stormtrooper of Boba Fett models.
$review_summary.: -Good- audio quality and a cool design, but what's with the cost?

Big mistake, doesn't not have the abilities I need in a camera.

After comparing the product features and the hardware, I realized that the HD 5670 could bring much more value for the same price. The support for DirectX 11 is an advantage which the Nvidia counterpart doesn't have, besides the fact it has more cores, more memory bandwidth, a more robust heat sink, better driver support, 40 nm manufacturing process and a higher GPU clock. Furthermore, it doesn't require a powerful power source, so I could kept mine and save an amount of money I would have to spend if I had chosen a Geforce 9800 GTX+.

$review_text.: *** I wrote this review after owning the TV for a few weeks


 I have had it for 4 months now and it died this morning.This review is for those of you who worry that DLP or a rear projection TV won't cut it for picture quality

 I am coming from the undisputed KING of Flat Screens, a 50 inch Pioneer Kuro Plasma

 I needed something larger (that I could afford) and brighter as well

 (Kuro was starting to give up the ghost) After two weeks I am still very happy with this TV


 It's good points far outweigh it's bad, especially at their current price.The WD-60747 is true value for money

 Overall, the high def picture is almost as good as the top plasma displays, except for a small amount of light that WILL leak into the black bars of a wide screen movie or the side bars of a 3:4 SD TV show


 But without any danger of burn in to the screen, it is more than a fair tradeoff


 I can finally relax while watching correctly formatted standard content and not worry I am wrecking my $2500.00 dollar plasma!Actual black levels in the picture composition  are quite amazing and exceeded my expectations


 Kuro is the leader in actual blacks, so I had something really good to compare the Mitsubishi too


 Motion blur is at a minimum and usually the result of a slow processor in your DVR or cable box

 Motion blur while playing a blu ray is all but unnoticeable

 Again, I was pleasantly surprised


 And this is without using the 120hz which to my eyes introduces other artifacts into the picture, especially noticeable during a static image or slow moving scene

 Your choices for screen formatting are more than adequate and it is easy to display any program material in it's native aspect ratio, or to stretch it nicely to fill the screen


 The zoom function also offers a very nice looking alternative for 3:4 SD.My only real complaints are some very slight geometry problems, but this is inherent in ALL large screen DLP screen based sets, and you can easily fix this by entering the service menu if it bothers you too much
Chekc sites like AVS forum to find out how to accomplish this yourself

 MOST people never notice it unless it is very bad
 ALSO, very bright whites sometimes cause a sort of 'sparkling' effect but that usually means you have your contrast and brightness up a bit high and are clipping the video signal

 The TV ships with picture settings set to "Flame Mode" so it is best to immediately turn down both the brightness and contrast, and set the picture mode to 'natural' rather than the 'brilliant' it is set on out of the box


 If you try to turn up the bass on the TV speakers, they will distort at fairly large volumes
 Tinny sound at best, so some home theater in a box type speakers would be best and a full blown surround system would be optimal


 But for normal viewing at low to medium volume, they are fine.Which brings me to the included remote! It absolutely SUCKS!  It is non back-lit, does not glow in the dark and has the worst button layout since the old Toshiba VCR/DVD combo machines

 Actually, this one is much worse
 ALSO, there are NO dedicated Input select buttons, instead somebody at Mitsubishi thought it would be better to create their own activity menu , which is fine for people without universal remotes, but a terrible pain for those of us who use Harmony One's or similar units
 If you have a standard DVD player and a Blu Ray machine, the TV will assign both of them to a "Play A DVD" activity and when you select it you still must toggle between the two devices on the TV menu to select the proper input for your device

CLUNKY and dumb!  A firmware fix could alleviate this, but I wouldn't hold my breath on it
 I solved the problem by adding a few more touch screen functions for my DVD and Blu Ray activity settings on my Harmony One and that requites two extra button presses for everything to be as it should
 But for the average consumer who will use the Mitsubishi remote, it works fine.The delivery went very smoothly


 The box made it across the US in one of the worst storms in history and was delivered in pristine condition
 The contents were obviously brand new, no factory reconditioned set here!  Two people can EASILY carry both the box it comes in and lift the TV up on the stand of your choice

 I am 55 and my 80 year old father helped me
We had no trouble whatsoever lifting it, it is very light at around 60 pounds after unboxing it


 My screen was NOT bowed and the plastic housing was as new as it is gonna get
 I sense the whole thing is a bit fragile, especially as far as accidentally flexing the screen and screen frame so lift it carefully
 Mine turned out to be what the AV sites call "a good one" which means everything WORKED , no screen sagging and minimal geometry problems
 These are mass produced in Mexico and there have been some quality control issues, but they seem to have been solved over time

 My set was manufactured in December 2009.This TV is priced within the reach of most people who crave full 1080p HD goodness AND a very large screen

 Movies are a delight to watch on this thing, especially Blu Ray
 Most DVD's look pretty darn good too and HDTV rocks!!  Even the old stuff on TCM has new life with this thing
 If you are on the fence about this TV or worried about buying online , DON'T BE!  It is totally worth the price and other than cleaning the air filters regularly and replacing the bulb every 3 to 5 thousand hours, it should give me many years of faithful service

Time will tell, but for now I am in big screen heaven and don't regret my purchase one bit!  (check the Mitsubishi website for bulb replacements, their price is the lowest at 99 dollars right now)UPDATE ON MY PURCHASE:  Ok, the TV died today


 After 4 months of use, it will turn itself off during the booting up process, giving me the dreaded flashing green light.


 Neither reset procedure helps


 I called Mitsubishi who gave me the run around

 I called a local appliance dealer I buy from and they will send a repair guy out to take a look and hopefully fix it as it is still under warranty


 They were honest on the phone and said it most likely is the main board and/or the light engine
 ANY piece of equipment that fails in just 4 months of light use is pretty much cheap junk in my view.If I had it to do all over again I would NOT buy this thing
On the bright side, it did lower my electric bill by 30 bucks a month compared to my 50 inch plasma and it didn't heat up my room.If you like perfect geometry, FORGET IT!  Even with a multitude of adjustments, you will NEVER get this screen squared
That is because the unit itself is NOT squared
 After my initial enthusiasm wore off, I realized that these sets are very cheaply manufactured with low end parts and a high tolerance for variation in measurements, both physical and electronic.I can NOT recommend this TV.......

You may get one that lasts, but I am starting to think that may be the EXCEPTION.....


 Good luck and buyer beware! As for me, the LED backlit Vizios and LG's look promising at my price range anyway.

$REVIEW.: I love these speakers!!! I bought these to replace my cheap factory speakers


I originally used them with my factory stereo, and they sounded great


I then changed to an aftermarket head unit, and WOW, the extra power made these even better
I can imagine how good they would sound with an amplifier.These produce great bass, while still allowing me to clearly hear vocals


I generally have a problem with vocals being to high and piercing my ears, but not with these speakers.As other reviewers have said, these seem to sound even better after being used for at least a week


I guess they need to be "broken in"


I have also noticed that they need a short "warm up" period in the mornings, usually about 5 minutes
The sound is never bad either way, it just gets better.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this radio for about two months now, and I am very happy with it. I live in a rural area and I am very particular about the radios I own because of the weak radio signals that beset me here. I am, therefore, pleased to say the C. Crane CCRadio-EP excels at receiving AM signals, with the distant station that carries my favorite baseball team's games coming in strong and clear. It is nearly as sensitive on FM stations, too, with my preferred NPR stations coming in very clearly. Despite the fact that it has analog tuning, it holds onto signals very well and doesn't require constant retuning to keep faint stations properly tuned. Sound quality is very good for a radio of its size and it has bass/treble adjustment, too. Sound is not quite as full as my GE SuperRadio II, but it is slightly better than my Sony ICF-EX5MK2. The bottom line is that the sound is enjoyable for both music and the spoken word. Concerned about QC, I ordered my C. Crane CCRadio-EP directly from Crane and it has performed admirably. I have no complaints about the build or material quality of the radio. Battery life has been good so far, as well.I would recommend this radio without hesitation to anyone who is looking for a portable radio that offers excellent reception and very good sound quality. Two thumbs, way up!

$REVIEW.: There are few laptops with a built-in numpad these days, so we ordered this as a complement for a new laptop.Unfortunately, the USB connector is too large to use it as an "always-connected" device.  A micro-receiver would be a huge improvement.The biggest problem we had was with getting it to connect.  It seemed to be *very* sensitive to having a direct line of sight between the front of the numpad and the USB receiver.  This completely undercuts the supposed convenience of a wireless device.When you're using a numpad, you're probably doing heavy-duty data entry.  You CAN'T afford to "lose" a few digits, which is something that has happened often to me in my brief time with this device.If left unused, the device seemed to power itself off, and the power button on the bottom is recessed and very inconvenient to hit.The only good thing I can say about the device is that it is stylish.  But I'm afraid I'll be returning this for another less-stylish, wired model.

$REVIEW.: For more than two years I have been using a bargain-priced SanDisk Ultra II 15 mb/s 4GB CompactFlash memory card in my digital SLR without file corruption or lost photos, so it was with considerable confidence that I decided up upgrade to this card that has twice the capacity and four times the speed.  This is the maximum size memory card that my camera will support.My camera was able to format it instantly.  Rapid-fire shooting both JPEG and RAW never exceeds the ability of this memory card to accept the data.  Speed is important and this card doesn't slow me down. It can keep up with my camera and has not lost or corrupted any of my photos.  That's all I expect from a memory card, therefore this one meets my needs handily.

$REVIEW.: Overall, this is a pretty disappointing product. If this wasn't a Christmas gift from an employer, and we actually paid the full 400 bucks, we'd be majorly PO'd. Here are the cons:-The keyboard/remote is too small for the number of keys, which means the keys are tiny, similar to a smartphone qwerty keypad. A laptop or netbook size keyboard would have been far better considering that this device is primarily intended for Internet-based interactive use, which requires lots of keyboard use.-Many streaming video sites block GoogleTV's browser rendering it useless for one of its primary selling points.-Many browser plug-ins do not work, such as the SlingPlayer plug-in, which, if it did work, would make this device far more useful.-The UI customization is extremely basic. You can't set up your home page with just the apps you want, and the number of apps is limited. (They are supposed to remedy this when they open up the Android Market to GoogleTV devices.Hopefully, the SlingPlayer or DishOnline apps will be available.)-The Blu-Ray player section is redundant for those who already own a late-model BD player.-It takes forever to boot-up, if you aren't using the quick-boot feature.-It is big and ugly. I'm not sure why manufacturers feel the need to make network-enabled HT devices "futuristic" and "cutting-edge" looking. But, I wish they would stop. (Roku is a pleasant exception to that trend.) It should have looked just like the rest of Sony's BD player line, simple and elegant, instead of like some giant atomic mutation of an Apple TV box.In my opinion, Sony and Logitech were a little too quick to hitch their wagons to the GoogleTV star. If only they were more familiar with Google's history of release-and-iterate, meaning get-it-out-the-door-and-fix-it-in-future-iterations, they may have waited until it was more polished or simply abandoned, which is also what Google does with so many of their products when they get bored with the initial excitement, or realize they can't make it do what they thought they could.Hopefully, the brilliant minds at Google will stick with and perfect GTV, and not abandon it so quickly like other Google products. If they stay on top of it like Android, it may yet turn into something great and game-changing. But, Sony will need to release an NSZ-GT2 with a better keyboard/remote, a smaller better looking body, and no BD player. They also need to get it below the magic price point of $200, $250 at most, if they want it to be successful. $400 is absolutely insane.
$SUMMARY.: So-so product. Ridiculous price point.

$REVIEW.: Great little speaker
Fits my console perfectly, and doesn't block my view from any angle
Hard to believe that a speaker this size has such crisp and clear sound


Watched Cowboys and Aliens and the actors sound as if they were right in front of you talking

Construction is "spot on," was amazed that it was made in Indonesia
The only feature I wished it would have had were isolators to give some distance from the console itself


I have a Samsung sound bar for my TV and it came with one inch extensions that you merely screwed into the bottom of the speaker


Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase.

It is solidly built and has a study quality feel and issleekly designed and has tremendous power compared to many I've used

I have blown through many batteries this week that died before fully charging me but the only one that kept me charged and ready throughout the week was the Itorch

It had worked on my Android as well as Apple products and has clear indicator lights that let you know how much charge is left on the itorch--no wondering when it will die
The separate output Ports for both lower power devices and higher power tablets also is a great touch
This device has literally saved my lifeand allowed me to get vital information during a dangerous storm when other chargers failed me
If a backup battery is important to you buy this product and trust no other

I know I won't.

These headphones solve that problem by indirectly transmitting the sound through the jaw bones instead of directly to the ear drums


 I was worried that the sound quality would not be good but that is not the case.....sound quality is very good with these headphones.The second big advantage is the safety factor while using these headphones because they allow ambient sounds to come through loud and clear, hence they are safer for joggers.Earbud headphones hurt my ears after a while

It folds into a stand that holds up well even after continuous use and can be used folded into different configurations.. The quilted exterior is not leather, it a polyurethane cover with a softer fabric lining inside and sturdy corner grips that really do hold the device in place. Device does not slip or move around. The stitching is very well done on the quilted parts.There's a little magnet built into this cover that automatically "wakes up" the device when the front flap is opened.I have several kindle covers and this one is my favorite.

I have had a few other integrated keyboard iPad covers in the past, those were too small for efficient comfort and quick typing.This keyboard has only one minor annoyance - enough to loose a star, the BACKSPACE key is labeled DELETE.  Yea, it may be nitpicky but really, delete is not the same thing as backspace.  I wished it did have a true delete button, instead of utilizing the function button and the mislabeled backspace to create a true delete button they chose to make function+delete lock the tablet.

The bag was obviously stapled shut by hand, with three unevenly spaced staples -- plus three sets of empty staple holes, indicating it had  been opened and reclosed (???). The printing was uneven and poor quality. The sheet inside was a cheap xerox of a Plantronics marketing sheet, with a copyright of 2005 (I bought this in 2014). I've posted a photo comparing it with what Office Depot sells.Everything about this looks suspicious, and makes me think this is counterfeit or refurbished or who knows what. I wonder if that explains some of the very negative reviews here.I bought it from PlusGadgets and am sending it back immediately.
$SUMMARY.: COUNTERFEIT? Sure looks it.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE EDIT:So 47 days in, the TV picture failed

 It happens, so I'm not upset about that at all as that is what warranties are for
 My update comments here are specific to LG service and support


 You never really know, until you need it, how good or bad manufacturer service and support will be


 I am happy to say that LG impressed me with their warranty support on this TV.I initiated a service request online, and received a prompt appointment window (Monday afternoon request, service guy was here Wednesday around noon)

 They do telephone confirmation the prior day with you by phone call, and you can track your open repair ticket on line

 In my case, based on the failure description.

the fault was likely the control card or the power inverter

 Well, the service rep swapped both and no fix


That leaves the flat panel.


so he had to come back with a flat panel (which was on Friday)

 I don't fault them on this as that flat panel is extremely expensive so I do not expect them to carry a spare with them for every possible screen size


 They are very good about their day/time commitments and he was indeed back with a brand new panel on Friday morning and that fixed the issue for me.I watched the service rep as he did the diagnostics and repair and I give him high marks for attention to detail, knowledge, and professionalism.The other thing to note is how simple the design of this TV is in terms of electronics and mechanics

 It's extremely easy to dismantle and there are literally only three field replaceable parts (controller card, power inverter, and flat panel) + the awesome remote
 It's very well designed for field repair, and if you have any service experience at all you could self-repair (unless it was the flat panel as it costs more then the price I paid for the TV) If the flat panel goes out after warranty.
throw the TV away.
their FRU cost exceeds the cost of the TV and the flat panels are not repairable (they toss them if they fail).In closing.


I was very pleased with this TV when I purchased it and I am even more pleased with how well LG responded to a defective unit repair
:)---Original Review ---This TV from LG is awesome
 (I purchased the 42 inch unit)Easy to setup, excellent build quality, no issues or defects at all.The display is outstanding


 I'm not a big 3D fan, but I have to say.
the passive 3D in this TV is excellent as well.I know some people have been critical of the unit for black background....

but I simply don't see the problem

 Colors are vibrant and very appealing right out of the box as well.


and with a few adjustments for my particular setup they were perfect.Wireless connection to my network was a snap.


and flawless.The TV firmware is extremely smart and intuitive in most cases
 Some of the menus to find nuance things such as sound select and sound set up are a little more buried then I would prefer.

but once you learn the path.

it's a nit to me.The TV immediately checked for updates and committed a firmware update on first powerup (with my consent of course)


 Flawless


and took only a few minutes

 The TV also does a nice job of stepping you through initial setup and configuration of the TV..

which was pleasant and appreciated.GoogleTV does not impress.


but I did not buy the TV expecting good things from googleTV at this stage

 So I don't care.

it will get better with time I am sure
 I bought the google version of this TV to get the remote (see below)The TV autoconfigured to my ATT Uverse remote control interface very well, and with only a few cycles of choosing from me (because there are a bunch of different boxes for ATT
 This is on ATT not the TV as far as I am concerned
 The IR blaster is flawless.Now to the remote


 AWESEOME!  I LOVE THIS REMOTE
 It has a full mini qwerty keyboard on the reverse side and simple and easy to use function control on the front side

Finally.

a remote that makes searching for content on my ATT Uverse a breeze..


no more faux-alphabet via number keys!  There is a Wii style floating pointer feature, as well as a voice input mode as well


 The floating pointer is great.
though not that relevant unless you use the googleTV and apps
I have not tried the voice command interface yet.As I said.


googleTV..


not that important to me.

but I do love that we have a full android appliance and access to apps!  The TV did come with Amazon OnDemand app loaded and it worked flawlessly right out of the box


 Comes with HBOgo preinstalled as well.

and you can easily load new apps if you want and it's not already there


 If you are an android app fan.

then this TV will not disappoint.The front face of the TV does have an anti-glare coating of some sort and I know some people have complained that it is too glossy.
but I disagree

 It strikes a good balance in providing crisp transparency with modest anti-glare performance


 Personally.
I like it.I have a PC connected to one of the HDMI ports and can sit back in my cozy family room and operate the computer from a wireless keyboard and mouse with ease


 Why anyone would browse he web with googleTV.
I have no idea


 :)  Gaming performance is great with my PC and this TV connected as the display

 No noticeable lag or latency at all
 The TV will remember modes sets for each HDMI port.

so I have the PC set for game mode and it reverts automatically when I switch to TV or BluRay
 So for gaming on a PC.
this TV works fine

 I don't know if it would meet the demands of "twitch" players on consoles.
but for MMOs on PC.
it's fine.The only nit about the TV that I did not like is that the analog audio out port disables sound effect options when it is plugged in and it's volume is controlled from the main volume control of the TV

 I keep wireless headsets setup to my TVs for when you want to watch and hear TV without disturbing the rest of the home.


and this implementation of the analog sound port is a disappointment here


 But it was easy to solve

 I just purchased a small digital to analog audio converter and hooked it to the digital optical output
 The digital optical output does not override sound effects on the main TV audio and it also is not modulated by TV volume control.
so it completely solves my problem (for about $35)


 You can have both the TV and the optical audio out enabled.

which means I can control the TV audio without regard to audio on the wireless headsets (which have their own controls anyway).Overall.

awesome TV.


$SUMMARY.: I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this TV.

$review_text.: I bought this gel case simply because the Xoom itself is very slippery
When I hold it, it tends to slide in my hands, and if I'm carrying it I would prefer a bit of a rubber coating so it is more secure.Unfortunately the rubber/plastic that this case is made of isn't very grippy
It added bulk to the Xoom without really enhancing my ability to hold it
I used to have a silicone slip cover for one of our digital cameras and I was hoping this case would be more like that.Also the case fits the Xoom pretty loosely

The edges don't sit tightly against the Xoom; when you are holding it you can easily push the sides away from the edges with your thumbs


My ideal gel case would have more friction/grippiness and fit more snugly

It should take a bit of effort to get it on and off


The Xoom slips in and out of this case way too easily.I do like the way the Motorola desk stand has an alternate cover to accommodate this case, but I think I will not be using the case (perhaps for travel on an airplane, since the edges do help provide a bumper for the screen)

I've decided to put some e-grips on the Xoom instead, as they provide the stability I am looking for (particularly on the sides) without adding unnecessary bulk to the device.



$SUMMARY.: Not as good as I had hoped
