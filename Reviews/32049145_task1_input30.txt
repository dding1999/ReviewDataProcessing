$review_text.: The latest addition to The Angler series is an emotional rollercoaster of a romantic paranormal read
 Overall, I was totally engrossed in the story from beginning to end, but if you haven&#8217;t read the previous books in the series I highly recommend that you do

The book can be read by itself, but to get the full impact you should really know the characters and their full histories together, where they started and how they got to where they are now and just how much they deserve the happy ending they got at the end of this story&#8230; sorry I&#8217;m not going to spoil the surprise.See my full review at: erotic .the romance reviews .com

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this book as much as the other two.  I would love to see a follow up. It was nice to get some back ground on the characters in the books.  I can't wait for the next book to see what happens.  I know there is no chance all the character will retire, but I hope some of the them will and not get killed.

$REVIEW.: I just finished reading this book and I must not get this genre of writing. Unlike many of the reviews here, I found the book a disappointment.  I thought the characters were one dimensional, underdeveloped and unrealistic. As a black woman, I found Fiona's character especially annoying.  I don't care how much I want a job or wanted to help a friend, I would not practically prostitute myself to get it. If she really wanted people to respect her for her brains, why did she spend most of the book dressed like a video hootchie?  Even though I understand that they secretly loved each other, their relationship seemed totally idealized and UNREALISTIC.  If she was as attracted to Ned as she seemed to be during the implementation of their "plan," there's no way she would have waited all those years to get with him -- especially as into sex as she appeared to be.  And if Ned was as hot as the writer wanted us to believe, why didn't he have more women chasing after him? In the book, he appeared to have no friends or serious interest from women.  All in all, it felt like a very drawn out short story with weak character development and a totally unbelievable story line. Bottomline: Buy this book only if you're into totally superficial romance novels.

It has lettering for things as cards, books, and journals, but even though it features different kinds of pens, markers, and paints, I am still not sure how to do it.  Much of it is about handwriting.  You can write letters at an angle, large, small, or cursive.  You can make them fancy.  At best, this book gives ideas.  It should be very helpful to those who want to make their own greeting cards.

$REVIEW.: If it looks like chick-lit, it must be, huh?  But that ain't necessarily so.It's hard to deny that the marketing of 'Nice to Come Home To' is geared towards the female gender, but that would be selling it short.  The story encompasses more than girl-stuff.  It's life-stuff.Flowers makes her characters real:  situations, dialogue, development and flaws.  The reader can relate to all - even the cat.  The writing is smart and clever which is what is usually missing in most novels that get pigeon-holed into this market.I'd encourage you to check the book out - regardless of age or gender. I believe 'Nice to Come Home To' would be something anyone who picked it up would enjoy.I did.

I can see myself read books on all of them. The only negative is that some parts seems like empty parts like filler words.

$REVIEW.: A young Hispanic woman, Jolissa endured years of verbal and emotional abuse from her disabled uncle. Confined to a wheelchair her uncle was a bitter and cruel man who belittled Jolissa at every turn. A speech impediment made it difficult for her to communicate easily, but she felt a calling to help others, particularly children. She developed a friendship with an elderly woman who told her stories through the blocks in a very special quilt. Through this relationship and the stories she eagerly absorbed Jolissa began to feel God's presence in her life, a gentle moving that taught her to listen for direction for her future.A very poignant and emotional tale of a young woman who suffered much loss and heartache in her life is beautifully presented by the author. Descriptive and moving, this tale of a beaten down young girl offers hope through the influence of a &#34;grandmother&#34; character who plays a significant role in this story. Eloquently written, Kathi Macias has woven the lives of two women together in an inspirational account of the story behind a very special quilt. The layers of the quilt represent the life of a woman who overcame her own obstacles which have a profound affect on Jolissa's healing and search for direction. This author has never disappointed me. Her stories are created with depth and sensitivity, and inspiration that touches the heart. Another Kathy Macias masterpiece!Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through the Book Fun For Readers Only program, in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are my own, and no monetary compensation was received for this review.

$review_text.: This intriguing and exciting futuristic action romance is the first book in the D.I.R.E


Agency series.Having always been a force to be reckoned with, former Navy Seal Tristan Jacobs is now a walking unstoppable weapon thanks to the D.I.R.E


Agency


When an ex-team mate calls in a favor, Tristan reluctantly agrees and finds himself on the toughest mission he&#8217;s ever been on, protecting Rachel Monroe, but she is way too distracting and he&#8217;s a lethal weapon that can&#8217;t afford to lose focus


Now his enemies have come to her small town looking for vengeance

Have they found more than they bargained for? Or, does the past have its own retribution in mind?This fast paced plot takes the reader on quite an action packed adventure with some rather unusual aspects

 The author brings the story to life with vivid images and details that ensure the readers feel as if they are part of the story
 The strong compelling characters are easily related to and capture the reader&#8217;s attention from the very beginning and keep it to the end.The chemistry between Tristan and Rachel radiates heat from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy


 The author draws the reader into the characters lives with intense details that make the reader empathize with the characters and making them feel as if they know them

 All the characters are interesting with great personalities and charisma that leave the reader wanting to know more.The story created by the author keeps the reader on the edge of the seat with anticipation, suspense, action and romance
 The concept is fascinating with lots of excitement throughout that keeps the reader thoroughly engaged from beginning to end and to spice things up a few interesting surprises and unique elements.I was totally caught up in the story from the very beginning and what an attention getting way to start a story and it just kept getting more interesting from there
 I had to finish the book and I am certainly looking forward to reading more about Aidan and his super hero abilities.

$review_text.: This isn't the first book that's been written about time travel, but Keller's vivid descriptions certainly give the concept a colorful new spin. Her characters are flesh-and-blood believable, and their adventures, exciting. What's more, their travels through time enable this sneaky writer to (gasp!) educate by lifting historical tidbits from the dusty pages of school textbooks, and making them come alive. I highly recommend this book for young readers. Heck, I recommend it for anyone. It's been a while since anyone accused me of being young, but I loved it.

$review_text.: I can't say I loved this book but I can't say it was horrible either. I really don't know how I feel. It started off great, funny, quick paced and the writing excellent. But soon it grew boring. Now I'm not saying that big drug bust or fights should have happened, but nothing really happens either. He met a girl, decided to change, not one time did I feel his emotions towards said girl that he liked so much he wanted to be better for her. The characters lacked depth and their emotions were written but not felt.I do love how this isn't your normal bad boy dealing drugs, sometimes in books and in reality we forget that just sometimes there's good people doing bad things. We forget that some times when ones back against the wall, there's no limit we will take to ensure survival. He was a plain boring boy with a stutter who lacks self confidence who did what he felt was his only choice. He had no one to offer him a better choice or life and sadly there are many children in this world taking the same path for the same reason. I enjoyed the raw material.The story was quick and easy to read, but needed a sever edit make over. I normally have no problem with over looking mistakes, but this book was just getting crazy with them.Now the things I didn't like. Simon, the brother, good character, but his attitude changed because of Jenna. Now I know love changes us and all that blah blah. But his anger towards James is understandable but I wanted to smack him and yell that he needed to take a look at himself. He did the drugs, he knew Jenna did them as well. We need to be accountable for our own choices, and James always owned up to his. Sad to say that the drug dealer was more respectable than the drugee.My mind is tossed up over how the patents dealt with the news of James, and again I hated how Simon handled that situation. I felt like he was using the excuse that he was trying to protect his sister, but deep down it was still because of the anger over Jenna.And most importantly, the ending. I'm a sucker for happy endings. That's why I love to read, if I wanted sad, and horrible endings than I would watch the news. I know happy endings don't happen much in life, but that's why I need them so much in reading. We read to escape, to see and be other people. That's why we desperately want to connect with the characters. This book made me cry in the end, the happy ending disintegrating in the last chapter and made me want to scream. No happy ending = not a good book for me.

$review_text.: Eyes of Justice by Lis Wiehl with April HenryReview by Kara GrantContains minor spoilersMy ReviewThis is not your typical crime novel.  It grabs you from the first chapter and pulls you in.  The Triple Threat friends are about to have a bad day.  It starts when one of them receives a phone call about The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) and a possible cover up they implemented.  The person who receives the phone call promises to meet the caller at her home.  She is never heard from again.  The Triple Threat are down to two friends, will they find justice for their friend's murder before it's too late?My favorite characters in this story were Judge Fanconi who sentences the first suspect with an impossibly high bail, a kind bartender who gives free drinks and a free dessert to the two friends when he learns the third has been murdered, and Ophelia.  Ophelia helps the two friends investigate, is highly intelligent but possesses little knowledge of social skills, and sacrifices her own safety to help out.  I was very satisfied that even though this is a police book, there was no profanity in it.What I didn't like about the story:Ophelia's investigation leads her to a strip club in the story.  There isn't anything offensive described, but it's an uncomfortable scene.The funeral scene in the story starts out classy and respectful, but then something disturbing takes place and it adds drama to an already tense plot.  It struck me as ridiculous and unnecessary.There isn't any profanity in the story, but many people are killed.  Several are shot, one gets his throat cut, one is stabbed and strangled.Since the police in charge of the investigation are not trusted in the story (one is a rookie and fails to do the job efficiently, one is untrustworthy for specific reasons, and they don't want the two women poking around), it gets to the point where the two friends resort to deceiving one eye witness and the investigating detectives in order to protect one another.  It does a great job of complicating the story, but it felt hypocritical and farfetched.What the reader will read about in detail pertaining to law enforcement:What's it like to interview a suspectHow to treat a crime sceneWhat happens in an autopsyHow to analyze fingerprintsWhat it's like to visit someone in jailWhat it's like to investigate a bank robberyHow reporters are critiqued by viewersThere are several references to prayer, the funeral takes place in a church, there are references to faith in God, Psalm 27 is used as a comforting scripture, the Lord 's Prayer is spoken at the funeral, one of the friends wears a cross around her neck, and Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 is spoken at the funeral.Each of the three friends are strong, intelligent, independent and love their jobs.  However they each endure hardship that causes them to reflect on their beliefs.  One of them suffers a miscarriage, one survives breast cancer and one breaks out of an abusive relationship with a police officer.I enjoyed reading how Ophelia deals with communicating with others and her diligence investigating the situation.  I was amazed by how smooth the writing is, how each chapter ends with another surprising clue, and how much these women love one another.  Both ladies analyze the type of friend they were to their deceased member and deal with their grief throughout the story.  Despite their knowledge of the law and how experienced they are at crimes, the murder of their friend makes their perspective personal and they begin to appreciate angles they didn't consider before.  It was interesting to see what investigations are like CSI style and I enjoyed the pace of the story.  There is considerable violence in the plot, but other than the funeral scene it was appropriate and done well.  There is a mixture of sadness, suspense, and faith well blended in this book that will keep the reader's interest until the last page.

$review_text.: North Star takes you on a train ride with two nice people, both recovering from a hard time. The attraction is immediate, but the path is rocky. This romance is written by a man and from the man's point of view, and the reader figures out the identity of the attractive mystery woman long before he does.  She notes that he is not the most observant person in the world.  Amen to that.North Star is smoothly written with appealing characters and snappy dialogue. North Star is a sweet romance. I won a free copy in a contest on the author's blog and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

$REVIEW.: Journey in Bhutan: Himalayan Trek in the Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon brought me to a world I've never imagined
Trish Nicholson decided to sign up for a trek of around 100 miles with a pack of wonderful characters

She kept a detailed journal of each day, almost moment to moment from the flight to Bhutan right up to departure -- astounding description, a detailed and lush understanding of language, which helped place me there, looking over Trish's shoulder


The real-life characters live, breathe, eat, drink, herd yaks, point out hidden beauty in the ever-changing, mystical landscape, and come alive


The other people on the trek, a varied group in search of something, be it for more vapid reasons or part of a job, or a change of life moment, also add rich color throughout the book
This is a journey the author took in 1984, but it sounds so present, and, even though there have been a few more changes in the little-seen country of Bhutan, I imagine these treks exist in a similar state

There are photos accompanying the journey, and I highly recommend the book, even to those, like me, who travel a lot of the time by armchair


Wonderful

Extra chapters are added bringing the reader up to date on what Bhutan is like now, and how the Thunder Dragon people are some of the happiest people on the planet.

$review_text.: The group prepares for an inevitable attack from Woodbury, training up everyone who can hold a gun while a small unit sets off to find the National Guard Station to stock up on guns, ammo and gas. Meanwhile, Maggie and Glenn tie the knot and Lori finally gives birth but still more death and tragedy befalls the small group.I thought after the craziness of Woodbury and the Governor that this volume would be much less interesting as it&#8217;s more or less a return to the status quo but it&#8217;s still chock-full of great stuff. Dare I say it - Robert Kirkman does some decent character-work in this book!Carol, the mother of Sophia who also tried to commit suicide earlier in the series, has been slowly unravelling these last few books and Kirkman does fine work in showing her fatalistic state of mind - her speech towards the end gives the reader a glimpse into her life in the group and her perspective on how she views them. It&#8217;s a very real moment that made Carol seem like an actual person.Kirkman also keeps things exciting for the reader by having the group looking for the National Guard Station encounter some of the Governor&#8217;s men while, back at the prison, Lori goes into labour at night with the generator about to run out of gas, and Billy and Dale have to venture out in the zombie-infested parking lot to siphon more fuel.It is amazing that before they sent out the most able among them to gather ammunition from the National Guard Station that they didn&#8217;t ensure they had enough fuel for the generator. They didn&#8217;t know how long they&#8217;d be gone and they knew one of their group was about to give birth, but still they don&#8217;t bother to top up the fuel containers from nearly empty to full? What a bunch of idiots!And the death and mutilation remains funny, to me at least, because it&#8217;s so over-the-top. When zombies aren&#8217;t popping out of the shadows like diseased jack-in-the-boxes, characters are happily dying, smiles on their faces!Still, The Calm Before is a highly enjoyable volume that&#8217;ll keep readers deeply invested in the series - especially with THAT finale! The Calm Before, indeed.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 stars!You can never ever go wrong with a book (or novella!) by Elizabeth Essex


There is substance to her writing
It&#8217;s seductive and oooh-so-satisfying.I adored this novella! It&#8217;s fast paced, well written and fun
I love novellas like this

Ms

Essex writes exquisitely and I found myself lusting after Lieutenant Ian Worth

 He grabbed ahold of my heart and wouldn&#8217;t let go
Who doesn&#8217;t love a hard, rough & tough navy guy? Seriously.The characters are compelling and the storyline is engaging


The passion between Ian and Anne is slap-your-panties-to-the-wall-and-let-them-stick hotness! It was a while before I could cool down

*whew*I love when characters in a book realize looks aren&#8217;t always everything
 Love is good

Trust is even better...

and when you find someone who makes you be honest with yourself, every bit of yourself, that&#8217;s a keeper


 That&#8217;s why I loved this novella.I read several reviews from readers who didn&#8217;t like it
I think they had given up quicker than a fat cop chasing a teenager
Read it all the way through, ladies

You&#8217;ll be so glad you did.Find a perfect excuse to immense yourself in this story
It won&#8217;t take you long


It&#8217;s escapism at it&#8217;s finest
 Do you really need another reason?So, huzzah for Anne and Ian! It&#8217;s been one heck of an enjoyable read.***ARC graciously provided by St


Martin&#8217;s Press in exchange for an honest review***

$review_text.: This was a beautifully constructed book. The characters were very uniquely fleshed out, each with their own personalities and motives.Admittedly, I hesitated once reading some reviews balking at the fact that she fell in love with her former father figure, but I feel like their relationship came very naturally even though it took time for their feelings peak to that point where they were romantically involved. It wasn't predatory, or anything like that. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it.This also offered another incredibly original perspective of vampires. Instead of "sleeping" or just avoiding the sun during daylight, they undergo a transformation where their bodies physically die. Of course, they reanimate again at night, but I was astounded by such a fantastic idea. (Kudos!) It made for very two-dimensional, vulnerable characters.I loved Valek. And Paige. I loved the gang. Heck, I love Francis. You come to care about all of them, even in their darkest moments, because for having lost their humanity, they are some pretty humbling characters.

$REVIEW.: Although raised a Catholic, I veered off early on a quest to figure out which religion, if any, made the most sense, based on personal experience and an examination of empirical facts. I settled on something closer to monotheistic Hinduism (and Quantum Physics) than any current form of Christianity that I've encountered. In fact, with the rise of the Christian Right and Corporate Christianity, I've grown to view Christianity in general as a dangerous fascist political movement whose poster children are money-grubbing telehucksters in bad toupees and thousand dollar three piece suits.How refreshing then to find a book on Christianity which is intelligently written and loaded with gentle humor. A book which takes a slap at the arrogance of contemporary Christianity, yet manages at the same time to convey what is truly beautiful about it.Over-zealous Christians will learn a lot from the quotes of non-Christians used as examples throughout this book, and all readers will be moved by Shore's subtly inspirational, off-handed descriptions of some of the beliefs and experiences which have been personally rewarding to him.These passages are some of the best writing on religious themes I've encountered anywhere. This kind of Christian exposition, coupled with the rising tide of ecologically and socially aware Christianity, gives me hope that Christ's church is being reborn as he intended it.

$REVIEW.: Wow! Just Wow! This book just got to me in so many ways


Melissa Collins has touched my heart through this entire series, but I didn&#8217;t think it could get better, then she hit me with this one

This is by far my favorite of the entire series and I was a bit nervous going into this one.We all knew what happened to Shane, but we never really understood why


This book is a gripping story of what happened before Shane left his family, friends and Dylan


Shane, Reid&#8217;s brother, was everything to Dylan growing up
They were the best of friends and did everything together
Dylan was there for Shane and Reid through everything with their father


But there was one thing Dylan couldn&#8217;t protect Shane from and that was who he was.I spent the first half of the book in tears
Such a beautiful love and such a tragic ending to it

My heart broke for Shane and Dylan
But for Dylan, is there a way to move on beyond the love of your life?Several years later, Dylan still hasn&#8217;t found anyone to fill the void left behind by Shane


He has a great career and amazing friends
But there will always be that space in his heart that cannot be filled
So when he walks into the gym that day, he can&#8217;t even prepare himself for what he is looking at

Connor and all of his glory.Connor is so beyond attracted to Dylan but he knows that Dylan is off limits

He has a family&#8230; or it appears that way.This book was powerful and moving and I was really impressed
There are so many battles being fought internally and externally in this book that I was just captivated

Melissa Collins just does such an amazing job with her words, the subject and she does it with ease and grace.I am not typically a reader of M/M romances but this one just grabbed a hold and hit my heart with force


It was powerful to say the least
I love this entire series and I can&#8217;t get enough of any of the characters, but there was just something so raw and powerful about Dylan and Connor that I just wanted more for both of them.The characters, the passion and the heartbreak all wrapped together in the pages of this book is incredible and I am so happy that I have had the opportunity to read this book and feel what the characters were feeling and I embraced Let Love Live


I will definitely be re-reading this one! It is heartwarming and touching while dealing with the difficulties that life has given them.

Erica does a great job starting with the story with Carl and John, starting out their regular day as landscapers when the earthquakes begin.  Erica then shifts to Mary Ellen and Al, and then finally to Riley and Xander and friends.  As their story lines begin to merge, Rochelle is introduced. Alliances are formed while all he'll breaks loose.  Earthquakes, tsunamis, and lava are just the beginning of the nightmare for these characters. Survival is paramount.I am a disaster book and movie lover.  This books is definitely a big things up for me.

From the commonly-held misconceptions about the history of slavery (it has existed since prehistoric times and persists today) to the acknowledgment that slavery has been used by all races around the world, Myths Of American Slavery provides an important and iconoclastic coverage which surveys social, political and even religious interactions with slavery issues.

$REVIEW.: A Lutheran must take this position, that the current Pope's depiction of the apostles starting the Visible Succession is more to tradition, if anything, than Scripture.  The argument over petra and petros in Mt. 16 is major.  Confession or office?  Has to be confession.This leads to second concern with this volume.  Pope repeatedly speaks of the ultimate reason of the beloved apostles was to speak the gospel.  But of what gospel, we must inquire, and what does this gospel do?  Here we can see the Papal error, that the gospel alone is not sufficient to save.  Works of grace and love must be added.  So, the major theological split is centered squarely here, as it has been for centuries.  Lutherans would easily agree to be under a Pope if he would speak the gospel truthfully and faithfully.  This book gives evidence against that, as also his previous volume on Jesus testifies.This does not add any significant insights on the apostles as have been previously been published.  There is also chapters on Paul's associate circles, i.e. Priscilla and Aquila, etc.Not for those who want a true picture of this important connection we have in the apostolic church to the Christ.

$review_text.: Randy Dingwall wrote this book as a tribute to his dog, Grizwall.  It's not a polished and slickly edited book, but the real man shines through in the simple, heartfelt writing.  He and Grizwall lived in a van and a cabin while working in the Pacific Northwest (picking mushrooms, planting trees), and they were inseparable.  They tangle with bears, porcupines, other dogs, and enjoy a life free of office cubicles and the burdens most of us carry.  I was a little envious of the carefree life they enjoyed.  Grizwall was a huge, bear-like dog with a sense of dignity and humor, and he was more of a partner to Mr. Dingwall than a pet.I hope Mr. Dingwall expands on this book (which is really a collection of essays) and can get a good editor to help, because I know he has enough stories about his life with Grizwall to entertain many people.I'm giving this book 4 stars for the content and the love I felt while reading it.  If you've ever loved a dog, you'll enjoy this book.

Her stories make me all emotional. Then she makes me happy and horny because her characters just to that to me. This is a very cute but sad story. I say cute because it starts off as a young puppy love. We get both characters falling in and out of love, lust. Their first times. Not with each other. That comes later. Ever and Caden meet at Art Camp when they were only 14 and 15. This sort of reminded me a little of Secret Life of the American Teenager, without the getting knocked up part. The sad part about it, they both have to face deaths.What starts off as a pen pal friendship later on becomes something that they will both cling to and need. I truly believe  that these two are soulmates. 100% made for each other. If you're looking for a light, romantic read, this is the book for you. I know I said that they were young, but Ever and Caden are far beyond their years.

$review_text.: I just finished this book. Almost didn't make it through it. To much like the first one of his that I read "The Child He Abused". What was the purpose of writing two exact books other then to double his sales? Although I do believe he went through some horrific things I find it hard to believe he could have survived some of the things he claims without being left crippled from so many broken bones that at many times he got no care for or being left mentally disabled from all of the head trauma. The father  obviously had some mental problems and it is so sad that know one will step up to the plate and help these abused children. The spouses are as much to blame for just watching it happen and not helping there children. As a mother myself there is no way on Gods green earth that I could ever sit back and watch someone do those things to my children. The parent that does, be it the mother or the father in my opinion is just as sick as the abuser. I have read many books written by people of abuse and it amazes me how some live through it and still can become productive adults were others grow up to become serial killers. I guess we'll never know why that is. Maybe some just handle it better then others.

$REVIEW.: When I pictured Zan, the hero of Dalya Moon's Poke, I got an image of Deb from Napoleon Dynamite, fussing with her Glamour Shots set-up. This made me giggle. When I found out Zan's magical power was that he could see any girl's future by having her stick her finger in his belly button, I giggled some more. The premise is downright absurd, but I think that's why I liked this book so much. Everything that happens is just a bit off-kilter, with the kinds of characters you might not necessarily encounter in real life, but each of whom have their own personality quirks without being *annoyingly* quirky -- if you know what I mean. (I'm STILL mad at the lady from the Chinese tea shop, to be honest, but I'm trying not to give anything away in terms of the plot. Oh, and that Duchovny reference made me swoon, in addition to giggling.)I loved that this "paranormal romantic comedy" was decidedly NOT like Twilight, that the characters had a lot of paranormality to deal with but still acted like human beings, and that although technically this was a tale of "love at first sight," it came off as believable young love instead of some melodramatic or creepy obsession.If you still think witches should be evil, that females of all ages should avoid vampires, and that magic comes from the most unlikely of places, you will enjoy this book.

$REVIEW.: I bought this book because of all of the positive reviews.  I'm writing my own now to do my part to get everyone reading this book.  The author knows how to keep you interested in the story.  It's high-intensity from start to finish.  The action was pumping the whole time.  Some reviewers weren't happy with the suddenness of the action and the escalation in psychic powers and lust, but I am completely capable of understanding that this is a work of fiction and the book can only be so long . . .I would have given the book a 4.5 star rating if I could.  My only complaint, which has been expressed by others, is with the cliff hanger ending.  I like my books to have more resolution at the end.  It definitely will make you want to read the next one, though, which is a clever marketing tool!  Too bad it's not out until summer '12.If you like Brockmann, you'll love this book.  And it's a great price!

$review_text.: BOOK REVIEW--MY HEART'S DESIRE: A Journey Toward Finding Extravagant Love by Mary Singer Wick.My Heart's Desire is a powerful story of the author's struggle to find everlasting love. Mary Singer Wick walks you through seven years of heartbreaking trials beginning with the diagnosis that, as an otherwise healthy single woman, she may never have children. Desiring to be a wife and mother more than a career woman, she begins her desperate search for a cure. Healing eventually comes, but not in a way she expected.By God's grace, Mary is drawn into the most powerful love relationship of all--the one with her Savior who heals her broken heart. With her involvement and membership in an evangelical church her soul is nourished and she begins to discover where true satisfaction is found.You will witness Mary's transformation from loneliness and despair, to hope and renewed faith. As you follow her journey from single-hood to married life, you will profit from the lessons Mary and her future husband, Jon, apply to their dating relationship.My Heart's Desire is full of hope and encouragement for the over-thirty-five single or single again woman. This book does not guarantee anyone a spouse, but offers the promise of an extravagant life, beyond your wildest dreams, that can only be found in a deep and loving relationship with Jesus Christ.

$review_text.: I had the same sense of revulsion reading this book as I did reading "Supersize Me" (which is more or less the food version of this book) and I see fast food and "fast fashion" as indicative of the same lack of basic skills.  We don't typically cook -- and therefore don't recognize quality in food.  Few people sew anymore, and therefore don't recognize quality in clothing.  The high cost of housing means that cost becomes more important both for food and clothing -- and quality suffers.  The manufacturing chain makes adjustments to accommodate the desire for more of everything.  And then follow the TV shows: Biggest Loser for the food problem; and Hoarders for the clothing (and everything else) problem.Oddly enough, the bad construction of cheap clothes puts consumers into the endless cycle of buying more of everything. If you can't fix your shoes or alter your clothes, then you need multiples of everything just to make sure something lasts through the season.  Expectations of grooming and dress have become demanding, which means that there is more acceptance of cheap clothing.  60 years ago when every working woman wore a suit every day to work, her entire wardrobe was different. She didn't have 22 tops and 14 skirts -- she had five suits.  And yet we see the connection  between clothing and our behavior-- schools that expect specific behaviors usually have specific dress codes.  (the author of Supersize Me also comments on how fast food -- and eating in your car -- disrupted the idea of set meal times.  )I am old enough to remember the grand department stores in big cities -- and the expectations both of dress and behavior that accompanied them.  The author does not make the connection between larger houses (and greater house payments as proportion of income) and the growth of the shopping mall.  Those grand department stores didn't need parking lots -- people took transit and had their purchases delivered by delivery truck (not FedEx).  They shopped during the day, not on the way home from work at 8 pm.  Our whole society has changed and the way we relate to food and clothing has followed.This may be one of the first things I've seen that puts a "sustainable, green" cast on clothing consumption though.  its ironic that Whole Foods sells cheap -- although organic and fair-traded -- teeshirts in the toiletries aisle.  And those items are always manufactured overseas.

$review_text.: Damn, can Samanthe Beck write! In her second Brazen book, Lover Undercover, I am yet again impressed beyond unreasonable doubt at her ability to tell a well thought out, sensuous, and emotional story.Who would have thought a virgin yoga instructor could be so good as a stripper at first try?! A hot, sexy one at that! Kylie was just unbelievable, I may have developed a slight girl crush on her! She was a fast learner when it came to filling in for her sister's job and she delivered. I loved the way Kylie was passionate about her job, loyal and caring to her sister, and the amount of her understanding was never ending. I thought her stepping in for her sister was admirable. The experience allowed Kylie to grow as a person because it made her open up more, awoken her sexually and also mentally and emotionally. She was scared of giving everything over to a man, but she found balance in the love she felt for Trevor and it was amazing. &#8232;&#8232;I don't what it is about men and law enforcement that makes me drool, but ohmysweetheaven, Detective Trevor was just, *licks his shoulder* deeelicious! He was all about getting the bad guy, bringing in justice, and protecting Kylie, all the while being the charming, smooth talking, make me so damn weak in the knees man, in and out of the bedroom. It was criminal how hot he was, seriously. What I loved most about him, besides his sexiness of course, was his compassion and understanding. He never jumped to conclusions about Kylie and gave her the chance to explain herself.It's one thing for sex scenes to be hot, but for make out scenes to be just as scorching is just straight up enlivening! And like I said, Beck can write them! I swear I was fanning myself and needing to cool down from the heat this book brought! It was more than well written. Love Undercover wasn't just about the sex though, it was also about the mysterious murders, the line between love and loyalty, right and wrong, and lies versus the truth. All of this is in there and it adds so much more to the story, making it unique and a thrilling read. I absolutely loved trying to figure out who the killer was. I had a good hunch and was certain it was him, but Beck was dropping hints to make me doubt myself. Even though I predicted right, I had the best time along the way, especially learning everything when it all played out. &#8232;I wasn't just pleased by Lover Undercover, I was satiated! Samanthe Beck, please give me more!

$REVIEW.: In this book, former journalist Richard Hoagland--who, this book notes in detail, is in part responsible for the idea of including a "message" on the Voyager spacecraft, and who, the book does not note in detail, is in part the originator of the as-yet untested notion that life might exist in a world-ocean encompassing Jupiter's moon Europa--attempts to convince the reader that a group of odd-looking rock formations in the Cydonia region of Mars represent structures designed and built by a super-intelligent race of aliens millions of years ago, that these artifacts hint of a link between these aliens and modern humans, and that NASA or elements within the government are actively engaged in covering up all of this earth-shattering knowledge

The sole basis for all of these claims is a small number of grainy, low-resolution photos taken by the Viking orbiter in the mid-1970s  It is worth remembering that these photos, or more specifically versions of these images that have been processed by amateur investigators, constitute the sum total of Hoagland's work, and of the work of others to whom he occasionally refers


More recent, higher-resolution photos by the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey spacecraft essentially reveal Hoagland's claims to be at best a sad little joke, unless one subscribes to the idea that the government is intentionally defacing these images (Hoagland's arguments are more complex than I can do justice to in this space, but they include this assertion)


After all, once one begins to cry "cover-up!" there is no logical way to stop.Hoagland's research is pitiful, his knowledge of statistics and the scientific method nonexistent, and his ego immense
The book is further clouded by vague references to a "tetrahedral geometry" revealed by the Martian artifacts, reflected in major features of the solar system (the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, etc.), and hinting at the existence of some wonderfully powerful energy source, all of which fall under the heading of what might be called "mystical geometry" rather than science


It is but a short jump to the inscribing of pentagrams on the floor
To reject Hoagland's notion out of hand is not to deny the possibility that "we are not alone," but rather to recognize a crackpot when one sees one, and to demand that if a pursuit is to be called science some semblance of the scientific method be involved

 This book, along with Hoagland's web site (The Enterprise Mission), gives us an excellent example of what has been termed "pathological science"--at every step, Hoagland attempts to assure the reader that what he is doing is "science."  In reality, it's a lot of doodling, with some wild conjecture and sci-fi plotting thrown in."The Monuments of Mars" is so poorly written as to be genuinely annoying, and the first-person narrative leads Hoagland to some yawn-inspiring descriptions of receptions, lectures, etc
etc


I can't imagine anyone being entertained by this, but from a cursory glance at the long list of glowing reviews it would appear that a fair number of people are bamboozled enough to overlook the logical gaps and lack of rationality here
Still, I suppose the narrative does provide an interesting description of the ongoing process of self-delusion

Therefore, I recommend this for psychologists only.

$REVIEW.: It's fortunate that her parents have retired to Florida, since it has given Molly an excuse to stay in their house with her two young school-age children and work on her eCard business while husband Jim has a yearlong work assignment abroad.  But, hardly has she settled done in her new home, when neighbor and friend Lauren's husband is found murdered.  The police, of course, suspect Lauren.  Molly, however, is convinced her friend is innocent and manages to involve herself in the investigation...with dire consequences.This is more than a mystery novel, since the supposedly quiet neighborhood is awash with hidden animosities.  Despite the perhaps overly complex plot, the story contains fascinating characters, and plenty of suspects.  Add to that some dry humor and the result is an intriguing and readable tale.

$review_text.: The premise of the story was an interesting one: a series of classmates being murdered several years after they graduated. Unfortunately, the overall plot and the price (free) are about the only good things I can say about this novel. Sorry, Mr. Moats!The book was riddled with run-on sentences and spelling errors, and the author's sentence structure was much too choppy for my taste. As a former English teacher, I can honestly say I've seen 8th grade essays that were much more beautifully written than this.And while the premise of the story is a good one, I just didn't think Mr. Moats did it any justice. Many, many points in the story were completely unbelievable. I realize that it must be difficult to write a mystery, but I found myself thinking many aspects of this story were just too convenient. There wasn't much thinking involved in this mystery; in fact, I think the only brain power I used while reading this novel was just to correct the grammatical errors!

 They each have lost everything and have had to pay heavy prices in their lives


 Harlow, the daughter of a MCer, is no one&#8217;s patsy


 This is one tough chick
 She is out for revenge and will stop at no cost to get it
 Cruz is all alpha male hotness who wants Harlow from the minute that he sees her

Cruz does claim her but she resist after having vowed to never become involved with another club member


 Ravage me is a tug of war, high octane thrill ride about revenge, pain and loss

$review_text.: The subject and the comments by Prof. hanson are very interesting. I was pleased by the way of studying the problem, and much more by the author comment that the people that best appreciated his lectures were the not so elitist students of Fresno, in the middle of California agricultural production valley, maybe kin to the old warriors that the author depicts. The book gives a lot of very useful information, and suggests other books that I have also bought. I write usually agaist war, but to be able to control war one needs to understand it, and this book goees far in that direction. The only drawback I find (4 instead of 5 stars) is that the book is a collection of short chapters unconnected with each other save for the common subject. But I heartily recommend its reading.

$review_text.: I have an old copy with a dust jacket that quotes Sinclair Lewis: "A brave novel about a woman who escaped from the fogs of today's misery into the sun of normality and happiness; a story as devoid of sentimentality as a blizzard, and yet a great love story-a real love story

I don't know when I have ever seen a more exciting first novel." Part of the book's impact comes from his razor sharp insight into the debacle of much of psychiatry; this is an issue into which he delves even further in Savage Sleep, his other novel.(This is after all, the man who wrote the screenplay for The Snake Pit.) But here he mitigates some of the brutality with the redemptive power of human love, in both its simplicity and its profundity

His concern for the human condition is as authentic as it is incisive, and sadly, because of that, he became a victim of HUAC
This is why he is so little known, despite his heroic efforts not just to shine the light on the travesties committed in the name of mental health, but also his fight in the Civil Rights movement


Definitely a gem worth unearthing.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. Cora was hilarious!! And the bantering between Cora and Tor was equally funny. After that the book felt a little flat to me. I really don't know why. Maybe because Clara seemed to lose her spark. It probably would have been more enjoyable to read if she'd battled on instead of falling in line with what Tor wanted. That said, I didn't dislike the book. It was an okay read but probably not one  I will reread any time soon.

I have been trying to find a book that would be fun to read with him while also being educating in a way and I definitely found it with this story. I think the book is definitely aimed at the younger male audience and I think that's why my brother enjoyed it so much, he's a little adventurer and I could tell that he could relate to the character's in the story a lot which was good for me because I could finally keep him focused while reading a book. It's hard to find a book that my brother enjoys but I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was for him to become engaged while reading this. I definitely recommend this story

There are tips to load images so they will load fast. This book is the book you would want to read after your blog is set up, and not attracting the traffic you need to be profitable.  Then you realize the value of the things you thought were not necessary to do like word tracker, key words and W3 validation, etc.. These things will help your blog become more visible in all search engines but obviously especially Google. You will be inspired by the comments at the end by successful bloggers. Again, the most valuable thing this book offers are recommendation to web sites that have been developed in the last few years to help quickly and effortlessly automate many of the blogging tasks most people dread.

$REVIEW.: Having two brothers 24 years younger than me, I was witness to their CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS craze.  These rude, crude and "punny" graphic novels were a HUGE hit for the 8+ age market, and Ian Probert has crafted a Young Reader's Book in that same, highly successful theme.  Fully steeped in British mannerisms, culture, and iconic figures, JOHNNY NOTHING had me laughing out loud straight from the Prologue.  The story uses a close narrative style, very often taking the traditional wall between reader and story and breaking it (then grinding, finally scattering the dust to the five winds*) in a manner that will gleefully make boys chortle like ribald pirates bathing in jellie dubloons.  (*North Wind, South Wind, East Wind, West Wind, and Body Wind.)For those of us "across the pond" in America, Probert does give an endnoted cultural lexicon, albeit not quite as comprehensive as it should be to really reach young American readers.  There is an excellent opportunity here for Probert to add more to JOHNNY NOTHING by wittily (and of course,  irreverently) expounding on other cultural references,  such as "council flat", various foods, what it means when the bailiff comes round, and perhaps even France (admittedly hundreds of years of cumulative research have not been very successful on that point).  Being myself steeped in British culture like a week old Tetley tea bag left in a dried smudge of brown sauce, even I had to scratch my head over a few referenced people (who, thankfully were mentioned in the endnotes... and no, the Beatles weren't one of the puzzlers).  Finally, the illustration style is eye-catching in an oddly but truly fascinating manner, one I have never seen before.If you are looking for a Young Reader's Book filled to the brim with jolly, rude, crude, and very punny humor in the same popular vein as other market niche authors, come get a real council flat dose of JOHNNY NOTHING and his literal rise from rags to rags sorta with riches to no rags with riches to giving riches to rags while not wearing rags to no rags, no riches to finally ... a coming 2nd Volume!----I received a free copy of the aforementioned book in exchange for a candid review. I have no genre bias, having always been extremely eclectic in reading tastes, and critically consider when applicable (in order of weight) titular promises vs content deliverance, stylistic qualities, general Kindle/physical formatting, and personal enjoyment.

$REVIEW.: While the goal of this book is to learn how to think for oneself, it should not come at the expense of annoying others with the bombardment of questions that challenge the way they think - which is a central theme, and the modus operandi by which Socrates lived (which ultimately got him killed). Enjoy this book and its historical insights. As a human, and professional person, you will benefit from a Socrates mentality that enables you to have a broadened perspective, question assumptions, and most importantly, learn how to dig for relevance, logic, and deeper meaning; something that other people will do ONLY when they are willing.

$REVIEW.: In Shatter Me, I hated Warner. He was a creepy psychopath. With Destroy Me being from Warner&#8217;s point of view, I was nervous I might not like it. I should have just trusted the awesomeness that is Tahereh Mafi. I may have hated Warner in Shatter Me, but I grew to love him a little bit in Destroy Me.Opening up readers to Warner&#8217;s inner thoughts is a genius move. It shows that Warner may have plenty of issues, but he is not pure evil and possibly actually human. It all gives insight to the horrific treatment Warner had to survive under his father. While I grew to love Warner, I am still divided as to whom I would like to see Juliette end up with but I am leaning closer to Warner for sure.Since this is a novella, it is a quick read that I highly recommend reading before Unravel Me. Knowing Warner better will give better insight and a deeper connection to the characters. At least that is what I hope as I am planning to start Unravel Me very soon.

$REVIEW.: Patrick Thomas is, in my opinion, the absolute master of the trickster leprechaun story. So when he decided to do a series on the ancient Sumerian god Negral, who chooses to work as Hell's Chief of Police instead of facing oblivion, I should not have been surprised at the result. Negral gets his jollies from putting one over on the Devil, on the Devil's dime. As a former god he's used to meting out punishment and justice, and tweaking the Devil's whiskers to help someone gets him off like a fine wine.Lore and Dysorder is a series of short stories and novellas about Negral's adventures set, literally, mostly in hell. He has to solve mysteries like finding a succubus' virginity (!) and dealing with a menace that is destroying demon lords, a mystery that leads him to the gates of heaven itself. Through all this Thomas weaves impressive, and occasionally hilarious, dark world-building: showing hell as seen through the eyes of a jaded PI who styles himself after Bogie and deals with the darkness like a wisecracking cop.RECOMMENDED

$REVIEW.: I love reading new twists on old tales, whether that be fairy tales, mythology, classic novels, etc. Unfortunately, many of those new stories fall short. I'm not sure if the writers rely too much on the source material to pull the story along, or what, but I've read some disappointing ones, even by seasoned and favorite authors.This is not one of those poorly-executed attempts.I bought this book today and devoured it within a few hours. Couldn't put it down. I love that the major characters are Sirens--they have dealings with some of the major Greek mythology players, but the story isn't about the majors. We get to read about the "little guys," so to speak. Char's handling of her new "job" and how she juggles it with friends, not-boyfriends, her waitressing job and her slightly overbearing father is entertaining and engrossing.The romance builds steadily, but at no point did I want to roll my eyes at Char's obsession (because there wasn't one), and I never wanted to flat-out kick the boys involved. (These are big pluses, because I can't say the same for every YA I've read.) What can I say? I loved the boy plenty right along with her. Her friends were interesting, but they didn't take over the story. Her mentor didn't info-dump the whole of the explanation/backstory, but her holding of information was believable and not annoying.I'm only left with one question: when's the sequel going to be out?

$REVIEW.: I fix a smoothie almost every single day so couldn't pass up picking up another smoothie recipe book for my Kindle collection. A couple of things I really liked about this book:1.  It has a great Table of Contents - so it was super-easy for me to navigate my way to each recipe2.  It has several recipes with interesting (and unusual) ingredients.Most smoothie recipe books stay pretty much in the main, with a few green choices thrown in for those of us who like to chuck spinach down there with the blueberries. But this book really took a fresh look at combining ingredients not always seen in a recipe book. For example, the Kiwi Lime recipe is one I'll definitely try - never thought of using Kiwis in my smoothie. And as a peanut butter addict - I will definitely be putting this one to the test.I thought the author did a great job of pulling together a solid resource for us smoothie drinkers - and hopefully he'll introduce some smoothie newbies to the joys of great tasting drinks.

$REVIEW.: I suspect that most Americans have no idea of who William Randolph Hearst was
Some may know, vaguely, that he was the model for Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles' classic "Citizen Kane"
But few of those people would know that Hearst as a model was greatly distorted in he movie


A few may remember that a Hearst descendant, Patti Hearst, was kidnapped by the so-called Sybmionese Liberation Army, and was later convicted of crimes committed while a prisoner of them


There have been a few biographies of Hearst, but Kenneth Whyte considers them shallow - and absolutely proves himself correct in this masterful work.Hearst was the son of a 19th Century mining magnate and ultimately US Senator
Daddy was, to put it mildly, filthy rich

Both mom and dad were indulgent of young William, buying him a steam yacht and many other nifty toys
William dropped out of Harvard and took over the management of the San Francisco Examiner

George Hearst, like many rich men of the time, had bought a newspaper because newspapers were very prominent in the politics of the day.Much to the surprise of everyone, except himself, William was quie successful in turning around the Examiner and he soon had his sights set on a bigger pond - New York.By 1895, George Hearst had died and left his entire estate to his widow, Phoebe

William convinced mom to finance the purchase of one of the existing 48 daily newspapers in New York City

It certainly helped WRH that he came from a wealthy family, for he used $10 million of the family fortune to finance his newspaper adventures over the next few years - and that was when $10 million was the equivalent of several hundred million today


Consider this for scale, the most popular newspapers of the day sold for a penny or two a day, compared to the dollar or more a day you pay today (if you're one of the diminishing number of people who actually read newspapers).Hearst bought the New York Journal, which was essentially a failing newspaper, and immediately started improving it with writers he hired away from competitors, massive promotion campaigns and stunts and what ultimately became a war between Hearst and the legendary Joseph Pulitzer, who owned the leading daily, the New York World.Hearst had a dream, a vision that saw him owning newspapers throughout the country
To acheive this, he know he must first be successful in New York City.Whyte spends most of the 466 pages of text on an excruciatingly detailed examination of Hearst and Pulitzer in the "yellow journalism" era they for the most part created
Just three years make up the bulk of the book, from Hearst buying the Journal in 1895 through the Spanish-American War in 1898

Along the way, Whyte demolishes the myth the Hearst literally created the war.The depth of Whyte's research is breathtaking, as exemplified by 28 pages of footnotes plus a bibliography and literally thousands of citations within the text.Although Whyte has a good, craftsman like writing style, the book is ponderous and moves slowly owing to the huge mass of detail


It took me about two weeks to work my way through the book, interspersing it with three others.Even so, it "The Uncrowned King" is a very informative read
Not only do you gain perspective on a most remarkable man, William Randolph Hearst, but you also learn about the press titan who had better publicity, Joseph Pulitzer
There are detailed portraits of a few dozens of the most luminois journalists of the day as well.All in all, "The Uncrowned King" is a valuable piece of American lore and very well worth reading.Jerry

 Perhaps a double?  In any case, I have bought a lot of books on eBay, so if you have too, this book shouldn't tell you anything new, but of this is your first book on eBay, it may be worth the purchase


 4 Stars.

$review_text.: An interesting read. Different from other supernatural/paranormal books I have read. Actually it was great to read something with more spirituality and a feel of aboriginal legends. The story therefore went much deeper and had more meaning than your typical books out there.Ralph was a really creepy character and although i was somewhat sickened by his character, I kept wanting to read on to see where his character was going and what was developing. He needed to be the character Buchanan developed him to be for this story to work. I enjoyed how the story was told from different perspectives and how good and evil were developed, explained and were equally important to the story.Some points of the story are quite graphic- given it is a teen novel. A fantastic read nonetheless. I hope there is a sequel to this book. I was totally drawn in to the Wolves of Sisters.

$REVIEW.: REVIEWED BY: Wayne S. WalkerThe author lives in Arizona where as Safari Sue she has entertained millions at the Phoenix Zoo with help from some incredible animal friends.  Her "Safari Sue" series of children's books is inspired by her life experiences.  In this one, Flora and Fernando wonder if they are really flamingos because they are the wrong color.  At first they are white, and then they turn gray.  So they begin to imagine what else they might be--perhaps an ostrich, or maybe a giraffe?  As they consider the possibilities and start to investigate, what will they find?  And are there any lessons for them to learn?The gorgeous color illustrations by Kevin Collier make this book a feast for the eyes as well as for the mind.  In addition to learning a little bit about the growth and development of flamingos, children will gain some insight into their own lives.  It is so easy for youngsters to look around at adults and even other children, see the differences between themselves and others, and begin to worry if they are "all right."  What Flora and Fernando learn can help set growing children's minds at ease so they can be content with their own pattern of growth.  This is a great book and lots of fun.  Did you know that flamingos maintain their pink color as a result of what they eat?

$review_text.: The serendipitous events that seem to accompany the books sent me for review are getting just a little spooky. For example, I'll be thinking, Gee, I'd like to review (a certain kind of) Gnostic book and...BAM! It shows up in the mail. Or I tell myself that I will absolutely, positively never again even look at a book dealing with the Bible and...BAM! One is sent that really shows "the Book" in a totally whole new slant.In the case of ORIGINS, I thought, Just stick a stake in me now, if I had to force myself to read any more pseudo-scientific, "New Age" interpretations of reality, & particularly historic reality. But I was drawn to the title of the book, and even more intrigued when I discovered that original 1984 title was Creatures from Inner Space. Now how could I pass that up?So I started reading, making my little notes--and before I realized it, it was dawn's early light.The book was finished.Time to crawl back into my crypt.Like Houdini I have been drawn to the occult & psychic phenomena--and also like Houdini, I remain mostly unconvinced, seeing in so-called "Manifestations" little more than manipulation & false mirrors & false memories & serpentine smoke disguising all the shoddy props but fading in the light of common sense. It was with this fairly closed mindset that I read the Introduction. I came to immediate attention at this comment: ...So what, then, really is a human personality, and what so much the limits of its powers, as a full, unrealized extent of them? [P. 3]Two correspondences immediately entered my fragile head: DAIMONIC REALITY and SETH SPEAKS. I write this not to suggest subject redundancy, but to impress upon the reader the type of pan-psychic (psychological) connection ORIGINS invokes.To summarize these works: DAIMONIC REALITY argues for the existence of an inner reality just as real & authentic as the external world. This is the reality of unconscious mind, but in its active 24/7 existence & based on, or spilling over into what Jung called The Collective Unconscious. This flipside of common reality is neither black nor white--or gray either for that fact. Just where this consciousness can be physically located is one of the tantalizing subjects of ORIGINS.The content of ORIGINS is perfectly aligned with the ideas presented in DAIMONIC REALITY; that is, the philosophy is a perfect fit. Author Stan Gooch is even more critical of the Jane Roberts material than I am--and that's saying a lot. However, I seem to remember finding a great deal of intellectual inspiration in Robert's first book SETH SPEAKS, but it's been aeons since I read the material & heaven knows what state my own consciousness was in at that historic place in time. I just remember really relating to the idea presented in SETH SPEAKS that the mundane personality is just the tip of a multidimensional iceberg-like Entity.As a psychological researcher, Stan Gooch's main intent in this work is to (1) demonstrate the actual, living presence of unconscious reality & how it affects the awake or conscious personality, and (2) how that reality translates into the common (yet profound) experiences classified as psychic phenomena. Not an easy task to illustrate, but the author most definitely succeeds.Stan Gooch has written a number of books, and I have seen them referenced (I really like the title THE DREAM CULTURE OF THE NEANDERTHAL), but have not read them yet. Judging from ORIGINS this is my summation of his abilities: He excellently explains the intricacies of the Science of Psychology. In fact, I enjoy his writing most when he addressees the specifics of the relationship between clinical psychology and Psychic Phenomena.ORIGINS OF PSYCHIC PHENOMENA provides an alternative approach to subjects held as sacrosanct by the new True Believers.What I find amazing is that ORIGINS really doesn't negate the existence of psychic phenomena. On the contrary, the book interprets the experience from a valid psychological perspective. If anything, ORIGINS OF PSYCHIC PHENOMENA gives a new life & vitality to the continued investigation of the subject. The book dispels the antiquated, externalized view of the phenomena and replaces it with an internalized, psychological mode that validates the reality of psychic phenomena, while at the same time affirming the depth of the individual psyche--the House of the Soul.The Death of Religion and the Rebirth of Spirit: A Return to the Intelligence of the HeartCarnival Of Lost SoulsDaimonic Reality: A Field Guide to the Otherworld

There is definite sexy time all through out but it's the banter between the main characters and the games they play that make this series so unique.Definitely take a chance on this one.

$review_text.: Iris lived a life isolated from society along with her father and Diana. Through her life, Iris felt that something is missing. Iris has been having dreams, and in her dreams that's where Iris is "herself". She can fly, it feels right being in that island and it feels like home. There's this sense of belonging-ness and fulfillment in those dreams and most especially - that boy. For the most part of the book, we journey along with Iris in discovering her past. Iris doesn't remember anything and she is struggling to know the mysteries that engulfed her life but nobody wont tell her until that day she read her fathers book.The whole Society of Feathers is interesting. I love how it is so different but the core ideology is similar to that of shapeshifters but more focused on birds. It can be a tough read at first since we discover things as Iris does so it is a bit slow but the process is refreshing. Bits and pieces will be given but it takes a patience for some but I love how my experience was. I may not love the idea of Iris and Falcon, too insta love-ish, but I did consider that they had a past that Iris didn't remember so technically they were already in love that's why it didn't bother me much.I would definitely recommend Owlet. It's refreshing yet familiar. It is written well with a little polishing in deliverance but entertaining. Owlet is definitely a read that can make you turn the page quicker as the story picks up and the ending, oh wow an absolute hooker that leaves you feeling sucky for not having the next book to read.
$SUMMARY.: Intriguing quick read

$REVIEW.: Joe Lansdale is back full force with Dead Aim. This is the Hap and Leonard we've always known. Though the last book was great but a slight bit of a hiccup, this one is masterful. It's so short, I'm not going to give a soliloquy that would ruin it for you. Just know that Leonard is Leonard, Hap shows some skills, the plot is thick and twisty, and there are ruminations of love and what matters the most in life. Normally I write reviews much longer than this, but all I can honestly say about this one is that it's, well, perfect. And I have no qualms whatsoever about having paid full hardback price on this. Lansdale achieves in 100 pages what most writers mess up in three hundred. Thanks for this Joe. This all that's best about what got me into Hap and Leonard in the first place. If you didn't get it yet:  buy it.

$review_text.: "Victory in Defeat" is the true-life story of the brave marines and contractors who were captured on Wake Island by the Japanese in December 1941.  Gregory Urwin uses the personal stories of the survivors to retell the harrowing tale of their capture and more than three years of captivity in China and Japan.  It was a fascinating story of bravery, depravity, and even humanity.  This will be a delightful read for both the casual reader interested in Marine Corps history, or for the more serious students of military history.Urwin opens the book by analyzing the Japanese amphibious assaults on Wake Island  in December 1941 (Of note, the Marines defense of Wake Island during the first assault stands as the only successful defense against an amphibious assault in the Pacific during World War II).  The Japanese, now reinforced with airpower from two carriers returning from the attack on Pearl Harbor, began their second assault on December 17th.  Major Deveraux, the Marine commander, realizing the futility of the situation, reluctantly surrendered the garrison beginning their almost four years in captivity.Using primary sources such as personal interviews and secret journals kept by the Marines and contractors to reconstruct events, Urwin reconstructs the events of the next few years.  The prisoners spent a few months at Wake Island before they were forced to transit the Pacific Ocean aboard one of the famed Hell ships.  They disembarked outside of Shanghai, China where they lived until the Allied advance forced the Japanese to move the prisoners to other camps across Korea and Japan.  Urwin meticulously accounts for the locations of each group of prisoners as they moved from camp to camp.As with any tale, there were heroes and villains.  Urwin attributes Deveraux's leadership  as a key factor that enabled the prisoners to survive the war with a much higher survival rate than other camps across the Pacific.  The other was Mr. Edouard Egle, the local Red Cross representative in Shanghai.  Egle's deliveries of Red Cross relief supplies ensured the prisoners had a regular supplement to their meager diets.I have read other books about the inhumane treatment of Prisoners of War by the Japanese such as "Slaughter at Sea: The Story of Japan's Naval War Crimes" and "Flyboys: A True Story of Courage".  With a few exceptions, "Victory in Defeat" stands in stark contrast to the war crimes documented in these two other works.  Despite the uncomfortable topic, it was a very enjoyable read.

$REVIEW.: From the imaginatively rich details that sets up a full background for the reader to grasp both the enormity of the world's multiple races - each having their own unique history and culture - to the innocent courage of the human protagonist, Karsen, as he carries out an adventure. The adventure Karsen is pulled into moulds him from the initial innocent, naive young man into what we finally observe at the end of the story - a mature, experienced young man. During this entire tale, the reader remains alongside Karsen - and all other characters - through this creative, mystical world of Tholann. As one read's, each page holds a hope for more and more adventure. The end of the tale was bittersweet - one that you wish had not ended and kept you wanting more. I enjoyed every minute of it; looking forward to much more from Mr. Patrick in the future. This is an excellent story; it combines all elements that one would expect in a fantasy and then exceeds that expectation. Highly recommended to any who can get a hand on a copy of this book!

$review_text.: If you like to read series, which I do, The Rachel Scott Adventures, Asylum Harbor and Burn Out, were two great stories packaged together.  I had not read anything prior by this author.  I like the development of her characters, especially Rachel Scott, the main character; her friend, Stacy a reporter; Red, one of Rachel's employees and her current romantic interest Mike, now retired FBI.  Rachel has had her only child, a daughter, kidnapped and to date has never been found.  It completely changed her life from a married, successful real estate agent to a divorced woman who turns her grief into helping others which inspired her to start her own company, Florida Omni Search. Both stories concentrate on finding missing people.  Asylum Harbor is based on the governor of Florida's daughter missing from a cruise ship.  This is scary as it makes you wonder about all of the actual missing girls in the Bahamas's.  The second, Burn Out, is about a missing firefighter.  In both stories, it is amazing the assumptions individuals make about the missing persons. These are the first two books in a series about Rachel Scott.  I can't wait for the next to see if she ever finds her own daughter.

She said, "Mommy, read it again!" ha-ha and I did! She said that she wanted to eat vegetables too and that is one of the best things that has come from reading this book. I recommend that all parents let their children read this and gauge their reactions. You never know what a child will take from a story like this one.

$review_text.: What an unusual concept for the plot.  It was highly original and intriguing.  However the main character's monologues were too lengthy and did not advance the plot or provide an opportunity to know her better.  The &#34;head over heels&#34; love affair was just plain juvenile and not authenic as was the contrived confusion between the real murder and the murder mystery.  I loved the Christianity aspect and how the author displayed the intimate relationship that grew between God and the main character. This isn't a bad book.  It just lacks feeling, momentum, and sufficient character development to prevent boredom.

This time around though S.E. takes you not only on a journey of love but on a journey of fear, pain, heartache and the will/need to survive in a world that has gone straight to hell.  S.E. created a wonderful leading heroine.  She is strong, determined, protective and has the will to fight for those she loves.  Even though she comes off as being tough and maybe even a little bit uncaring towards those that aren't related to her you later see a softer side to her when she first rescuses Hunter.  She can't leave him to be tortured and killed so she releases him to give him a fighting chance.  This gives you the first glimpse into their relationship which just lets you know that there is more to come and that it will be explosive.Something I love about S.E is that she always more that one supporting character in her book.  You get to meet Jesse's two sisters along with Hunter's two fellow warriors.  The connection the 2 warriors and 2 sisters have towards one another offered great humor and you could even feel the love connection between them.  I'm looking forward to reading their stories next :)  Overall, this is a wonderful love story, I couldn't put it down and finished reading it in one sitting.  S.E. always amazes me with her writing and I love everyone of her books!!  I recommened this and all of her books to anyone who has and hasn't read them.  You are missing out if you haven't read any of them!!!
$SUMMARY.: Out of this world amazing...S.E. Smith always delivers a terrific novel!

$REVIEW.: After reading &#8220;Desire & Prejudice&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t believe the book was written by a first-time author. It is fast-paced and compelling, and very believable. I almost wonder if the book is a little bit autobiographical? If there is just one problem, is that it&#8217;s too short and ended kind of abruptly. I do look forward to reading more from Jean-Louis McMillan, and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read.

$review_text.: LOVED Dorian. No apologies, no excuses just Dorian being Dorian. I loved Gabriella in this book as well and how they were together. I can honestly say that I haven't read a book in a long time that I felt the chemistry between two people so much that the events with Aurora deeply disturbed me. I was so mad I actually put the kindle down and stopped reading for a day. Then of course I picked it back up and continued on. This book was an emotional roller coaster and I loved the ride!!

$REVIEW.: I bought this at Barnes & Nobles a couple of years when it first came out. I was interested in becoming a leisurely reader and had seen this book appear on Fox News so I thought what better way to get started than reading a conscise book on national security by an expert on the inside? I thought Thiessen's defense of EIT as the moral highground was phenomenal and the insights of who is trying to defend these terrorists was especially interesting. It has been a while since I have read this so I plan on reading it again. I have read MANY books but this one stands out: It is well written, well argued, factually permeated and fun to read.

Except for the snotty rich girls, there is a lot of great stuff going on...like dances, homecoming, football games. You get the idea. Once Cindy joins the band, she gets along better than most poor kids in a rich school do. But that's after a makeover AND meeting the world's most gorgeous exchange student!

But when that film wins the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it is quite an achievement.The U.S release of this classic murder-mystery combines all the elements that made the film so engaging --- great, flawed characters, a decades-old mystery and a redemption tale.  The twist ending will have you gasping for breath as you turn the pages.  Hope we see more of this author stateside!

$review_text.: Her Father, My Master: Enthralled is told from the point of view of the young girl, Krystal. She is immature, needs control in her life like many young people her age. She makes a commitment to live the first year of her college life with her ex-friend's father, Mr. Henderson. He is an alpha male that likes control and order; he expects Krystal to follow his orders and learn self-control in a full time BDSM relationship.Both characters evolve to have slips in the desired control, which made them human as they learned to live in this relationship. He cared for her, controlled her and directed every part of her life but he did not love her. She was immature in some ways but she knew that he did not love her and she accepted this as she devoted her life to pleasing her master and giving him what he needed. The lack of love is the one thing missing from a committed BDSM relationship, but the commitment was being given for a specific period of time and they were open about it with each other.The sex scenes were many, varied and well written with great details. I found the girl a mixture of immaturity but seeking to learn to control her emotions and actions. Both characters had ups and downs, like normal people and her slip-ups and his melancholy gave them depth and like all people they had problems to solve in their relationship.I enjoyed the ups and downs and twists and turns of the characters as they interacted. The sex scenes were inventive, varied and detailed.

It just took Alexis Kelly to dig it out

Faced with drowning in a  sea of debt Alexis takes a job at her best friend's Mistletoe Ranch, where the rich came to find their perfect match
When she finds Gray on her massage table she wants to run, far, far away


Fun ensues and some steamy love scenes to fog up your glasses fill the pages of this great read.Once again I read this one late into the night, just to get to the grand finale, a happy ending! The Gift of Gray belongs on everyone's holiday reading list because it fills you with the holiday spirit and leaves a big ole smile on your face!

$REVIEW.: I know this book covers quite a slippery topic, but it all honesty it worked out briliantly, the twists and turns of Danni and Gabe's forbidden love story, the drama between and around these characters and the chemistry that pulled them together. It's an emotional and drama-filled story that won't leave you indifferent. I loved Twisted Summer for a lot of reasons, the main were already mentioned, but there's more.I loved that Lucy V. Morgan had the guts to write a story about something so challenging, risking that there would be readers who'd likely hate it. She wrote about a bi-sexual girl who falls in love with her step-uncle, that's homosexuality AND taboo relatioship. That made this book unordinary and highlighted in the NA genre. And it got a huge plus from me. Don't get me wrong, was it an incest, I wouldn't have enjoyed it, but Danni and Gabe weren't blood-related.Danni has mixed feelings about Gabe right from the start, he's sexy and doesn't curb the flirting, but she resists even though she likes him. After all he IS her step-uncle. There's a lot of turmoil and reluctant flirting between the two. And the fact that Danni has a girlfriend waiting at home makes it even worse, because after 'that night' Danni felt guilty for the cheating. How can you stop yourself from loving when it's so good?In relationship, Dani is kind of like the boyish and Esme the girly lesbian where Danni dominates their relatioship outside the bedroom. But when Danni is with Gabe she feels more feminine and Gabe dominated their sexual interractions.Cons:I know that Danni is a bitch for cheating on and lying to Esme, but I don't like that Esme is always trying to have Danni for herself and makes Danni leave her friends and family.Though the chemistry between Danni and Gabe was palpable and so frickin' awesome to read about, it did sometimes feel like their relationship was more physical than emotional. I know that the magnetism was what brought them together, but I wanted to find out more about Danni and Gabe.Bottom line:It was a twisted summer indeed! I have never read a book like Twisted Summer before and I really enjoyed all the feels I got from it, either it's hate or love, stress or relief, I was on edge. This book pulled me in right from the start and had my undivided attention, I couldn't stop until I found out how it ends for Danni and Gabe. I really enjoyed this book and would love to read more books like this one.If you're open-minded, romantic and a passionate NA romance reader, you must read this book, because you'll definitely love it. I recommend this book!

$REVIEW.: This book made me feel cheated, but that was my own fault. I fell for the title(A River Valley Mystery) and thought the book would be set in England. Not to be, but then we continue on to the heroine who constantly eats chocolate and moans about her weight.  This didn't bother me until I hear that she weighs 125 lbs. I'll bet there are not many women out there who would complain too much about weighing 125 while still stuffing chocolates into their mouthrs non-stop.  The mystery itself was unbelievable and more a cast of comedy.  It was a fun read (if you don't have anything better to do).

$review_text.: After reading part one, Wild Fire, I couldn't wait for a part two and I have to say the wait was worth it.  AfterBurn picks up right where Wild Fire ends and it's even more dramatic. I love the way the author fills you in with flashbacks at just the right moment without losing the momentum of the book itself. As I read the book I could actually see it in my mind and it takes a great author to be able to do that. The characters play well off each other and the twists and turns will leave you shocked.The book was well written and honestly more than I expected and I was pleased to see that there was a final twist that left me with a smile but definitely wanting more from this author.I urge you to step into Ms. Blaques world and really get to know her...she will not disappoint you.

$review_text.: I bought this book because it had an interesting synopsis, definitely had promise. Unfortunately, that promise was left unfulfilled. I have no problem with short stories, but when a story is short, glaring errors are more of an issue. The biggest issue I have is with the timeline. How hard is it to type 3 words? "One month later" "Two weeks later" etc. would've been helpful; assuming how much time has passed or trying to mentally calculate it can be frustrating. Also frustrating is trying to figure out who's saying what in a conversation. Even more frustrating is having the MC's be actually in the middle of doing something, then next thing you know they've jumped over that and on to something else without even finishing the first thing. (Ex: when Jack followed Alan to the bathroom, he stood in the doorway feeling shy, then they were in the bed, still damp from the shower. Huh?) Imagine this during their one sex scene! Even the very first scene had me struggling to get through it. Editing needs work, as well as the writing itself. But a cute, sweet story can be found buried in here somewhere.

$review_text.: `Mother-Daughter Duet' is written by a mother/daughter team.  Cheri Fuller ([...]) is the mother; she is a best-selling award-winning author whose books have sold a total of one million copies.  Cheri is also a speaker at women's conferences and frequently guests on national radio and television programs.Ali Plum, Cheri's daughter, is a writer, songwriter, wife, and mother to Noah and Luke.  She's recorded background vocals for popular musicians, and `Mother-Daughter Duet' is her debut title.Ali and Cheri, who have a blog with the same name as the book [...]) explain their reason for writing this book:Looking into the past to process what has happened in our relationship is the hardest thing either of us has ever done.  But we were willing to go there because we know what it's like to come out of the struggle and conflict to relate as equals and adult friends and how enormously satisfying that is.  Because of our experience, we want to provide hope for discouraged moms who think their daughters are too far gone, or for the mom who simply doesn't understand her daughter or just longs for a closer, more connected relationship. (p. 6)I had a wonderful relationship with my mother as I reached adulthood; adolescence was another story!  She went home to be with the Lord on Christmas Eve, 2004.  I look forward to our reunion in heaven!Being that my mother is no longer on this planet, and the only daughter I have is an English Cocker Spaniel (!), I was not sure how much I would glean from this book.  However, I found it to be helpful for relationships apart from the mother/daughter relationship.  I am a women's small group leader at church, and I appreciated the information on Generational Differences found in chapter 2, in particular.Chapter 13 is entitled `The Power of Forgiveness.'  One paragraph that dealt with leaving the past behind really resonated with me:Up to that point, Mom couldn't seem to let herself off the hook.  She even took responsibility for things that had really been my responsibility or failures.  I, in turn, mirrored her tendency toward shame and lack of forgiveness of self.  I most wanted her to acknowledge her own worth and to claim it with confidence instead of staying stuck in a mode of self-criticism or perfectionism.  (p. 196)Another important subject that is discussed is fear:.....we need to face the fact that our fear is not faith; it is not demonstrating faith in God.  We need to let go of our fear.  But sometimes this kind of letting go is the most excruciating thing a mother can do when she's very concerned about her daughter.... (p. 114)These ladies are not afraid to tackle difficult subjects either.  They write about addictions, struggling in a crisis, postpartum depression, etc...This book includes discussion questions for each chapter, so this book could work for a small group study.  I think it would be neat if mothers and daughters came together to work through the questions, and learn more about each other!Overall, although I came in reading this book thinking it may not necessarily be helpful in my personal situation, I was pleasantly surprised that that was not the case.  Human relationships are human relationships, so good advice in one case can be applied in other cases.  Cheri and Ali seem to have a wonderful relationship with each other, and I appreciate how they share what they have learned with others!This book was provided to me by Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for review and giveaway purposes.Reviewed by Andrea Schultz - Ponderings by Andrea - [...]

$review_text.: "Kriegsmarine Auxiliary Cruisers" is an Osprey New Vanguard Series entry on Germany's use of commerce raiders during the Second World War.  Despite their small numbers, a double handful of armed merchant ships did a disproportionate amount of damage to the Allied war effort, as measured in tonnage captured or sunk, and in naval vessels diverted to hunt them down.  Gordon Williamson is the author; Ian Palmer provides the illustrations.After a quick introduction, Williamson walks the reader through a series of operational summaries on each of eleven German commerce raiders.  The text is accompanied by a nice collection of photographs and illustrations.  Especially interesting are the cut-away diagrams which show how the raiders concealed their guns, torpedo tubes and even float planes."Kriegsmarine Auxiliary Cruisers" is a short book at only 48 pages, with a bare-bones narrative.  There is only a passing attempt to address the larger operational impact of the raiders.  As such, the book is only an introduction to the topic, although it makes for very interesting reading.

 I didn't think Dr


Williams could disgust or creep me out anymore than he has, but he did!  He truly is a really dark, horrible person
 Meg keeps evolving and she is getting scary with the amount of power she is gaining

Thankfully her faith is keeping her grounded!  Farrow and Gavil really surprised me, in a good way, on the parts they played in this book

 Creed continues his awesomeness, but I wish he didn't have amnesia
 Hopefully he gets his memories back

 I was mad at Cole though

 He was so selfish!  Maze is always amazing, and the brothers and mom are wonderful.

$REVIEW.: If I were to tell my real life friends that for months I am awaiting a new meeting with my friends Ty and Zane they would have probably asked who Ty and Zane are and why they have not met them yet. Of course if they would have learned that Ty and Zane are characters from the book, the least I would have gotten myself from my friends would be multiple eye rolls.Nevertheless, this book WAS for me like meeting old friends, learning what they were up to while I did not see them and remarkably, learning that I did not know nearly as much as I thought I did about their characters.I am a type of reader who is usually worried about reading a sequel to the beloved book simply because the next book will not measure up to the first one and also because I often feel that writing a sequel when there is nothing else to learn about the characters and that author will not be able to come up with powerful conflict between the protagonists and instead will create fake conflict just for the sake of it.Okay, of course I saw that after Cut and Run Ty and Zane had plenty of emotional issues to resolve between them, but I was not sure after Sticks and Stones whether what is left between them (to say those words to each other) is going to be enough for the whole book. Oh boy was I wrong.It is like in every book we are shown more and more of who these guys are and what makes them tick and how much they really do care for each other even if they are scared as heck to admit it.And they do mature in every book and their relationship truly does reach new level of trust and understanding and now I am not worried at all that these amazing authors will not come with enough new material for the books to come in the series.Sex scenes were so so hot and I loved how often authors made me laugh throughout the book.Bravo!

It's almost should have been broken down into more books rather than a daily, yearly account of the main characters life. I gave up half way through and started reading something that moves.

$REVIEW.: I read a lot of cycling books, and most of the time I'm pretty disappointed by them. They are generally one or more of the following: poorly written, boring, egotistical, or in the doping era gossipy or overly speculative. However this book cuts through all the crap and give you one thing, the inner thoughts of a racing cyclist.  If you race, or have even just spent a lot of time in the saddle, this book will ring true and resonate with you. I've heard it said that 'cycling is boring only if you are.' Kind of a harsh point, but I take it to mean that a thinking person who rides has all sorts of entertaining thoughts running through their head when they get out on the road.  Whereas others might just be... bored.  Well Krabbe's Rider is the type of cyclist who thinks.  And if you do too, you'll likely get a kick out of his free flowing thoughts.  Most are related to the race at hand, other though are just tidbits of cycling insight. Some thoughts are even a little strange, but hey, who hasn't had a weird thought from time to time while riding?  I rode across America a few years ago and one day I got the song 'Ten Little Indians' stuck in my head for like half of Kansas.  Damn near drove me nuts... but my point is when your riding all day, you think of all sorts of stuff. But don't be misled, the vast majority of this book is about a bike race, a real race at that.  I've learned things from this book that I took away and still value today.  An example of which is the line: "cycling is about licking your opponent's plate clean before you start your own meal." If you race, you no doubt will understand the brutal truth there.

$review_text.: The authors gained and share important insights and have dispelled many key myths about the battle by basic fact checking.  Their detective work on how the Japanese Navy, and carriers in particular, operated was both interesting and valuable in understanding why things happened as the did.  The insights are those in the military, management and the reader of history will find valuable in understanding their own organizational risks.  Thank you Mr. Parshall and Mr. Tully for a highly readable and insightful book!The book would benefit for the use of command organization charts and tables of forces to supplement the well crafted narrative in the text.  Some people like narratives only, while many others (myself included) like to see the charts and tables to do their own audit of materiality and aid understanding.  Some of this information appears in the Appendices.Kindle related problems are the usual footnote issues (given the navigational issues, footnotes at the end of each chapter would be better, though if course having them at the bottom of the page would be optimal but I gather beyond Kindle capabilities at least currently),  inability to easily navigate to photos and maps, and the low quality of the photos.  These are publisher/Kindle issues.

I'm a childcare provider and 1st time mom (now 16 months old), and I recommend and buy this book for all of my pregnant friends (even dads-to-be should read it).Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  I had 7 other pregnancy books given to me by friends/garage sales, and they all were terrible, common sense type books.

$review_text.: Fighting Love starts you off feeling from the first chapter. The heart, passion and even the indifference among Tommy and Julie shows through every page. Ms. Nilies put both of these characters through the emotional ringer, and I hate to say it but that is what made this book a pleasure to read.Tommy is an out of work top MM Fighter both sexy and confident this hero had my knees week. Ms. Niles shows Tommy at his worse and best, when he brought his A-game in the romance department he wowed my socks off and when I see him at his worse I wanted to knock him upside the head. Can we say dense?Julie is a sweet, caring girl that made me smile, but I have to say she comes off a little nave when it came to Tommy. Really the guy is not a mind reader. After I got ahold of my inner bitch though, Julie redeemed herself. There was a certain special moment shared between them that had touched me.Tommy and Julie together are divine; their passion fiery. Both work toward each other the path uneasy, each with their own issues. Is it possible to move from a point of friendship to a romantic relationship without someone getting hurt?The secondary characters there were a few but what there was of them softened and lighten up the plot to make it more fun but did not take away from the true heart of the book. Ms. Nines is Brody and Mac getting a book? Will this spin off a series? The plot was well described. I never felt myself struggling to keep up.If you are looking to read a romance that will leave you all warm and tingly inside then you need to pick up Abby Niles book Fighting Love get comfy and enjoy Tommy and Julie story.Rated 41/2 Stilettos by Deb!

I cannot use the index at all and so much of the book is completely unusable.  They do not have any customer service to speak of so I cannot return the book. Hopefully a negative review here will warn potential buyers. Based on the number of reviewers with this issue, this is a well known problem yet they make no allowances to exchange for another cookbook. No other cookbook in our library has this problem.  The pages are extremely thin and of poor quality.  Shame on them for putting out a book of this quality -- it could have used some testing!

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Navarre Gospels and Acts edition and liked it so much I decided to buy this one too
A lot of Christians stick to the New Testament but I enjoy the Old Testament stories and I think the theology in the OT is very important for context.This study bible has scripture across the top and explanation and commentary across the bottom
It is typeset in a very nice font, I think it is Times New Roman, about 12 point

The result is large, clear, easy to read and pleasing to the eye


The translation from Spanish to English has been accomplished with very few errors, the grammar is quite good


It is printed on a heavier than usual paper and has a good quality binding and cover.The preface and introduction are excellent and delve into the issues of the various traditions that source the books

Each separate book has its own preface and I found them very informative.The commentary is very good
In the places where there may be translation problems it frankly addresses the issue

Where the text is repetitive or confusing the commentary doesn't avoid that and fairly points out what may be the problem

It has the best explanation of typologies I've seen and points out several I had never noticed

The commentary is gentle and instructive
It doesn't put you off - rather it makes you think
As far as I can tell it is scrupulously faithful to magisterial teaching.The bible has extensive reference to church fathers and magisterial teaching
Somehow they managed to pull that off while keeping the text very easy to read to the point that it is very hard to put down
I have had sessions with this bible where I read it for hours just for the pure enjoyment of a good read.I wish it were less expensive, but bibles aren't cheap and this is a serious scholarly work
It has opened my eyes to many things I hadn't seen in the raw text
I am very glad I purchased this one and I will be back for more.

$review_text.: first and foremost, "shinobu kokoro wa" is not the first of matsumoto temari's work that i'm familiar with. this manga is not bad, as far as short stories go, but certainly not exactly her best work. however, despite the okay plot, i absolutely love her artwork, especially when it comes to her color pages and tankubon covers. beautiful, exquisite and ethereal comes to mind when i first laid my eyes on the cover of "shinobu kokoro wa".the four stars is mostly for her lovely art, but i have to admit that her characters are adorable and lovable. i think that the lack of a deeper plot, or perhaps the brevity of each story is the reason why this manga is not as good as it could have been. i have read quite a few of her works, and i know that she's able to spin really good reads. i think that when one decide to use ninjas as characters, the plot can get bogged down with details and angst, as we are wont to see in ninja-related mangas. perhaps it is one of the reasons she did not delve further into the ninja tradition, especially if the main idea is to create a light-hearted romance manga. in that essence, i think the stories contained in this volume did the trick - simple, adorable and with minimal angst.there are genuine comic moments in this manga, especially those concerning the first ninja couple subaru and yuuzuki, and the snow-spirit miyuki and futaba. also, like another reviewer mentioned, it has lots of naruto-esque ninjutsus and whatnot (now that's another series with a healthy following of yaoi-oriented fans and doujinshis, but that's another story).matsumoto sensei's art is distinctive, with strong and rather quirky lines. her characters are angular and with her ukes (or neko) they are quite cute and pinchable (lol). one thing i notice is that her characters tend to have huge hands, and for some reason it doesn't bug me like i thought it would. it's just one of her peculiarities... she proves that a mangaka can both make her characters bold with her black and white art and yet create a dreamy and gorgeous colored version of them without the characters losing their personalities. i'm just amazed at her proficiency."shinobu kokoro wa" is a manga that is light and fun, with striking characters and art that i think will be a pleasant addition to any yaoi lover's library.

The next favorite one would be the cream cheese and pepper sandwiches or the mini muffins or quiches. Maybe I just like it all. My whole book is dog-ear'd.

$review_text.: Very short and funny. Too much machoness for me though to read another story, but I found it very entertaining. I laughed at the characters antics from the beginning until the very end. I like more supernatural, deeper, more complex stories so I only gave it 3 stars out of 5. I thought there would be werewolves or something in the story because alpha is in the title, but I didn't see anything like that in the first story. The main male character is definitely an alpha male though. Maybe the supernatural will appear later in Redrock two. Either way, it is entertaining and fun, but the plot isn't very deep; the storyline is more simple and humorous.

$review_text.: This book will change the way you shop, eat and drink

This book has many colorful pictures to look at


The authors select the best and worst picks for 125 categories of food

There are best and  worst picks for cereal and even jarred vegetables


 I never knew that Quaker natural Granola, Oates, Honey and Raisins has a whopping 420 calories and 30 grams of sugar
These editors from Men's Health magazine expose food and food secrets like no other
 I never knew that something as healthy as V8 peach mango splash has 80 calories and only 10 percent juice

The biggest secret I learned is that the leanest cuts of meat often have the most sodium


 Chicken and turkey are often injected with a liquid solution to dry them out
 This solution contains a lot of salt
 I also never knew that the sweetener Aspartame can be dangerous

It can cause headaches and may even cause brain tumors


 Aspartame can be found in diet sodas that are often thought as healthy
 I already knew that long lines make a person buy more in the supermarket
 This is not a secret, but it is interesting to read

 I learned that a Bloody Mary is the the healthiest cocktail, because I can get my vegetable needs in one drink


 This book is an eye opener.

$review_text.: 40 years ago Studs Terkel toured America, as had become his habit


 He sat down with people and talked to them and he listened


 These people came from all over not just geographically, but also in terms of class and race


 We hear the stories of business men and bankers and pro athletes and models; we also hear the story of cabdrivers and the men on the factory floors and the people trying to organize those workers into unions
 We get to know people who work with their hands and people who get to work with their minds.Terkel's project is wonderful, as it shows a snapshot of the hopes and worries of Americans on the edge of the social upheaval of the late 60's and early 70's

 What may or may not be surprising is that many are the same

 The hope for a better future for our children, worries about change in automation and computerization causing the elimination jobs, these are contemporary and illustrate the tenuous nature of living in a capitalist society where we work to live, and very few are allowed the opposite
 Terkel's book shows these men and women's stories as a beautiful still-life, giving everyone the quite dignity that is elusive when you are Working.

$review_text.: I'm not exactly sure what rating this book with stars might communicate. It's like rating Hitler's Mein Kampf: &#34;Hm... well... Is it just 'okay' or do I 'like it' or do I 'love it'?&#34; Wouldn't choosing any of those cast doubt on a person's character? And yet, if one appreciates it merely as a historical document...?That's how I feel about this book, which I was assigned to read for a graduate course in public opinion. As a historical document, it's an important book. And maybe I should have given it five stars, because this edition of it is quite good. But as a book itself, it's pretty horrifying, like Mein Kampf (although not THAT bad, of course). This book marks the birth of public relations, and it reveals just how dishonest and manipulative that industry is. So... do I &#34;love it&#34;? No. But not because it's not important, readable, a good edition, etc.If you're buying this book for college/grad school, then this is a perfectly respectable version of it. Go for it. If you're buying it just to learn about the history of PR, go for it. If you're buying it because you want to learn how better to manipulate people, you should really also pick up a copy of the Bible or at least some moral philosophy books while you're at it!

I am fascinated how people 2000 years ago associated snake to evil, just like this book proves! In order to be fully functioning emotional creature you need to have &#34;organ&#34; for emotions, if you lack it you will be a psychopath or something else, this is what its called beauty inside! And its not written on anyones forehead, i just absolutely loved the book!!! its fascinating read, and really wonder why so many negative comments??......the author was really beeing honest there, and many of the people would not be able to be so honest.....this is irony of life, some psychopats actually say things honestly when they want it

$review_text.: This is an important and much needed book that provides an accurate account of Che Guevara as a murderer, narcisist, sadist, bully, egomaniac and complete failure.  It makes a rational person wonder how so many people hold Che up as some kind of democratic revolutionary fighting for the common man.  The entire Che myth in our culture is based on communist propoganda reported as fact by journalists who should know better and a populace all to eager to jump on a bandwagon to be part of the cool crowd without really caring about what they are doing.  There really isn't any gray area where people can disagree on Che.  He was a complete failure as a military commander.  He helped drive Cuba's economy into the ground as the Minister of Industries or whatever his title was.  The only thing he was good at was murdering Cubans in his prison without anything close to a fair trial.  It's really sad he's idolized by one segment of our society.

$review_text.: I read &#34;Fall from Grace&#34; & &#34;Saving Grace&#34; almost a year ago. My friend started reading them so I decided it was time to read &#34;Scars & Songs&#34; Shane's Pov. I don't normally read paranormal books but when I started reading &#34;Fall from Grace&#34; I had no idea it was that kind of book not until the end - I know there were clues mid way but I still didn't know until the end and by that time I was totally and utterly sucked in. To this day this is the only paranormal series I have read. I would say it's more biblical being as it's about arc angels. Not for my review lol. OMG I wanted to jump in my e-reader and just love Shane. I can't say I remember Grace being so mean to Shane in the first two books but I think she wanted him but didn't want to but seeing it from Shane's pov I can see why he thought she hated him. It was a crazy intense dance these two did around each other you couldn't help but feel the tension.  It was a long dance but finally when things came to a head it was Beautiful!! This book too their future further than the first two books. Oh yes then there's Grace's friend Lea who is absolutely hilarious!!Fantastic ending.Quotes:&#34;If I could end my existence right now, I would die the happiest soul to have ever walked the earth, because I knew this. Because I had felt this. Because I have known Grace.&#34;&#34;You, sir, are a bit easy on the eye, so therefore I shall stare at you. If you feel at all uncomfortable, I could always knock you over the head with something until you're unconscious and take pictures.&#34;&#34;Holy fellatio!

$review_text.: Story vignettes are like hors d'oeuvres. They pique your interest, but they're not very filling. The anecdotes found in Chicken Soup for the Soul: All in the Family are palatable because they are taken from real-life families, but due to their brevity they fail to leave a lasting impression. Editor Susan M. Heim does an admirable job sifting through thousands of submissions to arrive at the 101 included entries, but the limitations of the Chicken Soup framework produce superficial, glossy tidbits instead of deeply resonating personal accounts.The stories while divided into sections such as vacations, holidays and in-laws tend to blend together due to a lack of significant detail. The tales are quickly forgotten since many are based on worn-out cliches - the insufferable mother-in-law, the inept father, the doting grandmother. While some delve into serious issues like abandonment, alcoholism and mental illness, most unwittingly reach a tidy conclusion within two to three pages. These easily portrayed resolutions are likely to create a disconnect for the majority of the book's audience.Yet there are a few that rise to the occasion of providing substance in a condensed format. In "Right from Wrong," author Michael T. Smith states: "I learned a lot from my dad. I learned how not to treat my wife. I learned to give my children love and attention. Dad didn't teach by example. He taught by making me aware of what is wrong." A mental burden is revealed in Marijoyce Porcelli's "Grandma's Beads:" "Somehow [Grandma] let go of that frigid, bitter persona that was her usual self and talked, really talked. Unfortunately, these pleasant lulls didn't last long." The struggle to reconnect with an estranged son is depicted in Marsha D. Teeling's "A Tiny Piece of Paper:" "Why does [my son] hate me? I see him with his children, and I know that at least he is breaking the cycle because he is a loving, caring father."Some humorous moments deserve a mention. April Knight's family arrives in the Ozarks only to attend the wrong reunion in "Who Are All These Strange People?" Melanie Adams Hardy learns a whole new vocabulary while riding in "Grandma Lillie's Red Cadillac." Mimi Greenwood Knight deals with a husband whose mouth lacks an off switch in "What Did You Say?" While all the mischievous Ben Kennedy has to say is the key phrase: "That Did It!" to cause his little brother to take off running and screaming.Overall, this is a book for a location where reading options are limited such as a doctor's waiting room or an airport gift shop. It's a good time killer when there's nothing better to read.

$review_text.: Welcome once again to the wacky world of Stanley Hastings, a private investigator who works for a negligence attorney who reaps in loads of slip-and-fall cases through TV advertising
 Stanley does nothing more exciting than sign up clients to a retainer agreement and take pictures of broken steps and potholes and the like.That is until one day a hitman comes in to hire Stanley to prevent him from killing the person he has been hired to kill


 The only problem is the "client" gives a false name and fails to identify the victim


 Stanley undertakes the task, but then the hitman is shot dead and the person Stanley thought was the target also is shot and killed
 From that point the plot gets more and more complicated and confusing.However, the story, writing and dialog are very funny, in keeping with the tenor of the earlier entries in the series

 Stanley's wry comments are multiplied by those of his wife and favorite police officers, as well as his attorney-employer
 Fun to read, and recommended.

$review_text.: I am not (yet) an experienced baker and as such I was more than once puzzled by the errors contained in this little book. Some of the recipes will list specific ingredients in the ingredients list, but there's no explanation on how or when to use them (in other words, they're left out entirely from the method part of the recipe). Other recipes will omit essential ingredients altogether (like the &#34;Black Bottom Banana Sweet Bread&#34; where I couldn't find any type of rising agent: no yeast, no baking powder, no baking soda). Most of the time I used this book as a reference, just to give me an idea of what I'd like to bake, than I had to google the recipe and correct the errors.Also on the negative side, whole lotta calories in most recipes! Again, one could use some previous experience to make substitutions and, at the very least, reduce some of those huge quantities of butter. Personally, I also think there are too many sweet bread recipes versus plain bread recipes, but that is a matter of taste.On the positive side, the book contains many great ideas for baking, will also force one to get experienced in baking fast (or else..), and it's only 1 dollar. Just don't expect to get the book, choose a recipe and proceed to baking; this book requires additional research.

$review_text.: Tia Louise has outdone herself! This book is awesome! I read it in 2 sittings (which is kind of fast for me). I already knew and loved these characters, but this book made them even better. You were able to see a whole new side to the characters.Melissa and Derek's love was as strong as ever and their sex scenes as sexy as ever! But, we did get to see Derek's dark side, which was pretty awesome! I think I like bad boy Derek better than mushy in love Derek. Melissa was her normal self, but I felt like she was a more supportive match for Derek in this book than in the first one. I think the two characters were more in sync than they had been in the first book.Elaine, Patrick, and Star were great supporting characters and really added to the story line. I love how this series is written, each book has a couple as the main focus and the other characters are just supporting roles, but then the next book will have the supporting characters as the main characters and so on. It's wonderful!The sex scenes were steamy and believable which is something I look for in a novel like this. I don't want some ridiculous scenes where you'd have to be cirque de solei performers to accomplish the different positions. The sex scenes weren't overly graphic, but they got the point across and made the characters real.The story line complimented the first book nicely and tied up all the loose ends. I loved this book and I gave it 4 stars. Tia Louise has become a great friend and one of my favorite authors and I look forward to her future pieces of work.*I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.*

$REVIEW.: This is a very good book, with plenty of important messages for parents and educators
However, the writer deals with his Asperger's through diet and for many, Asperger's is addressed with a combination of medication and therapy
It would have been really helpful to see a chapter on dealing with taking medication at school (a major geek drag), stigmas of taking medications on a daily basis and how medications can work for and against you
Another chapter on the benefits of working with a competent therapist, behavioural psychologist or psychatrist should also be included
These would obviously have to be written by another young person with Asperger's.My son was eager to see how the author dealt with the medication and therapy issues and was disappointed to find that the author didn't need these aids in his dealings with Asperger's


But everyone on the spectrum is vastly different in the way they are affected, so no one book will cover all the bases
This is a good start.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed Kay's intro book for sight wordsEssential Sight Words Level I - Introductory (8 Readers) (Learn to Read)so much that I had to pick up a copy of this book. I really enjoy the little tips that are given before the actual sight word exercises. Kay really shows an understanding of the logic and theory behind the concept of sight words.I have also lent this book to 2 other friends and a coworker and they have all said that the book is top notch. Excellent read for any parent looking to teach their children sight words.  Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: When transitioning to a new position, you can find countless volumes available that will be helpful. However, most books written on the subject are geared to a rather exclusive audience relating to upper management. CEO's and COO's can find a seemingly endless supply of resources. THE FIRST 90 DAYS by Michael Watkins reaches much deeper into the management food chain with techniques and strategies that are applicable whether you are at the senior management level of a Navy Seaman being promoted to 3rd class Petty Officer.Watkins introduces what he terms the STaRS model, which teaches the newly promoted leader to first identify the status of the company for which you are involved, be it Start up, Transition, Realignment or Sustaining Success. This is critical to success, as each business modal must be approached with different strategies.Though this book would be beneficial for anyone being promoted from within an organization, I personally believe is greatest value would be for an outsider first coming in to a new company in that it covers many things that often are overlooked by newly hired managers, such as culture adjustments and team development.Above everything else, Watkins teaches the importance of timing. Newly hired or promoted managers all to often, make the right decisions, but at the wrong time. This goes back to the STaRS identification and the importance of knowing what mode your company is in before making changes.The book reads quite easily. Watkins effectively gives real life business examples of successes and failures and does so in a way that these examples can easily be applied to countless situations. Whether you've just received your first promotion ever with only one subordinate under your supervison, or are taking over a Fortune 500 VP position with hundreds of people on your team, you will gain critical insight to how to succeed from this book.

$review_text.: "A Foot soldier for Patton" covers over four years of service is the U.S. Army during World War II.  The period of time covered by author Michael Bilder and his son James is so extensive that some parts of the book became slightly vague as a result.  I suppose there is a certain margin of error within every memoir written over forty years after the events took place. That said, this book is never-the -less an amazing first person account of the final year of war against Germany, stretching across four countries and five campaigns.  Bilder states more than once of his extraordinary luck throughout the war; his survival was owed as much to luck as his gutsy, lead-by-example style of soldiering.  It seems Bilder was a natural leader, though his independent, slightly anti-authoritarian attitude prevented him from ever earning the rank of Sergeant, which he definitely deserved.Bilder and his son prove to be a great writing team, as many of the best memoirs from the war are co-written with help from an historian or family member.  Bilder's story begins in 1940 as he is drafted into the army from a tough, working class German neighborhood in Chicago.  The first part of the story is the best written; Bilder presents as good a portrait of the "Greatest Generation" in its' pre-war days as any memoir out there.  The reader really gets a clear sense of the author's character and demeanor, which once inducted into the Army, leads to some vintage comedic situations.  Bilder was fiercely independent with a passion for jazz bands and dancing.  The army was certainly not high on his list of priorities, but like so many citizen soldiers of the day, answered the call bravely when his name came up in the draft.  By the time the tough, first generation German-American is inducted into the Army in 1941, he already has plans to marry a beautiful Irish girl from his neighborhood, whose love throughout the war remains idyllically true.After training with the 5th Infantry Division in the American south during 1941, his unit is shipped to Iceland shortly after Pearl Harbor, where it remains until the middle of 1943 when they sailed to England.  Bilder's pre-combat chapters total nearly 100 pages and they are so colorful and humorous they could have been pulled straight from a nostalgic novel about 40's. That said, once his unit enters combat, the writing style shifts dramatically.  There is a slight disruption to the rhythm of the book as his division enters Normandy during July of 1944.  The book's linear flow is interrupted, replaced by fragmentary episodes about a certain buddy or skirmish.  There is little union between the historical reference points which the author and his son researched and his actual memoires of combat.  I think the story suffered a bit from the passage of time between the events and when they were written down.  You would think that most memoirs would have this problem, but the majority of them are able to pin down specific anecdotes with exact dates and locations on a map and continue this pattern in a linear fashion.  This union is essential for the memoir to be fully coherent.  That is not to say that Bilder and his son fail to do this throughout because there are numerous little stories within the book which are tied in with the division's history--it is only that they are fragmentary at best.The same is true of the lack of secondary characters; they appear in the book but the reader doesn't get to see the war through their experiences with any regularity.  This is partially attributed to Bilder's role within the 2nd regiment.  He becomes a certified combat lifeguard who pulls men out of the water during amphibious operations.  He then becomes a Red Cross liaison, whose job it is to carry messages to all companies of the 2nd regiment.  In effect, Bilder served with every company of his regiment at one time or another.  This is partially to blame for the scattered nature of his story.Although there are slight imperfections, it is definitely a good book and if nothing else, an amazing chronicle of one man's fight throughout the toughest and largest campaigns against the German army.  From the hedgerows of Normandy to the fortress city of Metz during Patton's Lorraine fighting, the reader witnesses Bilder on the front lines, killing with chilling regularity.  That he survived the war relatively unwounded is nothing short of miraculous, as his only stint in the hospital comes after a potato masher grenade knocks him over during the Battle of the Bulge in Luxemburg.  He admits his two week stay started to raise the suspicion of the hospital doctors and Bilder was back in combat throughout the end of Winter and Spring drive throughout the German heartland and on into Czechoslovakia.  Bilder's skills with the German language make him a valuable asset with his commanding officers and one can only wonder if this kept him in the right place at the right time as to avoid death.  Never-the-less, there are a few instances where he should have been killed but was saved by a freak misfire of a German Luger and the timely shelling of his previous positions. Bilder's luck and his tough, independent attitude were enough to pull him through the war's fiercest campaigns with barely a scratch.  His story ranks with some of the most impressive tales of the average grunt in the ETO in that Bilder is emblematic of his generation and Patton's Army in particular.

Contains heartbreaking situations, but LOVE conquers all in the end. Spoiler: the book doesn't end all neat and roses, but you will feel like the characters have some closure. I felt good about the ending, and I HATE unfinished business or sad endings. I read a book to escape life. I don't want to feel even more sad after reading it. This book accomplished just that. I feel sad for the life the characters had to endure growing up but in the end, I was left with a bright outlook and hope for their future. Awesome read!

$review_text.: Though very weird and grim in places No One is Here Except All of Us, draws a reader in

 Its premise is a small and isolated Jewish town, which basically forgets the world and begins anew
 And why not?  The time is World War II and Pograms, and the town is desperate for hope instead of resigning themselves to death
 Though fantastical, the plan works at least until reality and the rest of the world can no longer be held at bay.The story is told mostly from the point of view of Lena, one of the town's youngest as she grows up in this bizarre set of circumstances


 Critical moments are also described by other townsfolk because the story is as much about the town as its narrator

 And while the story isn't exactly paced consistently that only adds to its surreal rendition
 There was a time I thought I couldn't continue on after a particular slew of devastating tragedies, but I simply could not look away

 And if I ever doubted that so much could befall one person, the author's afterward suggested much of the plot was based on stories from her grandmother

 This was fast read and entirely original novel.

$review_text.: The subtitle of the book says it all and this book fulfills its promise.  In this anthology, writers talk about their most personal experiences of themselves as sexual beings: the gender they feel they are-sometimes in contrast to their physical bodies, what sexual experiences feel in synch with their arousal, and how each of these are changeable over the course of a lifetime.None of the authors fit the general expectation of lesbian, gay, bi, or transgendered.  If a self-identified lesbian and a gay man are partnered sexually, how do they then define themselves?  Why are bisexuals so often discriminated against by gays and lesbians as well as by the general public?  And in terms of being part of a community, how do others label them?Understanding the fluidity of desire and identity can reveal these mysteries, which challenge the queer community as well as mainstream folks who worry about how children will be raised and what makes a family."PoMo" refers to postmodern as the editors articulate so well on page 21 "Postmodern thought invites us to get used to the Zen notion of "multiple subjectivies" ---the idea that there is no solid, objective reality, that each of us experiences our reality subjectively affected (or influenced) by our unique circumstances.  This mode of thought encourages overlapping and sometimes contradictory realities, a life of investigation and questioning as opposed to essentialism's quest for the One Truth, the innate quality, indubitable facts on a silver platter, the answer to everything."Each essay is honest, thoughtful, and very well written.  I enjoyed this book more than I would have guessed and look forward to reading other work by the individual authors.~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY; THINGS THAT TICK ME OFF; and EXPLORING YOUR SEXUAL SELF, A GUIDED JOURNAL (May 2001).

Helen Scott Taylor captured the distinct and well-developed personalities of Tom, Eve, and Polly whose accidental connection changed all thei lives for the better. Neither Tom nor Eve were looking for love when he rescued her when her car got stuck in a ditch during a blizzard. However, just in time for Christmas, they all somehow fit together as a family with a lovely HEA ending.This story had wonderful, realistic imagery and I had no trouble picturing the scenes. The dialogues were all sparkling, authentic, and fun to read.

Kellan is apathetic and lazy. Somehow this works. They should not be likeable characters. But I absolutely loved them.They both grow over the course of the book. I have a thing for character development. Makes me all hot. And this book mostly focuses on the relationship and the characters, so there was a lot of growth for me to enjoy. I liked watching Nate and Kellan mess everything up. They were lovely in their imperfections. Confused and damaged. They had these realistic reactions that had nothing to do with logic and everything to do with emotion. It was great. They were both just really human.Also, Nate and Kellan were hilarious. I laughed a lot. This was a great book. If you enjoy character development and imperfectly realistic characters then you will love this!4 Stars

$REVIEW.: I do not normally enjoy that romance novels, however this is not the average romance novel. This is erotica - meaning highly sexual scenes that are not appropriate for children. That being said, this is a great book. Follow a lust that blossoms aboard a ship between Alan Pendale and the spinster Clarissa in the year 1800.

$review_text.: There is an American writer of the U.S. West who lives in Seattle but who grew up in Montana. His name is IVAN DOIG and he is a wordsmith of the first rank. I just finished reading his latest tome, SWEET THUNDER (ISBN 978-1594487347, hardcover, $27.95), his fourteenth book, three of which are non-fiction. Many if not all are set in Montana during contemporary and historical time periods. I have read a few of them but not all and those have been very happy periods of reading.SWEET THUNDER features Morrie Morgan (Llewellyn) who had previous appearances in THE WHISTLING SEASON and THE BARTENDER'S TALE. I have not read either of those books but now I think I will. I can state that it is not necessary to have read the books in sequence but it would have been a big help if I had done so.The year is 1920 as the story opens. Morrie and Grace, his bride of a year, are in San Francisco. There they receive a summons from Morrie's former boss one Sandy Sandison to come to Butte, Montana as quickly as possible. Morrie and Grace had been traveling the world on the proceeds of a bet that he had made on the outcome of the 1919 World Series (the infamous Chicago Black Sox scandal that nearly killed baseball). The Chicago Mob is trying to find out who made the bet because they lost a lot of money. That is the first of many scrapes that follow Morrie and Grace.Once they arrive in Butte, the couple finds that Sandy wants to give them his mansion. To support his wife and house, Morrie gets a job on the Miners' Union backed newspaper as the Editorial Editor/Writer. The story documents some of the issues that the Union and Anaconda Copper battled over for years. A little history lesson that is easy to take. When Grace finds out that Morrie has a checkered past, she walks out. There are wonderful glimpses on how newspapers operated in the 1920s. You may even remember what a newspaper was/is.My recommendation is get a copy of SWEET THUNDER as fast as you can and READ it.GO! BUY! READ!

$REVIEW.: "Reclaim" is a book that appeals to diverse readers


I, for one, am an amateur when it comes to the formal practice of withcraft; but it is a subject of much interest to me
Mr

Plaisance provides a substantial and clearly detailed overview of the practice and its benefit to human lives

His narrative - combined with invaluable mythological references - is refreshingly accepting of varied belief systems

His recommendations are inclusive of those varying perspectives that readers may bring to the table

Nevertheless, he is a stickler for accuracy and purity of the message.Chapters are divided up into dimensions of the practice with at times simple, yet apparently effective, descriptions of how to go about performing rituals and achieving change.The thing I like best about works such as this is the way they are so egalitarian in their approach of vouchsafing knowledge to readers

You can either follow every single step included and actually act out, or one can approach it from a more intellectualmind set and glean little insights along the way that enrich whatever you are already doing.Enhancing concentration, minimizing neurosis, and applying seasoned methodologies are aspects of "Reclaim" that make this a hallmark for the psychologist's, as well as the magician's, library.I had the pleasure of meeting Monte Plaisance recently in New Orleans


His affability and sincerity serve as a testament to character-enhancing benefits of the practice he professes.There is no better way for me to break down any stereotypes about religions or belief systems than to meet one who exemplifies the higest tenets of their professed faith
Instantly that brings me into a realm of open-mindedness and curiosity.This book is a wonderful introduction to those things mysterious.

It&#8217;s a great mix of mythology (vampires and dragons) and explicit eroticism.Megan and Garrett are great characters, and though the chapters about dragons were great, I enjoyed the chapters with Meg and Garrett the most.It was also quite satisfying to find out that the author had decided to make vampires into much more inferior beings than dragons. Loved the scene where Garrett fights MacDuvall.Definitely a qualitative read!*Many thanks to Wendy Russo for purchasing an ecopy of this book for me!*

$REVIEW.: The story, while a bit convoluted, is rather engaging. The character introduction is rushed leading to very flat unrealistic characters. For a $0.99 book this normally wouldn't be bad; it'd be a fun, fast read, on a Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately it has no story arc outside of the entire series. This is more of a few chapters of a larger book, than a book unto itself. There is no beginning, middle, or end of the book, it is just the beginning of a larger book.I enjoy all of the options in the $0.99 books out there, but I still expect a complete story, not a few chapters for my $0.99. I will not be buying the additional chapters in this "book".

$REVIEW.: REVIEWThis book was a different take on Amish life.  This was about their horses and how important they were to the Amish families.  The book is about Lenny, whose father had left the Amish years ago. He goes to spend the summer with his step father's Amish family.  He doesn't know these people or their ways.  It was like going into another world for him.  He likes horses so the grandfather made him &#34;the Horse Boy&#34;.  His grandfather teaches him how to work with the horses while working on the farm.  Lenny slowly learns to understand and love the horses.  He learns how to work with them.  What to do and what not to do.  As each day comes and goes, he grows more confident in working with them. He not only learns about the horses but about the lifestyle and he becomes more confident with it also.  Of course, we need that little bit of puppy love, romance?  There is so much to be learned in this book.  Like I said, it's not your normal Amish read. It's educational, fun, and interesting.  I found it hard to put the book down.  I wanted to know if Lenny wanted to stay or was he in a hurry to get back to his TV and modern ways.Everyone who loves Amish books, should read this book.  It's fun, educational, a little romance tucked in, interesting and different.  I'm hoping the next book isn't far away.I was given a complimentary copy of UNDER THE HEAVENS from the author Thomas Nye and Book Crash for my view of this book.  No other compensation took place.I would give this book 5 STARS.

$review_text.: I could never have pictured the idea of each cities primary superheroes forming "teams" that competed for acclaim, but the authors of this story started from there, and then built the story around a mid-level team in a fictional city in California.And it worked.Part of it is the characters

 These heroes are powerful, but have human flaws and fiobles

 They struggle to live the mundane part of their lives while fighting a series of crises that crop up

 While they do this, members of the team die, others "hold out" for better contracts, or land on "injured reserve"
 All this occurs with the media scrutinizing the heroes


 There is a TV channel devoted to them, and the team has a PR director working on what to say and what not to say.But its more than just the characters
 Here the plot is layered
 There is more than one enemy, and the multiple factions create a number of events that help move thes tory along while keeping the end clouded
 Unlike some stories, I could not easily predict the way the plot would turn.I did see a few proofreading misses, but not enough to generate real concern.I wouldn't put this with "Wearing the Cape" or "Confessions of a D-list Supervillian", but its definitely one of the better superhero fiction tales I've read


 If you like superhero fiction, you'll enjoy this book.

To that point, I had not read the other Cape books in a while so it took some time to recall some of the characters and the parts they played in the larger story.  So not a story for folks that haven't invested in the franchise.

It took me forever to bite the bullet and read this one. Now I totally hate myself for caving... I am ruined. UTTERLY RUINED.I thought Books 1 and 2 jacked me up. I was wrong. My Gawd. READ THIS TRILOGY PEOPLE! I urge you start from the beginning & be smart, don't do what I did. Wait until all the books are out. You will thank me later for this advice.This Novella is a rollercoaster ride of emotion. Fear, romance, love, lust, Hell, intrigue, hate, hurt & death galore. I no longer have a voice cos I have screamed and cried so much while reading this. I can't go into any type of detail without giving you a spoiler. So I will say this journey this trilogy takes you on is beyond unique. Beautiful. Heart pounding all the way through. I have been knocked on my a** and dragged through the mud reading this trilogy. No, I take that back, it's more like I've been driven through a brick wall, with no airbags.I seriously cannot wait for the conclusion any longer.

$review_text.: Anna Sullivan&#8217;s Temptation Bay is an entertaining first installment in the Windfall Island series


It is a lovely romance but I must confess it is the mystery aspect of the storyline that I found most intriguing.At first I really was not sure if I was going to like either of the main characters


Maggie Solomon has built a successful charter service and while she is independent and fiercely loyal to her friends, she is incredibly stubborn and rather bristly


She has an extremely contentious and complicated relationship with her high ranking military father that colors her perception of herself and her self worth

Maggie&#8217;s interactions with her friends revealed the loving, softer side of her and I did wind up liking her more than I thought I would.In the beginning, Dex Keegan was just as annoying as Maggie, but his irritating traits were fleeting and limited to his first meeting with Maggie

His background is the complete opposite of Maggie&#8217;s and he has a warm and loving relationship with his extended family

Overall, Dex is the more likable of the two but he has a few hang ups that have a major impact on their relationship later in the story.The sparks fly between Maggie and Dex right from their first meeting but not all of those sparks are from attraction

Their first meeting is quite contentious and it takes a while for their antagonism towards one another to simmer down


However Maggie and Dex do eventually given in to their desire and wowza! Their encounters are passionate and their sex scenes are smoking hot

Although they are quite compatible in bed, out of bed, they are still fighting their respective demons
Ms

Sullivan has a few surprises in store for this volatile couple and I really enjoyed how their romance eventually played out.The mystery portion of the plot caught my interest right away and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the investigation


Maggie is a hard sell, but once Dex finally confesses the truth about his reasons for being on the island, she does aid him in his quest to find the missing Stanhope heir

Even with Maggie&#8217;s assistance, Dex continues to run into obstacles during his search and it soon becomes clear that someone is willing to go any lengths to keep them from finding the heir.Despite a few initial reservations, I enjoyed Temptation Bay


It is very well-written and the secondary cast of characters is outstanding

Anna Sullivan leaves a few of the storylines unresolved and I am eagerly awaiting the next Windfall Island series.I received a complimentary copy for review.

$review_text.: As I've grown older my appreciation for the art of early illustrators like Hal Foster, Al Williamson and Roy Krenkel has grown as well
It's easy to see where some of my favorite comic artists of the 60's and 70's got their influence


Vanguard Productions steps up to once again produce an outstanding book, this time collecting the art of Roy Krenkel with commentary by Al Williamson, Frank Frazetta and J

David Spurlock
We learn about Krenkel's life and works both from his peers like Williamson, Angelo Torres and Frazetta and from those he influenced like Mike Kaluta
Amazingly Krenkel found himself at the Burne Hogarth School after WWII along with Williamson and Frazetta and it was Krenkel who was responsible for getting Frazetta his start in doing paperback covers for Ace Books editor Donald Wolheim

Krenkel's busy schedule prevented him from doing the work and he convinced Wolheim to give Frazetta a chance...the rest, as they say, is history.The book lists every Ace title which featured a cover by Krenkel, a must-have for collectors! One of my favorites was "Port of Peril" showing Grandon of Venus battling a giant, spider-like creature


Grandon of Venus was a creation of writer Otis Adelbert Kline


Kline was a Burroughs knock-off who is perhaps best known as the literary agent for Conan creator Robert E

Howard
Krenkel would later join both Williamson and Frazetta in working for Jim Warren's line of horror magazines including Creepy & Eerie
The book provides a bibliography of his work at Warren as well as sample pages of Roy's art.In all there is 136 pages virtually loaded with Krenkel sketches, pen & ink work, and full color paintings

Virtually hundreds of examples of his stunning art!  Though earlier Krenkel collections (over 20 years ago) were primarily sketches, Vanguard has assembled the most finished Krenkel paintings ever collected as well as reprinting 24 of Krenkel's book cover illustrations

The comments by his peers are quite touching as all note Roy as a strong influence on their own work
The book is available in a soft cover edition, a deluxe hard cover edition that includes a bonus portfolio, and a limited, ULTRA deluxe hard cover edition that comes with gold gilded pages, suede slipcase, an official stamp of the Krenkel estate and an original Krenkel sketch


This is an outstanding book no matter which edition you get."I have been a lifelong admirer of Roy Krenkel's work and this book is a welcome holiday of his talent."- HARLAN ELLISONReviewed by Tim Janson

$review_text.: This is the second J. Robert Lennon book I've read, but this book, THE LIGHT OF FALLING STARS, was his first novel, and an amazingly complex and multi-layered work of fiction. It's hard to believe it was his first. A plane crash in Montana is the event that unites the several stories given us here. The central characters are all somehow connected to that crash - relatives, lovers, ex-spouses and eye-witnesses. The stories, which slowly converge and - mostly - come together, are fairly compelling. You want to know what happens next, in other words. The main problem I had with the book was that I didn't particularly like any of the people. None of them seemed to come across as very admirable or sympathetic characters. The younger ones seem directionless and vague in their aspirations - if indeed they have any defined goals or aspirations. And even the older ones - Trixie and Bernardo - are not very likeable. There is not much resolution to be found in any of the separate stories. But life goes on; maybe that's what the novel is about. In any case, perhaps Lennon bit off just a little more than he could chew with so many characters and subplots.For my money, I preferred the other Lennon novel I read a while back, called ON THE NIGHT PLAIN. A much tighter book with better-defined and sympathetic characters. (See my review.) So I don't think I'll give up on J. Robert Lennon yet. If I run across another of his books, I'll probably give it a try.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER

 What level am I at?  First or second level of advanced I'd say.So now I've bought this package to help me with my vocabulary(mainly the verbs)
 I know that without the help of this package my brain would stay in the comfort zone of the vocab I already know
 I generally listen to each vocab passage 5-8 times.4 stars because they should take the expressions out and replace with more verbs.This is a helpful tool, but you must build your active vocabulary first


 Goto the country and speak for at least a month to get the ear for the language and the basic vocab down.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed J.L. Flynn's Short Game novella, which is part of a longer series (The Long Game and The Waiting Game). First of all, it was a refreshing departure from the typical romance fare. It was set in Louisiana and the main character was from a group of Irish gypsies, called Travelers. They made their living conning folks, doing anything from completing a roofing job with many slippery shortcuts, to long games, involving cheats that required intricate planning and years of infiltration to make the steal.The main character, Jimmy starts to fall for a girl named Tracy, who works at the local hardware store. He considers this an impossible relationship from the start because she's what the Traveler clan calls a Buffer, a village person, who the clan is never supposed to interact with in any deep way.It's a perfect setup for a forbidden romance, and to add to the tension, Jimmy is also quite worried about what's happened to his older brother, Shay, who was sent away for a long con, or long game.My only quibble with this fascinating, fast-paced story was that the ending was too much of a cliffhanger. That's why I gave it four rather than 5 stars. I understand why--Flynn is setting her readers up to nab the next story and continue reading. But I am a believer in at least tying up a few loose ends in any series book. That said, I still heartily recommend this read, which stands out as unique, among other all-too formulaic fare.

$review_text.: I received this book for free from the author in exchange for and honest review. This book is definitely an 18+ book. It's classified as New Adult but I would say its very adult. There are a ton of sex scenes that are very graphic and intense., but are also filled with passion. I found that the plot was not as unique as it could have been but I still enjoyed the story very much.Natalie was a very guarded character because of her past but when she let loose she was a whole new person. I found her to be very relatable and I would probably be friends with her in real life. For the most part I liked Nolan, I found after some of the information he gave Natalie I became leery  of him.  So I will just have to wait and see about their relationship.My only issue was the characters names, I found them very close and I kept mixing them up. But overall, Hard to Resist was a great read. Definitely on the sexy side lol. I will be reading more books by Shanora Williams. I would recommend this book to romance lovers as long as they can handle the intense love scenes.

$review_text.: One of the coolest things about the e-book revolution is that it's provided more openings for the shorter literary forms, like the short story and the novella. I've always enjoyed the novella form. It's a quick read, but there's more time to develop character and more chances to crank up the suspense than you can usually found in the short story.Becoming Quinn is the novella done right. It's short, tightly written, full of action, but at the same time it gives you the opportunity to really get to know and to care about the main character as he makes his journey from idealistic cop Jake Oliver to become the hard-edged "cleaner" Jonathan Quinn.Brett Battles also has the one indispensable gift for a thriller writer: he makes events that you would normally find absurd seem not only possible, but inevitable.This book's a lot of fun. Check it out.

$REVIEW.: The Twelve Children Of Christmas: A Baihu Short Story is an adorable and heart warming fairy tail that is filled with action and suspense, making this a very easy story to get emotionally involved in the plot-line and moved by the likable life-like characters.Transported through time and space from Earth's past, James Chalk has a unique way of telling a tale that comes to life.Baihu, is a gentle giant yet there is something very special about this tiger. How could one not fall in love with this animal?This touching story was written about the goodness of people and in this case a tiger. It's a sweet Christmas story of faith, bravery, survival and even miracles."The Reverend Mother gathered her heavy winter cloak about her as she stared out the broken window. Wind swirled in the hall, lifting up the dusting of snow that had covered the floor. Worry creased the brow of her aging face. Smile crinkles about her eyes and mouth had turned down, forming a resigned frown. The children were many hours overdo, and if that wasn't enough to convince her that something bad had happened, the tiger's precipitous departure surely did! What could it be?" she wondered fearing the worst."

But I wish there would have been more about Brody's parents


I mean we learned about Kacie's parents and got plenty of her mom, but with Brody being such a 'Momma's boy' I didn't think there was enough of her.

$review_text.: This short novel is told in a first person, stream of consciousness narrative.  The narrator, Lobbi, is a young (22) Icelandic man who makes a long journey to tend the once famous rose garden of an isolated monastery that has fallen into disrepair.  He leaves behind his 77 year old widowed father and autistic twin brother.  Also left behind is a 4 month old daughter, born of a one night stand, that he has seen only once - the day she was born.The voyage to the monastery is fairly uneventful, apart from coming down with appendicitis on the plane and undergoing emergency surgery upon landing.  Along the way, Lobbi encounters a couple of young women eager to jump into his bed, a fact to which he is strangely equivocal.  He settles in at the monastery, revitalizing the garden by day and spending evenings watching movies and drinking all varieties of alcohol with Father Thomas, who finds answers to all life's questions in his sizable library of old films.The real story, however, begins when Anna, the mother of his daughter, arrives to drop off the baby for a few weeks.  Anna decides to stay, and the rest of the book deals with the relationship that develops among Lobbi, Anna and their child.There is a muted quality to the narrative that is inconsistent with what one would expect from a 22 year old male, even one who chooses to be a gardener.  Where are the raging hormones, the aggression, the restlessness?  Granted, not every young man is a bull in heat, but everything seems a little off.  Is he on valium?  Does he share a mild form of autism with his twin brother; a touch of asperger's perhaps?  After all, this is stream of consciousness, we are inside Lobbi's head, and even mild mannered, nice young men have poorly behaved thoughts from time to time, if not a good deal more often.About halfway through the book I became aware that the author, Auur Ava &Oacute;lafsd&oacute;ttir, is a woman.  This explains the vague inauthenticity of the narrative tone.  It is not so much that the musings of Lobbi are not credible, but that so much is missing.  I suspect that Olafsdottir was cognizant of the fact that there are vast regions of a young man's thoughts that were inaccessible to her, and she chose (probably wisely) not to go there.One fact that is never revealed is the location of the monastery.  We learn that Lobbi is from Iceland only a third of the way through.  The only other reference to any place is Lobbi's speculation that some writing on a shirt worn by Anna is Finnish.  There are a number of clues, but they don't add up.  After the plane ride, Lobbi has a full day's drive to the monastery, through an enormous, old growth forest and across three borders.  The monastery is in or near mountains, but also close enough to the sea to have a steady supply of fish and seafood.  The inhabitants of the small village in which the monastery is located speak a rare dialect of some unnamed language, and yet there is a halfway decent selection of books published in the dialect available at the local bookstore.  Given that Lobbi started off in Iceland, one thinks naturally of Finland or one of the Baltic states.  This is impossible, however, because Lobbi tells his father that the days are the same length year round, which means close to the equator.  There is also a reference to the warm or mild climate.  It is, in short, an imaginary location.Ultimately, the slight dissonance of the narrative does not detract at all from this eminently readable book.  The plot is engaging and the writing is top notch (credit must also be given to the translator here).  I found myself stealing time to get back to the story.  I give it three stars.  It deserves three and a half, and I am a tough grader.

$review_text.: Having read the first six books, I have to say I like the series. I am not usually a big fan of "Harleguin" type romance serials. They are way too predictable and not really all that believable.But having said that, this series IS different. I think that by placing all of the stories in the same small town among a group of people who all know each other has given the series a continuity that is usually missing. Their stories are all too believeable. They have all faced heart break in one form or another. Not only did I laugh out loud, I laughed til I cried. I cringed and was horrified.  But I also cried for real and one story in particular broke my heart. My favorite character? SUGAR!I know that some people will "ding" the series because not everything is tied up in a neat package with a bow and not every problem has been resolved. Maybe the authors plan to do that later in the series, ever hear of cliff hangers? Myself, I like the way they left the stories un-resolved for now. I like using my imagination to think of all the possibilities and there are a lot of possibilities. The love affair of Bo and Binky, however, HAS to be resolved! I cannot wait!!I am definitely going to keep up with this series....

$REVIEW.: It is the 1400s and Maxwell is tired of hearing how he needs to be married. While listening to Keanan ramble on about it he looks into the magical mirror to see this beautiful woman, who looks so different from the women he is used to seeing. Her image is burned into his eyes. Who is this woman and why did he see her.Trish is an archeologist and favorite aunt to six nieces and nephews in 2020. On a visit to their home she learns they are all in touble after Ramsey the eldest was performing some pretty powerful magic gone wrong. While being punished Trish is talking to him about it and decides to allow him to try again with her. The results are not what either of them expects.Trish and Ramsey are hurled back in time to a familiar place but not quiet the same and right into the arms of Maxwell. Ramsey handles the outcome much better than Trish and in order to save her life Maxwell binds his to her. And on the day they are to wed something happens and Trish's world is turned upside down. She and Ramsey are ripped back to their time and she comes face to face with the reality that Maxwell is no longer there or is he.What a cute book I really enjoyed reading this one. I have always loved "Highlander" type books and this one with its bits of magic in it just added to the whimsey and funness of the book. This is the first time reading a book from this author and I will most definetly be reading more of Maeve Greyson's books.

$review_text.: Book #4 Wings Of Lomay... What can I say?... Oh yeah I know what I can start with...WHY DEVRI, WHY???Sorry, I apologise for shouting there. But Oh. My... I cried! So much!! I wouldn't have minded so much but when I started that particular part I was sat in the middle of a busy coffee shop and I had to stop reading!! But I'm getting ahead of myself here.There is so much I want to write, but as I will NOT publish spoilers for anyone who hasn't yet read this! So my review...Kiora, Emane, Alcander, Drustan, and Arturo have all grown and been through so much throughout this series. Their characters have gone from strength to strength. They have faced evils that would have made lesser people turn and run screaming for the hills!The levels of magic in this book reach new heights, as the forces of good really do unite to try and rid the world of evil once and for all, but can it be done? If it is done what will the cost of it be to Kiora? those that she loves? and the rebels?This review is so unfair, I want to write so much more but I am so scared of publishing spoilers, and if I did that I couldn't forgive myself.Wings Of Lomay made me laugh, yell, smile and cry! As I've already mentioned the part that caused the most tears I came across sat in my local coffee shop I had to stop reading until I was back at home behind closed doors!! After feeling like that at the start of that part, you would have though that I would have been prepared by the time I got to continue, right? Wrong! When I continued to read at home I openly wept! I felt EVERY bit of hurt that was written on those pages. Which brings me back to the start of my review again... WHY DEVRI, WHY?Wings Of Lomay is well thought out, superbly written and had me from page 1. I was transported into Kiora, Emane and Alcander's world once more. I felt like I was there through all of their ups and downs, I've been there on all of their journey's and on the beach during THAT scene, the scene that completely destroyed my heart!Wings Of Lomay is every bit the epic finale that I thought it would be, and it was a fitting end to an amazing series.

$REVIEW.: Born in 1906 Shostakovich lived through the communist years in the Soviet Union. This book covers Shostakovich from his first symphony, completed when he was 19 through his next 14 symphonies and six concertos. It has relatively little in the way of biography, but instead is about his music.Each major work is given a chapter of its own, and like the Owner's Manual of an automobile it describes the feelings generated by that work.Mr. Hurwitz is perhaps the foremost writer working today in the field of classical music. He founded and is the executive editor of ClassicsToday.com a daily clasical music magazine, and is the chairman and founder of the Clkasical Internet Awards. He is the author of similar books on Wagner, Mozart, Mahler, Dvorak, and Haydn. The book includes an audio CD of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, easily his most famous.

$REVIEW.: The story starts us with Jon, a fresh out of college idealist who used to be passionate about music but is now attaching his passion to his fiance's drive to teach in Peru. Enter Koko and her sidekick Faron who introduce themselves as poaching party acrobats... the idea of which is just too crazy not to lend itself to truth. Towards the end of the party Koko five-fingers Jon's tape recorder which just so happens to contain a love letter from his half-peruvian fiance and absconds... and thus we have the setup for a complex friendship built on self-discovery.Jon is most certainly the normal one of the bunch... who is attempting to break out of his mundane existence by leaving the country. Koko is certainly the wild one. Sometimes criminal, sometimes philanthropic, but always authentic in her own strange fashion, Koko definitely steals the show, making you hate and love her in every panel, bitch or lost kitten. The story's third ideal, Faron, is... much more muted, but his story is that much more tragic yet hopeful for it. He doesn't talk much, most of his panels are devoted to showing you his troubles and the steps he takes to overcome them. If anything, I think the book should have centered on him, instead of Jon's search for meaning or Koko's search for place. But what are you gonna do?The art is definitely indie and reminds me very much of Meredith Gran's Octopus Pie. Pleasing and eccentric. I love how the panels flow and the body language Ms.Wang imparts in her art, especially in the rare silent moments between Jon and Koko and the rare panels that are exclusively Faron's.If you're any kind of fan of indie comics, I'd give Koko a recommend. Its a great "finding onesself" narrative and I look forward to reading more from the author as soon as I can aquire it.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the few best books available on basic prepping; the author read a lot of other books and included the basic information in this one.  If you buy any books on prepping, start here, then go to more detailed treatments on the various aspects of dealing with a local or national emergency.The book is oriented to those who haven't the faintest idea how to get started on preparing for an emergency.  There are many, many facets to prepping.  This book is really a compendium of common sense rules, and is well written in a folksy, down-to-earth style, sort of like a "Consumer Reports" of survival.The idea is for you and your loved ones to survive a disaster,as best you can,in the face of an economic collapse, or other natural or man-made disaster. The major areas of survival concern are shelter, food, water, health, and security.  Each has to be treated, as all are important to survival.  You can't just concentrate on everything else and not your security and safety in the face of looters, robbers, killers and rapists, etc.  Being able to defend yourself, your loved ones, and your supplies will be just as important as obtaining the food and water supply.  Thus, you should have a rifle, pistol and/or shotgun (with ammo) and most importantly, the skill training in how to use them.  In the health area, you may not survive if your health deteriorates due to malnutrition, sickness, or injury.The book is strong on common sense considerations, perhsps too simplistic for many readers; for ex., "practice safe habits at all times," well yeah--  But there are many useful tips as well.As a prepper for seveal decades, I would strongly recommend this book (I am not related to or know the author).  I have ordered several more copies for friends and relatives.

I think I could have set aside my feelings about the nature of the kink in this story (reading this tale confirmed my intuition that I do not have a lactation fetish) if the author had brought a touch of realism to the scene.  But for a story with such an out-there theme, everything else felt stale . . . the woman who somehow has a picture perfect body even though she's got an infant, a guy who is willing to turn off his morals and his brains just to have a shot at doing it with his wife's best friend, the routine couplings (routine except for the fact that they're sprinkled in breast milk).  By the time I reached the implausible twist ending, I was disappointed.

$review_text.: The Art Forger is an entertaining mystery that blends fiction with facts about art history and today's art world. The author, B.A. Shapiro, builds her story around a painting stolen in the1990 thief at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.The art heist is real, but the stolen painting that propels the story, Degas' "After the Bath," is a figment of Shapiro's colorful imagination.Claire Roth, the first person narrator, is gifted young painter whose previous involvement with her mentor, a well known artist, unfairly causes her to become an outcast in the tight knit art community. To support herself, Claire paints for a company that legally reproduces old masters' works.A prominent art gallery owner enlists Claire's skills for a scheme that will ultimately benefit the Gardner Museum, Claire and, of course, the gallery owner. When this dubious plan runs into trouble, Claire uses both her training and a bit of sleuthing to uncover the truth.Shapiro's shares her broad knowledge of painting, coupled with vivid details of how great works are made, sometimes reproduced, authenticated, sold, cherished and displayed. Reading this book felt more like watching artists create beautiful paintings, rather than reading how they do it.Sugar Hill: Where The Sun Rose Over Harlem

$REVIEW.: I love that this is a &#8220;normal&#8221; cookbook&#8212;filled with some of my favorite go-to meals like pizza, sloppy joes, and deviled eggs, despite me thinking that a sensitive stomach meant eating bland food for life. I like that the cookbook is written in a friendly way that is mindful of our palates, our health, and our need to entertain! It gives you a game plan and resources for creating a diet that is very specific to your own body and digestive issue. That way, you can eliminate just the foods that give you issues (instead of all foods with FODMAPs), which makes for a more reasonable diet plan. Simple directions and great tidbits. Only downfall: no calories or cooking time.

$REVIEW.: Let me put this disclaimer here right now: If you are easily offended when it comes to religion then don't even think about reading Blood on the Ice.Blood on the Ice is one of the funniest stories I've read in a long time. This book is a riot, I couldn't stop laughing. I know the cover doesn't look  too appealing but once you get past that, it is a laugh-out loud page turner all the way through.Mr. Healy definitely has the gift of comedic writing. He pokes fun at everything, and I mean everything, and not only are the results are down right hysterical, it gets you thinking. He offers up narrations throughout the story and at first I was confused as to who's pov is it was. After further reading, it actually works, instead of being a detriment. His action sequences are very vivid and smoothly written. Some of the descriptions he uses are pure genius.The story takes place in a small Canadian town and this is what hooked me from the start. References to our great Tim Horton's, Rush and everything else that is typically Canadian really works throughout the story. Oh and the hockey scenes? I'm loving it. LOVING IT!Kudos to you, Mr. Healy.Hammie is a great guy, no doubt about it.  He is part of the Fighting Aardvarks Hockey team  and though, they are not a winning team, its not for want of trying. In a way they remind me of the Toronto Maple Leafs (sorry, lol)Hammie is besieged upon by his moronic goth girlfriend, his hilarious yet confused team-mates, his well-meaning Jewish parents and thoughts of what he should do with himself.When a new guy, Digby, comes to the team by way of a trade, Hammie's other team-mates are, one by one, turned into Vampires. This, in turn, makes the Fighting Aardvarks into a team to contend with. The only reason why Hammie hasn't been turned is because he's Jewish. Hammie is then faced with a decision. Should he ignore what's right in front of him or try to get his friends back?With the help of his friend Betsy, a rookie vampire hunter named Doogie (who, for some reason, brought Dog The Bounty Hunter to mind), Eli and Cat (his other team-mates that haven't been turned) Hammie sets out to stop the Vampire invasion.Vampires, hockey and Jewish humor, how can you go wrong?

$review_text.: 4.25 of 5 StarsFor original review see The Prism Book Alliance Blog onlineImaginative stories and rich, complex worlds. Both are things you can expect from an Ashlyn Forge story. Even in a short 40ish pages, Forge can suck you in and make you continue to turn the pages.The two main characters are very different and should not have anything to do with each other. While their races once held a symbiotic relationship, invasion, war, and time have turned them against each other. When the Leveller King, Lyndel, is attacked on his way to reproduce, he is taken in by the Summoner, Aton, at personal risk to Aton. Lyndel is a bit of an ass, but then again, Aton isn&#8217;t much better. In only a few short page we watch these two grow personally, individually and together.I will admit to being put a little off balance by the ending. It is a hopeful ending, I think, but a lot is left to the imagination of the reader. If you are looking for a quick, rich, SciFi story, I recommend Caterpillar.

The Journey is not easy as they try to overcome past hurts, but the bond and love they share shines through and you just know they'll be okay! This book is packed with all sorts of emotions, while reading this ,I cried and I laughed!! And as always the Sex between Caleb and Livvie is hot, raw and very emotional!!! I highly recommend reading this and the whole series! This is easily one of my top 5 fave series, in my opinion CJ Roberts is Brilliant, and I would read anything she writes!!!

$REVIEW.: **I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review**First, I would like to say how much I love this cover! Maybe I'm just a sucker for blue (and Christmas!), but I think it fits the book perfectly-- festive and oh so cute! When I was first approached by the author to review By Proxy, I knew I had to give it a shot. First of all, the concept was something completely different-- and, honestly, centered around something I had never even heard of before: a double proxy wedding.For those of you saying &#34;huh?&#34; like I did, here is the definition according to Wikipedia: &#34;A proxy wedding or (proxy marriage) is a wedding in which the bride or groom (or both) is not physically present, usually being represented instead by another person. If both partners are absent a double proxy wedding occurs.&#34; This actually very interesting to me, and I can see how, in some instances, this practice can be extremely helpful-- with military couples (which is true for this novel), for example. But, despite that, it just screams impersonal to me. Oh well, to each their own! Obviously they don't do this by choice.Now that I've sufficiently veered off course, I'll get back to what I thought about By Proxy! I will admit that this story was a bit difficult for me to get into in the beginning. I was having a very hard time connecting to the characters and had my fingers crossed tightly for something exciting to happen. After pushing through the first parts of the book, though, I had a much easier time and ended up really enjoying the story.Jenny, a teacher, is exactly as the blurb depicts her: stubbornly small-town. But she's also very sweet, and has a heart of gold. But those things definitely don't mean that she isn't tough. Being the baby of the family with three older brothers, she definitely knows how to stand up for herself. When she meets Sam, who makes them late for their appointment and doesn't make a good first impression at all, she writes him off as an arrogant man who has no respect for her down-home lifestyle. And while Sam does seem to look down on life in a small down, it turns out that he truly appreciates it at heart. Originally, I found the two main characters to be pretty judgmental of each other, feeding into stereotypes. But once the story really got moving, I was hooked and found I really enjoyed their interactions with each other. There were laugh-out-loud moments for me, and this story turned out to be extremely heartwarming.In the end, I found this novel to be completely charming and so sweet. I became quite attached to the characters and found myself really invested in how their story would play out. I loved that the basis of this story was something new and different. And by pairing all of the sigh-worthy, romantic moments with Christmas and the holidays, Katy really gives us something magical. If you're a sucker for Christmas stories and books about finding love in the most unexpected of places, this one needs to go on your list!

I've been listening to these tapes for a few years and they are one of the best out there.DIRTY SECRET: A LOT (if not all) of self-help info is the same material distilled in a slightly different way. Tony has a great way to make the information interesting and fun.MAY 12, 2002FOLLOWUP: So far I've lost 30lbs (after 2 months), am on a 2x day exercise program walking 5 miles in the morning and evening (8th week of this), completely eliminated all desire to snack during the day, have improved my energy level, business success and overall self-confidence.

$REVIEW.: Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the author for a fair review
I was not compensated in anyway for this review.First, Mr
Luffman is my kind of guy


He writes horror and has a respect for what is scary
It is so rare that I read anything that can fill me with a little dread and make me sweat a little while I read it because I am afraid for the characters.This was one of those books
A nail-biter.I totally bought into Wynn, North Carolina
The setting felt real for me, with enough description to keep me engaged, but not too much so I felt I was reading a travelogue


I know nothing about North Carolina, or it's inhabitants, but Mr

Luffman obviously does


It's not just because he lives there, either
Many of us live in our state and couldn't describe it to anyone


Mr


Luffman really transported me to North Carolina
For that I was happy

I have to admit that when I heard that this novel was set in North Carolina, I had a hard time seeing it as a setting for a survival horror book.I was wrong.It was the perfect setting.I also really liked the character of Jake Marsden

He was well thought out and held the book together as the main character
I could feel the dilemma that he is in in this book


Mr


Luffman did a great job of making me feel that a couple of things were on the line for this character: his sanity and his life


I wasn't as happy with his buddy Eric Lawson


He felt a little cardboard to me and so I didn't look forward to their scenes together as much as I wanted to


It was the same for me concerning Eric's live-in girlfriend Wendy
They were very much like every other side/main character relationship that I have read before.However, the main thing is the horror.Oh yes, the horror.Once things ramp up and all hell breaks out, Mr
Luffman really took me on a trip into an unstable place where almost anything terrifying could happen, and sometimes it does


It really turned into a landscape of uncertainty, and for a while, I had no idea where this book was going, but I was interested to find out....and a little scared to find out too.

$REVIEW.: In &quot;The Trouble with Dilbert,&quot; Norman Solomon seeks to expose the supposedly distressing truths behind the popular comic strip character, Dilbert. In this review, I'd like to expose some distressing truths about  Solomon's &quot;book.&quot; First off, it's hardly a &quot;book&quot;  anyway; at barely 100 pages, if one were to remove all the various  cartoons, lengthy quotations from assorted media pundits (including an  entire chapter by another writer!), and Solomon's constant repeating of the  same few points over and over, all that would be left would barely  constitute a short magazine article.  Working through the repetitive and  pretentiously written text, it becomes clear that Solomon holds the Dilbert  comic strip (and especially its creator, Scott Adams) in contempt, mainly  because the strip doesn't go as far as Solomon would like it to in trashing  C.E.O's and traditional corporate structure. Solomon considers Adams a  traitor for giving frustrated workers a mere outlet for their anger rather  than producing a &quot;call to arms&quot; for them to unite and overthrow  the system as it exists. Ironically, Solomon never offers any concrete  ideas on just how this should be done at any point in his book either; what  comes across most powerfully is bitterness and jealousy that Adams has  achieved the widespread acclaim and popularity that has eluded Solomon so  far. Solomon's posturing and holier-than-thou attitude wear thin, and his  claims that Adams is some sort of &quot;double agent&quot; for C.E.O's  border on self-parody. Scott Adams is happy making money off Dilbert and  freely admits it; he's not trying to change the world. This is unacceptable  to Solomon, and one can only wonder which other comic strips he'll go after  next (&quot;Garfield Revealed&quot;?). Additionally, I noticed no mention  anywhere in &quot;The Trouble With Dilbert&quot; of Solomon intending to  donate his profits (shudder!) from this book to help any downtrodden,  downsized workers he claims to be so deeply concerned about.  Of course,  Norman Solomon has the right to say whatever he wants. And maybe if he came  up with something more intelligent to say, and did so in a more  entertaining manner, he'd achieve some of the  fame and influence that he  begrudges Scott Adams for having already earned.

$REVIEW.: I think their is some truth to being able to eat all fats if one maintains a very low carbohydrate intake. However, there is much more evidence that a lower sugar, but balanced diet of meats, daily, fruits, vegetables, and some grains is the healthiest way to go. This diet would also include a moderate amount of healthy fats- not laden with saturated fats. On his chapter on fat, he cites a study done with the Intuit Indians. What is appropriate for them is hardly the same as for us living is Central Texas. Also, there are been some adaptation of the species since cave men days.I gave the book some thought, tried the diet for a couple of weeks, went back to a more balanced diet stressing healthier fats like olive oil and avocados, and a little coconut oil. Then threw the book away.

$review_text.: "20 Master Plots" is a good reference book for budding authors. Each of the plots is given a thorough run-through, with "real" (story) world examples of well-known tales. Some plots even include a mini-checklist at the end of the chapter to provide consistance with the plot listed to your story. I have found with my stories, they have run-on plots into many different areas (i.e. starts out a mystery and ends up a revenge plot) - this book helped clear up the context to remain true to the writing. No more crappy cross-plot tales from my pen!

$review_text.: Kendall has always had everything and any man she has ever wanted. Night after night she goes to the club with one goal. Pick a man out and make sure by the end of the night that he wants her. She feels that she has to prove to herself that someone wants her and she accomplishes this by picking up men at a local club. That is until one night when she attempts to pick someone up and he shoots her down. Not only does he shoot her down, but acts like he couldn't care less about her.Kendall has never been turned down by anyone before, and now isn't sure what she should do with her night. So she ventures to the back room of the club, where only the owners are permitted to go. While trying to find something exciting to do, Kendall witnesses something that she shouldn't and ran. Now she can't remember what she saw that night and people are trying to kill her. Her father's solution to protecting her is to hire her a bodyguard.Logan is trying to crack the mystery behind some of the towns most wealthiest people disappearing. Not only is there nothing pointing towards a source, but there is no type of strings or path to follow other than a local club in town. Logan knows there has to be more than meets eye to the club.Logan gets a special assignment... to protect Kendall St. John a spoiled brat that he turned down at the club the night before. But there is something different about Kendall, she smells different than any other women has to him before. She smells sweet and irresistible. Kendall is a stubborn, spoiled princess that will stop at nothing to make protecting her the toughest job he has had yet.Soon Logan and Kendall find themselves falling for each other... but can Kendall see past what Logan is? or will Kendall die before she learns the truth both about Logan and what she witnessed that night in the club?Guardian Vampire was a surprisingly fast read. I finished it in a little under 3 hours. I just couldn't put it down, I was hanging on ever delicious word that Lauralynn Elliot was feeding me. Guardian Vampire has a little bit of something for everyone, it has romance, action, adventure, intrigue and mystery. It is a great all around read. I loved how the relationship developed between Logan and Kendall, how difficult it was for them to see past both of their stubbornness. It wasn't one of those books that you are immediately thrown into the two main characters having sex, because they find each other hot. There was time for them to get to know each other and to develop an attraction.I would suggest this book to any adult. It is steamy and lustful but will give you that warm tingly feeling that love still exists and not all men are jerks. Unfortunately this one is a vampire and you will never have a chance with him.... but we can't help but have a little bit of hope... right ladies? If you are going to fall for a vampire, let it be Logan!

$review_text.: I bought Radical by David Platt, when it first came out and have just read it again.  This book is a challenge because we are comfortable in our lives and we don't want people to rock our boats.  Platt has rocked my boat and woke me up to truly serve Christ without abandon.Platt challenges us to live teh Gospel everyday.  He uses personal stories and plenty of Biblical examples.  This is an important mixture for me as an avid reader.People might say Platt is anti-American.  I disagree because David it not Anti-anything in this book; he is pro-Jesus.  If people do not like this book, it probably because they feel convicted.  The Holy Spirit used this book to convict me (which is healthy).  Read this and be challenged to have a Radical faith.

$review_text.: &#34;Clockworkers&#34; is modern day, quasi-fantasy adventure by author Ramsey Isler.This Kindle e-book was approximately 345 printed pages and sold for $3.99 at the time of writing this review.General theme (some minor spoilers)When Samuel Chablon dies, his watch repair business transfers into the hands of his daughter, Samantha (Sam). The business has earned a reputation of not only being able to fix the oldest and rarest of watches but also the problems that no other watch repair shop could solve. Shortly after her father's death, Sam finds out the secret to his success... and it arrives in the form of a small Elf named Piv.Some thoughts on &#34;Clockworkers&#34;...The Pros:1.) well written and edited, with few if any grammatical or spelling errors. It did however have several formatting errors (read on the Kindle reader app for my IPad mini).2.) an interesting plot filled with many twists and turns. I thought the beginning section and end sequence were the best areas, while the middle section struggled a bit with believability (believability within the context of this fantasy setting).3.) there were a few dark and creepy chapters that I felt were particularly well done.4.) cover art... a great image. Truly reflecting on the potentially dark and mysterious nature of the tale within. Loved the eyes.The Cons:1.) dialogues... this was probably the book's weakest area. Many conversations were short and appeared to be somewhat forced, lending them a choppy, abrupt feel. Although in fairness, these areas were dictated to a degree by Sam's curt personality.Impressions:I loved the premise for this story, but I struggled when it came to our heroine, Sam. Specifically, her attitudes when it came to dealing with people... if I had to pick a missing quality in her, it would be her lack of empathy towards others. I suppose this would not have been such an annoying trait to me if she'd been the villain, but I don't think the author had this intention for her. I simply find that it's hard to really like a novel when you don't feel some sort of attachment to the main character. Obviously these reflect my own personal and subjective feelings... other will probably disagree.My concerns regarding dialogue, made me aware of the importance of the conversational aspects of any novel and how much it contributes to the overall quality of prose. This area could use some improvement.While I liked many areas of this book, the real question is,  would I read a second book in this series?... maybe, but only after reading the sample available from Amazon.com to see if Sam and I are a little more compatible... lol.As it is... 3 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholsonralannicholson@hotmail.com@ralannicholson

His approach is definitely counter-intuitive, but worthy of serious investigation (especially for poor tired souls who do not want to write another promotional blog). I think his approach could definitely work, but it would take some definite chutzpah. If that is you, then this book will probably do a lot for you. He also writes about some real gems for promotion that anyone can use, and that alone makes this book a definite worthwhile read for the aspiring Kindle author.

$REVIEW.: The Nikon D800 is a groundbreaking camera.  It is a professional, full frame model, packing a whopping 36 megapixel sensor and a body only price tag of $2,999.That said, there are some people who buy this as their very first DSLR camera.  Because of this, any useful manual must appeal to a wide spectrum of readers.While Mr. Young's book is not without its minor faults, it does an admirable job of addressing the needs of the new photographer as well as those of the seasoned professional.The author assumes the reader already knows their way around a DSLR, but in case some readers do not, he includes basic instructions in an appendix at the end of the book.  And for those of us for whom the D800 is not our first rodeo, he jumps right into the meat of this camera from virtually the first page.I have been shooting professionally since 1969.  I learned some new tricks from this book: things that made a visible improvement in my images.  I cannot imagine anyone who uses a D800 or D800E not benefiting from owning this book.The author's writing style is light and humorous.  You will be learning things about your camera and at some point while doing so, you will realize you are enjoying the entire process.If you are going to spend the kind of money necessary to buy this camera and a few essential lenses, do yourself a very big favor.  You have likely invested at least $5,000 in this marvel of engineering.  Get the most out of that D800 and pony up an additional $26 for the one accessory that will enable you to take full advantage of the incredible camera you own.

$REVIEW.: I loved this book. And sometimes for me, the hallmark of a good ending is when I read through it so quickly that I have to flip back a few pages once in a while to see what I missed. Not that I'm going to put a spoiler here, but the ending is very, very (and I rarely say "very very") exciting and is full of heroic goodness and tension. I found I whipped through just to find out how it was going to end, then had to reread to savour.The beginning, on the other hand, is something I lingered over. Why? Because it's chock full of steamy goodness and frankly when it comes to romance, I am not a pleasure deferrer. I like steam right away. To be fair, the entire book is filled with steam. I mentioned the beginning and the end more for parallel structure, to appease my former English teacher, than anything.Now here's the story What we have here are two members of the Walking Wounded. Both protagonists, tattoo artist Pandora and musician Brian, are wounded people. But they are not pathetic. They are simply wounded. And one cannot help but feel extreme sympathy for the catastrophes in their lives, but they are not shriveling the contemptible characters. Each struggles and each triumphs. They don't triumph in a perfect TV situation comedy triumph. They triumph insofar as they work through their troubles, physical and emotional, while we, the reader, cheer them on.Pandora is a tattoo artist who has struggled with a terrible and cold family background to move into a physically and emotionally abusive relationship, who frees herself from this relationship to move forward and realize her dream to be a tattoo artist. Brian is a former musician who has survived a tragedy which killed his bandmates and left him physically and emotionally scarred on many levels. The two had met previously, some 10 years before the story begins, both leaving on each other an impression on each other for extremely different reasons.Fast-forward 10 years and they reunite at a tattoo competition. Pandora is competing, Brian is the person on whom she freehands a commemorative tattoo in honour of his lost bandmates. Their subsequent meeting is passionate but is riddled with self-doubt. Mercifully, the self-doubt is pushed aside for Ms. Bristol's deft handling of some really delicious sex.The story is supported by well-drawn and colourful secondary characters, and a particularly adorable dog. The secondary characters: Pandora's friends and coworkers in particular, make this read a rich and real experience. The entirely despicable antagonist Robert is--frankly--painfully and realistically depicted. A word of warning to those sensitive to violence: Robert is viciously psychotic.Each chapter begins with a brief epigram explaining the various tools and procedures involved in tattooing. As a structural feature, this works admirably.This book is first in Ellora's Cave's new imprint, Pricked, for tattoo-themed romances. If this is representative of the line, then we are in for a treat.I look for to Ms. Bristol's next book.

He is looking for his prince and has kissed a lot of frogs. While he is at Rosie's engagement party, he sees a man across the room and the attraction is instant. But will there be a problem because the man Matthew is Rosie's fiance. While Rosie loses the guy, Rafe gets Matthew. They wait 30 (long) days before they are intimate, they don't want to rush things. Rafe owns a coffee shop and Matthew owns a gym, is a personal trainer and has made workout videos. Their relationship is put through the test. Will they make it and have their HEA? This is a great story and it helps to read the Mr Write Trilogy but I don't think it is a must. You will be a little confused but it works out. Great job Cassandra P. Lewis. Looking forward to the next one!

$REVIEW.: Battlestar Galactica is an amazing show. I'd read all the articles I could, watched and re-watched the shows, listened to commentary tracks, etc, and still wanted more -- trying to hang on until the new season starts. Well, this official companion has been a thoroughly enjoyable read and the it's been informative too.It starts with a chapter about how the show came back, and then offers lengthy synopses of each episode (and the miniseries)y, with trivia, information about the writer(s) and guest cast and comments from the participants. There are lots of black and white pictures throughout and a center section of color pictures. After the episode guide there are 4-page chapters devoted to each main character (William and Lee Adama, Roslin, Kara, Baltar, Six, Sharon and supporting characters). The volume ends with chapters on production design, visual effects and music. There is a forward by Ronald Moore and an afterword by David Eick, and lots of input from the cast and crew throughout the book.I enjoyed this very much and look forward to the season two guide. It really helped me cope with the between-seasons doldrums, and made re-watching old episodes even more fun.Highly recommended.

But there are also moments of humor, and kindness, and some real sizzle between the two main characters. I really hope things work out for them, which is the sign of a good writer, right? I know they're just fiction, but she brought them to life and made me care. (Just to be clear, it's not a cliffhanger ending or anything, just hints that there could maybe be more trouble on the horizon for them.)

$review_text.: College Boys [Men of Holsum College]  Daisy HarrisARC supplied by NetgalleyI love a good romance, and its the love story that matters to me not the sex of the people involved. Having said that there's something really tender in this story where its clear that Peter who's openly gay has feelings for Chris who's on the surface a typical hetero sports jock. Yet beneath that he's unsure of his feelings and the thin walls of his neighbour cast them even more in doubt when he finds he's turn on by the sound of Peters pleasure....Slowly they draw closer, and feelings are exposed though Chris is anxious not to let anyone outside the small gay circle know about him.  I guess that's a hard decision for anyone - not only lost in the passion of the throes of love but wanting to shout it to the world as others do and yet being scared of the reaction of homophobes :( Anyone a bit different whether it's sex, race or disability has faced that at some time, and people seem to look upon sexuality as a choice issue rather than just nature. It can impact on not just emotions but families and careers, so taking that plunge needs a lot of thought for some people. Daisy does that so well in this book, we feel for Peter who wants to be open about his boyfriend and has never hidden his sexuality, and yet also understand about Chris who wants that too but is scared to let people know - he has so much to risk.Its a beautiful story of a slowly unfolding passion the two boys have for each other. Like another reviewer I felt the mention of engagements and marriage at the end was perhaps not necessary, I think they'd just still be busy enjoying the Now rather than thinking of the future, especially when Chris has only just admitted his sexuality. There's lots of graphic sex here so if you don't want that then don't buy this book. I feel it fits well but know others want there sex to stop at a kiss and a hint of action and Daisy goes much further than that but its well written and fits the scenes.At 3.59 for 88 pages its quite expensive I feel although it is well written and devotees of m/m fiction with a HEA will probably re read. For me its too short for that, I like long novels where there's a lot more to the story and a greater drama and storyline to get engrossed in.Stars: three and a half from me, I do feel its an excellent story but expensive. I'd have liked a longer version, and would have given four stars for that.

$review_text.: As an active member of a pretrib evangelical church, and also as a reasonably mature Christian and bible student, I have found myself struggling lately with the apparent conflict between what I hear from the pulpit concerning the timing of the rapture, and what I've seen in my own study of scripture.  I think the bible is very plain that a rapture of the church will occur, but I think it's much less clear about when that will happen.  On a purely personal level, my hope is that the pretrib position is the correct one, because I don't relish the thought of either myself or my family having to endure even a part of the tribulation.I've been wrestling with various passages of scripture which seem to be inconsistent with the pretrib view.  For example, in each of the three synoptic gospels, the latter verses of the Olivet Discourse (in my opinion) seems to tie the rapture directly to the physical return of our Lord in glory.  Jesus himself also stated that the days of the tribulation are to be shortened "for the sake of the elect."  In Daniel chapter 7, there are several references to "the saints of the most High" enduring the tribulation for 3 1/2 years.  Even C. I. Scofield, in his marginal notes, interprets these verses to refer to the church.  I think one may fairly infer from these passages that the church may, in fact, have to go through all or part of the tribulation.  Still other passages, however, seem to clearly support the pretribulation rapture.In short, I'm not really sure what to believe about when the rapture will occur, and I'm desperately looking for some useful insights.  It was with this mindset that I picked up Tim LaHaye's book, hoping that he would provide some convincing answers to some of my concerns.  I was deeply disappointed.The first thing that struck me about the book was the condescending, dismissive, graceless and at times openly vitriolic tone that the author took toward persons espousing other views of end time events.  I consider myself to be a person who is genuinely seeking the truth, with the realization that it may lie in one of these alternate interpretations.  Thus, I felt personally slighted by Mr. LaHaye's bare insinuations that anyone who holds to those other views is deliberately trying to undermine the faith and hope of other Christians.  This could not be further from the truth.Nevertheless, I continued reading, searching for some spiritual meat that would also satisfy my probing intellect.  I genuinely hoped to find interpretations of some of the aforementioned difficult passages which would persuasively reconcile them with the pretrib view.  Instead, all I found was a superficial, skin-deep litany of the standard pretrib arguments, with no effort made at all to genuinely respond to competing interpretations.  LaHaye's "answers" to these other positions was merely to impugn the motives of their proponents, not to address the scriptural substance of what they believe.This book leaves most if not all of my questions and concerns unanswered.  Worse, I detected a decidedly unchristian attitude toward other believers who, no doubt, are equally sincere in their search for biblical truth.  So, I will remain confused for now, and look for other books which do a better job of defending the pretrib view and dealing with some of these "problem" passages.  I'm very glad I was able to borrow this book and didn't actually have to pay money for it.

$review_text.: When a fit and trim, windsurfing grandpa' of 65 wants to give me some advice on being healthy, I'm all ears!The fact that he's a highly respected physician with a mesmerizing history and a courageous and daring education (medical and otherwise) is just too much to pass up.Alas, the SAD diet (Standard American Diet) of his youth nearly killed him as a teenager (literally)
Suffice to say, he then went thru Medical School with a VERY unique perspective
 Eyes and ears and mind open all the way and never afraid to challenge the status quo, he sought - again and again and again - comprehension and simple, accurate answers to straightforward questions about his own health - and that of his patients.Dr


McDougall is a genius


 What he's discovered along the way will captivate you


 It will change your life, as it's changed his own and the lives of thousands lucky enough to call him 'Doctor'.(today, thru this books, videos, DVD's, youtube and his website, MILLIONS are following his worthy advice)Hope he gets to be our next Surgeon General!

$REVIEW.: If you have a cricut machine, you know that they can be incredibly frustrating at times. This guide is the ultimate in helpfulness for anybody who owns a cricut machine. No matter how skilled you are, sometimes you are going to need some troubleshooting and tips from somebody who has been there.Maryann Gillespie has created an excellent guide that is well-written and well-organized. It is a must have if you own a cricut machine. I learned one specific tip that made this book worth far more than its asking price (I won't give it away. You have to buy for yourself!).

$REVIEW.: This book had a lot going for it

I liked the set-up, I liked the hero, and I thought this was fairly well-written
The major sticking point was the heroine
She was a soppy mess and a complete and utter pushover for the men in her life


I understand trying to give your heroine a sense of vulnerability, but I think they went to far with Arielle


She seemed to have no self-confidence whatsoever, and the book gave that dangerous impression that all she really needed to be happy was a man to take care of her, whether she wanted it or not


That can be a staple of romance novels, and when it's done right it's wonderful to see couples who care for one another act that way, but this book just took it too far.I respected the hero for trying to do whatever it took to take care of the mother of his children


I could not respect a heroine who was a wet sop who constantly lied to herself, and rolled over for every man in her life

Her one attempt to take a stand did not even begin to atone for the many, many times throughout the book when she let herself be bullied
I couldn't root for her.

$REVIEW.: We meet Mia Reeves starting her freshman year of college. She is pretty much wanting to start over in a town where no one knows her or what happened to her and her best friend Macy. She believes she hit the roommate jackpot when she meets Darby. Darby is the perfect roommate and they hit it off quick. On her first day of college she meets the most gorgeous guy, but she knows she needs to stay far away from him or any male for that matter.The minute Tristan Chamberlain sees Mia in class he knows she is not like his normal screw, he knows she is the one to change him. He even uses a lame excuse of needing a pen to be able to talk with her.Mia tries really hard to avoid Tristan but when he are practically family to her roommate Darby its hard to do. Tristan and Mia form a strong friendship and she is slowly falling for the amazing guy he is, but fears her secrets will push him away for good.Tristan has secrets himself and he doesn't think he is worthy of Mia's love and friendship.Can these two overcome their fears and get their happily ever after or will their secrets pull them apart forever.The author blew me away with this story. Tristan and Mia's chemistry was off the charts from the beginning and I felt ever single emotions everyone in the story had, not just Mia and Tristan.I can not wait for more on all these characters and to see where the author goes with Trace and Darby's story.Catch my Fall gets 5 AMAZINGLY HUGE STARS

$REVIEW.: A valuable resource. I wish I&#8217;d had this book on my kindle three years ago when I began the long journey which is self-publishing.I read with interest the sections covering promotion as a brand and selling yourself as an author. Knowing your target reader and identifying the market for your books can be tricky to work out. Many self published authors fall into the trap of sitting between genre, and this is quite often the very reason that mainstream publishers have turned them down in the past. These chapters were full of solid advice.Unlike lots of help guides, the author doesn&#8217;t wholly concentrate on the Internet. Selling paperbacks can be a different story!Above all, as well as being a mine of practical information, I found the book to be heartening, encouraging and inspiring. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;ll be dipping into time and again.Jan Ruth Author.

$review_text.: `Tyndale' is a comprehensive volume of what William Tyndale had to endure to translate the New Testament and parts of the Old from Greek into English. A master of eight languages this man of God was determined to not let anything and anyone stand in the way of his life's work of `bringing God to the plow boy'. Most of his translation work was done while exiled - `a stranger in a strange land', poor, lonely and on the run to escape imprisonment. Still, he never lost focus and was very conscientious about his monumental task: "...I never altered one syllable of God's word against my conscience, nor would do this day, if all that is in the earth, whether it be honour, pleasure, or riches might be given me."Because this is written in textbook fashion - fine print, long paragraphs with little to no dialogue, this book is not an easy read and therefore takes a while to get into it. However, once I was at the point where the author studies the dynamic literary debates between Tyndale and Thomas More, a staunch Catholic who loathed `the Captain of Englyshe heretikes', I was totally absorbed. Teems did an admirable job of comparing and contrasting Tyndale and More - `two men, two visions of life, two faiths' and ironically enough both were executed.I was surprised how much Tyndale has contributed the English language. Besides lyrical phrases like `blessed are the peacekeepers', William Tyndale is also credited with adding words like Godly, sanctified, chastening, zealous to the English dictionary, to name but a few.In exchange for and honest review, I received a complimentary copy of this book from Book Sneeze. My views are my own.

$REVIEW.: I have been eating a low carb diet for 6 weeks now. I was looking for some new recipes and this book seemed good. There are many tasty recipes. I loved the spicy popcorn. I was also excited to see so many soup recipes. The French onion soup is great and I didn't miss the big hunk of bread one bit. There is also information about low carb dieting in general and a 14 day meal plan for anyone that is just starting out. This diet allows up to 100 grams of carbs a day which is more than I am used to but may be good after I am done with the strictest phase, which is over in two more weeks for me.
$SUMMARY.: I was in need of more recipes for my low carb diet and this book is great!

$review_text.: When I read Audrey Schulman's Three Weeks in December, I was transported back to the time when I  read literary novels by the dozen.  In college and graduate school, especially, I lived for sentences so beautiful that they could bring me to my knees.  Never mind where those sentences might take me.  I just wanted to bask in the crystalline light of words and images perfectly crafted.Among my favorite novels were books by Henry James,  Virginia Woolf, Paul Bowles, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, E.M. Forster, Evelyn Waugh, and Doris Lessing.  Now there is Audrey Schulman, who has reminded me of how much I love to read.Many reviewers here have already summarized the plot, so I won't go in that direction with this review.  You already know that this book involves two parallel stories, one set in 1899 and one set in 2000, and that the two stories are connected--a fact that doesn't become clear until the end of the book.  What you need to know is that this is a "must read" book, whether you're 22 or 82 years old.  The social and political issues in both story lines--whether you agree that they should be connected or not by the book's end--will leave you thinking deeply, not just about Africa and its troubled history, but about the British railway system, Asperger's Syndrome, the great apes, and the strange medicinal properties of certain plants.Even better, as you read, you will be immersed in gorgeous passages like these:"When she woke, the sun had appeared from behind the clouds.  The last two weeks on these mountains, she'd been surprised by how much the light could change along the jungle floor.  At times it was as gloomy as a basement, at other points it gleamed otherworldly with mist. Sometimes it dazzled the eyes, as brazen as a spotlight."Right now, a thick beam of dusty light poured down through a hole in the canopy.  In the brightness of this luminance, everything shown as though lit from within, the stained-glass of the flickering leaves, the brilliant red of a parrot flying by, the hewed columns of the giant trucks.  The cathedral of the trees.  This must be where humans came up with the architecture of churches--the vaulted spaces and filtered light imprinted in the genes as the original holy place."As I said before:  you must read this book.  You will be forever changed by it.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a particular fan of Whole Foods nor John Mackey, but found his presentation to be full of insightful observations and predictions about the future of business. He correctly identifies many of the weaknesses of existing business models (ie. business as a machine to maximize profits) and think management should be a skill of organizing competing ideas.Mackey talks about the impact of healthy foods, but recognizes the positive effects of mass food production, reducing the average family's food expenditure from 50% in the past to around 10% today. At the same time, he believes that one of the great public discoveries to come is just how badly we treat livestock in America today ("truly disgraceful").Some great gems:- Most businesses do a terrible job at customer service. "Put your customer service first always, and I guarantee your business will flourish." And "paradoxically, if you put your investors first you probably won't give them the return they would like".- Salary openness (and salary cap @19x pay, which has increased to fight competitors). Fully-paid health insurance, where benefits are the same for every employee.- You can beat the stock indexes by buying the Fortune 100 companies - would have doubled return in last 10 years.- Doesn't like Walmart's mentality of beating up suppliers - vendors must be allowed to thrive.The ultimate message is that business has a deeper purpose beyond maximizing profits, and must maximize value for every stakeholder (employees, vendors, customers, community, etc.). Conscious capitalism is the ecosystem created by these businesses interacting and he foresees that this will be the dominant business environment of the 21st century.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this audio-book (an excellent alternative to radio in the car). Although Mr Mackey's optimism and vision is not practiced by the majority of companies out there, he clearly states the case for improving the capitalist ecosystem that will pay dividends for shareholders, suppliers, employees and customers alike.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 stars!In this last book in the Everlasting Heart series, Sanderson and Charlotte Redding head west to California. Charlotte has always been spunky, but I enjoyed her more than ever in this installment. Approachable and vulnerable, yet incredibly brave and willing to stand up for her beliefs. I loved the way she defends Cotton -- her affection for her adopted son/brother shines through in that section. Not sure if what she does to the town bullies is prudent and maybe it's pretty convenient that the they make a hasty exit shortly afterwards, but as a reader, I found myself cheering her on. Very satisfying!AHFW starts out with a lot of excitement - the main characters are dealing both with herds of soldiers and stampeding horses, which is breathtaking --  but I really got engaged with the appearance of Johnny Tan. What an intriguing character! I liked the fact that Charlotte finds him attractive -- another reason to identify with her -- and that Sanderson feels an illogical need to gain his approval. Sometimes we find ourselves reacting to people in the strangest, most unexpected ways, and I think Ms. Barnard captured that really well here.During these scenes, Sanderson rings true. However, during parts of the book, he acts out of character, at least in my opinion, and I still don't understand why he buys Charlotte the blue dress with the stiff corset. It was interesting to hear about the dress and how it makes her feel, but this purchase was another reason I began to feel unsure about him. Maybe this was the author's intention -- to show that he's unpredictable due to the uncertainty of this new place and all the dishonesty around him -- but maybe more of his thought process here might have helped since he has been a pretty steady, dependable character in the previous books.As for the language in the book -- ah! I really appreciated the descriptions of the gorgeous wild mountains and vivid colors and smells of this new environment. I sometimes tend to appreciate the details of writing more than the overall plot, and there were some wonderful phrases to savor in this novel, probably the best-written of Ms. Bernard's work to date. One of my favorite lines, when Charlotte sees Cotton dressed his school uniform and feels that he's possibly going to lose his Indian identity: "Something caught in her throat, something that tasted a little like regret." Nice.The story is resolved at a good pace -- it wasn't drawn out and there were no quick fixes either. These characters are layered -- therefore, their epiphanies are not predictable or pat -- just like real life. I appreciate that Ms. Barnard wrote a story above and beyond the romance genre and was so successful in describing another lifestyle during an earlier time. Nicely done.With all that said, let's see Johnny Tan in his own novel!*I was provided with a copy of this book for an honest review.*

$review_text.: In a way I don't care because the one giant problem the US government has is massive debt.  That issue is tackled in the book "Empire of Debt" which is sold on Amazon.com.However, I pretty much agree with everything written in this book.  But, I know most of the short comings with our courts and laws.I was sitting in a law class and we were covering evidence and illegal interrogations.  This case dates back to the '60s.A man did a kidnapping.  They knew the girl was murdered.  So, as the officers were driving the man to jail they said to one another "she deserves a good Christian burial rather than being eaten by magpies".  The suspect broke down and showed the body to the police.The courts threw out the dead body as evidence.  The courts ruled that using guilt in getting a confession was cruel and unjustified.So rather than letting this brutal murderer out of jail the state made an appeal.  The case was re-argued in front of the same court members.  In the exact same case the courts ruled that the finding of the body was legal for use as evidence because of the proof of a "methodic search".The lawyer who was instructing us on this series of cases made a "pulling it out of their mouth" motion.The chilling conclusion swept the room.  The law is anything the courts say it is.  We live in a judicial fiat.This book is informative to the people who don't know much about Federal law.  However, it's a little dry to those of us who sat in evidence classes and seen the results of judicial fiat.I always wonder why some grief filled parent does not take revenge on an elitist judge.A good leftist lawyer could get them off.

$REVIEW.: I WAS NOT going to get sucked in 
 No way!! I did not want to start loving a new series

 What was I thinking by starting this book? Oh well, what's done is done
 I FREAKING loved this book


 Every character spoke to me

 Ellyson and Carter? Holy Hotness
 This is a second chance romance that will leave you breathless

 Ellyson and Carter were best friends in college

 They both were attracted to the other, but both of them were afraid of rocking their friendship by telling the other how they felt

 They lost touch for years
 Fast forward to a chance meeting when Carter moves back to New York
 I cannot even tell you how much I enjoyed this book
 I could not put it down even when I knew I had other things to do
 My eyes are red and swollen from the tears that I cried while reading parts of this book
 You will feel every emotion as you read the book

 There isn't a lot of angst where other people are coming between the couple

 They just have normal everyday problems that they have to get through
 Carter is the ultimate book boyfriend


 The author perfectly sets up the other characters to have books about them


 I got this one for free


 Halfway through I found out there was another one
 I went and purchased it immediately

 No cliffhanger

 Dual point of view

 Oh my is all I have to say!

It's a face-paced story with leading characters who are very interesting: Rebecca Mayfield a homicide inspector and Richie Almafi the leading suspect in her latest case. For Rebecca, all evidence points to Richie, and the case is handed to her like a gift all neatly wrapped up from the start. But when Richie shows up at Rebecca's house with &#34;his side&#34; of the story, she doesn't know if there's any truth to what he's saying. Is the perfect crime coming unwrapped, or is this a well-played hustle by Richie Almafi?

Except that this is so poorly written that I can't tell if it's meant to be as absurd as it is.  Look, if you're really offended by Cindy Sheehan and want a poorly written book that will appeal to readers of the New York Post, you can't do much better than this.  So this would fit on any wishlist right next to the new Bill O' Reilly book on...whatever.

The cookbook portion is just short enough to have plenty of recipes without getting bogged down with too many choices. There's still plenty of variety, too, so you don't get bored eating the same old thing. You don't have to be vegan or even trying to lose weight to enjoy the recipes found in this book--lots of choices for everyone.

$REVIEW.: Award winning, best-selling author, Lori L. Lake, tells a riveting story in her acclaimed novel, Ricochet in Time. Lake's novel hits a raw nerve in its depiction of prejudice, homophobia, and gay bashing at its ugliest. It is a story of how tragedy and despair can lead to hope and love as a brave woman, Dani, with the help of newfound friends, fights back. The main theme of Ricochet in Time is, "What goes around comes around...you send love out into the world, and it comes back to you. You send out hatred and hell-fire, and it behaves just like a boomerang. It ricochets right back and hits you in the heart (p. 198)." One door closes for Dani, will another one open?Danielle Corbett (Dani) and her new girlfriend, Margaret Lee O'Donnell (Meg), lives are changed forever because they stopped at a bar along the road. They had been traveling by motorcycle in hot, humid weather, and after two hours they needed a break; they stopped to get a Coke. If only they hadn't, things would have been so different. The mere sight of these women provoked the locals, who took offense at having two "queers" in their establishment. One bigoted low-life forces them to leave. He doesn't think "perverted dykes" have the right to be in his presence. Dani and Meg leave, but not without a fight. Thus, begins the masterful storytelling Lake is best known for.Left for dead by their basher, hikers witness the accident and rescue Dani. Hurt, alone, with little money, and no place to go, Dani's impulse is to run. She has always run away from her troubles. The only thing keeping her from running this time is her medical condition. Dani has to heal first-physically and mentally. She has to come to terms with Meg's death, figure out where she is going to live, and what she is going to do with her life. After her mother's death, Dani and her brother were raised by a homophobic, abusive, and alcoholic father. Growing up under harsh circumstances, she developed a tough outer shell, but inside she is a sensitive, caring woman who only wants to love and be loved.Hospitalized at a very vulnerable and lonely time in her life, Dani meets a physical therapist, Grace Beaumont, who is interested in Dani for reasons she doesn't reveal. Grace's great-aunts, Estelline, and her partner, Ruth, take Dani into their home and hearts. They feed her starving body, as well as her mind and soul. What started out as Ruth's desire to get the story of the bashing for The Purple Paper, and to help the gay community fight prejudice and hate crimes, ends up to be so much more. Dani becomes an important part of Grace, Estelline, and Ruth's lives. The women become very special to Dani too.The heart-warming, committed, and loving relationship between Estelline and Ruth sets a perfect example of two soul mates who remain together through thick and thin; they have weathered many storms and have become stronger because of it. The older women are role models for the younger women. Can Dani and Grace achieve what these two women have?Ricochet in Time grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go. The story flows so naturally that you don't feel like you're reading a book. You are there, living through the circumstances along with the characters, who come to life on every page. Lori L. Lake is a masterful storyteller. What I love most about Lake's novels is how much I care about the characters and what happens to them. Even with Dani's rough-around-the-edges exterior, you can't help but love her. She comes across as a strong woman who can fend for herself against all odds, but this is her coping mechanism. Through Grace's eyes, you see the good more clearly and you find yourself rooting for more than friendship between Dani and Grace. Lake writes with such clarity and imagery that her description of the pain Dani suffers from the accident is palpable. The author, insightfully and eloquently, went inside her characters' heads, making the story that much more believable. You know exactly what and how the characters are feeling at any given time.I highly recommend Lake's debut novel, Ricochet in Time. This talented author of the best-selling novels, Stepping Out: Short Stories, Different Dress, Under the Gun, Gun Shy, and Ricochet in Time, is "considered one of the best authors of modern lesbian fiction," according to Lavender Magazine, " but her work-part action, part drama, and part romance-gleefully defies categorization." I couldn't agree more.

$REVIEW.: I read both The Stumpwork Robe and the sequel The Last Stitch. Prue Batten has talent as a writer--the world she creates is beautiful and believable. She has cleverly woven Celtic mythology and the lore of the fae into a semi-medieval world. Her characters are vivid and engaging, and the plot kept me reading on, wanting to know where it would go. However, she needs to proof read--too many errors in pronoun usage (it is necessary for she (her) and the babe to rest);verb tense "he opened his palm and lay (laid)something in it"; and word usage "at a discrete (discreet) distance". Occasionally I think her love of using a different and unusual word misleads her--such as "making a fulsome discovery", or "silver like a precious chaperon a Queen might wear".Chaperon is a old word for a hood, but here it makes one think of a chaperone, which is unintentionally funny. Fulsome mean abundant in the 13th century, but now has the meaning of flattering or complimentary to an embarrassing or excessive degree. "I could angst over it" also sounded odd--angst is a noun, not a verb. Some words are misspelled--palate for palette, rooves for roofs, mame for maim, misogeny for misogyny. I found her errors bothered me more because Batten has talent and imagination. A good writer should take care to be sure the finished product is truly finished. I hope Ms. Batten keeps writing and finds a good proof reader and editor.

There are a lot of things that I didn't understand and, because of that, I am sure that I am not making as much money as I could be. Now, after reading The Simple Strategy, I feel more confident in my trading abilities than ever before. It's almost as if a light bulb was turned on over my head as I was reading along. The way the author explained certain aspects of trading, especially the intraday trades, was almost as if he was sitting down with me and showing me step-by-step what do to and why I should do it. I think that is the best way to explain something to someone rather than just telling them to do something without that all-important explanation. This book is very well written and worth far more than the asking price. I have read it through many times now and each time, I find something new to focus my attention on and see if I can use that to make my trading abilities better. Whether you have been trading for a while now or are just getting started, this book will help you immensely.

After all the customers are gone and the shop closes for the day, Chance is required to be naked so the old man can watch him. It is humiliating, but Chance gets two things out of the arrangement. The first is a roof over his head but it's the second that makes it all worth it. Chance has access to all he needs to cook. He dreams of being a chef on The Food Network and is sure he can win a recipe contest sponsored by the network and get his chance.Brody Johnston is home on leave from the Navy to take care of his mother. Brody is instantly attracted to Chance the first time he sees the younger man. As Chance is with Brody.  Now Brody has to convince Chance to take a chance with him. Brody can't leave Chance behind when he has to return to duty. Brody sweeps in and literally sweeps Chance off his feet. And hopes it's enough to convince Chance to take a chance on them.An Officer and His Gentleman is a true romance. I'd even go so far as to call it a modern day fairytale. It has a hero in distress, Chance. Chance's best friend could be seen as the fairy godmother figure and the evil witch/bad guy wants to keep Chance all to himself. And in the end, Prince Charming comes riding in to save the day and ride off into the sunset with his love. All very suggestive of An Officer and a Gentleman. I had to laugh at the squirrels and their orange tails. They made the whole story amusing. The only problem that I had was some of the dialog, and I can honestly say it really didn't take away from anything. It reminded me at times of the dialog in bad porn film. But even with that I Joyfully Recommend An Officer and His Gentleman.WillowReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$review_text.: A school of magic, kids with supernatural abilities, and... Lewis Carroll? I admit that when I read the blurb I didn't think I would like this story. After all, many books out there deal with schools of magic and children with magical abilities.But I was wrong.The blurb frankly does not do this wonderful novel justice. My initial reservations evaporated after the first page. Written in the first person from the point of view of Simon Magus, a teenage boy, in a clear, strong voice, the story draws the reader into a realistic and yet fantastic world. Although I haven't read Book 1 in the series, I had absolutely no trouble following everything that took place in Level Three's Dream.Simon, the protagonist, is a believable and likable character. His sorrow, his maturity, his worries and questions about the future, all serve to make him real. His interactions with his parents and friends ring true, while his preoccupation with doing the right thing and his fear of becoming dangerous to others through his powers hint at his powerful internal struggle.The author is able to render a full characterization of not only Simon but also of all the other characters surrounding him and does so with easy, bold strokes, through the way they speak, their actions and gestures. You will find no lengthy descriptions or unnecessary details. The writing is stripped down to its bare essentials so that it shines in its simplicity. This polished style, coupled with lots of action and suspense, makes for a fast pace.The author's wit and humor shine through every page of this book. Not only are the dialogues natural-sounding and funny, the world inside Level Three's head, based on Carroll's stories, remains true to the original's surreal, irrational feel, while the play on words and expressions is dazzling. If you are a lover of Carroll's wit, then this is certainly a book for you.I was glad to see that, instead of an all-white Caucasian cast, the author included different ethnicities, marked by their beliefs and mode of speaking, both in their syntax and vocabulary choices, a fact that not only added to the character's three-dimensionality, but to that of the created world as a whole.The depth of emotion described and evoked was a pleasant surprise and one of the strengths of this story. My sympathy was with all the characters - Simon, fighting his sorrow over Leah's death, Mermelstein fighting his fear of emotions he cannot yet understand, Level Three trying to figure out what makes him do the mean things he does, and all the other characters having their internal struggles.Furthermore, although I was initially unhappy with the way the topic of autism was treated not only by Simon and his friends but also by the school teachers, I was pleased with the resolution of the matter.However, I did have a few issues with the novel. Although the bare style works well, a couple of times I wished for more description. That was my problem especially toward the end of chapters. In general, I believe some more description would have grounded the story more and helped the reader visualize this magical world.Another issue I had was with the overuse of the `Alice in Wonderland' theme. Although I expected this theme to run through the novel, I thought the excerpts from Carroll's books at the beginning of each short chapter weren't necessary - indeed, they were distracting and I admit I skipped over all of them, after I had read the first one.On this same topic, I found that there were too many poems in the book. These are modified versions of the poems found in Carroll's books, but, although they are quite funny and witty, I also stopped reading them after a while. However, I can imagine that young teens may enjoy them more than I.Finally, at various points, the book also contains illustrations done in pencil and I don't think they were really needed in a book for young adults.To sum up: Level Three's Dream is a well-written story, fast-paced and witty. Well edited and formatted, penned with sincerity and feeling, it addresses not only teenagers but public of all ages. The novel asks essential questions about death and the immortality of the soul, sexuality and religion, cultural xenophobia, love and sorrow. If you are a fan of urban fantasy, of Lewis Carroll or are just looking for a good, gripping tale, I highly recommend Level Three's Dream by Matt Posner.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.(for Good Book Alert)

$REVIEW.: Originally from California but having grown up mostly in the South, as a 52 year old male I looked forward to this summary of the civil rights movement.  This book is MUCH better than I expected and would put it in my Top 10 of all time.  First of all, as the premier writer of the civil rights movement mainly in Mississippi and Alabama this first hand account sheds new light not only the events that have been reported but also the emotional mentality of the crowds, the offended race AND the reporters caught up in the story.  I live in Memphis and have seen racism and to this day, subtle racism.  But the description in this book of the open disregard for the law and willingness to kill, maim or intimidate with no fear of retribution is eye-opening.But this book is much more than civil rights.  Growing up at the end of the depression Karl Fleming gives an account of a different family life in a less affluent time.  Reading of he and his sister being sent to an orphanage is heart wrenching.  This event obviously has long lasting effects on his relationship with his mother.  This section and his initial jobs in the Navy during the war and upon return as a cub reporter gives great insight to a mystical life growing up in the charming South that so many Southerners would prefer to revisit.  If I have one complaint it is that he later only mentions his sister in passing.  How did she emotionally survive this ordeal.  I'd really like to know.The third act of this book is of a mature reporter whose family is dissolving as he enters a relationship with a new woman to whom he is still married to this day.  But it also touches on the cultures of the 60s with his interest in booze and later drugs.  While he does not spend as much time here, there obviously is a bigger story as he enters a difficult time financially, professionally and emotionally as he confronts his divorce, his demons and his past.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in what life was like living in the South in the middle of the century as well as life during the depression and the following war.  If you have any interest in the civil rights struggle read this account to truly feel the emotion that movies such as Mississippi Burning poorly convey.  As a companion book I recommend "The Glass Castle" which tells of another unique survival in a poor family.  I bought this book and couldn't get motivated to read it immediately but am very glad I did.  Read this book for enjoyment and to learn. It is a master piece!

$review_text.: This book is an interesting survey of the careers and prospects of the new group of rulers installed in China in November 2002 based on leaked, edited internal party reports as supplemented by background information provided by the leaker.  The authors seem to be in a position to judge the credibility of this information, though I can only imagine that the information is filtered through some subtle lens which would only be detectable to the true insider.  Now, this book went to press in September 2002 so it seems that some of the predictions did not come to pass and these issues may or may not be addressed in future editions.The book is well written straight forward account of the intrigues that led this group of men to the control of the lives of a billion people.  Recent press reports show that this transition is just as opaque to the Chinese as it is to Americans, which only increases the importance of this book and its Chinese language counterparts.The compelling thing about this story is the bit of light it sheds on the Chinese power structure.  There are a series of overlapping factions, interests and affinities of such small distinction that I am not sure that even the players fully understand the game.  Prof. Nathan provides some information but does not attempt to explain it all in detail.

$review_text.: Oblivion has finally made it, they have a chart topping single and are on their first tour, opening for a popular rock band that Deacon McCoy has idolized for a long time. Their fans are growing by the day and though life on the road cramped into a bus with four other people might not be easy, it's the start to their dreams. Having a sexy and feisty chef cater to your needs doesn't hurt either. But Harper Pruitt knows all about rock stars and has no time for their attention, or their egos. She's focused on her future and owning her own catering business some day, and fraternizing with a big, sexy, bassist is not what she's looking to put on her resume. From the start though, Deacon is not what Harper expected, and he is determined to show her that he is more then just a musician on tour. When the band seems to be crumbling around Deacon though and Harper is his only anchor, will she be there to hold on to or will their dreams take them in different directions?I really loved Deacon and Harper's story. It was full of passion, doubt, angst, and romance. Deacon is a lovable character. The end. Sure, he is a guy and has his moments, but his heart is as big as L.A. and he will do just about anything to keep Harper at his side and hold his band together. Harper I liked, she was strong and independent, but at times that independence turned to just stupid stubbornness. Together though you just knew her and Deac fit. Their chemistry sizzled from the pages and I'm sure would have scorched the ends if I was reading a print copy.I also enjoyed the dynamics and the drama of the band-mates in Oblivion. The story was a roller-coaster ride with many ups and downs, towards the end I wasn't sure what would happen to the band. And really, I'm still not certain of their future. Nick and Simon have done some major damage to the comradery of the group, Gray is obviously hiding something huge that could very well destroy them, Nick...my sexy, angry Nicky. I want his story soooo bad! And Jazz is Jazz, how could you not love the little purple pixie?I'm looking forward to more from this series, the books can't release fast enough for me! If you love contemporary romance with a dash of NA and a whole lot of rocker sexiness then I recommend you pick up this book, and it's prequel!

 Heavily layered with mystery

 I don't know if I want to read the other books in the series, I looked them up and am kind of intrigued on what will happen in the future with Maggie and Saint Just

 There was a love triangle that was just introduced between the detective, Maggie and Saint Just and am kind of curious how it will play out

 I was a little dissapointed and hoped for more to happen sooner in the first book to kind of hook me and then make me follow the others that follow


 I'm just not sure if it hooked me enough


 There were parts that were just kind of boring and conversations I couldn't understand how they became part of the story and why it was important for me to be reading them
 I don't know, this book was just ok for me, cute yet a little on the slow side

$REVIEW.: I thought the beginning was rather slow, but once I met Nellie, the heroine, I was hooked

She's a very interesting, strong, complex character.I also liked that Julian wasn't your typical hero -- he's obviously a person of color, a doctor with an engineering bent

However, at times he comes across as very annoying -- esp
when he disparages the heroine's paranormal abilities
It seemed like a double-standard: he's hurt because she misunderstands his mechanical interest, but he won't even consider her paranormal experience.Also, I wasn't quite sure how Ms
Kwan would handle the heroine's married status...but she did it well
And I was happy, the husband actually had more depth than I expected.And yes, at the end I cheered when the villain got what he deserved


I just wish there was a stronger steampunk aspect in the story.*A copy of the book was given to me by the author in exchange of an honest review.*

$REVIEW.: Suzan Mazur is a natural history science reporter based in New Zealand.  As such, she is probably as knowledgeable as any single person might be regards the state of current thinking on the front lines of natural history research.  As a reporter Mazur has written for several publications and also maintains her own website, which see.  This book is based on a conference, organized by Gerd Muller, chairman of the Konrad Lorenz Institute of Evolution and Cognition in Altenberg, Austria.  The conference took place in July of 2008.  In addition to the 16 scientists and philosophers attending that Altenberg conference, Mazur's book also provides marvelous interviews with and glimpse into the thinking of other non-traditional, leading edge thinkers in the field of Natural History research who didn't attend the conference.  Mazur's book is thus a marvelous resource for further research.  A couple of caveats: Some of the content was taken from Mazur's website and some not. Thus the style is a bit clunky and content at times is somewhat repetitious. Secondly, an index is sorely needed.As a result of the Altenberg conference, M.I.T. published two great books.  The first is a reprint of Julian Huxley's EVOLUTION: THE MODERN SYNTHESIS (2010) that was first published in 1942.  Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd Muller provide a new Foreword to this edition.  The second companion volume is EVOLUTION: THE EXTENDED SYNTHESIS (2010) edited by Pigliucci and Muller.  This second book has 17 papers that resulted from the conference.Mazur's book and the two books resulting from Altenberg are all certainly 5-star works and certainly represent a step in the right direction although, in my view, not quite "there" yet.  Lynn Margulis, well known for her important work regards symbiosis, when interviewed by Mazur for the book provided one of the common definitions of "evolution."  Margulis said, "[e]volution just means change through time."  As far as I am aware, the Altenberg attendees and others mentioned by Mazur also all accept the notion of common ancestry and a single tree-of-life.  Thus, in my view, they are appropriately yet labeled Evolutionists (with capital E) whereas, in my view, the appropriate approach is Naturalistic Parallelism.NOTE AND UPDATE OF 11 / 20 / 2012:As she stated in Mazur's book, at the time when the now late Lynn Margulis was well into what was to become her enormously important contributions to the advancement of Natural History studies, i.e., her work regards symbiogenesis, Margulis was surprised to learn that much earlier a Russian, Boris Mikhaylovich Kozo-Polyansky, had already made very similar discoveries and interpretations.  I have thus been reading Kozo-Polyansky's A NEW PRINCIPLE OF EVOLUTION ([1924], 2010) that Margulis referred to.  The 2010 edition was translated from the Russian by Victor Fet and edited by Fet and Margulis.In the following quote of BMK, information in the square brackets is of the 2010 editors. The asterisk is BMK's and refers to his 1923 book, THE LAST WORD OF ANTI-DARWINISM, which apparently is not yet available in English.  Koso-Polyansky writes (p.117):"According to Darwin, the best manner in which to present relatedness among living organisms is a tree with multiple divergent branches, a `family tree' similar in shape to a real tree."This opinion is accepted by the overwhelming majority of evolutionists. According to some, however ([Leo] Berg [1922]), genealogical relationships should be presented in the shape of a rye field --- as numerous parallel, similar phyletic rows. Elsewhere*, I attempted to show that this fantasy has no validity."Without a doubt, a `genealogical tree,' as an expression of these phenomena, should be preferred. Everything described here demonstrates that in this case we also have to make a radical [topological] correction."A genealogical tree of organic nature does not follow the shape of a real tree.  The genealogy of organisms is expressed not only in divergence of lineages but also in fusion, or joining; two or more branches fuse and give a merged lineage [anastomosis].  This branch, in its turn, can fuse or merge with other branches to give a new branch of higher order, etc."One has to keep in mind, however, that this fusion, i.e., the association of several types of organisms to make a composite type (fungus + alga = lichen) has nothing to do with convergence in the sense of Danilevsky, Berg, etc., where this term designates full SIMILARITY among several organisms belonging to different genetic lineages."In Mazur's book, Margulis similarly accepts what I refer to as Evolution, i.e., the notion that includes common ancestry, a tree-of-life, etc.  Margulis states (p.279):"Everybody agrees with ultimate common ancestry of Earth's life, because the DNA, RNA messenger, transfer RNA, membrane-bounded cell constituents (lipids, the phospholids) that we share --- they're all virtually identical in all life today, it's all one single lineage.  So that part of Darwinism --- that we're all related by common ancestry --- no scientist disagrees with."Well, if that is what all current scientists think (and similar statements have been made by other Evolutionists), then obviously society needs to spend less on scientists and more on students of chemistry, bio-chemistry, mathematics, and physics.To be clear, and for what it is worth after several decades of study, I disagree with Margulis on two fronts:  (1). I accept the common, popular understanding of "evolution" (which I capitalize as "Evolution") which incorporates the notion of common ancestry in the definition of the word itself. Margulis states that "evolution" is equivalent to Darwin's "descent with modification."  I disagree. It is clear to me that soon after "evolution" was associated with Darwin's work --- by Herbert Spencer, Thomas Huxley, George Romanes and others --- the term was primarily used, often later confusedly and irresponsibly as continues to this day with more trivial meanings, to indicate Darwin's entire primary thesis including the orgins of species (previously termed transmutation). Thus the meaning of "evolution" came to include 'decent with modification from common ancestors.' So as to avoid confusion, I have thus come to avoid all uses of the word where common descent is not intended, except when quoting others.  The Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, the Dover PA 2005 trial regards the teaching of ID, and the endless arguments with Supernaturalists (Creationists and IDers) over the decades since Darwin surely haven't been focused on the trivial "change through time" which even biblicists accept.  (2). I obviously also reject the ideology, well enunciated by BMK and LM, that Evolution (common ancestry) is true.  In the view of Naturalistic Parallelism that I have come to accept over the decades, samenesses (Darwin's "homologies" as also applied to genomes) do not automatically equate to relationship.  That is, just as many complex chemicals are known to exist in parallel on Earth and in the Universe at large resulting in the same apparent designs (consider snowflakes), so too is it probable that life arouse many times in parallel and continued to so develop. In my view, if an eukaryotic cell can originate via serial endosymbiosis (as very well indicated by LM 1998), then there is no reason why such an event could not have happened many, many, times.  Etc.  Furthermore, such parallelism seems to be well indicated in the fossil record both prior to and after eukaryotic cell formation. (A "web of life" is also presumed, commonly by origins-of-life researchers, to be a dominant feature, especially prior to the Cambrian.)While I see zillions of forests and gazillions of trees rather than the "rye field" that BMK reports that Leo Berg saw, it nevertheless would be interesting to read both Berg's work as well as BMK's objections. Would these writings were available in English.

$review_text.: I was asked to review Mike Robinson's new book "The Green-Eyed Monster." I received a free copy off netgalley in exchange for my thoughts. It's a paranormal horror/mystery that twists through the interlinked lives of two men: Martin Smith and John Becker.This is a mystery laced with metaphysical and philosophical questions. You start off at the end--the final battle in the war between two competing giants. Much of the rest of the book is presented in flash-back, where the characters who had been influenced by the tendrils of chaos that emanate from the two boys tell their story.The two main stories are those of Mrs. Chatsworth, their first grade teacher, and Harry Zweig, a classmate of theirs. This makes up the real meat of the book. Each character had a distinctive voice, and even though you knew in advance what happened to them, their stories were fascinating. They felt like real people--or as real as possible when their reality is rapidly approaching insane. These stories take up the majority of the book, which is good, because they're what I most enjoyed.The monster/philosophical part never takes concrete form--the "grandfather" can always been identified by his butterflies, but he seldom communicates directly with the characters. What is interesting is how both Becker and Smith appear to be two halves of the same soul--their books are almost identical, as are their life stories. They don't really seem human--too lost in some other world to interact with the other characters well. It makes them seem mysterious and a little dangerous--especially after Mrs. Chattsworth's story is told.In short, don't accept favors from anyone's grandfather. Ever. Bad idea.

$review_text.: In an era in which the sun is setting on the superhero, Steve Clarke - a.k.a. Reaver - is counting down his own personal deadline. He has two weeks to settle his affairs, a fortnight's reprieve from execution granted him by the Eleventh Hour, the world's most frightening criminal syndicate. After years of staying far away, Reaver is going back to tiny Greenway, his hometown and site of the research facility what inadvertently gave him his secret origin. He's made a list of things to do before the villains come for him and end him. Topping that list is Adele, the childhood sweetheart he'd abandoned so long ago.Reaver is not the world's greatest superhero. He's certainly not the most acclaimed. That would be the charismatic Paladin, this reality's closest thing to a Superman analog. Except that Paladin, like most other heroes, has died. Reaver's powers aren't chump change. He can muster three times the speed of a normal human. He's hundreds of times stronger. He heals real fast. And his catchphrase "Take some time off!" makes sense when I tell you that one punch from Reaver can literally take a year off a man's life. So his street cred's fine. An off-putting sort, Reaver isn't the most well-loved hero. Can he finish off his list before Eleventh Hour picks up where it had left off nearly beating him to death the last time?You may or may not know Paul Tobin for his work in the comic book field. It depends on how off mainstream your taste is as a comic book reader. Tobin's resume includes several series in Marvel's all-ages Marvel Adventures imprint and indie titles like BANDETTE (from Monkeybrain Comics), GINGERBREAD GIRL (originally serialized on-line, later published by Top Shelf), and the chilling horror mini-series COLDER (from Dark Horse). Tobin's readers grew concerned when they learned that he would be writing PREPARE TO DIE!, fearing that he was abandoning comic books for prose novels. To quote Tobin: "I wanted to look deeper into the personality of the characters. I wanted the freedom to explore humanity in depth. Along with punching things."And, no, he's not jumping ship. Still, I wouldn't mind if he occasionally strayed into prose novel territory. In PREPARE TO DIE! he writes a rich narrative set in the cape and cowl universe. Steve Clarke, Reaver, is a complex character whose humanity and super-humanity are explored vividly and whose life is broken down in rich, melancholy detail. A huge chunk of the book is dedicated to flashback segments as Steve Clarke narrates his life from childhood to exposure to the spill to his stint in costume. And, yes, there's a whiff of an elegiac lament going on.Tobin adeptly addresses superhero tropes but balances the gaudy, grandiose themes and the blood-and-guts action with many introspective moments. Reaver and Paladin are well fleshed out, and so is the central villain, Octagon, unpredictable leader of the unstable Eleventh Hour. And, yes, I hear and even reluctantly agree with those who'd remarked that the women characters are given shallow treatment (except for one). PREPARE TO DIE! isn't tailored toward kids under a certain age (preteens?) as there's plenty of frank discussion about sex and sometimes even more than frank discussion. The narrative is fueled by an emotional charge that is very much in your face, it's almost visceral. There's a density to the storytelling. Tobin is a really good writer. By the time you close the last page, it may feel as if you'd experienced Reaver's tempestuous life. If you're devoted to comic books like I am, you owe it to yourself to read PREPARE TO DIE! You know what, take some time off.

$REVIEW.: In his debut novel, The Professor, author Robert Bailey utilizes his extensive legal knowledge and experience interwoven with his passion for his alma mater, University of Alabama, to weave a riveting and unforgettable legal thriller that will captivate the reader's attention from beginning to end.This is a fast-paced story about greed, bribery, betrayal, and a fight for justice. It is a classic legal chess game set in Alabama between evil big business and corrupt politicians versus a seasoned legal professor and his young protegee, that provides a powerful and compelling story with enough gripping thrills and chills interspersed with drama and suspenseful twists and turns.What more could a fan of college football and legal thrillers want then to lose themselves in between the pages of this emotional story? The author does a wonderful job of interweaving his legal experience and passion for 'Bama football with richly detailed and descriptive references that easily transports the reader to a small town Alabama courtroom and the Crimson Tide campus where the legendary football coach Paul &#34;Bear&#34; Bryant ruled supreme.With a complex and realistic cast of characters; witty dialogue and dramatic heart pounding interactions; and a fascinating mystery/crime storyline with an authentic style that flows seamlessly from beginning to end; The Professor is a thoroughly entertaining legal crime story that takes the reader on one hell of a thrilling roller coaster ride!

$review_text.: The Handbook of Catholic Apologetics by Peter Kreeft is a great resource for Catholics looking to explore their faith, answer questions about the religion, and learn to argue in defense of Catholicism
Kreeft's writing is eloquent, concise, and for the most part, easy to understand, but there are some sections that are rather difficult to comprehend, especially some of the arguments for the existence of God

If you don't have any background on philosophy, this book may not be right for you, but all of the theology is accurate and fairly comprehensive, which is probably a necessary trade-off.I have to admit, I am actually not Catholic, although I do have a good understanding of the religion

$review_text.: People are dying in the creepiest weirdest way ever imagined in the new novel, The Book of Matthew: a macabre novel of suspense by Thomas White. It falls on San Francisco homicide inspector, Clemson Yao and his intrepid partner, a local Realtor, Angie Strachan to end this spree. Angie isn't your typical Realtor though.  She once attempted to become the city's first woman homicide inspector, but was kicked off the force when she killed a suspect/perpetrator instead of arresting him.  The serial killer being sought is one of the more compelling baddies found in modern novels. He cheerfully calls his victims, "messies", and spends untold hours researching methods for killing them. This grisly murderer has searched the globe for all the ways of brutal torture that can kill in the slowest way possible, and he selects his victim's deaths from this research.Disturbing and warped, the book nonetheless is a pretty satisfying novel. I did find that the detailed hallucinatory descriptions of dreams and nightmare sequences got a bit old, and I could have done without most of them. But for originality in a genre filled with twisted bad guys, the author scores a slam-dunk. The dynamic between Yao and Angie was great, and was a solid set up for an entire series featuring them. This is a well-written debut novel and I look forward to seeing more from Thomas White.

$review_text.: When I received this book I was expecting it to be an in depth chronology of the Clay family, which was prominent in early America. When I first looked at the book I knew at once that it could not include that much data - it was too thin!The author is a fine historian, and has well documented the first 1/2 of the work. This deals with the story of the Clay family in Colonial America and up into the late nineteenth century. It also details the Cecil family, which actually originally owned all of Maryland - something I have never known.However, one should be aware that the purpose of the early histories is to lead up to the author's own heritage. Thus, she deals with the branches of the family that lead to her direct ancestors. Once she has described the early Cecil / Clay families, she increasingly relies on the oral history of the women in her family. From about the middle of the nineteenth century the story is increasingly about the Cecil family women - no Clay histories at all. The final several chapters are entirely oral history. It is not that the author was unable to document these chapters, but rather that she began to present to the reader the actual purpose of the book.As the book went on I came to realize that this was more of a biography of how the author found her own roots, recognizing the importance of oral history in Southern families. As a work of this nature the book is outstanding. She pulls no punches in describing the dark sides of her heritage, and yet in the end it is a story of personal hope and the redemption of a soul. If one approaches the work in this light, it is utterly fascinating. If one is looking for complete histories, look elsewhere - that is not what the book is about.The language and subject matter in the book are frank, and I do not recommend it for younger children. It is very suitable for older children, especially girls, and especially Southern girls whose families adhere to the principles of Southern oral traditions. One needs to read the book to understand these recommendations.However, I am not a Kentuckian or a female, and I enjoyed the book immensely.

I love the way Rico grew from an egomaniac to someone who learned to trust a woman with his heart.  Asia was a sweet follow, as I enjoyed watching her take control, showing Rico who was really the boss.  I realize that this novel was a little spicier than the ones before but of course I did not mind as I enjoyed it immensely.I look forward to Judy Angelo's next intrigue.

$review_text.: On the Cold CoastsThe setting is unusual &#8211; Iceland in the mid 1400 hundreds- when  Iceland is ruled by a king who lives in Denmark while the archbishop lives in Sweden and English fisherman  are  setting up trade alliances.  The English are not only interested in exchanging goods for fish but also but also do a bit of raiding and kidnapping , making slaves of their captives.  The Black Death ,or the Great Plague, as it is called in the book, has left empty lands lacking workers and altered inheritance patterns.The story opens with Ragna, age fourteen, in the throes of agonizing childbirth.  The child is a bastard born of a brief encounter with an injured English sailor and Ragna herself, who had scarcely understood what  that sexual experience could mean, has her life changed completely.  Her betrothed is unwilling to marry her without  an additional dowry and her stepfather  doesn&#8217;t want to give any more of her mother&#8217;s lands to her.The story is told in two voices &#8211; a straightforward narrative and the musings of Ragna&#8217;s own thoughts . The plot  develops over a period of fifteen to twenty years.  The characters are believable and Ragna herself quite likeable.  The author has a love of countryside and  the ability to evoke a strong sense of landscape.  It is an enjoyable readmlr

You learn the money saving tips and benefits of starting up plants from seeds compared to the more costly way of purchasing the plants themselves and he teaches you how to make your own compost while you're at it


There's a list of problems you may encounter so you can avoid them.I found this e-book very helpful as I don't have a garden, others to will benefit greatly from reading this if they live in apartments, have no garden or yard space and just have a patio or porch to grow things in.Chapter 2 was especially helpful for me, as I intend to grow my own vegetables in the future

I shall follow his advice on planting perennials too.I recommend this book to those who want working knowledge of container gardening, the author has explained the ins and outs of it in a clear, concise and practical way.

$REVIEW.: The Marriage Caper (Billionaire Games: Book 2)is 208 pages long and priced at $3.99
 (Remember - check the boxed set price first before you buy them singly!)  This story takes up after Julian & Camille have married - for real - and the couple for this book is Andre and Tasha


 Tasha is Camille's best friend from the States and Andre is the "spare" of the de Laurent dynasty

 Andre's mother's uncle passes away and leaves the bulk of his estate & holdings to Andre, with $50 million stipulations for both Julian and their half-sister, Lecie - but Andre must marry within 60 days and remain married for 1 year or else the will reverts to two very distant cousins

 Unknown to them, one of those cousins is scheming to get the fortune.This book was shorter than the first, but hit hard on a subject that can be considered very sensitive to some - that of miscarriage

 It's interesting how vividly Sandra Edwards portrays the pain and enduring loss a miscarriage can have on a woman..
a couple..

and a marriage..


and she doesn't shy away from the issues of (secondary) infertility, either


 While the love story between Andre and Tasha was heartwarming, I think what really sold me on this book was the ability of the author to pull me into their lives - even the messy parts.

$review_text.: I had to sit down and really think about why I liked this book so much. After much thought, with some sleep in between it came down to the fact that Blade, the assassin in the book, wasn't untouchable. Most books with assassins in them have them being totally untouchable, and if they did get hurt they played if off as if it was nothing. It was nice to read a book about someone that yes could kill you in your sleep, but couldn't hold his own in a bar fight.I also really liked the concept of the familiars, I really enjoyed how when someone was described they looked some what like what ever familiar they had. Sometimes it was fun for me to try and figure out what the familiar was before being told just from the description on the person being talked about.The story itself went in a completely different direction than I thought it was going to go in. I wouldn't have guessed at half of took place in it. And yes after a while I was able to figure certain things out, but something else would pop up to surprise me a few chapters later.Its told from many different point of views. I can't say if there was someones head we were in more than another, everyone was pretty equal in this. Though I can say I liked being in Blades head more than anyone elses, though the Queen was a close second.If I had to pick one thing I really just didn't like it would be the way the book ended. All the lose ends seemed tied up, at least the important ones, and the ones that weren't I didn't expect to get anything from this book. But anyway I feel unsatisfied with the way it ended in general, the book was good enough for it to end a different way and still get readers to come back for the second one. Its hard to explain this without giving something away.Would I recommend this book? Yes, I have recommend it before and I will keep recommending it.[...]

$REVIEW.: Mia is Luke's sister from I love You to Death. Jared is Luke's roommate and fellow band member. The story is told in a series of flashbacks going back 4 years and is in alternating POV's between Mia and Jared. In the present Mia and Jared have broken up and Mia is heartbroken and trying to make amends. Jared is trying his best to ignore her and to just keep going. That's where the flashbacks begin."I want her arms to wrap themselves around my shoulders as I pick her up and take her down to the beach, to a hidden spot where I can kiss her all over. Where no one will find us, where we can pretend, for just a minute, that nothing else, including all of our problems, even exists. But I don't. I do nothing but stand here, watching our reflections in the glass door.Unable to move at all."Four years ago Jared called Mia to tell her Luke had been beaten up by their father. Mia flew to Boston to be with Luke and she and Jared formed a bond, this connection was something that pulled them towards each other despite their long distance lives. One drunken night, Mia attempts to seduce Jared and as much as he wants her, he wants her sober. They never talk about it, but their feelings for each other are there. As Luke healed and Mia left to go back home they stayed in touch and formed more of a romantic relationship.Back and forth Mia travels and with each visit she and Jared fall for each other a little more. When they finally give in and become intimate, let's just say they make up for lost time! But Mia is determined that Luke not find out about them. She doesn't want to strain the friendship that Jared and Luke share. Luke has worked hard at getting away from their father's control and she doesn't want to ruin the life he has built. In the meantime, Luke has met Ash and more of his time is taken up with his relationship with her."I wonder if this time, our kiss isn't going to go a whole lot further. I trace her cheekbone with the same thumb. "I want to as well, Mia," I tell her. "I've always wanted to." "So kiss me Jared," she whispers. "Kiss me like you want it."The flashbacks shift to the present and we see the progression of Mia and Jared's relationship. As close as they became, there are forces determined to keep them apart. Mia's art career is taking her to Chicago and Jared and Luke's band is starting to make a name for itself. There are secrets Mia is keeping from Jared and they are creating cracks in their foundation.As the reasons for their break up become more apparent from the flashbacks, Mia is making some headway into getting Jared to listen to her and understand how sorry she is and how she wants their relationship back. The last year has taken its toll on both of them. It seems that things may finally fall into place. Mia's revelations are heartbreaking and once again her father is at the root of their problems. Even if they can overcome their pasts, is there some other evil waiting to end things for all of them?"I never lost him, but can I have him back. Can I really have him back after everything I did to him? Can he ever really forgive me?"I enjoyed this book. I was a big fan of Ward's ILYTD and loved that she paralleled this story with the events of the first book. The ending drama of ILYTD is also a game changer for this one. I can't wait to read Luke's POV.

$review_text.: This is a beautiful book to open at random. Each and every page is a true delight. The stunning photographs and carefully chosen aphorisms are an inspiration for anyone interested in exploring the true nature of reality. A couple of random examples: "Whatever you take yourself to be will come to an end" and "Continuously hold on to what you are and not to what you know". The book is full of such mind-liberating sayings. The fact that they are brief extracts, rather than whole paragraphs, makes them particularly powerful - as the mind has little to grasp onto. The sayings are so direct and clear that they are beyond the need to be explained by intellectual means.Needless to say, this book is highly recommended!Roy Whenary (author of 'The Texture Of Being')

However, this book provides great insight into how the administration sees the system and what they want to do to it.  For example, Mr. Emanuel states that the reasons the roads are in bad repair is that the healthcare system took to much money.  The ACA is going to take care of that.  While changing medical education and closing a large number of hospitals.  We will not need them for we are all going to be healthy because of the ACA.  If you want to the complete story you will have to read the book to believe it.

$REVIEW.: I know people always say "this was so great i never put it down til i read the whole book" and i always think how absurd that sounds but here i go....I DIDN'T PUT THIS DOWN ONCE TIL I READ EVERY WORD! LOL....I never like to say to much about what happens in a book for fear i will give away a spoiler, so i'l give you my thoughts! At this point i am so invested in Lissa and her family that i feel they've been with me forever! This was definitely a bit different than the others based on the fact its from Lissa's now teen children whom all adore the mother and the occasional excerpt from Lissa's diary (which stays so true to Lissa's point of view, feelings and things that are hopefully to be continued in the next book). I thought it was awesome to catch the kids (whom all definitely have their mom and dad in them!!) using their skills to love, fight, and do whats right, and be great individuals who are not spoiled and are always wise to the worlds they live in and love.

$REVIEW.: Josh worshiped the ground Peter walked on, the air he breathed in and was always amazed at the pastry masterpieces the chef could create. Josh was always honored when Peter asked him to assist in pastry competitions. So when Peter asks Josh back to his place after an event Josh jumps at the offer to go see where the man lives.Peter is a confident chef who knows he is good. Josh on the other hand thinks himself inferior to Peter until Peter tells and shows him otherwise. Peanut Butter Kisses is an excellent read; great storyline, great foreplay and a wonderful finale. I thoroughly enjoyed it.RaineReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$review_text.: good collation of events and legends and conclusions. I think there is a mix of ETs cryptoterrestrials and human whatnot and demons. That incident where an entity approaching a man who was holding a star lug wrench - which is effectively a cross also - turned back when it saw this, shows the power of the Cross! That cross signs existed before Christianity is irrelevant, God Who would have the Crucifixion to break the power of satan and give us salvation and atone for our sins (atonement is NOT at-one-ment that is a play on the English word, it is totally different sounding in Hebrew and Greek and means to cover a sin to make up for it to erase it), would have given that sign power in advance.Whatever physical beings are involved, they seem allergic to Jesus Christ which should tell you something right there. I knew of two cases where invoking Jesus against satan caused the human carrier to flee along with the devil.So physicality is not ruled out by exorcistic effects. Aliens can be demons, physical, or demon infested physical beings.An interesting video series on youtube is by a scientist who has gone loony from working with these aliens in some underground base, they get inside your head, and he may have gotten in their head also. TWO of the videos have a definite satanic imagery to them, and incl. a far eastern flavor in one. the other tells a little story that adds up to, the aliens had a problem, and made a deal with the devil to solve their problem, so now are serving him.I discuss this in a video embedded at [...] and in my book on amazon kindle, A Possible History of Life on Mars. In my late father Elliot Erikson's book also on kindle, Karl Marx and The Communist Manifesto, is an eyewitness story of Karl Marx blowing his top, and this and his hatred of religion (and he even once penned some pro satan poem, I don't think that is mentioned in this book but somewhere else) makes me suspicious that Marx was possessed, and of course so was Hitler. A pincher move. But nazism is closer to the demonic than the mere vaccuum of atheism in communism in general (aside from Marx) so is worse. an atheist can always be converted to Christianity being bored after a while with the spiritual dryness of atheism. covert ambiguous Christians were always in play in Russia and got more unambiguously Christian after the Iron Curtain fell.The fairies and so forth are definitely trouble. they lie, they steal, and the initial peace between the Ottoman muslims and the Orthodox Church in the Balkans, Serbia in particular, was disrupted by a Montenegrin bishop who started the rant that the people don't need their religious freedom as much as their national identity. This fleshly unspiritual concept which worships serbian land as part of "the serbian soul" got entrenched and Velimirovich spoke approvingly of this, and said that fairies in the hills help the serbs with their struggles.Well! a land beset with vampires and haunts and demons has fairies in the hills helping the people, eh? helping keep them estranged from Orthodoxy. most were not reliable church goers long before Communism.these things are damn evil, and whether demons themselves or demon compromised physical beings with a technology or psychic skill to warp one's mind so the are invisible or whatever, they are following the style of Balaam in Numbers in The Bible, who, when he could not curse Israel for gold from the king of Moab, advised alienating the Israelites from YHWH by getting them into sin - fornication with Moabite women, and idolatry. This didn't work forever and 23,000 were killed for it by a plague God sent, and Balaam ended up dead.But the analogy is obvious. These things want what they want, and they try to get us estranged from Jesus Christ. Either get people away from Him altogether, or water the faith down with New Age heresy in the west and meditative states of mind that make one more vulnerable to their influence, dreamy manipulatable states or in the case of Serbian Orthodoxy compromise the faith by viewing it as a cultural artifact, and entrench a mysticism of soil and nation with it defiling it.I am Eastern Orthodox myself by conversion. I have been there done that and repented of it regarding the Republican party is the party of God sort of mentality, and I recognize the same game when it play out in another context.

$REVIEW.: Levesque proves he's not a one trick pony with his second novel (that I've read) THE GIRL AT THE END OF THE WORLD. We are taken on a wild ride with a teenage girl, Scarlett, as she experiences what can be described as a rather realistic global apocalypse. There are no zombies or giant astroids or savage nuclear wars, but it's the end of humanity just the same. Without giving it away, I loved the concept behind the apocalypse. It appealed to the sensible scientific side of my brain. I also enjoyed being in Scarlett's head. Levesque creates a believable teenage girl persona instead of an overdone caricature. From about page two, I was sucked in and read it all in one sitting.The writing is stellar, as expected, and pace is quick. Again, I can't help but wonder how Levesque has been missed by the traditional/nontraditional publishing world. I was however, a bit disappointed by the end. It is always hard to give a truly satisfying end to a book about the apocalypse, (worrying about WALKING DEAD anyone?), and although Levesque handles his with grace, it is somewhat anticlimactic. He had me up until three quarters of the way through, then it sort of peters out. Doesn't matter though, those three quarters are enough to catch some serious escapist time with a good book.There were quite a few similarities in this story to the playstation game THE LAST OF US, so if you were a fan of the story behind that game, you'll dig this novel. I know I did!

$REVIEW.: Each update of the PMBOK guide incorporates changes designed to evolve and improve the project management profession. This book is an excellent reference for educating those new to project management and it should be on the desk of every practicing project manager to remain current in the field of study.For those looking to prepare for the PMP exam this guide provides a solid and reliable foundation on which to build. I used this book along with a few PMP test simulation books, CD-ROMs and online pre-tests to prepare for the exam and passed on the first attempt. During my preparation I pre-tested at least 10 times improving my score from the low 80s to high 90s to insure that I was properly prepared. I did not utilize class based preparation, neither those offered by the local PMI chapter nor those offered by private companies. Others have used the class based programs as part of their readiness with much success and I believe it comes down to what you are most comfortable with. My recommendation to you would be to sign up for an exam readiness program offered through the local PMI chapter and participate in a study group. These two activities combined with a cover to cover study of the PMBOK guide should prepare you well for the exam.

There is not another woman that can compare to Kaitlyn. Pirate and Creeper is doing big things by taking over territories. So many characters has come into this series which makes it all the better.Jaleesa can't make up her mind of whom she wants to be with I can't wait to read the next book. Tae has to come back into the picture but can't let go of Shells and her son whom where in an accident hopefully in the next book she will come back. Raider has calmed down from wanting to be like Socrates and Hangman. I would love it if this was a movie or a mini series I'm all in good job Kr Bankston for an outstanding job on the THIN ICE SERIES.

$REVIEW.: I am a true fan of best friends turned to lover's story and this one sure does hit the mark.  McKenzie Wood is oblivious to Aiden Rogers emotions and how he goes all puppy eyes around, until feelings start stirring in her and realizes she actually wants her best friend.  They both do not want to jeopardize the friendship they have just for sex, but with a very convincing rock star named Nick Blackthorne (awesome name BTW) they can't seem to say no.The intimate scenes are scorches, pun intended since Aiden is a fireman *drool* (lol).  I did almost feel bad for Aiden because I thought maybe his first time with McKenzie should have been alone, but I really think Nick helped their relationship and completely tore down their inhibitions.  Along with Lexxie's known humor, this story is a definite winner for me and a perfect addition to this series.

Smith has created a female character who can stand up to the alpha males and make them kneel at her feet!The lead character is Krinos, a beautiful but tough Aussie who is a spitfire, she can hold her own, is confident in her sexuality, and not afraid to scratch that itch when she wants.  She's everything you would expect a drug bosses daughter to be, and the business is being handed over to her, which leads us to where she meets her fathers second in command, Stefanos.Stefanos is the Alpha of all Alpha male's, he is hot, sexy and used to getting what he wants when he wants... possessive of what he thinks is his... And he wants Krinos!When they meet, Krinos is in lust at first sight, she's not daft to pass up getting hot and heavy with this Greek God, but on her own terms...  Which Stefanos is not happy about, this leads to some awesomely hot reading... The sex is off the charts, hot heavy and hard.Krinos doesn't want to submit and neither will Stefanos and he has a hard time dealing with the fact that she is her own boss, not to be owned or submit (YAY) at last a female who is an equal to these alpha characters.  I also liked how she didn't weaken when times were at there worst, she is a fighter, and she will take on anyone who dares to think she is just a simpering woman.The story is fast paced, the drug world do not think a woman should be a boss, and they stupidly think that she will lay down and take their insolence, I really enjoyed reading this Novella, and I look forward to reading how she will take hold of both the reins in business and how she decides what future Stefanos will have in her life.T.K. Smith's writing style is fast paced, erotic and the chemistry between Krinos and Stefanos literally smokes.I hope book 2 isn't too far away.If you like fast paced story lines with strong characters this book is for you.

$review_text.: I feel in love with &#34;Breakaway&#34; from the first page, it transported me back to my college days without being annoying it was the perfect mix of days gone by & responsibility
Levi Carr (sigh) is captain of his college hockey team


Now if you're from the south (like me) let me translate, hockey is HUGE like football for us


As you can probably guess, Levi (sigh again)  is cocky, determined to win & is quite the ladies man


He does however, take his role as captain very seriously examples: early morning practice & pushing his team mates to hard

The forever thorn in his side (like since high school y'all) is Trevor McCarthy (hisssss boo) this guy is a major jerk

When Levi isn't thinking about hockey he's scheming new ways to get under Trevor's skin (THIS will have y'all giggling, promise!) But after a chance meeting, Levi's life is fixing to take an unexpected detour for the better...Presley McCarthy is intelligent, gorgeous & sassy (totally love her) She's also just happens to be Levi's biggest rival's sister (da,da don)
Growing up, Trevor filled Presley's head with the evils that make up Levi
She's not about to fall for for Levi's cheesy pick up lines that leaves most women drooling

The more time Presley spends with Levi the more she's able to break down the walls he's put up & uncover the true Levi
What's exposed is more than Presley's ever imagined

Can she get passed what her brother Trevor ingrained in her about Levi? Or will she trust her heart & fall in love with the perfect man??Of course I LOVED this book!! I just adore Presley, very often she had me laughing historically
She would turn down Levi & it would leave him stunned because he was so used to woman just falling at his feet
This love affair is a slow burn that will leave you sweating


BUT when it does finally explode, you better turn up your AC because its amazing!! Oh & one of my favorite parts is their first date so keep an eye out for that!! &#34;Breakaway&#34; is a must read romantic love story!!

$REVIEW.: From the author of The Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek series (which I LOVE!) comes a new series of novellas called The Quilted Heart. The first book in the series is Dandelions on the Wind--my latest selection I was fortunate to be able to review.I picked Dandelions on the Wind because I am familiar with Mona Hodgson's work from her previous series (The Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek) which I love (I'm eager to read book #3 and #4!!!). I hoped that this book would have the same level of appeal.I was captured in the first few sentences:"Nevermind that four months had passed since General Lee's surrender. Maren never walked the apple orchard or the wheat field without careful watch for bushwackers and jayhawkers."This book is set in St. Charles, Missouri in 1865 shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War. The plot follows Maren Jensen a young woman from Denmark who came to America to wed--only to find herself rejected because of her failing vision. She has since found a home with a widow and her grand-daughter as the little girl's nanny. The widow's daughter had died in childbirth and her son-in-law ran away to war overwhelmed by his grief. The story begins four years later. One day, without warning, the son-in-law named Rutherford Wainwright aka. Woolly returns home from the war (after not having communicated at all since he left) in hopes of a second-chance with his daughter and to help on the family farm. What follows is a sweet story of forgiveness, grace and second-chances at love.It's an easy read with beautiful vivid vocabulary. I think it enhances the plot since the lead character is facing a life of utter blindness. So the vivid descriptions reminded me of what a seeing person would use to describe the world around them to someone blind. Like in the book series Little House on the Prairie when Mary goes blind and Laura describes everything to her.Because it is a novella, Dandelions on the Wind is just about 100 pages long, so there isn't time to have a deep plot or a lot of characters--however, the author allowed enough character development in the handful we meet, for the reader to understand them.It really is just a very sweet story--perfect for someone wanting a good wholesome short story to enjoy. I wish it had been longer, but now I will just have to seek out the next two books in the series Bending Toward the Sun and Ripples Along the Shore in hope of seeing the characters again.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Water Brook Press as part of their book review bloggers program through Blogging for Books. All opinions expressed are my own and I was not required to write a positive review.

$review_text.: Aesop's Fables were written to convey a message


 Sometimes they offer wisdom, and sometimes they poke fun at conventional wisdom


It illustrates a lot of the thinking and the old ways of doing things and dealing with the world going back into the Pre-Christian times when things were looked at quite differently than they are today
 The book is fun to read because each little story only takes a few minutes to read and the plot changes so quickly from story to story that it is easy to simply relax and let the book carry you along without having to deal with any heavy plots or deep concentration

 It is also very interesting to find out where so many of our old cliches and sayings originated from


 Much of the material would be worth reading to children, and would be a great exercise to teach them to look for deep, and sometimes hidden, meaning.As an adult, I find the book to be both interesting and entertaining, so I give it five stars.

But in watching over her his feelings for her have grown. What is he to do? In Candice Stauffer's noveletteSweet, Decadent Fire (Breath of Darkness)we learn all about Lee Anne's betrayal by her intended and what Jake is willing to do about it.Then there are the demons, Demetri (who has turned his back on his kind) and Joseph. Although demons normally hunt and kill vampires to keep humans safe, Joseph and Jake are friends, and that friendship helps Jake deal with Lee Anne's situation.This is a sexy, hot story by a superb author.

$REVIEW.: My 18 month old loves this book so much that we are on our second copy...he loves to touch the pop-ups and they hold up really well as long as a "grown-up" is there to supervise!  The rhymes are simple and there is not so much text per page that a little one will become antsy waiting to turn the page

 We will be investing in more of this series.

$REVIEW.: 3.25 starsWell, this was certainly a different type of BDSM story and not what I was expecting at all.I liked the concept behind the story and thought that it made for some very interesting reading. Lucian and Tara meet while waiting in line to audition for a spot on Dom Wars, a reality TV show. They are paired during the audition process and strike a deal to help one another move on to the next round. And this is how their story starts.Soon they find themselves engaging in different activities--Tara going for the ones that will get her the most points without sacrificing the limits she set for herself and Lucian preferring to go all out to see if he can get some sort of reaction out of Tara.Personally, I didn't think these two had anything to go by relationship-wise, especially during Round One. Nevertheless, it was fun to see them trying to up one another and get on each other's nerves. In this installment we get to see how these two deal with the different situations they have to encounter and the feelings they are bringing out on each other.I wouldn't say that they shared an immediate connection, but they sure did have plenty of chemistry. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to have Round Two handy so that I could jump into it right after finishing the first one.

$review_text.: The Gift is another wonderful story from Karli Perrin. Although it was a brief story I didn't feel I was shafted when it came to character development. The banter and rapport between Blake and Imogen is on point. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions, especially the Santa and Mrs. Claus scene (you'll have to read it to find out what I'm refering to). I actually don't read many holiday stories, I don't know why but they've never really been my style but The Gift was the perfect story to get me started!Karli Perrin does a wonderful job creating character chemistry without the prototypical story-lines. Her writing style is refreshing and her characters seem to really come to life, Blake and Imogen being no exception. Additionally, despite its brevity The Gift is full of action and there is quite a climatic ending!If you're in the mood for a short, sweet, fun, and flirty holiday story The Gift will be a perfect addition to your December reading pile! (In fact, it's really good for any time of the year but 'tis the season!) Plus, everyone should have a Blake under their tree...or mistletoe.*I received an eCopy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Wes Teague is college age man whose dreams are making him feel disconnected. He doesn't feel like his world is right side up. He isn't sure why until he wakes up in a new place. It looks sort of like the city he lives in, yet it isn't.  Looking for something familiar, Wes goes to the park and the sculpture there.  It's called "The Bean".  Something is different about it though. Trying to get through the crowd to see what's happening, Wes gets a look at this "new" world.  He's not expecting any of the information he's about to get.  But is this home or is home in his dreams? It might take some time to find out.Fascinating plot and full rich characters you'll really enjoy this book.  Becca Campbell pens another wonderful book that will keep you thinking for sometime.  What if it happened to you? Is it possible?

$REVIEW.: Coming on the heels of McDonald's blockbuster hit "River of Gods", Brasyl is part cyberpunk, part historical narrative, part bladerunner, part parallel universe epic, and part introduction to a culture most Americans know nothing about. Throwing standard American/Western European scifi on it's head, McDonald sets his story in Sao Paulo, the capitol of Brazil. I don't know about you, but everything I know about Sao Paulo can be summed up with "they speak Portuguese, right?". I am a sad, sad American that I know next to zero about one of the worlds largest cities. Forget Tokyo and New York City, this future is in South America. While he overwhelms you with local slang and culture (don't worry, a lot of it is in the glossary in the back), we are introduced to three different Sao Paulos in three very different times.Sao Paulo, 1730's, father Luis Quinn is on a Jesuit mission to bring a rogue priest back into faith by whatever means necessary, before this man can burn and kill his way through the jungle. Beyond treacherous waters, dangerous animals, unpredictable natives and poisonous everything, Quinn has no idea what to expect. And the reports of gigantic angels flying over the river followed by fiery death are especially disturbing.Sao Paulo, right now.  Marcelina Hoffman produces trash reality tv shows by day, and sleeps with a highly respected news reporter by night. Always chasing the new big thing to beat the competition, she has no idea when she is in over her head. While on a wild goose-chase for the story of her life, no amount of capoeira will save her from the a fast death by a q-blade, which cuts down to the quantum level.Sao Paulo, thirty years from now. The population is higher, the stakes are higher, the technology is faster. Uncontrolled consumer garbage is a marketplace unto itself, where children mine for metals, and quantum computing crime is organized.  Enter Edson, a sometimes talent agent, sometimes petty thief, always protector of his family. Getting involved with the beautiful Fia pulls him into her dangerous world of quantum computations, digital hacking, and parallel universes. While visiting the scene of her gruesome death, Edson looks up to see Fia staring at him from across the street.What could these three story lines possibly have in common? McDonald braids them around each other, bring them together only at the knot at the end. Sure, I've read parallel universe plotlines before, but Brasyl takes it to a whole new level of weirdness. McDonald's characterization is great, the characters feel realistic, fleshed out, and for the most part, unlikeable. Marcelina and Edson seem to be drowning in their own distaste for themselves, looking for new people, new thrills, new drugs, new anything to help them run from who they are. Quinn is a quiet man with a violent past, who has found his personal salvation. The man with the strongest faith, he has the most to lose.  We get whispering and rumors of a behind-the-scenes "order", who are trying to keep knowledge from the general public. What are they hiding? It's these shadowy details that become the most fascinating part of the book, but are rarely expanded upon. Quinn, Marcelina, and Edson, they do not exist in a vacuum. the Universe and all its secrets exists around them. How much knowledge can they handle? will the truth set them free? Or imprison them further? Enjoy their stories for what they are, don't rush to the end for the action.  The enjoyment of the journey makes the unexpected and bizarre kicker even sweeter.Although alluring, Brasyl is not an easy book to read. Peppered with what's become the standard cyberpunk shock value and constant barrage of Portuguese slang and reference to indiginous religons, you've got to get through a lot of interference to hear what McDonald is trying to say. There is a line between imersion, and drowning. I'm sure the next time I read a book that culture shocks me, I'll enjoy it more. the first time is always the hardest. Perhaps it is time to for me to pick up McDonalds earlier work - River of Gods,  his view of a future India. Also a center of population whose details I am ignorant of.3 and a half out of 5 spaceshipsReviewer: Andrea Johnson for Multiverse Reviews

$REVIEW.: Jade and David are house sitting their grandparents' home in Charleston.  David is earning money for college, while Jade is trying to sell her paintings at an art festival.  Elaine, Jade's best friend, is also staying with them, and David finds another college friend, Matt, who also comes to stay at the house.Everything is going great until jewelry and clothes are either missing or moved.  While having a barbecue, hamburgers and vegetables fly suddenly all around them.  It turns out that the house is being haunted by Phoebe the ghost.Phoebe was Jade's great aunt who had a tragic life -- her death happened on her wedding day.  Phoebe gives Jade the task of finding her and her groom's wedding rings so she can rest in peace.Matt and Jade start to look for the rings but then Jade's ex-boyfriend, Kurt, shows up.  Kurt is a real piece of work and starts to stalk Jade.This was a roller coaster of a story and I enjoyed every minute.  I liked the relationship between Jade and her big brother.  During the course of the story they end the relationship they had as children and start a mature adult sibling relationship.  There isn't any blood or guts but the haunting can be quite scary when we don't know about Phoebe.  Kurt is very scary, as well, realistically so.  There is also a good romantic twist which is fun.  So this Halloween or at anytime, do yourself a favor and read LISTEN TO THE GHOST!Reviewed by:  Marta Morrison

I feel as if I am still waiting to find out what happens to Emily and Cameron. And don't even let me go there over Manny. Julie Hockley WHAT WERE U THINKING??? Please do yourself and your writing career a favor and redeem this beautiful story with a third and actual rendering edition of the true Emily and Cameron!!!

$REVIEW.: This is a fascinating series of shorts about an alien race called the Valdrott. The Valdrott use humans as lab rats, conducting experiment after experiment. This collaboration between two authors is well-written and engaging. The stories focus on the effects of the Valdrott on humans and it would be interesting to get more backstory on the Valdrott themselves. It would also be neat to see all of these tales incorporated into a novel, instead of a story series. The end of the collection states that the story of the Valdrott will be continued in future works and I'm looking forward to reading it.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to read this book because I thought it might give me some ideas about coaching others on how to organize their lives and businesses. I never even considered that I myself might be a clutterer, but the more I read STOP CLUTTER FROM STEALING YOUR LIFE by Mike Nelson, the more I came to realize there are areas even in my life where I have allowed clutter to take over.When my wife and I married 8 years ago, I had a house full of stuff, she had a house full of stuff, and now we have a two and a half car garage full of stuff. 8 years! This book has made me realize it's well past time to take action and rid our lives of some of this stuff we will never use! I also found many other useful ideas such as better organizing my own office, even finding ways to make better use of our closet space.Clutter is all around us. This book will help you get things under control again. It's the old AA mantra of first admitting you have a problem. Often things we don't even realize put our lives into a state of turmoil. For instance, after reading this book, I realized when returning home from a business trip, it takes me much longer to unpack (sometimes up to a week) than it took me to pack! Putting something like that off just disrupts our lives.There's a lot of information here. Some you will find useful, some not so much. But there is no doubt you will find something that applies to you and ways to make your life or business run smoother.

$REVIEW.: I read this book with interest from cover to cover during vacation

I suppose all the personal stuff was for local color, or whatnot
I like that Mr

Kenyon presented himself with warts and all, not making  the account look like he did all the right and/or brave things.It is interesting that in the last few pages, there are some paragraphs extremely similar to those in Echoes of a Haunting and E of a H Revisited by Clara Miller

But I suppose one can put some things in a limited variety of ways
Also, by Mr
Kenyon's account, Ms

Miller was in the house and everybody actually heard the house screaming indoors during the exorcism and not just outside, which isn't something she actually states in her book, but kind of skates over


All in all very interesting and a worthwhile read for those interested in such things.It is very unfortunate that Ms

Miller mentions in her book that she left out some of the more unbelievable or bizarre things that occurred in the Hinsdale house
I wish she would write about them.

$REVIEW.: Having listened to Larry Burkett talk about the pleasures of being debt free, and last month having achieved that goal, I have a soft spot in my heart for him. I teach a class in a state university on &quot;Apocalyptic  Fiction,&quot; and I thought &quot;Solar Flare&quot; might be a good  choice, so I bought it and read it. I was really astonished. The premise is  a good one, and it's an exciting book. I had a hard time putting it down.  The chances of a solar flare that destroys civilization are about as likely  as the chances of an asteroid doing the same, but it could happen, and it's  fascinating to speculate about the results. What astonished me, though, was  the terrible editor. Some editors edit, but these days many just arrange  publication. Burkett got one of the latter sort this time. The problem is  not spelling and punctuation, but deeper. Burkett should have caught these  mistakes, so we should blame him, too, but barring that his editor should  have caught them. Examples? In chapter one, the hero, Jason Hobart, is an  assistant professor. Then in chapter two he is an associate professor, then  back to assistant, then back to associate. There are paragraphs of dialogue  or explanation used almost verbatim in two or more chapters, as if Burkett  wrote the chapters a week or two apart and never went back to tie things  together and forgot what he had already written. A gang from Indianapolis  decides to raid a refugee camp in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, about 500  miles away, and makes the trip in twelve hours--by horse and buggy. A truck  caravan is planned to take Prof. Hobart and staff from Andrews Air Force  Base in Maryland to New Holland, Pennsylvania, in Amish country, two hours  away, traveling by freeway because it's safer. They plan to take I-95 to  I-83 to I-78. Fortunately instead they turn onto highway 30 to Lancaster,  because you can't get there from here. And it takes them eight hours, much  to long. Most of the people in the cities are exacuated to the country,  supposedly, and placed in relocation camps of about 25,000 people. But  there are only three camps within a 500 mile radius of Washington, even  though this includes massive areas of great farm land in Virginia, North  Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, etc. Burkett says that  the little towns of Pennsylvania are mostly deserted. This seems unlikely,  as they would provide plenty of shelter and tools and food (ever heard of  grain elevators and corn cribs and feed stores?) and most houses are  usually within a couple blocks of good garden plots. Is this a Christian  novel? It's not about the return of Christ, and Christianity isn't  mentioned until about 3/4th of the way through. When it is, suddenly most  of the refugee camp &quot;accepts Christ as their personal savior,&quot;  then everything is fine. As someone with an undergraduate degree in  Journalism, I realize that a lot of news people will lie and cheat and  manipulate in any way necessary for a story, and many are terribly biased  and have their own agenda. However, the picture of the news media portrayed  by Burkett is unrealistically dark. Even if they didn't like the president,  surely if there were the chance of a massive solar flare destroying all  electrical motors and downing all planes in the air, all the news media  would cover this in detail, rather than insisting that it won't happen,  simply because they crave bad news, and this is terrible news. Look at what  they've done with Y2K! So, read this novel only if you can put up with this  sort of problem. If you like world catastrophe novels, this is nowhere near  as well-written as Stephen King's &quot;The Stand,&quot; but it's pretty  cool.

$review_text.: Professor Flew is a wise man

 I say this as a Catholic Theist (and he is no friend of Catholics, though he does respect them in their search for the truth)

 In this books Professor Flew presents his arguements against the existence (and even coherence) of the Monotheistic (read: "God of Abraham") deity.Flew's biggest fault is that he is a radical empiricist (at least when he was writing the book), which is a poor place to start as it eventually turns on itself
 However he does raise still a number of salient points which the average theist should know how to answer.The average theist and/or upper level philosophy undergrads, may have a tough time reading and taking Professor Flew's meaning
 The biggest qualm I have with the book is that it is a difficult read


 Flew tends to digress, and then digress in his digresson, and 15 pages will have gone by before you get to what the chapter was supposed to deal with


 His sentence structure is also a bit difficult at times to understand

 That's not to say it's un-readable at all
 Just that the average reader will need to understand that this book will need to be read and re-read most likely to fully take his meaning.

The use of Jewish words for names or things, within the text, has not been a distraction. It reads as it most likely was written originally. Highly recommend having this version. Compare the two and you will find that when it comes to reading the Bible, you will pick up the Jewish New Testament first.

As she learns to love God even more, and looks forward to the birth of her child, she also learns to open her heart to love a man again. It's a very peaceful story with a strong message of forgiveness and hope.

Patton
 While we know him for his military prowess in leading US troops in WW2, his contributions to the US military and personal accomplishments outside of warfare were astounding


 His life and lore--the scandalous as well as the sincere--are portrayed fabulously in this quick-moving epic of Gen


Patton's life.Though famously controversial with reported character flaws as big as the moon, this true account of Patton's genius, work-ethic and amazing stories of cunning will command the reader's respect

 American history would never be the same without this man's drive to conquer!

$review_text.: Voluntary deprivation and expensive, complicated meals have never really been a thing for me, which I suppose is the biggest reason all the diets I try end up ultimately failing


Reading &#34;Mediterranean Diet for Weight Loss: The Inexpensive and Easy Recipes I Used to Lose Over 100 Pounds in 7 Months&#34; was eye-opening in a way that showed me that not all diets have to be a miserable experience

Karen Carter's journey is an amazing one


Her life long struggle with her weight and seeing how sticking to the Mediterranean Diet dramatically turned things around for her is certainly one way to convince a man to try something new! All the recipes she includes in the last chapter sound delicious! (Can't wait for my wife and I to try out the Beef and Potato Stew!) Highly recommend for anyone looking to try something new.

 I would have given four stars but the book needs a good edit - wrong word usage, wrong use of apostrophes, all repeatedly

 While the writing is good, the story moves a bit to slowly at times but it is interesting, funny at times if one likes antiques, collectibles, estate sales, auctions, etc


 It kept me interested despite the lack of editing.

$review_text.: Journalist Virginia &#34;Ginny&#34; Bruce Hunnicutt just had her dream job ripped out from underneath of her in spectacular scandal.  Back home in Cottonwood Cove, Alabama to lick her wounds, her mother wrangles her into helping her save her family's newspaper by uncovering the secret the new football coach is hiding.  However, the closer Ginny gets to him (and the truth) the more reservations she has about whether she is doing the right thing.This story is written in a style that is more common in Women's Lit and less common in main stream romance.  It is written entirely in the first person, and only tells the story from the prospective of the heroine (leaving the reader no insight into the thoughts of the hero).That being said, the story was well crafted and emotionally engaging.  It did seem to run a bit fast, but humorous hi-jinx the heroine finds herself in with her sisters keeps the story from feeling pointless during the rushed parts.  While some elements seemed highly repetitive at the beginning, the story evened out and improved greatly at the end.Overall, I liked the premise behind this story and am glad I stuck with it to the very satisfying end.

I loved almost every line that came out of his mouth

He just oozed hotness

Ryan I adored as well he was just a little more reserved, being this was his first time dealing with feelings for a man


I loved his struggles and how he dealt with them, which made me love him even more
Now usually here I'll put what i didn't like about the book, but there really isn't anything for me that I didn't like

What was really up with Nyeem, infatuation at it's worst on a demented mind! Not to mention they were related whether he wanted to look at it that way of not. Blue was just as crazy and Nyeem. Poor Amber didn't have a chance in hell if Mak hadn't came along. As much as I love Kalil, I also love Kaeden (two for the price of one). I didn't see the book ending the way that it did and it actually had me in tears. Great job LaShanta!

It's about two friends, your typical gorgeous, needs to be center of attention friend and the average looking friend who gets stuck alone when it comes to finding love.This story not only made me laugh with the humor, but at times I found my blushing when Jane would blush. It was a quick read and wish it was a bit longer, but I found it quite enjoyable and I am looking forward to reading the other short stories by Lisa Scott.[...]

$review_text.: Silent Echo: A Siren&#8217;s Tale is quite an interesting read


You meet a likeable character named Portia


She appears to be an ordinary teenager in that she&#8217;s dealing with being shy, insecure, wanting badly to fit in and is angry at her parents
Portia though is dealing with more than most teens as she has no voice


Thankfully she has made friends but that&#8217;s where it gets complicated for her, when she has a crush on a new guy, a friend decides that maybe he has feelings for her as well


So things seem like normal teenage stuff but as you read this story there is this underlying, intriguing thread of something dark lurking there.Right at the beginning you&#8217;re introduced to some birds acting rather oddly, so it makes you wonder what&#8217;s going on
Slowly things start to unfold and you get this crossover of ancient legend with current day life


Strange things start to happen and Portia&#8217;s world changes drastically

Some bad things occur that Portia wants to stop only it seems that she might be the problem

She learns a truth about herself that shocks her but explains a lot about what is going on
Now she has to figure out how to take control of it or ancient forces will use her gift and her for their quest for revenge.I liked Portia, I wanted her to get her voice, to get the cute new boy, to keep her current friends but there are a lot of things working against her

She&#8217;s a really caring, likeable person that even when she&#8217;s doing some not so nice stuff, you really want her to figure a way out of it.It&#8217;s a good read that has an interesting mix of reality, fantasy and of the past and present


I like how the author brought Greek Mythology into this and used ancient mythology to blend with today for the rebirth of new life


It&#8217;s definitely worth reading


I was given a copy as part of a book tour.

His story was so full of heartbreak from the beginning that you just wanted to surround him with love and understanding.  Thankfully Duane was there to help him and provided him with exactly what he needed.  Though Duane wasn't without his own need for comfort and Arie came around at the perfect time.  Giving these two a happily ever after was just the icing on the cake.As always with Mr. Grey's writing, he delivered a believable couple and a wonderful story full of beautiful friends and family.  I hope there will be many more books in this series.  I can't recommend this book enough, but to get the full experience it should be read in order with the rest of the series.

It's one of the rare cookbooks that includes several fish casseroles that are NOT the same old tuna type dishes!  They actually use many other ingredients such as crab!  Loads of chicken recipes too.. and different!  I never would have thought to include some of the cheeses that they use.

$review_text.: Ms. Haskin begins this story by stating that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can come about after one has experienced or witnessed life-threatening events like war, natural disasters, terrorist incidents, or violent personal assaults.The author provides a vivid and emotional account of her experiences after the plane hit Tower One at the World Trade Center. She explains that she was frozen with fear and could not understand what was happening. She was one of the last ones to leave her office area because she could not grasp the gravity of the situation.She then entered the stairway and descended thirty-six floors. She describes how crowded it was as they went down the stairs. She was disoriented and was just pushed along as the crowd slowly made there way to the bottom floor.She tells how more people were entering the stairway from each floor.  On one floor, the door was opened and she could see a man who was decapitated. People were yelling, cussing and crying in desperation as they made their way to freedom. She tells of the putrid smoke that was burning her eyes and making breathing difficult. When she finally exited the building, she saw many people jumping from the upper floors.The author sought guidance and strength from her Christian faith. The text contains Scripture that complements the text. She is truly convinced that the Lord was with her and led her to safety on that horrific day.Leslie Haskin has provided a very detailed description of her experiences on 9/11. She is very good at expressing her emotions and providing details that some authors might overlook. I think one of the most poignant moments of her experience was when she witnessed a man and woman holding hands and jumping from a window to their deaths.Some people will object to the author's frequent references to the Bible. I think the verses that she chose to highlight her experiences were very appropriate. She is a woman of faith and she gladly gives all the glory to Jesus Christ.

But Robert is 32 years old and, even if the first encounter is a steamy sex session, he thinks that a boy so young can't stay long in a relationship. But if they want to take a change, maybe this will be the best love of their life.Sam, Sammy, is a wonderful character: a wild cat in bed and a tender puppy outside. He absolutely loves sex, more and often. Without problems and strings attached. But Robert is something else. He can't be only a one night stands.Robert is the type of man I like best: a huge man outside with a sweet inside; he wants commitment, he wants love forever...On fire is a sexy romance filled with funny moments.

To me, the book reads more like a tourist guide. There is not really enough information or tables of comparison, to use the book as a guide to select a new hometown from. Still, it does highlight a lot of places to look at, that one would otherwise have by-passed. From that point of view, maybe it will make a contribution to the economies of the artist communities presented. I think we need a similar resource for Australia.

I don't know how you couldn't love her. The only thing her life was missing is the right man with whom to share it. Her main struggle was learning to open up her heart to Nate. I enjoyed watching as he broke down her walls and she fell in love with him. He brought out another side of her that made me love her even more.Nate was hot as hell with his assertive, powerful, and yet tender demeanor. His protectiveness and desire to make Jules happy had me swooning all over the place. I loved how he didn't care what anyone thought of him or their relationship, and how he was committed to making her his. One of the best things about Nate was that he had no desire to change Jules. He loved her as she was and supported her fully.This was a hot yet very sweet read. There was just the right amount of angst, heat, and romance. Plus there was a whole lot of chocolate cheesecake. :) I absolutely loved Jules and Nate together, not to mention that I think the whole Montgomery family is awesome.

$review_text.: I loved how real this story felt. It wasn't the most dramatic or emotional or suspenseful, but sometimes it is just so comforting to read a book that is just enjoyable for being what it is. Carmyn (who in my head was Camryn until about halfway in - I don't know why) had a rough few years that get rougher when she finds her almost-fiance to be cheating on her. Dallas has always watched Carmyn from afar, and isn't going to let her newly single-status stay that way for long. I expected more angst from how it all began, but I was not expecting the incredibly sweet courtship from "bad boy" Dallas that we got. It was so refreshing to read, and I look forward to Denton's story next.

$review_text.: This book was fine.I am not sure if I read the same book as the other readers: but then again, I'm not 17 years old so I'm a little more discriminating.The writing seemed a littler elementary, especially at the beginning.What confused me the most was WHY the main character was such a jerk -- He loved her so much he was a bully??????He publically humiliates her, tells her he wouldn't be sorry if she was dead - all in the name of LOVE?That's the single dumbest thing I've ever heard. Come up with a better reason for crying out loud.I'd also like to know -- Why is this behavior ROMANTIC??? If someone treated you like crap for a year, tormented and bullied you, would YOU fall in love with them??? I just found it all very hard to believe - We want to create strong young woman, not perpetuate romanticism in a weak "hero"

Sometimes loves comes when you least expect it and some times may feel its in the wrong package but if its good for your soul, it will last. Try this story to keep you believing in it. This lawyer was not ready for this sexy bachelor who was all the spice she needed. It was great to see how this relationship caused them both to become better people. Sometimes family can not have all you need for the long haul.Keep them coming Ms. Diamond...Are you finished with the Detroit family? Would love to see more of them.

$REVIEW.: After reading The Priest's Graveyard, I was glad to hear this story was going to have resolution.  But this one was a little disappointing.In PG, we get the story of Danny and Renee, two souls who meet in the strangest circumstance, but the book was very enjoyable.  While I'm glad there is resolution to the story, it wasn't believable.  Many of the confrontations in this weren't believable either.  And Danny seemed a little too "superhero-y" to me.  And Renee was ANNOYING in this book.  VERY annoying.It was ok, but not my favorite of his.

$REVIEW.: This product is a means of enabling a traveler to learn Italian phrases and expressions to smooth out difficulties he may encounter in a country where he doesn't know the language.  The DVD is formatted in ten sections and two reviews.  The phrases to be learned are spoken and appear in both English and Italian on the screen.  There is a logical progression to the lessons.  The beginning is greetings, for example.  (Prego means you're welcome.)  Special topics are covered at the end of each lesson.  The disc, and specific sections of it, may be run over and over again until mastery kicks in.  A U Print guide and audio appendix with additional vocabulary words are included.  It is excellent.

$review_text.: this was one of the first books i purchased on my kindle. i was so drawn to Dawns story, i could not put it down. the heartbreaking true account of her young life really struck a cord with me. written from her heart, Dawn does a very good job of walking the reader through her childhood and consequent teen and young adult years, in a world where many people would never otherwise know about. i felt compassion for this child while reading her experiences, and yet felt triumph for her at the same time, knowing she came through it all to become a strong, compassionate human being. this book will capture your attention for the topic- for some reason we are drawn toward unbelievable stories- but it will keep you reading it; rooting for Dawn and wishing only for nothing but redemption, love and happiness for her. it's refreshing to see someone not only come back from such dismal and oftentimes dangerous situations, but to flourish as well as use her life to helping others. this is what life is all about, and Dawn does it so well- she should be very proud of herself. this is one of those rare stories that you will never forget. i know i never will.

$review_text.: The author was very generous to share this book for free. The recipes using the slow cooker gave me a few ideas how to adapt my own recipes.  Because recipes in this book use almond flour, they can be classed gluten free, and that's great.  But the paleo diet leans heavily on protein, and protein generally has fat with it, unless it's plant-based.  Honey is used fairly heavily as a sweetener, and honey is not a low calorie sweetener, even if it is natural.This cookbook doesn't work well for me because I can't tolerate caffein, gluten, soy, beans, tomato, dairy, egg, red meat (including dark meat chicken or turkey), coconut in any form, cruciferous (cabbage family) vegetables, onions, garlic, or honey.  If you're wondering, 'Geez!  What can you have?!' The answer is, water, white meat chicken, white meat turkey, lower fat (no more than 5 grams per serving/meal) fish, broiled scallops and steamed shrimp, rice, potatoes, lower fiber vegetables in small doses and small quantities of some fruits--not including apples or applesauce, unfortunately.  I've lost 30 lbs. in 8 months and am now officially underweight, without even trying. Now I have to work to keep my weight up. If you want to lose weight, you're welcome to try that 'diet.'  I hope you like herbal tea.I did not give this book low marks because it doesn't work for me. I gave it low marks because it does suggest that those with weight and digestive problems can solve their problems with the paleo diet.  I believe the promises offered are not realistic.  The paleo diet can cause clogged arteries, and should be undertaken with great caution, if at all.  These recipes tend to be high fat as well as high protein.

I wanted to smack Keira in book one, thought she was a witch, and I still want to smack her. As she said herself, "I don't have a nice bone in my body." Only this time she has ammunition and support from Mom Donovan, Mom Whitley, et.al. When you read chapter 5 you'll see the ammunition she has to take Rainey down....makes you want to puke! Worthless people. DM introduces a new character, Roxie Reynolds, who sees through Keira and is "an alternative reality version of Keira" like two peas in a pod working together. Oh, remember hunky Evan, the man who slept with everyone, what an about face for him! A good quick read, fun, steamy sex, a good ending for Rainey, Aaron, Evan and Keira.  The only other thing I have to say is humph, what's wrong with JC Penney's...I shop there once and awhile!.

$REVIEW.: There are a few good psychology tricks in here related to motivation and enjoying food rather than treating it like an enemy, but those insights are overshadowed by lack of depth and constantly trying to sell the author's other services as a weight loss coach.  If you don't mind paying to read a long advertisement, go for it. Otherwise don't waste your time.Edited to add: due to comments on my review, I am suspicious that positive reviews are from friends, acquaintances, and social media followers of the author, rather than from objective readers.

$review_text.: Well, I recently purchased the book "Guranteed Success" and overall it was a good read that provides a basic foundation in business entrepenuership. Nevertheless, the only drawback to the book as it personally relates to me is the religious overtones. I'm pretty sure that God belief isn't a requirement to be successful in Home Based business enterprises. Madalyn Murray O'Hair, North America most famous Atheist, started her business empire from scratch and build the worlds most famous Atheist organization (i.e. American Atheist). She stood her ground against mandatory Bible recitation and school prayer against all attempts to discredit her and her family; yet, she would win a judgement at the Supreme Court level that removed Bible rituals from public schooling. Her organization today brings in a total revenue of no less than $500,000 dollars. In any case, what it all boils down to in business is finances and marketing. What does your financial statement look like? How will you market your product? These are very important questions any aspiring entrepenur would want to ask himself. The book "Guaranteed Success" could of made a more important impact or message to its audience if it also talked about business plan development and generating business ideas!

$review_text.: This is the only book you need if you want to keep a few chickens in your yard.Flipping through a lot of the other highly-rated chicken books, it quickly became clear that most of them are oriented toward large-scale chicken keeping. Sure, some have added token acknowledgement that some people keep chickens as pets that happen to lay eggs, but the tone and the information are suited toward people who don't plan to name their chickens or tell stories about their antics. They're low on details about how tall a fence should be to keep the chickens from ravaging your vegetable garden, and discredit methods like clipping wings because it's just not viable if you have 200 birds.If you want to experience the joy of cracking open an egg still warm from the chicken, of knowing exactly what the chicken ate and how it was cared for, of knowing that the only carbon footprint involved in your breakfast was your trip down to the feed store every few months, this is the book for you. If you have no plans whatsoever of eating your chicken just because it stopped laying 7 eggs a week, this is the book for you. If you want a practical guide for housing chickens in a small urban back yard, heck, this book even has detailed plans for building a simple but safe coop and run. It even has a neat breakdown of how much time you will need to set aside for caring for your birds (five minutes in the morning to feed and collect eggs and let the birds out, five minutes in the evening to feed and collect eggs, and lock the door of the coop, 20 minutes once a week to add more bedding, and so on) so you have some idea of what time commitment you're actually making.

$REVIEW.: Embracing the Gray is basically an auto-biography of Mark Hollingsworth in a unique story format.  It was an enjoyable and fairly smooth read.  Mark does a great job bringing you into his unique stories that range from the serious (brother's life and death, father facing death, etc.) to the humorous (stuck on a plane with a baby that will not stop crying and two unique seat mates) and everything in between.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter where he pondered the essence of eternity.If you are looking for some great stories that read fairly easily, I would reccommend Embracing the Gray.

$REVIEW.: Let your imagination run wild with The LEGO Adventure book: Cars, Castles, Dinosaurs & More! This is a big, impressive book that every Lego lover is going to want to get their hands on. All 200 pages are filled with large, glossy, colorful photographs to inspire and amaze.The first chapter shows you, step by step, how to set up a home base. The LEGO avatar, Megs, says she's calling it the idea lab. Then it's on to the LEGO town. Here Megs meets Craig, the aircraft parts manager. He shows Megs (and the reader) how to build a San Francisco-style cable car, coffee shop, zoo buggy, bridge, two-story house, and garage. The house could be a bakery or store instead--it's all up to you.Once the garage is done, you're ready for hot rods and cool rides. These are impressive vehicles, complete with exposed engines to show off your craftsmanship.Do you prefer flying? You won't be disappointed as Jon demonstrates how to construct the Skywolf, Gryphon, Scarlet Fury, Viper, Skyhammer, and Steel Wind. Jon offers a good building tip: "Make sure that your minifigure can fit into the cockpit before you build too much of your place!"Throughout the book, helpful building tips guide the LEGO builder. For example, in the chapter showing how to build the action figure Counterbalance, the tip says, "Of course, your mecha doesn't have to have two identical arms. How about adding a rocket pod or a power sword instead?"Each chapter is designed by a different avatar, which are representations of the actual LEGO enthusiast from an international community.This book has something for everyone. If you prefer medieval, there's a whole village, complete with hilltop tower, castle, market, woodsman's cottage, and even a stagecoach.There's so much more, but you get my drift. Everything from a train to a thinking tower is here. Your creativity is guaranteed to be bumped up with the abundance of ideas. Whether you're new to LEGO building or an experienced engineer, you'll be delighted. Both my husband and our grandson loved this book. I suggest picking up at least two: one for yourself and one to give as a gift.

$review_text.: First I want to say how beautiful the cover is because its absolutely breath taking! The story inside is just as amazing
I started this book and was determined to finish it before went to bed, but my eyes wouldn't work with me

They insisted on closing before I was ready for them to and getting hit in the face with my Kindle Fire got old


This book was so much more than I thought it was going to be
I saw all the good reviews and recs to get the book and was like well what the hell? I mean everyone has different taste in books but the cover and synopsis pulled me so I bought it
SO GLAD I DID.We are introduced to Karis, love the name by the way so unique, when she's being banished to Earth from her world


Why is she being banished? Well you're going to have to read to find that out


She is stranded on this deserted island that has a curse placed on it
A curse that ensures her captivity but also from anyone coming to the island

Talk about harsh right? Destined to spend all of eternity on a deserted island with no one to talk to? I think I'll pass

That is until a storm sends a plan crashing through the barrier and going up in flames on her island


Knowing the curse would kill whoever made it through, she decided to take the chance and make sure.Brady is an underground fighter who just happened to crash on Karis's island and for some reason he made it

Well with the help of Karis' healing powers that is

Confused and angry that he is now stuck on the island, Brady has some mood swings

It's not until he sees what happens when boats get close to the island that he starts believing Karis' story about being stuck there
Then there's this strange attraction he has towards Karis


Of course she's beautiful but there's something more and he can't quite put his finger on.Karis and Brady's lives become intertwined when they learn that Brady is more than he seems and they were destined to meet
Can they both wrap there head around that information? The most important question is what's going in Karis' home and can she save her people? Being a princess comes at a price and when everyone is out to get you, who do you trust? Brady vows to stay by her side and protect her but can he? Can Karis save her people from what her worlds become? And who exactly is Brady?Ageless Sea will have you at the edge of your seat dying to find out what's going to happen next


M.R

Polish wrote one damn good story


She captured and held my attention from start to finish and I seriously need the next book in this series


She takes a spin on Greek Mythology, which only furthers my love for this book because I love Greek Mythology
You'll have to read to see what I'm talking about! Brady, oh Brady how I love you! I usually use quotes in my reviews, so I'll leave you one and of course its from Brady's mouth."No, you keep it
I've got everything I need right here."Not what you were expecting right? Usually I pick a romantic quote, but this one, this quote right here speaks loads about his feelings about Karis
When you read the book you'll see exactly what I'm talking about


So go buy this BOOK now!

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a cute fish book for a little girl to remember her trip to the aquarium.  I picked this up and read it in the bookstore.  I was shocked at this book, why is explained below, and I strongly suggest that you carefully consider the book's message.  Please keep in mind that I did not come into this book with any preconceived ideas and I did not read a single review prior to reading the book.  But after one reading, I realized this is not a book about sharing but about discrimination, conformity, bullying, self-mutilation, etc.  I am sure the author did not intend this, but let me explain to you why this is the message of the book.Summary of the book:The rainbow fish was born with a natural gift of beautiful sparkly scales (note its a genetic trait the same as blue eyes or blond hair). Because of how beautiful she was, the other fish discriminated against and mocked her (note they were not punished for that bullying).  The rainbow fish therefore could not make friends and was terribly lonely.  So the only way to make friends was to rip off all but one of her beautiful scales and give them away to those who had persecuted her (self-mutilation).  Only when she bribed others by giving them things, could she have friends and be happy with herself.  Seriously that is the story in this book but written in more colorful words with pretty pictures.So what this book actually teaches are the following:1. You should be ashamed of your natural beauty, talents, giftings, etc. and others have the right to hate you and discriminate against you for them.2. In order to make friends you have to destroy yourself or bribe them because having friends and not being lonely are the only things that can possibly make you happy in life.3. No one can get along unless everyone is exactly the same and has exactly the same things.All of this is totally the opposite message we should be giving to our children!  Diversity in talents, skin color, hair types, abilities, giftings, etc. is what makes our society INTERESTING and children should never mock others because of those differences and no child should feel ashamed for being smart or beautiful or athletic.  They should use those talents to serve others and work together as a team.Therefore find another book to read to your kid that actually deals with sharing.

$review_text.: I bought this light to replace a broken book light


My husband cannot sleep with the light on and I like to read before bed
WOW! This light is bright! It is as bright as my bedside lamp


It lights my entire side of the bedroom.I actually try to push the light into the book pages to try to dampen the light

I cannot imagine using this light on a train or airplane
I think it is too bright to read around others
I would be worried to annoy people around me on public transportation.Pros:-this will certainly light a book!-it is certainly a travel light

it is small and lightweight-the bendable arm is very flexible-comes with a battery so it is ready to go out of the box-book clips easily onto book and does not tear cover or pagesCons:-too bright!-the battery pack is quite large
it folds open my hardcover book
I can't imagine using this on a softcover book


I occasionally tuck it under my pillow with the light sticking out so I don't have to connect it to my book.-does not come with multiple light settings

That would be ideal to deal with the brightness of the light.

$review_text.: Unsurprisingly, many of those who devise new exploits for SherlockHolmes like to imagine him visiting their own corner of the world

JohnS Fitzpatrick was perhaps inspired by the success of Larry Millett, whohad already brought Holmes and Watson to Minnesota in five books
Atany rate, in Sherlock Holmes: The Montana Chronicles Mr Fitzpatrickbrings the duo to `Rodgersburg' (a lightly disguised Anaconda, Montana)after the events of Mr Millett's novel Sherlock Holmes and the IcePalace Murders

The four stories are ingenious and engagingly told,though the style is not Dr Watson's
Mr Fitzpatrick justifies theAmericanisms by the fact that the text is `edited' by an American, but for the British reader that's perhaps stretching credibility rather far


At all events, Sherlock Holmes: The Montana Chronicles is great fun to read, not least as an introduction to life in Montana a century ago.-Review written by Roger Johnson, Editor of "The District Messenger", the Newsletter of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, Oct

$review_text.: You will not learn anything new here. The "league of five extraordinary gentlemen" were not armed with secret powers, they did not forge clandestine agreements, they uncovered no great, diplomatic nor military secrets. The marvel of "Rendezvous with Destiny" is that it examines a reality that has become lost to view, in the aftermath of the Allies' success in World War II.In the dark days after France surrendered and while Britain stood alone against the blitz, the U-Boat and imminent invasion, Roosevelt did not know if Britain was worth the candle. Roosevelt was convinced that the United States must ultimately confront the Nazis militarily. He also knew that he needed to bring the American people to that same realization very slowly and carefully. His dilemma was both stark and frightening, and now almost forgotten. For every plane, tank and gun put on a ship, bound for England, for every merchantmen and warship consigned to Britain, there would be one less in the US arsenal. These were the days before the transformation of the US into the arsenal of democracy. If Britain lost, every pound of war material sent to Britain was a pound lost to the Nazi juggernaut. These five men were chosen to help answer a most fundamental question; could Britain survive? Each in his own way, through first-hand observation and discussion with British leaders and citizens, returned to assure Roosevelt that the best way to confront the Nazis was to aid Britain.

$review_text.: David is a weightlifter and soon finds himself using his skills in an unexpected way to try and save his supposedly cheating wife.It's hard to really peg this story as it starts out as an all action thriller, deftly switching between different timeframes to layer a tightly packed story


It then slightly switches to something more supernatural, these elements only add to the story and in no way detract from the fast pacing which is break neck speed in some parts.There were a couple of things that didn't quite work for me, such as the repetition of themes
I got what the author was trying to do but for me it could have been more subtle and still worked well

Also I thought that the characters reaction to the supposed cheating was a bit far fetched as there didn't seem to be any evidence that his wife was involved with anyone else.These are two minor quibbles and perhaps I'm being too harsh as there is a lot to like about this read


The ending was fantastic and I especially enjoyed the history of the mask.Overall a great read that I would readily recommend.

$review_text.: Adrienne Giordano has done it again! The sixth book in The Protector Series, Opposing Forces is a fantastic read !Adrienne Giordano is a very gifted writer. Not only does she write a thrilling romantic suspense, a steamy hot romance, she creates memorable characters with loads of personality. Her characters and dialogue are creative, snarky, smart mouthed, and sensual. Her plots are creative and keep the reader sitting on the edge of their seats. Add the former character's from Taylor Security Agency to the mix and you are in for high octane read.Opposing Forces is Jackson Lynx and Jillian Murdoch's story. Jackson is still in his one year recovery program for addiction to perscription drugs. He has a plan and goal. He cannot let anything get in his way to his one year anniversary mark. That means getting rid of the stress in his life , celibacy,and any temptation. He is almost there....six more days....until Jillian Murdoch approaches him for help. She is a temptation.....Jillian Murdoch works for a pharmaceutical distributing company. Her job is to keep track of all deliveries and distribution. When an unscheduled delivery shows up on a Friday night she becomes suspicous. After witnessing this delivery frightening things start happening. Her home is broken into while she is asleep and her camera is stolen. She has been locked out of the company's computer network, moved to an isolated office, and basically shut out of her job. She is determined to find the answers. She approaches Jackson Lynx for help. And Jackson being the good guy with the boy scout complex agrees to help. What has Jillian got herself into...one super sexy hot guy, hot guy who has an addiction problem, dangerous job, scary boss, and life threats. As the danger escalates so does the chemistry between her and Jackson. Can she deal with both? Can she deal with Jackson and his addictions? Can Jackson meet his one year anniversary and be free? Can he do it without breaking his celibacy? Can Jillian accept all that he is, good and bad. Can they catch the bad guys so that Jillian can make that choice?

$review_text.: The Royal Navy's attack on the Dardanelles, with the associated Gallipoli land campaign is well know as Churchill's worse idea in WWI. However, Mr. van der Vat makes it clear that Churchill had a great deal of help in bringing about this diaster.The author does a workmanlike job of explaining why the British wanted to attack the Dardanelles, albeit with far too much emphasis on history, going all the way back to the immediate post-Trafalgar period. The conflicting ego trips among the senior political and military leaders are well presented, and explain why such an important military operation was conducted in such a poor manner. Everybody involved seemed to be making up the plan as they went along. It was very clear that the Royal Navy was in the grip of senior admirals who had not a clue as to operational and tactical realities after so many years of peace. The descriptions of the actual fighting are reasonably well done, but often confusing. Since I had only a cursory knowledge of this campaign, this book was useful to me, but I had to work very hard to get around some of Mr. van der Vat's obtuse prose.The reader is "treated" to an extensive analysis of the post-war history of the region. While this may be somewhat intersting, it seems out of place in this book about a particular military operation.The author seems allergic to charts, seldom including such in his books.  This book, which covers a complex naval/ground operation occuring over months, has not one single chart or map. This is beyond the pale for any naval or military history. I also am uninterested in Mr. van der Vat's political opinions which consume the final chapter of the book.Overall, this book has the feel of something cranked out to meet a contract, rather than to enlighten the reader. Too much of it is recycled from previous works and the physical quality of the book is below par.

$review_text.: Although this book was written in the 1980's, it is, in my opinion, even more relevant today.  Stan Weinstein wrote this book during the greatest bull markets in history, where almost any stock one touched would eventually have gone up.  Fast forward to today and the Dow has gone nowhere not just for a year or two, but for 12 years!  A stagnant stock market combined with zero percent interest rates have made, for most people, wealth accumulation difficult.There is another way, however, that does not involve buy and hope, but a systematic, objective technique that empirically works in bull and bear markets.  In a nutshell, Weinstein discusses a trend following methodology that holds on to winners in bull markets, while cutting losses short and short selling stocks in bear markets.  The author outlines the importance of price and volume, which contain everything that you need to know, while forgetting about news flashes, P/E ratios, or other superfluous bits of information.The book is geared somewhat for beginners, but I think even the most experienced traders will find value in this book.  Written in a clear, simple and humorous way, this book belongs in every trader's library.->Danny Merkel->Charting Trends Blog

The writing seemed disjointed, a trifle clich&eacute;, and like the author was searching for something and missing the mark just by a nose


But, I was interested enough to continue reading


That was when I decided her style of writing and the way the book was paced was possibly more like a new dance or song that did not quite match previously learned rhythms


Once you got into the "groove" reading the book was more enjoyable.I agree with a few other reviewers that "Death" was unnecessary for the book to have been a good story with a decent plotline
I think I understand his presence, however

I would not say that this character makes the book a "supernatural" mystery, though
It seems that Death is there more to act as a tool through which to help view the main character's past and to help vet her flaws.The story makes me think of the old "Hitchhiker" or "Twilight Zone" shows, with the exception that the main character is the same in each mystery.There are areas which stretch believability more than the usual

300 sit up for a morning exercise routine? Really? And she happens to also be deadly via martial arts..
Well, perhaps how she got that way will be revealed over the course of the series, which might help the reader sympathize with the character more.The book really does improve as you read it
I have not decided if it is the reader's ability to adapt, or that the author improves, or a bit of both


However, I am definitely interested in what happens next and am going to read the next in the series.All in all..

ENJOY!

$review_text.: Jack and Graham have known each other pretty much their entire life. Graham is her brother's best friend and she has had a crush on him since she was six when he kissed her. No childhood sweethearts here though because according to legend, Hollingsworth men will recognise their true love at first touch. Which obviously wasn't Jack.Because of that legend these two have been pining after each other for ages, knowing they are not meant to be. Which is very hard when you have such strong feelings the other person. Seriously the tension between these two has been building up for years.Besides the whole love or no love drama, there is the bakery. Jack and Graham founded it a couple of years ago. With his talents for cupcakes and Jack's talent for sensing what people want, they hoped for success. So far business has not been as it should and the suicidal oven is not helping either. Needing to take it to the next level, Jack's prayers get answered in the form of her sister Harper returning home. Being an artist she can decorate the cupcakes like no one else's business. If only these two sisters got better along.So we have Harper hiding stuff from her siblings, Graham getting tired of fighting his feelings for Jack and Jack wanting to succeed in her business. Lots and lots of drama going on. Let's not forget there is also Hutton, he's Jack and Harper's older brother. That man is way too involved in the lives of his sisters. Apparently he has a knack of scaring away men, including Graham. That poor guy has been in love with Jack for nearly twenty years, but that stupid legend and an ass kicking from Hutton has stopped him from going after the woman he wants.That excuse of the legend got tired pretty fast by the way. Graham never wanted to even try, because if it wouldn't work out, he would lose Jack. So he rather has her as a friend than not have her in his life. There was also this part where Graham doesn't remember his first touch with Jack. A couple of times he almost remembers, in the end nothing is done with the memory. I would think when finally something happened between them he would remember and she would be the one.I liked the fantasy element, but it wasn't worked out well enough to hold any value in the story. In the end the legend seems to be void and Jack's sensing ability just seems like she can smell what people want. Which comes in handy in a cupcake shop, but outside of that concept it wasn't made very clear how far the ability went.The ending didn't really feel like an ending, because the build up towards it was lacking. There is this whole race in town, which Graham is participating in and they are providing the cupcakes for the event. I was thinking he would win the race and everyone loved their cupcakes, the end or something. But it gets cut off before that, almost in the middle of a scene, so that felt a bit weird for me.Love and cupcakes is a sweet and clean novel, with very interesting characters and that small town feel. Jack and Graham, everyone, including themselves were just waiting for them to take a chance. Fun drama and delicious cupcakes all around. I am very interested in Harper's story as it seems she has a more intense personality and well Susan left that storyline wide open.*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review*

I read a sample of the first one and didn't go any further


I read the sample of this one and snapped it up


I really loved this book
It has some elements of the most popular books added in the plot, but it was kept in it's own league


I loved LEO and I liked SAM


I mean look at the cover of this book, look at that guy! The author does a great job of nailing his character to his appearance
I will probably go back and read the first three books after loving this one so much


Sorry, no spoilers in my review

Many are from those who left the church under disgrace, and many are from outright opponents to the church. Some of what one may read here is true and with thorough investigation can be made clear and understandable. That is not the intention here. With outright deception and malice, this book is meant to confuse and scare one away from the church. If one is interested in the truth, then go straight to the source and find out for yourself.

$REVIEW.: The Artful, by Will Stanton, is an amazing piece of work.  From the beginning the author distinguishes himself through exceptional voice and style.  While the dystopian setting impacts the flavor, the characters are the real gem.  Gritty and honest, it feels exactly like real teens dealing with the most appalling and impossible of circumstances.  I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: no matter what the consequences to herself.  Diane Wilson, author of this stunning, shocking (even to those of us that thought we knew all about the sins of the corporate giants) and gut-wrenching book, tells it like it is, in her own Texas-grown language as everything she does and says is done from a deeply instinctive, passionate nature.  She tries to analyze why she is a natural environmental activist (going on many years now) and has endured many a Texas jail (read about the horrors done to women in them and try not to get mad - roiling mad!), and boils it all down to her Cherokee granddad who, like rejected and persecuted indigenous people all over the earth, viewed life on our planet as inter-related and one.  We are the earth's stewards, but modern man has strayed far from that belief.  We have now become the earth's destroyers.I couldn't put this book down as I read about her surprise confrontations with Dick Cheney; Warren Anderson (ex-CEO of Union Carbide for whom an Indian arrest warrant is still outstanding over the tragedy at Bhopal, yet protected by our government), who she tracks down in the Hamptons;  Tony Hayward, former CEO of BP (we all know who he is); and she even travels to Taiwan to pay an unwanted public visit to the Wang family dynasty about perhaps the most horrific crimes related in the book:  Formosa Plastic's imperviousness to the health, and even the lives, of their employees.Raw and gutsy, this story is about as authentic as Twain's Huckleberry Finn.  It wasn't born in literary circles or writing workshops in Connecticut.  Does Diane Wilson, for all her courage and derring-do, actually accomplish anything?  Does she change the corporate mentality?  The indifference of the U.S. government?  Affecting officials in Texas seems to be a lost cause.  Well, what other ways are there to try and save the earth and the lives of people who are unfortunate enough to have to work in knee-deep pollution?We have the large pro-environment organizations trying their best, I guess.  Once in a while they make a dent in the giant bucket.  There is another book newly released which confronts environmental problems from a different angle:  It's calledWild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justiceand it's written by a South Africa-based environmental attorney, Cormac Cullinan.  I haven't really gotten into it yet, but he promulgates the transforming of the corrupt systems (government and industrial) to promote a new (but old) relationship with our earth.But I wonder:  Is there really an answer, or does sheer and unimaginable destruction lie ahead?

$review_text.: "All Things Austria" aims to be a comprehensive travel guide to the country of Austria, paying particular attention to landmarks in Salzburg and Vienna


Personal reflections and snippets of helpful information season an easy to read guide
For a basic overview, it's helpful

For serious travellers, the book comes up short on unique experiences.The travel guide has some serious shortcomings for any tourist planning a stay in the lovely central European country
"All Things Austria" never strays away from paths heavily beaten by visitors to savour secret delights and local favourites or hotspots
When I go to a place, I want to see it how the residents do, not just as a random American or British or Australian tourist trudging between overrun points


Similarly, I look for a healthy balance of famous monuments and diamonds in the rough when assessing a guidebook.Some of the highlights -- Schoenbrunn Palace, a UNESCO heritage site -- are expected no matter the guide, but the rest of the Vienna chapter reads like a cookie cutter list of top 10 "to dos" that shows up on almost every website or travel guide
That leaves something to be desired.The writing style is friendly, informal, and almost a little too casual
No wading through dense patches of text lifted from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica here! The charm is in the author's passion and interest in Austria, and the anecdotes that filter through

However, some good editing would improve the book's professional feel greatly


In places I feel like I'm reading compiled blog or web articles stuck together.Most of the sections are complemented by bright photographs, maps, and illustrations


I'm not sure the graphic choices best suit the material

I would have liked more detailed shots -- as a tourist, I use photos to orient myself to unfamiliar locations

Salzburg's charm or Innsbruck's beautiful architecture deserve higher resolution photos.This is a quick read and an easy introduction into Austrian culture, geography, and landmarks


As a primer to a country you might not know about, it's a fine little resource, but not so helpful on planning my two week vacation through the country

I would like more content, better photographs, and deeper personal suggestions or recommendations from someone who knows and loves the place.

$review_text.: Occasionally, during the journey in this life something comes across your path that simply takes your breath away. It may be a perfectly formed flower, an amazing sunset, a passage of words, or perhaps a composition of music. All of these things leave you with a feeling of complete awe of the creator of such beautiful things.I've recently discovered a book that has left me with such a feeling and in fact I'm only now, getting my breath back! The book I'm referring to is called In Praise of the Needlewoman Embroiderers, Knitters, Lacemakers and Weavers in art.This book is the result of a thesis researched and written by Gail Sirna. This publication contains a compilation of beautiful paintings of needlewomen, by artists such as Vermeer, Renoir, Picasso, Monet, Gauguin, Cezanne, Van Gogh and Cassat. These paintings span from the times of the old masters, through the Impressionist and Pre-Raphaelites period right into the twentieth centurySince time memorial, women from all walks of life have taken needle in hand either for the most utilitarian of needs or simply for the pleasure of creating something of artistic beauty. Artists over the centuries have endeavored to capture the concentration and serenity of the needlewoman whilst she stitches, or have tried to portray the necessities of needlework in ordinary day to day life, present the world over.The author of this sumptuous publication Gail Carolyn Sirna, has had an interest in needlework for over 30 years. It was through her passion for needlework that led her to the art that portrayed her Favourite pastime. Gail enrolled in the honors program at the National Academy of Needle Arts. In Praise of the Needlewoman evolved from Gail's' honors research for this program. Gail writes, "For peasant and princess, cave dweller, and career woman, needlework has been a most gratifying endeavor for the human being, especially womenI have my Favourite paintings in this book. I especially love the painting titled "The Sick Child" which was painted by J.Bond Francisco. Whilst the mother is busy with her hands, sitting at the bedside, the painter captures her anxiety for her seriously ill child who lays unmoving in the bed. I also enjoy looking at some of the lesser known works by both well known artists and totally unknown artists. Gail Sirna completes this publication with interesting information and expert comments relating to each individual paintingThe intellectual capacity of the writing is a pleasure to encounter, just as each painting is a treat of its own.

$REVIEW.: Romance, intrigue, heart-thumping action and more are in Thompson's debut, The Mistaken.  Although it started out a bit slow, I know it was to set the tone of the book - characters, plot, location and etc.  However, I do think over four hundred pages was a bit extreme.  That said, I loved this book.Thompson has a knack for character building.  Tyler, Nick, Jillian and the mob all leapt to life from the pages. They are complex, modern and authentic to relate to.  The story unfolded at a steady pace but I wanted to know what was going to happen next so many times, that I really struggled putting the book down.How far would you go to satisfy your need for revenge? This is Tyler's story and so much more.  Mistaken identity changes his life in more ways then one and I look forward to reading what Thompson writes next.  Great romantic suspense!

$REVIEW.: Will Peterson and three other high school friends travel with their pastor to Central America to rebuild a school. Their experience was typical of any mission trip, until the hour before they are scheduled to leave. While waiting at the cantina for their pilot, the revolution that had been boiling in the country engulfs them into a life or death adventure.Klavan writes an exciting story. Klavan is a great storyteller and will not disappoint his fans.  Although there is interaction between the characters, the strength of this novel is the fast-moving plot. The story is told in the first person through Will. Will lives through many perilous episodes and Klavan reveals how someone might act in the face of death.  The character of Nicki aggravated me at times with her whinny behavior and her description as being a beautiful young woman. I did enjoy this book and found it hard to put down even with the little bit of criticism about the character of Nicki.  I would recommend this to readers who enjoy fast action paced stories. I look forward to the next Young Adult book that Klavan will write.

This is the 2nd book of the Laid Bear series


I really liked reading this book and would recommend this read to anyone.This book is about Max and Bethany who are trying to deal with a baby on the way, running a were-bear & human matchmaking site and the conflicts that happen in their relationship but it also deals with Jess and Veronica and their budding romance.Both of these couples in the book deal with just about the same problems and there is a flow between the characters through out the book

There are not just every day problems but also with the conflicts between them and people who do not like the were-bears to mix with humans


The emotions that are in the book feel real in today's world so you feel like you are fighting along side of them for what is right.The length of the book could have been a little longer but other then that it is a good read.I would suggest this book to an paranormal romance reader who like the BBW elements in the story line
There is suspense, the ups and downs of romance, action through out this book.

Rarely are both blended so well as they are in this book


The main character Maria, a nurse takes us into her mind as we follow her into a how to realm of sensual pleasures

She gives us a platform of understanding that we don't have to explain but we simply understand.Pleasure is  Control

While you can read it as a stand alone, you really will miss a lot of backstory if you don't read the previous books. That being said, this is one of the strongest books in the series. As I said on a previous review, with each new book the author really gets better and better, and this book really shows that with both characters and world building.I'll admit I wasn't overly excited hearing that Leopold was the next to get his story in this series. I was seriously hoping for Dimitri to be next, but I'll completely admit when I'm wrong. I was SO Wrong.. Leopold's story was awesome! The author really picked a perfect mate for him in Laryssa. While she was trying to hide who and what she was from him, she was still strong and mostly confident of herself. The minor lack of confidence in herself made her more approachable as a character.Leopold is one suave, yet utterly Alpha ancient vampire. He knows what he wants, sees it, takes it, and damn the consequences for he most part. Yet having Laryssa and baby Ava in his life change everything for him. You literally see the hardass persona melt away the more he's around and the more he comes to care for Laryssa. He really wants to be what she needs and wants and he completely changes himself for her.Through this story Leopold and Laryssa became one of my favorite couples in this series. However, I am very excited for what happens in the next book if what I'm supposing is going to happen from the last bit of this one. I seriously recommend picking this book up and this series if you haven't yet tried it. ~Reviewed by ChrisThis review is the property of Chris and not be shared or copied unless by the Publisher or Author or unless credit is given.
$review_summary.: Surprisingly I ended up loving Leopold, especially with Laryssa

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the first two stories in this series and was looking forward to reading this story as well. It took a while to get into the story because most of it happens as flashbacks to previous times (20 and 2 years in the past) interspersed with happenings over just a few days in the present. You also had to have knowledge of the previous books for this to make the most sense. But I did enjoy the story.
$SUMMARY.: The story continues

$REVIEW.: I received a complimentary ebook, via Evatopia, in exchange for an honest and unscripted review.The creative and beautiful cover for this novel is an exemplary example of what lies underneath.I was immediately taken by the sweet and nave heroine, as I was much like the young woman in my youth.  After her true nature is tested, Caitlyn is given an unusual gift that jolts her face-first into reality.  We all hide our true selves at some point, be it to spare feelings, or simply to protect our own.  While Caitlyn was aware of how many times she had done this in the past, she had never considered someone hiding a dark agenda behind the faade.  Being a pure soul, she soon finds herself unable to ignore her new talent, and follows her heart.  Of course, the young tend to forget their mortality, which means danger is never too far behind.This is an extraordinary YA novel with a wonderfully unique concept!  It's always a treat to discover a fresh story line with a superb cast of characters.  The slight touch of romance is sweet and fitting, considering our hero and heroine, and beautifully written.  Full of suspense, comedy, and the paranormal to boot, I highly recommend this novel to all YA fans!  I cannot wait to read more from this splendid author!

$review_text.: I am sorry I caved and bought the second book in this series.  This book lacks everything, story, characters that you can relate to, and heart.  The author forgot that women read these books for the connection between the main characters.  Yes we enjoy the sex, but we are looking for a story that gives us the connection of the heart.  It's the why this is called a romance novel not mindless sex novel.

So I knew loving his book was not going to be a problem

But I had no freaking clue how much I would love him by the end of this book
Emily, however, is another story


She made me a little mad at first as she seemed to only think in terms of how Clay wasn't 't the right type of guy


All the while, he &#34; Mr Right&#34; was off being very very wrong


In the end I liked her and think it was a great ending


 Loved this book and as always with Jade's characters I 'm hoping we see more

Would love to see Emily & Clay a few years down the road, and definitely some more Brian.

$REVIEW.: From the very beginning, Rosa's life was anything from easy. She lived in one of the Woodlands eight enclosed circular cities where in order to be left alone by the Superiors, you had to conform to everything they told you to do, or suffer the deadly consequences. Rosa always has a hard time since her thinking and ideas were radical. She experiences everything from abandonment, hurt, loss, fear, all mixed together with love.Author, Lauren Taylor, creates a story world in which the harsh reality of Rosa's world is highlighted to the extent that the reader could feel for everything she goes through.I'll admit that at some points I couldn't help but tear up. Taylor takes the reader on an emotional journey throughout the book.I will highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a great read which will keep them up until nearly three in the morning finishing it, like it did for me!Now, just can't wait for the sequel! That cliffhanger was something!>I was given a free copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review&lt;

$REVIEW.: This story begins 100 years after a pandemic kills approximately 80% of the world's population and 50 years (two-and-a-half generations) after the government of what used to be most of the United States instituted the Life First mandate.  To insure the survival of what little populace remained, the government required that all persons be DNA type-matched and a GPS chip with alarm nanos be placed in all persons. The idea was that if a person became ill or had an accident, the most likely donor of blood, tissue cells or an organ could be quickly located and a transplant made, insuring that the stricken lived as long a possible.However, participation was not voluntary. If a person did not wish to comply with the mandatory "donation," he or she was declared a sociopath, imprisoned and was eventually "terminated" when someone genetically compatible needed a heart, a liver, a double lung or a double kidney transplant. Several "free states" had been formed prior to the enactment of Life First, namely Peoria (the original state of Florida), but now a person had to get there first and the GPS nanos made that virtually impossible.Using this viewpoint of a dystopian society, we follow Kelsey Reed, the daughter of a prominent Senator, who has been "matched" and must give up a kidney. Her mother had died and her best friend had been maimed in botched up situations and Kelsey decides to flee. And, as the reader can expect, she gets caught. Game on.This was the most psychologically terrifying novel that I have ever tried to read. With the current threat of bio-terror in our world and increasing government interference in our medical choices, the premise of this novel strikes more than uncomfortably close to home. This is the debate of "pro-choice" versus "right to life" taken to an all-new level. The idea that such a concept as Life First could actually become law after a terrorist attack feels actually more like a probability than a possibility.And the reason it feels so strongly that way is due to the author's writing skill. Not only are the mechanics of the writing top-notch (grammar, punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, editing), the structure of the story flows logically. This may be a dystopian situation but the author creates a reality that cannot be denied and there is no deus ex machina to miraculously save the day.However, that incredible skill to create a terrifying reality quickly became a negative in this reader's experience. There is not one page in this novel that contains a breath of fresh air or even a momentary chance to breath any air. There is not one genuine smile or even a small hint of laughter until the last 10 paragraphs of the book. Page after page, the terror builds with no relief.And page-by-page, the storyline caused my indignation, my anger and my distress to build. Even knowing that this was "just a story," I couldn't control my stress. I tried stopping every few chapters to rest my brain, but that didn't work either. Then I took to scan-reading, then reading just the first and last pages of each chapter only. But even that provided no psychological relief.I read prodigiously, especially mystery/thrillers from the likes of Child, Baldacci, Flynn, de Mille and Kellerman. I am used to graphic violence and terror, both in books and in my past career. But, in this instance, there was just too much tension and anger and stress written into every page.I am not a young person and, most times I know when to pace myself or just out-right stop doing something that is hurting me. And this was one of those times. I stopped.This is one of the very few books that I have not been able to read cover to cover, word for word. It is the author's excellent skill in developing her premise that initiated that action but it is also the author's choice to pace the conflict without even momentary relief that made the final decision for me.I received a copy of this novel through the Goodreads Giveaway program. That fact did not, in any way, influence my opinion of the book.

$REVIEW.: With my daughter experiencing some body changes, I purchased this set to read with her.  The book does not speak down to girls, but helps explain the changes their body is going through or will go through.  It also brings up questions that other girls have about their own bodies, putting my own daughter at ease - that she's not alone and that what she is going through is normal.  The pictures are age appropriate as well.The Feelings Book also came in this set, along with the Feelings Journal.  Great books!  My daughter is learning how to express herself through words, which leads her to a more positive expression of her emotions without all the tears and anger, etc.  The book gives insight to what feelings are, how to express them in different ways, how to talk about one's feelings, etc.  My daughter really enjoys the journal that goes along with the book.

Now these aren't your typical zombie/vampire/monster/creatures. Brant brings to life a new breed of fear. His Vladdies are fierce, disgusting, and down right spine chilling. Join Lance and Cass as they make their way out of the city and into the mountains, running from the monsters in the night and the men who are just as evil. With a fast moving plot and good action scenes, this book is a fast read. For all you monster and apocalypse enthusiasts, you should read this novel. It's the first in the series, so be prepared to keep going. Thank you, Jason Brant, for this fun ride

I kept thinking, especially during the last third of the novel, how Laird Barron did this kind of stuff so much better.  But I'm willing to concede that it's likely just first-novel problems, as there's nothing shoddy in its construction and I will be interested in reading whatever comes next in the trilogy.

 I see alot of books that say &#34;quick knitting&#34;and I dont know about others but nothing for me with knitting is &#34;quick&#34; and I am an avid knitter for sixteen years now so I did not order this book thinking anything about it was going to be very fast per say.secondly the only slight complaint or thing to know is while these patterns are beautiful looking, I noticed alot of them do not offer different sizes which is a bummer
 Some of the random patterns have two sizes but I am used to books that offer each pattern in the book in at least four different sizes
 now some knitters could probably adjust the size on their own but I rarily have luck with trying to experiment with such things.would I buy it again? yes.

$REVIEW.: On 1 September 1944, a B-24J, tail number 42-73453, from the 307th Bombardment Group &#34;Long Rangers&#34; was shot down over the Pacific island of Palau. Although the plane was observed to catch fire, eventually explode into large pieces and fall to the sea near the island, the fate of the crew remained unknown for over 60 years. This wonderful book chronicles the efforts of Pat Scannon, M.D., PhD., to find this missing plane and its crew: from his discovery of a B-24 wing during a vacation trip to Palau in 1993 until the final under water excavation efforts in 2008. His dogged determination, becoming an obsession after mutiple trips to Palau over many years, relates his ability to evolve his thinking, organizational skills and motives as he tries to solve this mystery. He puts togther a disparate team of local Palauans, adventurers, archeologists, navy divers and a host of others who finally find enough physical and archiveal evidence to point the team to the main wreckage of the aircraft after years of searching in the wrong area. The final efforts in 2008, directed by the Joint MIA/POW Accounting Command, using the data compiled by Scannon and his Bent Prop Project, successfully recovered the remains of all 8 crew members who fell with the plane. Scannon's team was also able to definitively determine through archives of the 1947 War Crimes Trials for the Japanese who committed their executions the fates of the 3 crewmen who successfully parachuted from the doomed plane. Throughout his long search Dr. Scannon tracked down families and loved ones of the missing and the author has seamlessly woven their stories into the larger narrative, making the text very intimate and human as they wait on his searches which are prolonged by many challenges. This book is a magnificent compilation of history, heroism, love, angst and a long held sense of loss. In the end most of the big questions are answered for all involved, yet some smaller pieces of the puzzle remain to  be revealed; including the discovery of the burial place and recovery of remains of the three executed airmen, for which an active search is underway. This book is highly recommended to all those who served or had family who served in World War II, and also will make enlightened reading for all who enjoy riveting stories well  told.

$review_text.: I picked this up a few days after I finished Pierced. This novella lends a bit more back story to the events that lead up to what happens in Pierced. Escaped is a dual story, with the narrator, Oscar, telling how he aided Pierce and Mia's escape and the story of his love, Sarah. I liked this story a lot. The duality between the two plot lines was interesting to me. Oscar would recall something between him, Reyes and Sarah and it would be reflected in the present time actions of Pierce's and Mia's escape. It was really great to see how Oscar builds trust and friendship with Reyes, and how heavily both Oscar and the girls depend on him.Escaped is well written, fast paced and rich in details. It gives more history, and more insight into what's going on, and why Pierce and Mia are so determined to escape from Dorian. Oscar is a great narrator, and a good protagonist who only wants to have the people around him safe. Be it two people younger than him, one who he's madly in love with-two people that Oscar is willing to protect from their own father, or two younger girls, one who is so much more than she seems. He's a strong character, and one that I enjoyed reading about. His final actions and request and the end of this novella made me tear up. Despite the length of this, I really felt a connection with Oscar. I would like to know more about Reyes especially since he's so much of a ghost character in Pierced.Though the events in Pierced take place after Escaped, read Pierced first. Escaped will spoil one of the massive plot points in Pierced. The novella doesn't rehash the events that Pierce mentions when she's talking about her and Mia's escape. Escaped is a story in and of itself and one worth reading. Pierced for me has a larger pull, but Escaped is still a wild ride, and something that lingers in my head.
$SUMMARY.: Great story!

$review_text.: Kallypso Masters is just amazing! Wish I could come up with a better, more descriptive word, but I don't think there's one that has been discovered!The Rescue Me Series is one of the best you will ever read.Each time a new story comes out to join the previous ones, I set about re-reading from the beginning to get my mind and heart ready to discover more about these remarkable characters, and this time was no different!Learning about Master Marc and his insecurities just made me love him even more. I've read some other reviews and posts about how people were angry with Marc and his treatment of his &#34;Angel&#34;, but to me, the revelations in this book only proved that his love and determination to make a life with Angelina is the heart and soul of the man under all the debris. His willingness to undergo the &#34;interrogation&#34; shows his devotion.I absolutely LOVED this chapter in the lives of the Masters. Marc and Angelina are all the stronger in their relationship - the road to get them to this point was full of boulders and pitfalls, but they came through their journey as 2 pieces of a magnificent whole partnership.Congratulations Kally - your true gift of bringing life to these wonderful characters is astonishing and we are all blessed that you allow us to share in their lives. Thank you!

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.To be honest, I was a bit apprehensive about reading Tamed by Rebecca Zanetti. I adore her Sin Brothers series but was very disappointed with her Maverick Montana series so I truly didn&#8217;t know what to expect from Tamed.I was pleasantly surprised though. It was obvious from the very first pages that Zanetti took the time to built a plausible world for her characters to live and fight in yet didn&#8217;t bore me with endless descriptions of said places and characters. As book 6.5 in the Dark Protectors series, it was a little difficult for me to catch up with the different races and their histories and to learn and remember the connections between previous characters and the current ones. However that didn&#8217;t take away from my enjoyment of the story.While Tamed is a novella, it still gave me that whole novel feel and showed me why Caleb Donovan is called the Realm Rebel. He may have a Prophet mark on him but at heart he&#8217;s all warrior. Brash and most of the time, hot headed, Caleb could easily overwhelm any other character who has scenes with him. He&#8217;s an alpha male yet he isn&#8217;t overbearing or manipulative to the point where he becomes unlikable. He has a soft spot for those who can&#8217;t protect themselves.I really liked the heroine, Lily being in a position of power among the races in the story, but what made me like Lily even more was the fact that even though certain obligations came with being a Prophet, she had a difficult time acting like a Prophet. Sometimes she just wanted to punch someone in the nose, usually the same someone but still, it was nice to see a heroine who wasn&#8217;t always graceful, poised with an endless supply of patience.Tamed is a fast paced novella with an interesting premise. Rebecca Zanetti did a great job creating a paranormal world that is quite different to what I&#8217;ve read before and she managed to get me excited about past books as well as the next book in the series. If the previous books are as good as Tamed then I&#8217;m going to have to buy them as soon as I can.

I feel like the story line showed more real life. No matter what a person does they have to over come problems and no one is perfect but these two are perfect for each other. The sense of family is strong and the loyalty is strong no matter what. Great read. I cannot wait for the rest of the series!!!!!

$REVIEW.: This isn&#8217;t going to be a long review. I just wanted to put in my two cents (or is that pennies?). All-in-all I actually thought this was a well-written book. It wasn&#8217;t too complicated and I absolutely adored Dominic&#8217;s naughtiness. The chemistry was off the charts hot. Add in the Mafia style action and it is now one of my favourite books. In fact, I have already read it twice.Yes, Bronagh does a lot of smacking and punching. Yes, most of the characters do cuss a lot and I won&#8217;t say it was cool all the time but, I honestly think L.A. Casey was kind of going for that. I think it added to the conflict and chemistry between Dominic and Bronagh. Plus, maybe the Irish ARE that blunt and it&#8217;s a cultural thing? That said a warning is CLEARLY there in the excerpt. Reviewers complaining about the violence and cussing only have themselves to blame. I&#8217;m sorry but, it&#8217;s true.My one question- when is the next one coming out? ;)

I understand that she wanted the whole family in this Christmas special but it just seemed jumpy to me.  It felt as if I had just gotten reacquainted with a particular brother and then they were having sex again.

Quentin & Sophie were so easy to love and their chemistry was so hot I thought my Kindle would start smoking

This book is different from your usual historical romance because Sophie isn't a debutante she is a 41 yr old spinster

Everything was going great and then as the saying goes..Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned..I was not happy with this woman's actions

However I was happy with Quentin and the way he dealt with it all

$REVIEW.: Personality Poker is a great book that carries the universal message: People bring different things to the table.  The book cleverly breaks the tasks of high performance into four different factors: Defining the problem, solving it, planning/executing it, and evangelizing it.  The truth is, everyone on your team will identify with one or more of these themes, but probably not all four.  Your job, as a manager, is to figure out how to align people's strengths and passions with the tasks you need to solve the critical business problem.Personality Poker: The Playing Card Tool for Driving High-Performance Teamwork and Innovationlets people play a simple game to determine where their abilities are.  There are certainly no surprises in the game, just about everyone I played it with determined that they did actually get the results that they expected.  But once we tried to match up where we decided their strengths and interests were with the actual work they were doing, we realized that we need to make some significant changes.The idea of including a card game in a management book is an innovative one, and it's a great tool to get people to open up, and learn some things about themselves.  If you are a manager, executive or even a small business owner, this game will teach you a lot.  I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I pick up books for the strangest reasons sometimes. In this case I saw Rae Davies comment on my blog and I clicked her link and found out she was a mystery author. The cutesy cover of her first book in this series, Loose Screw, got me interested, but it was the first class mystery that kept me hooked until I clicked the last page on my Kindle.Lucy Matthews is a crime reporter turned antiques dealer, who one day stumbles across a body. When her ex-boss asks her to follow up the murder for a story she reluctantly agrees and ends up knee-deep in a murder investigation.This was a really fun mystery. I could completely relate to Lucy in her love for her pets and the way they boss her around. I live in a family of two cats and one hamster and even the hamster knows I'm a pushover.The mystery felt well plotted out and I really enjoyed the combination of Lucy and Detective Blake. I sure hope there is more romance between the two of them in later books in the series.All in all a good read, and I plan to read the next book to see what adventure is in store for Lucy Matthews next.

His brother Davy is a cop and his other brothers Andy and Micheal all live in Philly.Quinn served time for forgery. He's one hell of an artist and can forge any art. He served three years.Quinn is also a very good boxer. A talent that serves him well. He can't carry a gun because of his ex-con status but he can sure as hell use his fists.Most of the family, with the exception of Davy, have forgiven Quinn for his transgression. Davy will take a little longer as he's a cop.Quinn now works as an insurance investigator for PMI and the case he is asked to investigate is the theft of a painting worth ten million dollars.So begins one damned fine read.This one has Liam, his Father, a bunch of retired cops, the current Philly PD., a mob boss, a few old friends, a young sociopath, Liams gal pal Nora, the owner of the robbed gallery, a talented artist, Alicia who runs the gallery, the robbery of an armored car, a guy named Pat Delaney, his wife, murder, attempted murder  and one hell of a good story.Five Stars all the way.

$review_text.: The NASB Giant-Print reference Bible is designed to be easily read by older readers and the visually impaired. This Bible features large, clear text and is bound in a variety of quality materials. If you are searching for an economical giant-print edition, this Bible is an excellent choice.About the Binding & CoverThe edition featured in this review is bound in Leathertex, an artificial leather that is flexible and durable. Leathertex is thought to be as durable as bonded leather, though it has not been on the market long enough to know for sure. This edition is also available in bonded leather, hard back, and genuine leather. The binding is sewn for added durability. Size: 10.2 x 7.5 x 2 inchesWhat's inside?The text size of this edition is 14 pt, an excellent text size for those needing a giant print edition. The layout of this Bible is double column format, red-letter edition, with subject headings. Features of this edition include: translation notes, a detailed Dictionary/Concordance, 13,000 end-of-paragraph cross references, 8 full color maps, pages for family record/ family tree and located in the back are Introductions to the books of the Bible. This edition has one burgundy ribbon marker and the pages are gilt in gold, which looks elegant with the burgundy cover.In the Front1. Presentation Page2. Family Records3. Forward to the NASB4. Abbreviations and Special Markings5. Table of Weights, Measures, and Coins6. Books of the Bible in Canonical Order7. Books of the Bible in Alphabetical OrderIn the Back1. Dictionary/Concordance2. Introduction to the books of the Bible3. 8 full color mapsAbout this TranslationThe translation used in this edition is the Updated New American Standard Version. The New American Standard Bible (NASB) is a revision of the 1911 American Standard Version. The American Standard Version is a reversion of the King James Version. Many view the New American Standard Bible as one of the most literal translations of the 20th-century. Since its completion in 1971, the New American Standard Bible has been widely embraced by many as "the most literally accurate English translation" from the original languages. In 1995, the Lockman Foundation reissued the NASB text as the NASB Updated Edition (or more often known, the Updated NASB or NASB95). Since then, it has become known simply as the "NASB" and has replaced the 1971 text in most current printings (although the Thompson Chain Reference Bibles, the Open Bibles, and the Key Word Study Bibles use the 1977 text for their NASB editions).My Personal Opinion:The quality of this Bible is excellent for an economical edition; the binding is sturdier than many other giant-print editions, and the text is a large, clear size making this edition easier to read. To test the readability of this edition I asked my friends and family for feedback. My mother found this edition to be very readable and a pleasure to use.

Suddenly Aimee is leading a war, ok but one minute we read she is a monster and is running away then she is asleep and wakes up and all her men want her to lead.  We think Greta bit her but are not sure.  Jade is a fairy, nice touch but it all comes out of nowhere and without any real character development.  Honestly if the wrong name was used for one of them we wouldn't be any wiser because they all sprout the same thing at some stage. Are you kidding me?How can an imaginative idea get so out of hand?  Was there an editor to help sequence and cut out all the unnecessary dialogue that is so banal that it becomes laughable?  Truly I do not understand how something with so much promise can be thrown away for the sake of getting it published.  Get it sorted then publish!  What a disappointing book!

$REVIEW.: Satori wants his ex-girlfriend, Star, back
 Star just wants to be left alone by him, as she is tired of all his talk about magic and his self serving ways


 Since he dabbles in magic, he decides to preform a rite to get her back


 Unfortunately, he unleashes Lilith, a demon whose main goal is death and destruction.As Satori tries to figure out how to send Lilith back, Lilith sets out after Star.As the story unfolds, and Satori realizes what his actions have caused, he starts to change from a self-centered boy into a hero concerned with the welfare of Star.Lilith uses her essence to start a relationship with Star and corrupts her

 I was actually amazed at how well-written the erotic scenes were

 They were even dotted through the story at appropriate places.Not being Goth, I did find myself a bit lost in all the talk about the music at the club
 I was also a bit confused by the comments, by both Satori and Lilith, that Star was special, as I saw nothing but a Goth girlThe story is very interesting and unique


The ending did create a desire to find out what happens next!!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book. I'm a sucker for cowboys so I wish there was a little more of that but really enjoyed. I love Abby's character I thought she was cool. I liked Chase too but not as much. I really didn't like that Chase kept pushing Abby away saying "I'm not the right man for you" it didn't make sense to me and it wasn't explained why he was doing it either. I really loved the supernatural spin in the book though I thought was really well done. All in all it was a good book with minor grammatical errors here and there but I still really enjoyed it and look forward to more by this author.

$review_text.: A Perfect Moment is a fun and sweet read with a little suspense. After reading the prologue I knew I was going to enjoy this book.The book starts off with Ella getting her heart broken when she thought she was going to have her perfect moment. Fast forward 5 years and Ella is attending her best friend Jo's wedding. When Ella finds herself in a awkward situation she seeks out the perfect person to help solve this problem, Preston.Preston is Jo's younger brother who has been in love with Ella for what seems like forever. He has patiently been playing the role of a great friend to Ella and has been waiting for the perfect moment to make his move. Everyone but Ella knows how he feels about her and he is tired of being looked at as Jo's baby brother in Ella's eyes.When Ella comes to Preston looking for away to get rid of the creep hitting on her Preston poses as her boyfriend and unexpectedly kisses her. This hot kiss changes everything. Preston decides it is time to make his move and finally have the woman he has longed for. Ella is confused by how she felt about the kiss and isn't sure if she should have these feelings or even start something with Jo's baby brother.Ella's past has left her feeling insecure about relationships, she wants Preston but is afraid of getting hurt again. Preston also has some issues in his past, but Ella was always there to help him get through it. As Ella and Preston try and sort out their feelings and relationship a surprising twist stirs up some drama.I really enjoyed reading A Perfect Moment and I believe it is a fantastic debut novel. It has some seriously funny parts that had me giggling like crazy. Throughout the entire story I was hoping Ella and Preston would get their HEA, so I was very happy with the ending. Preston is one hot, sexy fireman, so you know you can't go wrong with that. Jo is an awesome best friend and I can't wait to read her and Liam's story.

$REVIEW.: These three stories are gems, each in its own way, and calling the opening story, "The Second Marriage of Albert Li Wu" a masterpiece is no exaggeration. It put me in mind of Isaac Bashevis Singer's quirky magic, but with different geography. I also mean the term gem, as distinct from gemstone, to convey the fine and careful polishing evident in all three.Zoe Keithley writes clearly, evocatively and with great truth. Her time and scene transitions are smooth, her dialogue realistic and her settings fully alive, no matter that they vary from a busy street corner, to the dining room of a senior facility, and to a widowed man's ghost-filled apartment. One wishes, at the end, for a fourth story and a fifth, but 3/Chicago is a slim volume that proves yet again, good things indeed come in small packages.

$REVIEW.: I picked this book up because of it's "Epic Rock Star Novel" reviews and I have to say... Yes, Mrs. Jade Jamison - you wrote an "Epic Rock Star Novel"! Don't be mistaken this book is a rock star story but it is so much more; a story of mistakes, consequences, maturity, relationships, friendships, and promises made. You are treated to the past and present story of Valerie over a several year time span where you will grow to love her, hate her, and sometime just want to reach into the book and shake her! Every time I thought I had this story figured out, I was wrong. Don't miss out on this roller coaster ride where you will laugh, get pissed, need to fan yourself (this is a rock star book after all), have "awwww" moments, re-read paragraphs to make sure you hadn't read it wrong because all you will be able to think is "did that just happen?", and finally end the ride with a few tears falling.Jade Jamision, From the "Bottom of My Heart" THANK YOU for taking out your "trunk novel" and sharing this epic story.

what? This was one of them

It was a bit confusing and I don't think I ever got a clear picture of what happened in the past, why they live where they live, why she is in charge....

there are just so many questions but I don't care enough to continue reading the series
I tried to give it a chance but the story never really caught my attention
Someone might enjoy it but if you are over the age of 17 and enjoy reading then this one is most likely not for you.

The characters remain consistent while still developing, the plot didn't get to advance very far but this seemed mostly due to the need to set all the various subplots spinning (and there seems to be a lot of potential with those subplots for the next book) but the GREAT advancement is that this book has an ending!  Book 1 just ended midscene, so it was great to not have that jarring halt with this one, and I take this as a great omen as I look forward to the next in the series.

$REVIEW.: *I was given a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review*This book started kind of slow for me at first, but as I kept reading I found myself thinking of the the book and getting excited for when I could read it some more. The characters are well developed and this book just makes you want to keep coming back for more.It begins in present day, which at first threw me off since I thought, &#34;hey isn't this a fantasy book?&#34; Once the characters go through the portals though, the fantasy world begins and the roller coaster ride continues!I also enjoyed how this book was written. They writing style fit the story nicely. There was just enough dialog to keep you going and enough description to paint the picture in your mind, but not overwhelm you. I never found myself skipping over some parts just to get to &#34;the good part.&#34; It was all good!While I think teens and middle grade readers would very much enjoy this book, I, a almost 30 yr old woman, thoroughly enjoyed this book as well. It's a great tale and totally worth reading!

$REVIEW.: Three years ago, I wrote that "Humble Orthodoxy," the final chapter of Joshua Harris' bookDug Down Deep: Building Your Life on Truths That Last, was worth the price of the book all by itself. Evidently, I wasn't alone in thinking so!By popular demand, Harris has finally expanded and expounded the contents of that great chapter into its own book, and I'm so glad he did! Humility is sadly lacking in modern discourse, particularly in the realm of theological convictions. While the abundance of attention being given by evangelical authors to getting our doctrine right is a good thing, far less attention has been given to how we ought to contend for the faith.Does God care about the attitude with which we stand for truth? Of course he does! Yet, as Harris points out, "orthodoxy has gotten a bad reputation." We Christians are not exactly known for our compassion and humility when it comes to defending our beliefs.Something has to give. As Harris argues, that something is our pride. We need to stop seeking the approval of men, and start living for the only approval that matters---God's. When we understand that our deeds merit nothing but damnation, and that God's approval is based solely on the obedience of Christ, we cannot be arrogant. This is the heart of true orthodoxy, and it can only be realized in true humility.We don't have to choose between humility and orthodoxy. We need both, and, in fact, each leads to the other. Humble orthodoxy changes the way we relate to others. Instead of puffing ourselves up through comparisons with those we see as more sinful, we should see God's grace as something to be extended to others. Harris writes, "Instead of looking down on the unorthodox, how can we NOT want to humbly lead them toward the same life-giving truth that has changed our lives?"This book is tiny---its 61 pages weighing in at under five ounces---but exhibits an incredible economy of words. Nearly every sentence is worthy of highlighting... no filler material here! Throughout its four chapters, Harris gives examples from Scripture of men who exhibited humble orthodoxy, and shows readers how to develop this godly character in our own lives.There is quite a bit of overlap with the last chapter of Dug Down Deep, but there is easily enough new material to make this book stand on its own merits, even if you have read the "Humble Orthodoxy" chapter that led to it. Its small size and easy readability means this book lends itself to many repeat readings, something I'll be certain to take advantage of whenever I need a good dose of conviction about my pride (which is often!).This is also a perfect little book to give away to young Christians and new theologians, whose "newfound zeal for truth often makes them dangerous," as Harris points out. I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open down the road for deals on bulk purchases of this book to go in the giveaway box in my office. It's important to note, though, that as this book is primarily concerned with exhorting readers toward humility rather than establishing orthodoxy, this book alone would not be sufficient to help a new believer achieve humble orthodoxy. To get a good grasp on what orthodoxy is, they will need to consult other resources. For this purpose, Harris' earlier book remains one of my top recommendations.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Humble Orthodoxy. Reference it frequently. You won't regret it!
$SUMMARY.: Worth it even if you already have Dug Down Deep? Absolutely.

$REVIEW.: What a creative idea for a cookbook!  The book literally follows the standard format for a field guide to animals or plants

 For each cookie it provides the type, habitat (country the recipe is from), description, field notes (where the recipe came from, origin of name, etc.), and lifespan (how long the cookie will keep)
 Of course it also has ingredients and directions for making the cookie, and total yield for the recipes.These are some truly creative recipes that children will love, like the Night Before Christmas Mice, which actually look like mice, and traditional favorites like snickerdoodles or pizzelles


 It even has a recipe for salt-dough ornament cookies - totally inedible but can be decorated to make permanent Christmas ornaments


 A Baker's Field Guide to Christmas Cookies is fun, creative, and recommended.

$REVIEW.: This book puts together excellent research on how the health of children (and adults, of course) is being harmed by environmental toxins.  From autism and ADHD to asthma, allergies, cancer, and leukemia, childhood health problems are epidemic, fueled by corporate desires for profit at the expense of public health.  Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of these environmental hazards, and the authors provide some guidance into ways that parents can reduce the risks posed to their children as we deal with living in a toxic world.  The rapid rise in these health issues is clearly documented in this book, and the authors present some case studies to show how this unfolds in families and communities across America.This book details some of the examples of how this is happening, such as communities where industrial pollution has produced cancer clusters and parents who have discovered that vaccines are triggering autistic spectrum disorders.  Also exposed is how the government and legal system have been corrupted to protect the corporations - and even institutions of faith have ignored the assault on our children's well-being even while some focus obsessively on protecting unborn fetuses from abortion.  The authors seem to see this in some ways as a liberal vs conservative phenomenon, though in reality both sides of the political duopoly are involved in betraying the public's health and well-being.  While the profit-focused capitalist system is exposed as fueling the problem, the idea that benevolent government regulation offers a solution misses the need for an underlying change in the structure of our society.  As long as the control and accumulation of wealth are built into the society then government itself will be subject to corrupting influences.  Public health and well-being (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual) needs to be the foundation of the society in order for institutions to truly support those values.The authors look for signs of hope and potential for change and progress.  While there is evidence that some people are raising their consciousness about these issues, the authors seem to underestimate the power and cunning of the forces that are profiting from practices that poison us.  They refer to the public being mobilized to fight global warming as an example of how people can be brought to face a challenge, yet the man-made global warming idea has been promoted and financed by many of the corporate and global finance interests who are the worst polluters and has been exposed as false science and a scheme to generate global taxes and control.  The global warming fight has actually subverted real environmental and public health efforts since it diverts attention and resources to a misdirection.  The authors also wrote this book at the time of Obama coming into the role of President of the USA, expressing optimism about a shift to progressive change with a new President.  Unfortunately, Obama is subservient to the same interests that have controlled the government during his predecessors' administrations and many of the threats to our health have continued or expanded under his supposed leadership.Thus, the authors are correct that public awareness and action are needed to bring about healthy change, but naive in some ways about the current prognosis for these changes to manifest.  The majority of people in our society remain asleep and continue to use toxic products and let corrupt experts and leaders govern their lives.  Ideally, many people will read books such as this and awaken - I would highly recommend that readers share this book and similar materials with family and friends.  Yet, even when given this information many people will avoid taking responsibility or making changes, as many lack the courage or motivation to change the status quo.

 That is what the book reminds me of-  I never could get into the show Gilmore Girls because they all talked like the micro machine man..


too fast


 I felt like I had a headache after 5 minutes of watching the show


 The first 200 pages of this book literally gave me a headache
 There is so much dialogue and so many conversations, I found myself having to really concentrate


 I can usually polish off a book of this size in a few hours- this book took me a few days, that is how much conversation is in the book.Now, this was my second attempt at this book


 The first time I got 100 pages in and then gave up

 I really love Shannon Hale though


 Although this was very unlike her other books, I felt like I needed to give it another chance
 I am SO glad I did
 This book really took almost 250 pages to get "into the swing of things"


 I felt like there was a steady flow and the conversations seemed to calm down a bit.I really loved how the characters interacted with each other, and the way the community reacted to their interactions


 I loved that this book took place over a long period of time, so that we could see how the characters grew apart and together throughout their years together- it felt very real.This is a book that is very unlike Shannon Hale's other books- but I really enjoyed it
 This is not a mush book- that you can read without thinking
 This book requires time, commitment, and thought, but in the end- it is so worth it.PS- I can see how younger readers of Hale's work may not enjoy this as much- this book is written to a much older audience, who are in a much different place in life


 It is good to consider the intended audience when reading this book.

$REVIEW.: I got this book just to see if my assumptions about its plot were correct based on the Amazon description, & they were. Definitely different from the norm. Very sexy, hot & steamy sex scenes, every last one. The only drawbacks, in my opinion, was that 1) it did tend to get a little overly descriptive in some places; 2) right when the scene in the tent is about to get going, the story flips back & forth to give everyone's POV and you may find yourself screaming "get on with it!" like I did; 3) the ending was pretty much 1 big loose end. You get the feeling that the Sharps will base their final decision on whatever Josie decides to do, but you don't know. Overall, a little weird but not bad.

$review_text.: I adore this author.  Her style is compelling but full of humour, rich characters and a sizzling hot love affair with plenty of action within the plot and with the characters.  Ryder however overrides everything else for me.  He truly is just  so delicious.  He is powerful, unafraid and bound to duty despite the bloody consequences.  He is also incredibly controlling but somehow he makes it seem so incredibly acceptable because everything he demands is about his fierce feelings for Syn even if love is not in his vocabulary.I could say so much but I don't know if it is necessary.  This is a wildly romantic and sexy read from an author that has the best imagination and the best words to describe as she leads us through a fantasy world of amazing events and creatures.  I love her world, I love her books and I love her writing style and mostly I love that she has ended this book so that if it is the last we are satisfied but if there is more....then bring it on because I will be in line waiting to purchase.
$SUMMARY.: Totally into Ryder!

$review_text.: Elizabeth Lee's best novel yet!SOmuchSTEAM!Lust, Love, Laughs, Family, Great secondary characters... It has it all! The writing is flawless. It will consume you! I read it in one sitting, because there was just no way I was stopping.Elizabeth Lee has a way with words. From her hilarious descriptions to her subtle sarcasm, you can always count on good entertainment and good writing when it comes to her novels. I loved everything about Escaping Me. I could definitely relate to the small town vibe. I read both Shattered and Give Me Something by her and adored them both. Shattered is pretty high ranking on my favorites list, but, I have to say, you get a whole new Elizabeth Lee with Escaping Me. She grows as an author with each book. Her confidence is pouring off the pages in Escaping Me.The story opens with Whitney going for a run. It's hot out and she's not used to the heat in her Mother's hometown. Her parents divorced when she was younger and she chose to live with her Father while her sister, Mallory, stayed with their Mother. She just went through a bad break-up, because she caught her ex-boyfriend, Wes, doing the dirty with another girl. As she's nearing the end of her run, she passes out. That's when Cole stumbles upon her. He's pretty perturbed that he has to stop to help her at all, but can't just leave her on the side of the road. He takes it upon himself to make sure she makes it home safely.When Whitney wakes up, her Mother goes on and on about the cute boy that brought her home. Whitney doesn't think much of it until she gets a good look at Cole later on at a local bar. The thing is, Cole's in town to work and plans to leave as soon as he can. He got in a little trouble back at home and just wants to be left alone. He's not looking to make friends. He catches Whitney off guard when she approaches him and he gives her the cold shoulder. Eventually they agree to be friends, but we all know how the "friends" arrangement usually works out ;)"I'm backwoods, baby. The sooner you figure that out, the better off we both will be."If that's not an invitation, I don't know what is. This. Book. Was. So. Hot. So hot! Cole Pritchett is something else. And by something else I mean something wonderful. I devoured every page as Whitney and Cole's relationship developed. It's not often that you find a book that allows the secondary characters to pull you in just as much as the main characters, but this one did. I'm itching for the next installment in this series so I can learn a little more about Mallory. She exudes sass and has trouble written all over her!Do not pass this one up! If you do, you are seriously missing out. You need to get to know Cole. To love Cole. Trust me, you will LOVE Cole! And just a note to Elizabeth...YOU ARE SO MEAN! You nearly killed my heart right at the ending. NOT FUNNY! ;) To everyone else, no cliffy but you'll have to read to find out what I'm talking about!
$SUMMARY.: Elizabeth Lee's best novel yet!

$REVIEW.: I read the entire book in a couple of days and admit that this one spurred me to purchase the sequel 37 Miles: Patty's Journey.I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the book is very wordy and not well edited (didn't really bother me that much) and very graphic (flaying alive, impalement, etc), but did not detract from the story line and did reinforce the deep evil that could be lurking in a time when the rule of law is nonexistent.I will recommend reading the book and will review the sequel when I finish.

$REVIEW.: I didn't know who Robert Taylor was until the TCM channel had him as their actor of the month. I don't know which movie it was that I was watching that month but Robert Taylor's blue eyes got my attention. Wow! I watched all the movies that I could and picked up "The Reluctant Witness" by Linda Alexander at the same time. It's a great book on many levels. The research must have exhausting, going back to his parents lives before Robert which was interesting too, creating many "days of old" sighs. The book also brings you into the life of a naive movie star that obeyed to the tee, his boss, MGM studios which at the time, was the biggest. The book showed how controlling MGM was to Robert and he took all to a point. The point was the hunt for communists in Hollywood. Linda showed us a man unwilling to tow the company line and stated his dislike for communism and anything, anyone involved in it in front the American people and congress.I was a fan of Barbara Stanwyck when as a kid, watched Big Valley and then The Thorn Birds but Linda introduces the reader to many people including Robert's first wife, Barbara. Reading "The Reluctant Witness" showed the difficult side to Barbara, that I found eye opening.There is a lot more to this book to enjoy and I could go for on for a while but will end with this: read this book and you too will want to back in time.I read Robert Taylor's second wife's book, "...but I have promises to keep" by Ursula Theiss and enjoyed her life too. Another must read but will need kleenex with this one too.Enjoy!

$review_text.: Let me begin by saying that Conspiring is a must read, as it completely adds to the remarkable reading experience of the This series by J. B. McGee. In Broken and Mending, I loved Gabby and Bradley and wanted their relationship to go farther and work, but I absolutely hated Ian, and Veronica was someone I wanted to fall off the pages of the book and never be seen nor heard from again. Well, J.B. McGee managed to turn the tables on this little fantasy of mine by twisting and warping my emotions and every thought I had of Ian and Veronica with the novella, Conspiring. I have entered the Twilight Zone. I can't believe I'm writing this, but I loved Ian in Conspiring, and Veronica managed to win me over quickly...until I didn't like her again. Who do I now dislike? Bradley! Yes, my former book boyfriend has now become my nemesis. Conspiring is the story of Veronica and Ian, and what a story it is! So, what has made me fall in love with the villain and villainess of this series?We get the entire back story of the relationship (for lack of a better word) between Ian and Veronica as told in Veronica's point of view. All of Veronica's thoughts and feelings are on display to tear at my heart and emotions. The story opens with Bradley, the successful and handsome CEO and architect, meeting Veronica, the beautiful and successful attorney, at Joe's for the first time and both are expecting nothing more than a pick-up to feed their needs of being with someone physically. I connected so easily with Veronica and felt such pity for her as she faithfully continued to attend her semi-weekly "appointments" with Bradley. As the Wednesday and Saturday appointments continue for more than a year, Veronica begins to develop deep feelings for Bradley, but he doesn't return those feelings. In fact, he never makes her feel more like his whore than when he refuses to take her to his cousin's wedding in Charleston. It's not as if he hasn't been up front with Veronica from the beginning, but to make matters worse, he issues an ultimatum to her. Veronica never wanted to fall in love with anyone and quickly denies her feelings for Bradley until she realizes that the pain in her heart truly is the love she feels for this man.As a woman who thrives on routine, Veronica's world is upset with Bradley's absence while he is in Charleston, leaving her alone. Upon Bradley's return from Charleston, Veronica's fears come to life, and his mistreatment toward her reaches a new level; talk about your wham bam thank you mam...this is it! Thanks to her good friend, Val, she is whisked away for a night of fun, and Veronica finally realizes that she must try to get Bradley out of her heart and mind. Enter Ian.Ian is the handsome soccer player I first met in Broken. When Ian first sees Veronica at Joe's bar, he is immediately attracted to her and vice versa. He is also the perfect distraction for Veronica, helping to put Bradley out of mind and [hopefully] heart. The chemistry between Ian and Veronica is amazing. They are so good together and the physical attraction is only the beginning. They immediately connect and realize that they have something special, but Veronica doesn't want it to go farther. In fact, neither of them are looking for any type of relationship, but one quickly develops when Veronica becomes sick. During this scene, I see Ian as I've never envisioned him before...even while he was with Gabby in Broken. He is caring, considerate, and kind to Veronica; something she has been lacking with Bradley. In fact, Ian is everything Bradley is not. Ian wants to continue to see Veronica, but she is still having difficulty getting over Bradley, dismissing Ian as a one-night stand....until she needs him and he is there for her as a knight in shining armor.My emotions while reading this book were all over the place. I am so conflicted! I loved Bradley in the first two books of the This series, so the sudden dislike for him took me by complete surprise. I wanted to slap him so hard for making Veronica feel like the dirt beneath his shoes when she genuinely cared for him. He toyed with her emotions and used her body with complete disregard to her heart. However, I still remember how he is with Gabby and still love him for that. Conflicted? Oh, yes. And how the heck did J.B. McGee make me love Ian?! Well, she did! She has truly taken my emotions and twisted them into something I don't even recognize and am not sure how to acknowledge.The last chapter of the book is Ian's point of view, and this no-longer-the-villain-but-now-my-beloved-book-hero actually tore at my heart strings. My heart is broken for him, but at the same time I want to shake him and tell him to not give up on who and what he wants without a fight. But he feels so inferior to Bradley, he is like a little puppy dog walking away with his tail tucked between his legs. And the epilogue! Oh. Em. Gee. I recognize the epilogue as one of those pivotal scenes from Mending, but it now gives me an entirely new feeling toward the characters in all three books. It is so fitting to be placed as the epilogue here. What my mind originally believed to be deceit and selfishness on Ian's part has now warped into believing the most unselfish act of love from Ian, bringing about a huge conspiracy that threatens to wreck any happy ever after for all four main characters in the series.Conspiring is the book that brings understanding to the events of the other books in the series. However, to get the true emotional feel for the series, I strongly suggest reading the books in order. Kudos to J.B. McGee for writing a story that is surely to climb the charts to be one of the best. The writing is fluent, there is a level of steam in this book unseen in the others, and I can't wait to see how the story continues for Gabby, Bradley, Veronica, and Ian.

$review_text.: Books like Untellable by Suzanne Lilly are exactly why I started joining blog tours


 While this book sounded interesting, I probably wouldn't have made the time to read it on my own...and I ended up loving it, so I'm so glad I joined the blog tour and read it!My favorite thing about Untellable was definitely Suzanne Lilly's writing style

 She just had such an easy, smooth way with words that made reading the whole book a very pleasant experience, even when the subject matter was heavy

 I loved her descriptions of the small country town setting (and the town's name, Honey Creek, was great too!), and I especially liked the way she depicted Aspen's love for swimming and the way she felt in the water

 I liked all the characters too--Aspen was strong and resilient, Colton was such a great guy, and I really enjoyed minor characters like Linda too

 The only character who got on my nerves a bit was Elise, but I think the author did a good job of showing that Elise's mistakes were due to naivet&eacute; and lack of thought rather than any real malice


 (As for Aspen's father, there's definitely some real malice there...but we weren't supposed to like him!)The plot was fast-paced and kept me interested the entire time, with the danger from Aspen's past looming over even as she shared sweet, romantic moments with Colton
 As a romantic suspense, the plot was quite dramatic at points, and stretched the limits of credibility a few times, but I expect that in this type of story and didn't really mind


 The romance also developed very quickly, and was heightened by the dangerous situations that Aspen and Colton found themselves in
 Again, since I enjoyed the story and really liked the characters, I wasn't too bothered by the fact that their relationship might not be completely realistic.I am definitely a fan of Suzanne Lilly, and I was excited to see that her previous novel, Shades of the Future, also takes place in Honey Creek and features characters who make a brief appearance in Untellable

 I will be picking up Shades of the Future soon, and I look forward to whatever Suzanne Lilly writes in the future!

Her gift of pulling laughter from me one minuite to being in a complete fit of rage the next was horrifying and thrilling at the same time. I completely devoured it. Normally you can tell where an author is gonna take a scene or what direction it seems to be heading... Not Carmen, you aint got her figured out. She crazy and you're just along for the ride.Carmen delivers pure genius plot twists and turns. Elijah and Ana make very very bad decisions that normally would have me unable to forgive. But what blew my mind was Carmen's ability to pull me back.

$review_text.: I read The blood that bond by Christopher about a year ago.  I LOVED it, there's so much depth to every character.  The same goes for this book.  Blood Hunt did NOT disappoint.  I was actually kinda bummed it wasn't longer.  This book is told from many different angles and different point of views.  You never miss anything..at every point in this book, you always knew what Shasha was doing while you were reading about Two in a different country..make sense? Maybe not, but if you read it (which you should) you'll get it.  Every character is easy to fall in love with all the main characters because at some point in this book, you get very acquainted with each and every one of them.  There's so much that happens in the first book, that if you didn't read you'd be way lost..so read that first! it's free!  I'm not one to post huge reviews, besides to say yes, I loved it.  Yes, I recommend it, and yes, it'll leave you begging for more.  I'm very anxiously waiting the next book.

It may not be a book that you will read from cover to cover, but definitely a great reference. I've been eating this high fiber bread (6g fiber/slice)which I thought was perfect, until this book taught me there are healthier options out there which provide the same amount of the fiber, but half of the carbs. I'm horrified to find out Arizona Kiwi Strawberry has a shocking 84g of sugar per can, and happy to see I made smart choices for cereals. The label decoder is a must read, it tells you the claim and the truth. For beginner shopper, there's a section to teach you how to pick and handle produce. I highly recommend this book to anyone who shops in a Supermarket and may not have the time to read nutrition labels.Sorry! This is a review for Eat This Not That!

$REVIEW.: It is a rogue trader's duty to go out in to the dark places beyond human controlled space and to exploit what they encountered for profit

That meant trading with alien races rather than destroying them outright


However, Cardinal Gurney and Inquisitor Grand believe that all non-humans should be exterminated upon sight


Patriarch Lucian Gerrit, Heritor of the Clan Arcadius, managed to get a delay to the cardinal's ultimate sanction against the Tau when Space Marine Sarik captured a tau commander.Lucian and his family soon find themselves voyaging across the Damocles Gulf

Lucian's daughter, Brielle, had attacked Inquisitor Grand and freed all the tau prisoners before disappearing with them
At least, that was what Inquisitor Grand said happened


But Lucian knew that Brielle would never do such a thing unless the chances of vast power or currency were possible.After weeks of worrying, Lucian found himself with no time to even give his daughter a passing thought


Something from the Warp was on board his ship and stalking the corridors


Lucian must order "protocol extremis", an order none of his line had been forced to issue in over three millennia


"Protocol extremis" was a desperate reaction to a situation few expected to survive


And it did not look as though anyone would be surviving the chaos within the ship's hull.***** This story is as terrific as its predecessor, Rogue Star! Readers can tell from the beginning that there is something deeply unwholesome about Inquisitor Grand

Also, many would consider Brielle's actions in this book (and the previous one) to be selfish


However, DUH, as I said at the beginning of my synopsis, rogue traders are raised to exploit things they encountered for profit

It is not only totally natural to them, but also considered quite noble
The characters are not as well developed this time around as I would like, but the plot and action are terrific

$review_text.: Enjoyed Embattled Minds a lot. Ember lives in a blue collar world that pretty much revolves around her family (her son and her father) and the bar that she and her dad run together. Her dad, Hank, has some post-war issues to deal with; issues that Ember has tried hard, but unsuccessfully, to get him to address. Ember is forced to make a tough decision so that her dad has no option other than to finally seek help for himself. Ember meets Zeke as her dad hits a critical point and she kind of transitions from trying to fix her father to trying to make Zeke understand that he doesn't need the fixing that he (Zeke) thinks he does. Zeke and his group of veteran buddies are frequent guests as Ember's pub. Zeke is your typical hero physically, except for the pretty big issue (at least in his mind) of significant disfiguring scarring. He has also suffered a pretty major injury that is not as obvious.Ember is patient with Zeke as he slowly grows to accept that she cares about him despite his injuries. He is fiercely protective of her during a time of transition in her life related to her dad which, as always, warms your heart in books like these. Both characters have issues to deal with, and they very effectively handle them together without intending to do so. Their relationship just kind of grows in unexpected ways before their very eyes, and it surprises both of them. Bonus points from me for the camaraderie between Zeke and his small group of fellow veterans that have a tight little support system going on. Love the way that Zeke and Ember's relationship grows, love the vulnerability that Zeke displays, and love the persistence of Ember. She's sensitive to his issues without using kid gloves and holds her ground well without apologies. I'll be reading more from this author.

$review_text.: 4 1/2I hadn't read Echo of a Siren, but found this book easy to connect with. It is well-written and gives enough of the story from the first book that I never felt lost or like I was missing something.The book is well-written and imaginative. It is a welcomed relief of the usual fare in the fantasy genre, and was quite enjoyable. Rachel, the siren, was a well-crafted character. She was strong even though she had endured much heartache, and she was willing to take the consequences of her actions. I didn't quite figure out what the sirens saw (or felt) for Greg. He didn't have much depth and seemed more willing to just follow and get along. I didn't see any reason to fall for him. But the &#34;Sisters Three&#34; were very good. I could picture them, feel their wrath and their feelings. This book seemed to me to be less of a romance and more of a story of the sirens.I enjoyed this book. It isn't a long story, but it is interesting and draws you in.

$review_text.: With so many Indian cookbooks already on the market, why should the interested home cook look at yet another? It's simple: The Food Of India: A Journey For Food Lovers by Priya Wickramasinghe and Carol Selva Rajah is quite a cut above most of its similar-sounding competitors. In the first place, a team of traveler/food fans join forces to offer exquisite color photos of both Indian foods and culinary scenes across the country, pairing these photos with clear discussions of the seven Indian states and the local foods they're noted for. Secondly, The Food Of India includes a healthy dose of local history and ingredients research, as well as interviews with chefs and food producers. And if this isn't enough, it needs to be noted that the recipes selected for The Food Of India are anything but ordinary: from a Fried Beef Kerala to the Northern Indian traditional Chole Chaat, many regional specialty dishes aren't to be found in competing guides. All these features combined assure a visual treat packed with dishes all levels of Indian cook will relish.

I don't like saying this, but I think Kate Harper is so accustomed to using her method, which is good, but she must have left out some important steps. I just could not make it work when I was attempting to make a cover for my series of books. I must admit I took other methods in creating some darn good covers. They are on Facebook, and really show up good on my Publishing page, Shinning Light Publishing. The page advertises Ebook publishing on Amazon, which I did not do. Facebook did it.

$review_text.: I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.Stars: 5Searching for Tomorrow is a heart-wrenching, anxiety-filled (in the best way possible), tears running down your face book. When I first opened this book I obviously had no idea what to expect, the character Wrynn instantly stole my heart and I felt her heart through each page that I turned. I fell in love with her beautiful family from her girls, to her brother, to her amazing parents. I was taken through an emotional roller coaster from being infuriated at Mrs. Tidwell to feeling Wrynn's heartbreak as each day passed and she struggled through what all of us only hope to never go through. This book was addictive and I could not put it down when I had it in my hands and in the off chance that I had to set this book down all that was on my mind was the beautiful and magnetic love that Tripp and Wrynn share.If I could give Searching for Tomorrow more than 5 stars, I would. I was emotionally invested into each character and I am crossing my fingers for another book to follow this one. I was more surprised with each page I read. Have a box of tissues and chocolate handy because the love story of Tripp and Wrynn is going to wring every emotion that you have out of you. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants more than an everyday read and is ready to have there hearts attached to yet another book.

The only issue I had was I would have thought that Gemma would have been familiar with Cy as a stuntman before meeting him since they ran in the same circle.  I love a book  with a strong alpha male that takes charge and is still able to meet his feelings.  He dismissed all of Gemma's fears and they had a great romance.

$review_text.: How would you handle it if you felt everyone close to you their emotions so intense (and not always one at a time mind you) it could if you let it would seem to choke you? Would you collapse under the weight of it or run away never to be around others
What if also you denied yourself the love of that one in order to spare them the same? Or would you risk it for love? In this series Maddox (one of my favorites in this pack) is the Omega and was carrying around alot of weight these days and not just from being who he was but also denying himself of a mate-Ellie
Noble man that he thought he was his twin brother North he thought would make a far better mate than he but what does he know
Funny how he thinks he knows better even though his emotions on this are smacking him right in the face and silly man bears the unnecessary pain that goes with it


But it causes her pain also (the art of being noble forgets stuff like this) and now there are 2 being torn apart and she believes she is not good enough
Circumstances changes things for the 3 of them and they are forced to temporarily leave and also told to work it out between them once and for all


Can't fool parents and certainly not these

You think alright finally but oh not so easy either 

Their is turmoil and fighting going on after all


Drama filled edge of your seat action but wait that is not all, beautifully written passion filled dance as Maddox and Ellie come together and quit fighting the desires of their hearts and souls
Great story comes to light also on the scar on his face and who was in place to release him so that he is even able to be here at this time


As with fighting there could be some hostages and during a rescue a discovery is made concerning another one in the clutches of her evil brother that also has a big impact on their lives
During a rescue death tries to enter in and oh joy does love enable to bring back love that lasts a lifetime


Love the way this author weaves together each story for this series and brings the characters alive that you also fall in love with them and care for them so by the time you are done and reached the last page you are panting for more after a rest and cool down for sure.

As a romance reader, I've been getting a little tired of the same old story and I'm so glad I decided to buy this book.  "If I Wait for You" is the perfect romance story in my opinion; adventure, honor, mystery and of course, undying love!  It brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  This is the first book I've read by this author and I am so excited to read more. I just bought "When a Duke Says I Do" and am looking forward to it.

$review_text.: I loved the latest book in the Powertools series.The last few books have had more emotion and been more real, more relationship-like and less a sex free-for-all.Don't get me wrong, the free-for-all's are seriously hot and really enjoyable, but it is nice to get more of a real story as well.This book deals with quite a few issues:  the pain of trying and failing to conceive a baby, the trauma of a loved one in hospital after a terrible car accident and how everyone deals with those issues in their own way.And then there is the seriously hot sex, which is always a winner.As always, Jayne Raylon has delivered a great book, and I will continue to keep an eye out for new books by this author.I see (I hope!) a spin-off series in the future, after the introduction of Joe's cousin and his 'crew' and I eagerly await the first book!

He watched for a reaction,"Really? You are the biggest pig I know, how can you hate pork?"Adam is a cocky self professed ladies man. He never 'sleeps' with the same woman twice, and he doesn't sleepovers. Women know the score - even if they had trouble accepting it. He's the playboy, the black sheep, the one not to be taken seriously, but suddenly, more than anything, he wanted to be taken seriously.He's just recovered from an accident that landed him in a coma and broke both his legs, and has been kicked out of his brothers place and realized he's lonely & basically friendless. He's feeling super sorry for himself. Get out the little violin. You are invited to Adam's pity 30th birthday party :) Enter Cammie aka doll - bar tender, ice queen & catering goddess. He needed her to deliver him from the hell that was his apartment and the nurse his brother hired. Oh.my.god. She's exactly what he needed and a total breath of fresh air. Enter the world of 'the other half'."Cammie studied him across the table. He seemed really enthusiastic, highly motivated, and only mildly annoying. He was practically a credit to his kind. Then she remembered the last 117 parties they had both been at. That was all it took for those compliments in the tip of her tongue to slip away."From the first, these 2 had me giggling. They were explosive. Arguing every second. It was like watching an old married couple. It was awesome. They both have issues to get past if they are going to leave their state of denial. Can they overcome their differences? You'll have to read it and find out.This book is chocoblock full of banter, funny brother moments, a magical flying squirrel scene with the tree kiss (BRILLIANT!), food talk that had my tummy rumbling, and so many moments that had me sitting back and just enjoying the ride. I adored the way Adam would just never give up, even after he was shot down. Over & over again. Hahahaha"You strike me as the type of guy that is so full of himself, he even talks in his sleep."Seriously, I LOVED Adam. He's sweet, tender, caring and although he puts across the vibe that he only does what he does so he gets something out of it, he really is just a giant soft teddy bear...made of clay waiting to be molded. And Cammie was just perfect. For Adam. She was a fabulous character. Well done. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

$review_text.: Rachel Morse is the soul survivor of a horrific tragedy, brought from Chicago, IL to live with her grandmother and aunt in Portland Oregon
Rachel creates within her self a "new girl"..
the old girl is gone, dead with the rest of her family

This new girl struggles to navigate a different life in Portland
Back home, her parents - a white Danish woman and a black soldier, never told her she was black
They never prepared her for a world where her kinky, curly hair and bright blue eyes would land her smack in the middle of two races, able to identify with neither.The novel follows Rachel and those who are involved in her life on the periphery, like spokes on a wheel, by switching narrators
We jump in time between Rachel's present day, and the slow re-telling of the story through other voices.I'm having a difficult time forming the words to describe my feelings on this book


It is beautifully, almost poetically written


I was deeply involved in the story and invested in each character

I started listening to the audio book in the car and it was just moving so slowly that I came home one day and bought the book so I could read the rest of it and find out what happened!I like stories that are subtle

You don't read what happened, you come to understand it

You don't get a play by play, but you get enough details to know, in your heart, what's going on

I felt that there was an effort to explain things from the mind of a young, confused girl and I was sympathetic to that.I also felt like there wasn't..


enough story

I got to the end and thought..
"erm..

that's it?" I still sort of feel like I don't really know what happened, or why

I still have questions at the end of the book and while I don't like endings where everything is pat and everything is tied with a big bow, I do like to have major plot lines tied up.This is a great read, and I really enjoyed it

It just left me wanting more.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this story. I couldn't imagine waking up in a hospital and not having any idea as to who I was or who the people around me were. To remember music, words, books, etc.. but not anything about your actual life. Scary."The things we should focus on in any life shouldn't be what we've lost, but what we've gained"I found Emma to be a strong character. Not knowing who she was before and the pressure from her family and friends to try to conform to who they wanted her to be now. They want her to remember herself as before and they try their hardest to force her to think and act a certain way.However the more Emma learns about her 'old' self the more she realizes she doesn't really like the person she was before. To be frank she was a spoiled brat. Rude, needy and one of the mean girls at school. This is not the Emma now and the drives she obviously felt before are no longer there. She doesn't care about fancy cars, money, designer purses, or being a part of the 'it' couple at school."It doesn't matter who you were or what you've done in the past. The only thing that matters is who you are right now."Enter Mason. Mason is Emma's physical therapist and helps her after she wakes up. I know what you are thinking... eewww[...] Her physical therapist? He is only a few years older than Emma and nothing inappropriate happens while she is in the hospital. I was at first worried that the feelings she was having toward Mason was because of him being her carer but thankfully it never came across like that. He is always sweet and kind to Emma and is the one person that tells her it is okay to be who she wants to be. She doesn't have to be who her friends and family are trying to force her into being."I'm going to take you somewhere and kiss you until you can't think or move or breathe."My only issue at all with Wide Awake is that I did feel a few of the side characters were a bit unrealistic or a little over the top. For example... in the hospital the psychiatrist that is 'helping' Emma seems to be giving her terrible advice and it appears to be stemmed from the fact that she may or may not have feelings for Mason. And the head doctor seemed to be a little weird as well. Emma's family has a lot of money and it just seemed like the facility had a few shady characters... These small issues in no way stopped my enjoyment of the story but I did just want to mention that I felt some of the interactions were a little 'off'.I recommend Wide Awake for a quick, enjoyable read. The love between Emma and Mason was really sweet and it does have a lovely story."You're the girl that I'm falling madly in love with."I felt all the breath leave me. My mouth fell open, but no words escaped.He chuckled. "A speechless Emma. That's really cute."ChristineRainy Day Reads

$REVIEW.: Yesterday I finished reading "Creative Spirit" By Scott Nicholson.. First let me confess my guilty pleasure I am a MAJOR fan of the Paranormal/Horror Genre, Is there an emotion that I did NOT feel in this book? No! I felt them all I even got mad a Scott a few times (and I told him so hehehehe) This is a Ghost story, a love story, a story about finding yourself, And a story about coming to terms with who you are..or aren't. Scott's Descriptions of The Appalachian Mountains is breathtaking, he uses every sense at one point I was smelling the Apples he describes, and the colors he brings to life thru words AMAZING....with lots of twists and turns and I even thought "uummm I don't remember that happening " then you find out why you don't remember lol Thrill ride!!! so if you get a chance go to Amazon Download the book and step into the paranormal

$REVIEW.: Let me just say that I'm glad I read this book. It started off very slow and maybe a little boring.  I didn't think I would like it but as I pushed myself to read it, it kinda sucked me in. It's not the best book I ever read and the writers style is not really my cup of tea but the plot and characters were awesome. I really liked it in the end. So even tho It felt difficult to grip the story line at first I eventually fell into it. I guess maybe the beginning of the story should have been more engaging and interesting but who am I to judge?? I still give it 5 stars and will surely read his other books.

$review_text.: I bought this online guided by the good reviews, but the book proved dissapointing. Though pictures are very good, the story of a boy that gets sent to bed for bad behavior and travels to an island where mosters live, and where he reigns as his king, has absolutely no soul nor magic. Story starts with the boy mother calling the boy "a monster". I know raising a boy is challenging, but I felt uneasy about that language from a mother to his son. In short, the very short story seems focused on the boy getting away with everything he does: no moral, no tenderness, no warmth. AND my kids found the pictures alluring but the book boring. I bought three books, read all of them to the kids and asked them to choose their favourites to keep, and this one was last.

$REVIEW.: This next Volume of Archer and Armstrong is even better than the first! The art and story get better and better


Valiant has shown it really knows how to introduce new characters in it's books! This one being the Eternal Warrior! So violent and funny

Not trying to outsmart it's audience all the time but rather using some very common sense which through the story wins over Archer and the reader

Offers other points of view in some very comical ways

Great reading all in all


Another great chapter in the new history of Valiant!

$review_text.: There is a wide variety of protagonists in the mystery genre, but Timothy Hallinan has come up with an unexpected and different one:  a professional burglar.  Junior Bender has been a thief, breaking into homes for 17 years, since he was 14, often on a contract someone pays him to obtain a desired object.  Moreover, he is an intelligent, well-read character, always thinking.Junior is hired, indirectly, by Trey Annunziato, the female head of a crime family, to steal a Klee from the home of another gangster.  He is then blackmailed into helping her produce a porno film starring Thistle Downing, once the darling child star of a popular TV sitcom, now a down-and-out doped-up has-been.  It appears someone is attempting to sabotage the movie, and Trey wants Junior to find out who and to help make the film possible.  So much for the plot.  It's what follows that keeps the reader turning pages with its out-of-the-blue developments and amusing dialogue and situations.Originally published as an e-book, the novel is the first of a three-book deal with the publisher (with the third one due out in June), and the TV rights have been sold to Lionsgate.  Quite a send-off for a new series.  No wonder the author turned from the just as popular Poke Rafferty series to concentrate on Junior Bender.  Both series have in common very original protagonists, lots of humor, stirring stories and extraordinary twists.  And now, for this reader, the second novel in the series, "Little Elvises."Recommended.

$REVIEW.: I thought the beginning of the book was fun, and Marco may be a bastard, but I liked him right off, despite his arrogance. I liked that Natalie defies Marco every chance she can. An intelligent character that gives Marco things to think about. At times Marco came across as immature due to his obsessive/possessive controlling nature, and jealously. Natalie's strength was what made this book enjoyable and worth reading. She really broke Marco. Nice ending.

$review_text.: We have a 4 year old and a 2 year old and read a lot of children's books.  What I love about this book is that it really aims to teach something very practical and direct.  This is very different than the more metaphorical and sometimes nonsensical books that fill our shelves.  There are six short "situations" that start with a good feeling, illustrate a not-so-good feeling (like feeling lonely, or not being able to sleep) and then take the children through a breathing exercise with a sound to result in a good feeling again.  It's simple and clear, yet powerful.  Both of my kids were "whooooooo"-ing and "heeeeeeee"-ing right away.  I think that while the science may be lacking here, there is tradition behind these types of exercises that support them helping to relax people and focus the mind.  If the children can learn these at a young age, perhaps they will be less stressed and more balanced along the way--I really like this preventative strategy.  These are very neat life tools that are worth exploring with kids.  I highly recommend this book!

$REVIEW.: I have read both previous versions of this story and that may be why I rated it 3 stars rather than 4.The time period is a difficult one for me to enjoy.  The Happy Days vibe combined with an erotic, taboo story line was a bit discomforting.But despite that, it's Selena Kitt and you know you are going to get a hot story that pushes the boundaries.  That I DO like.Honestly, I am looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.  All the content of the original (and the less taboo re-write) was revisited in this first book, so Confession will be completely new territory.There are some subtle but important differences in the stories and I am curious to see how they play out.Whether you read the original Under Mr. Nolan's Bed or the more PC Plaid Skirt Confessions, it's worth revisiting Leah and Rob in this new re-telling to find out where Selena is taking them next.

real competitive advantages, areas in which you can find better investments in the media landscape as well as the internet impact on eroding once dominant organizations advantages.The authors fascinating facts finding efforts, significant depth of evaluating competitive advantages and the landscape of many media companies as well as numerous examples of the impact of changes, will enable the reader to have a framework to use to overcome the "pixie dust" spread by the moguls and discover the true value of a media company as a long term investment

$REVIEW.: I found the story line rather interesting, if underdeveloped in some points.  For example, the main character suffers a major grief and seems to just bounce back with one or two 5-minute teary-episodes.  To me, this seemed unbelievable.It's a light story, with the stock characterizations of good vs. evil. I found that I was curious to finish, but had no problem skimming some filler parts to continue to the end.There are many grammatical errors, especially a confusion of tenses.  These appear more and more frequently as you progress in the story.  The dialogue is not always clear or correctly formatted for easy reading.  The dog's name (Buttons) replaces any use of the common noun 'button'.If you want a fluffy, interesting but not captivating relaxing read, you might enjoy this.  If grammar errors destroy your reading pleasure, then wait for a well-edited revision!

$REVIEW.: This is an absolutely excellent tool for the modern day church. In a day and age where we prefer the "Big Sunday Show," to the Biblical concept of Discipleship, this book is a breath of fresh air. The concepts and principles contained in this book are not new. They in fact go back a few thousand years. Why are they so revolutionary and why do I recommend this book so much? Because we as a Church and as a culture have strayed so far from the Biblical mandate set forth by Christ that we have settled for a Christianity that doesn't even compare to that which was originally prescribed by Christ. This book is a wind to take us to where we need to be: authentic discipleship. The main theme of the book is to make disciples who make disciples who make disciples. Simple enough, but this book offers simple, pragmatic steps to incorporate these principles into your personal life, or the life of your ministry. I cannot recommend this resource enough and would love to give this book to every pastor in America and around the world. I am willing to believe, that if the Church of America and the world will go back to the Biblical model of making disciples who will make disciples, that we will truly disciple and transform entire Nations and essentially the entire world as is the desire of Christ. GREAT BOOK! It is going on my A-List shelf. Finally I pray that this review would encourage you enough to get this book and apply it's principles that the whole earth would soon be covered with the Glory of the Lord through authentic, committed, lovers and followers of Christ who are strong and stable enough to train other authentic, committed lovers and followers of Christ who are strong and stable enough to train other...you get the picture. PLEASE, get this book and apply it's principles! I hope this book is as much a blessing to you as it was to me!Yours for Christ,Tony CappoferriMatthew 28:19-20

$REVIEW.: If you've not read volume 1, you may not want to read this review. I can't promise it will be spoiler free :)I love this book! Seriously insanely love it. It is even better than Volume 1, if that is possible. It is so cute, so fun, so exciting, so funny, so everything good about a book :) Alice and Briar Rabbit are back for more Corrupted fighting. There is more action and more backstory as well.Let me just say, that the characters in this book are so endearing, that I just want to have them over for pizza.  They are so real. My daughter is Alice's age, and I so feel like they would be friends. Alice is such a great hero(ine). :) She wields that magic pen like she's been the hero for years rather than months. She takes down Corrupted like it's second nature to her. If you haven't read Volume 1, the Corrupted are Grimm's Fairy Tale creatures who are living in our world. The longer they live, the more corrupted they become. And it's Alice's job as the hero to destroy them. And Briar is B'rer Rabbit. Trust me, it will make sense when you read it :)I love the secondary characters in this book. They feel more like main characters now.  I love Seth. He is the ultimate best guy friend a girl could ask for. He is hilarious. And the inclusion of Chase is amazing. Their little group of 4 could not be better. Rachel and Clyde are excellent secondary characters as well. I am hoping they become more involved in the next volume. And I seriously hope Trish comes to her senses!My favorite scene has got to be where Seth and Briar are trying to sing "Dancing Queen" by Abba. "Seen that girl," he (Seth) sang out of tune, "watch her scream, kicking the dancing queen." Briar waited for the next chorus. "I do believe they're saying Sea that curls, within seas, tickle the dancing queen." I was totally cracking up! So not only do you get kick-butt action, you also get serious comic relief in this book.Trust me when I say, you need to buy both volumes of The Grimm Chronicles.  You don't know what you are missing!

$REVIEW.: I started Sea Glass Inn last night. This morning, instead of working on my own story, I obsessively finished reading Ms. Walsh's novel instead.This is a lovely story of two beautiful, damaged women struggling to make their lives right. There is exploration, wonderment and joy, and those are not always found in the expected places.As with all novels, if one looks for things to complain about, one can, just as one or two of the other reviewers have done. But this story is so lovely, I would rather focus on the beauty.Thank you, Ms. Walsh, for an enjoyable read.

$review_text.: Action centered, fast paced post apocalypse series suitable for the teen market and adults looking for an action based story. The standard cliches of the teen hero's fist love were treated as minor diversions which didn't get in the way of action. I don't do spoilers, so I won't be more specific so I'll just say that ending pushed the boundaries of what we're expected to believe could happen in any setting - even a fantasy - but didn't take away from my enjoyiing the series as a whole. Worth the time.

$review_text.: I loved the concept of this book and I'm very happy it held my focus throughout

We read about superheroes so much it was nice to shift that focus onto their children and their super powers.This is the story of Penny and her two best friends, Ray and Claire


Penny's parents are superheroes and she expects nothing less than to become a superhero when she starts getting her powers

Some stuff goes down and the trio are labeled as supervillains
Penny wants nothing more than to prove she's really on the good side, the only problem being, she's actually really good at being a supervillain.I really enjoyed the bond shared by main characters


They were very believable as a team
I enjoyed all the different heroes and villains throughout the book.The one thing I would change about this book, is that I wish the characters had been 15 or 16 years old, instead of 13
There is a little touch of a love triangle in this book and it was funny for me to picture them as 13

Ray would definitely have been more believable to me, with all of his new super powered muscles, if he had been 16.Overall I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves super heroes and villains.

$review_text.: The Bird family have an idyllic existence living in a picture perfect English village in the eccentrically named Bird House. Megan, Bethan, Rory and Rhys have the kind of childhood than only exists in fairy tales, picnics on the lawn, Easter egg hunts in the nooks and crannies of the garden and rainbow filled afternoons of love and laughter with their mother, Lorelei and father, Colin. But on one Easter afternoon a tragedy of epic proportions rips apart the family and nothing will ever be the same again.Lisa Jewell has written an entirely believable book which untangles the minutiae of family life, and quite simply reveals the vulnerabilities and insecurities which can unconsciously fester away until the hurt becomes palpable. Beautifully characterised, everyone could be people you know, in situations you can all too easily understand, and yet shining through the hurt and awfulness is a gem of a family who tug at your heartstrings with a poignancy that will leave you captivatedIt's an absolute gem; it's one of those books that you really can't put down and have to keep reading until your eyes sting with tiredness.Quite simply a perfect read and one that will stay with me for a long time.
$SUMMARY.: A perfect read...

$REVIEW.: "Goodnight Brian" is a wonderful and heartwarming story about a young man with developmental delays from early on in life.  His parents believed all of the doctors grim forecast of his future when his grandmother believed otherwise.  Brian and his grandmother instantly formed a special bond with her grandson that she instilled in the rest of the family.  It is uplifting from the first page to the last!

In this story we live the horrors of Chernobyl...not from the official government reports...but from the families that lived through it ....but not for long. Through them we confront our own mortality and are inspired by their courage, their kindness, and most.of all their dignity.A beautifully crafted novel.

$REVIEW.: I was given book for honest review. Mia has patched up more than her fair share of idiot fighters so when Mike is laid up in her ER room she tries to deny the attraction and walks away. Fate seems to want them together and they crash into each other again. Loved how she wasn&#8217;t afraid to speak her mind and tell it like it is.  Colorfully hot yet romantically sweet. Can&#8217;t wait to read the other siblings stories.

With the help of her best friend Chas she sets out on a crusade to avenge her fathers murder.Grimey will have you spiraling out of control, with mixed emotions, gruesome scenes and downright gutter behavior you would want to stay clear of Parrish.

$REVIEW.: Nothing is going Lizzie&#8217;s way. Her sex life is unsatisfying, her job sucks and she has more debt than she needs thanks to her loser brother. Against her better judgment, she lets her best friend sign her up to be auctioned off at a high-rolling venue called the Club. Agreeing to a weekend of adventurous sex with a stranger is one thing, but being bought by the brothers who own the Club means Lizzie is up for a weekend beyond her wildest fantasies.Ryan and Lizzie hit it off, in bed and out, but it&#8217;s his quiet brother, Trace, that has her heart pounding and her panties in a twist. But is Lizzie what Trace needs? Having been burned before, will he take a chance on what his heart is telling him or trust his instincts and send her home after their weekend is over?I really enjoyed this book. The story deals with struggles of self-image, which is easily relatable. Lizzie believes that she is overweight, unattractive and undeserving of a better life. Her best friend Bel, is the only person she has in her life that sees past all of her insecurities and helps Lizzie see herself in a new light. Because of Bel, Lizzie musters up enough courage to auction herself off for a weekend to help her pay bills and take a step in the right direction for her life. It&#8217;s a complete shock that she gets an offer too good to be true, from two brothers. Ryan is a cage fighter that is covered in colorful tattoos, and his brother Trace is a clean-cut businessman. Will 48 hours be enough time for them to satisfy their needs? You definitely have to read this book to find out. I actually read this in one sitting and I needed to see what would happen with Lizzie. I only wish that it was a little bit longer, since I felt like the ending was rushed. I give this book a solid 4.5 stars out of 5. I highly recommend this book and I cannot wait to see what happens in the series!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed reading this book. It read very quickly and was very entertaining. It was realistic for the most part. I loved the way the main character, Casey interacted with others, and how she changed as the book progressed. I also liked the music.I don't really consider myself a music person, but I could definitely appreciate the music in this book. It was a central part of it, and the author definitely knows music. If you're someone who loves music, this is a good book for you.The characters were all really well put together. I especially liked the way Casey and her brother interacted. It was very realistic. I think the average high school student-body was pulled off very well.The only thing that I didn't particularly love about the book was how narrow the setting was. I didn't really feel like I got a big picture.Overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it, especially to music lovers!

$review_text.: Serge Trifkovic's book is clear and concise and not polically correct.  The book is divided into five parts and the first four are worthy of five stars, but the last part, "the Solutions" needs more development,should be longe, and in parts questinable implementation may result in a country no one wants to live in either and brings down the overall rating of this otherwise spectacular book.Now let me be clear, there are many good muslim people, if not most of the muslim believers are good people, who focus on the more noteworthy tenets of Islam - that is not the arguement.  The arguement presented here is that Jihadists are logically following Islam's teachings to their conculsion.  The radical results of terrorism is actually the logical outworking of Islam as spelled out in many Koranic text, the Hadiths, and Islamic history.Leftists politcally bent individuals, more concerned in pursiung an anti-Christian society than the truth of the current threat, typically provide silly and disturbing arguements for Islam and blaming American society.  Trifkovic demolishes such nonsense.  His overall critqie of Europe is fair and in regards to Spain painfully accurate.Now, let us hope our leaders truely understands the threat and protect all Americans (Christians, Jews, seculars, and Muslims, etc),from this threat.

$REVIEW.: It's not very often that I read a book that will make me laugh, cry, and make me mad all at the same time but this one sure did.  The characters are very easy to like with the exception of a few. Gabe is hilarious, Dominic is hot as heck! What more could you ask for? I read this book in one day and when it was over I was really disappointed because I was just THAT into the story. There is some bad language so if you aren't a fan of books like that....than this might not be for you. Honestly though, a story isn't about whether the characters use certain language...its about the WHOLE story. Not full of sex, but the sexual energy is with you through out. I could go on and on but I don't want to give away any spoilers. I will say I thought it was AMAZING and it had me right from the get go.
