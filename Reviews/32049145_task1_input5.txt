$review_text.: I was looking for an inexpensive camcorder to take ATV and dirt bike riding video with
 Something that I wouldn't be too concerned if it got totaled in a crash


 This unit was a good deal at $70 but Amazon sent me a $10 off coupon and that sealed the deal

 It takes sharp, clear video as long as the camera is relatively steady


 Colors are sharp and true

 The camera shape and light weight are not the best for a solid hand hold
 Mounted solidly on a bike, there is quite a bit of bouncing around

 It needs to be helmet mounted to steady it down but I haven't got that figured out yet
 Pure Digital Technologies Customer Service confirmed that the camera does have a build in stabilizer but it isn't enough to overcome the bouncing of a vehicle on a rough trail


 Pure Digital Customer Service response to emails is excellent


 Expect a response in a couple of hours

 They will stick with you until your problem is solved


 I'm not sure I would purchase the new 60 minute model at $150 but I can recommend this unit for an inexpensive, easy to carry, knock around camcorder.

$review_text.: I have always been a huge HP fan until the last few laptops showed certain annoyances (malfunctioning fans, touchpads out of control to name a couple) so I started looking around. For desktops I've always used Intel OR Asus boards and cards exclusively and have always been happy with Asus so I thought I'd give the N53SM a try.There were a few things I was worried about. Silver on a laptop is not really my thing so I was hoping that it wasn't too shiny. Also, several folks mentioned a flimsy keyboard and I was pleasantly surprised that it was not the case with mine. The play in the keyboard was minimal compared to my more expensive HP laptops and the silver is more of a slightly polished matte pewter! Great. Something else that I was worried about was the overall styling and material used. I've seen some tacky looking laptops with cheap plastic in my time and was hoping for a sleek yet stylish design and Asus delivered on that. Nice curves and nothing too extravagant and everything feels solid. Also worth noting is that the screen is matte which I'm extremely happy about. The only glossy part is the 1" bezel around the screen itself. Perhaps a finger print magnet, but I simply avoid that area or keep it clean with an anti-static wipe.Now on to performance. My laptop came with the default 6Gb of ram which is probably more than enough for the average (power) user. With about 35 Mozilla tabs, MS Word, email client, Quickbooks Pro and background music I barely touch 3Gb. So far it's been responsive in every way! I've also rendered a few 10 to 15 minute animations at optimized settings in less than an hour on Adobe CS5.5 AE (plus all other Adobe apps run just as responsive as on my desktop). I have since upgraded to 16Gb to cut down render times significantly.Audio is great after some minor tweaking; probably better than your average laptop in its class (and definitely price range). In my opinion, the Bang & Olufsen system sounds better than most of the HP Beats systems. Keep in mind, that this is a laptop. If you're in a noisy area, put on some quality headphones.I'm not much of a gamer, but I do play one game - SWTOR - I'm not even going to attempt it on here; while it should run, I need to have this game at max settings and this laptop simply wouldn't handle it, graphics wise (plus, playing this on anything less than 70" LED HD tv would seem like a huge downgrade to me!). I've seen enough reviews and videos that this can handle other 2010/2011 games (see youtube) so it might be a decent entry level gaming laptop for those on a budget.My only (temporary) gripe, is that I have yet to get used to the touchpad 2 finger scrolling, but it's getting easier as I use it. Some folks complained about the weight, so I can see that as the only con for this laptop; for me, lugging it around isn't an issue - especially since I'm used to carrying full combat armor, gear, ammo and weapons around for months at a time up and down hills and in desert sands until recently :)So that's just my 2cents (and non-technical review) on a great laptop at a great price. Asus is an excellent company and Amazon, simply is amazing at delivering!UPDATE: June 03 2012After I wrote this review I decided to install SWTOR and played around this morning and must report that it is very playable and even with the lower settings it does look amazing! So, should I ever be away from home with access to a decent network connection, I can still play :)

$review_text.: A few things make this great:-Screen Rotation: You can watch this while riding shotgun just by rotating the display toward you.-Remote Control: my wife doesn't have to try to reach back and control it, but can just click the remote


The sensor is a little persnickety, but it beats manual buttons.-USB/SD Input: We load up an SD card and a Jump Drive and we are ready for a road trip without having to bring a ton of DVDs.-Divx Support: This is the single best feature

We converted all our DVDs to Divx, which degrades the quality, but not noticeably on such a small screen
So suddenly a 2 hour movie is 700 MB, which means you can fit 11 or 12 movies on an 8GB jump drive
Do the same with an SD card, or bring back up jump drives, and you have more media than even your fickle van-bound children can go through.

$REVIEW.: The 35mm Nikon f/1.8G lens has become one of my go-to lens. It does wonders with low-light/night time situations and has razor sharp depth of field. This lens is a joy to use. Since it is a fixed/prime lens, it has helped me become a better photographer - composing & finding different perspectives. As we know, using a zoom lens can make us lazy photographers!Features at a glance-Aspherical lens element-Nikon Super Integrated Coating (SIC) enhances light transmission efficiency and offers color consistency and reduced flare-Nikon Silent Wave Motor (SWM) enables fast, accurate and quiet autofocus-Close focusing to 1 foot-Rounded 7-blade diaphragm opening makes out-of-focus elements appear more natural-Uses 52mm filters and attachments (I've attached a Sigma 52mm UV filter and 52mm Tulip flower hood with no problems)PROS+ F/1.8+ AF-S Autofocus for shooting pictures and video.+ Very Sharp+ Vivid, vibrant colors+ Razor sharp depth of field (Great, but not everyone will like it)+ perfect for portraits, landscape, creating sexy bokeh and depth of field+ Comes with a lens hoodCONS+ Has a very plastic feel, not the smoothest of focus rings (I miss the older Nippon lenses that have silky smooth focus rings)+ No Vibration Reduction (VR) - Not a huge deal, but it would have been niceConclusion- At this ridiculously low price (~$200), you're getting a very sharp lens. Bokeh, picture quality, and low-light/night time shooting are all amazing. What are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and get this prime lens.
$SUMMARY.: Sharp, excellent for low-light shooting, solid auto-focus

$REVIEW.: What can I say that has not been said before?  Nothing.  These are perfectly acceptable as 3.4 star earbuds with mic for under $30.  I have JBL over the ear and Etymotic in-hear that are used for more critical listening.  I wanted something to throw in the gym bag for New Year's resolution workouts.Calls are clear, mic is clear, music fidelity just average, comfort ok.  Tried all ear cushions, none really fit.  I miss in ear stability for working out.  I like the ability to quickly tug and release for  safety.  Not highly noise isolating, again better for safety.  No real bass after 24 hour burn-in.  Too much treble and can be tiring.  Not very loud, and have to play at higher volume levels than others.Would I recommend: yes, but know what you are willing to give up and you will be happy.  Many many many better options available but they are all at higher price points.

$REVIEW.: I own a Logitech Harmony remote which is digital, has a touch screen interface, and is pretty fancy but it's not really that intuitive for some people.  It's suppose to be but for anyone who has family staying over, example is Logitech's own commercial where Grandpa was baby sitting.  The Harmony remote may still be a bit too fancy since you can customize the buttons.  You'll need to leave instructions as to what certain things do.With this remote it's pretty clear cut. One button is for the TV, another for the DVR etc.  No need to leave behind instructions (hopefully) and it's an interface a good majority of people are already comfortable with.

$review_text.: For the past nine months I've owned a smaller version of this keyboard - Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad Mini


That one is, by far, my favorite tablet keyboard/cover combo
It's simple, lightweight, and very innovative in terms of its design
It also allows me to simply and quickly detach my iPad Mini and use it as a tablet - which is for the most part my preferred way of using it anyways
It also provides a lot of protection for the iPad in the cover mode, and the keyboard action is my favorite of all the tablet keyboards that I tested

That's why I was so excited about this bigger version of this cover for iPad Air

It seemed like an ideal accessory for my iPad, and held the promise of perhaps completely abandoning my Macbook Air.On the surface the two models, aside from the size, seem almost identical

However, when it comes to execution there are many significant differences, and all of them are for the worse
This larger cover does not close properly when shut, and the small groove on the top of the keyboard does not support the iPad securely when propped up


The keyboard itself is pretty good though - not quite as comfortable to use as a proper full-scale keyboard, but definitely good enough for most on-the-go work tasks

(Composing e-mails and shorter documents for instance.) It is also very light, much lighter than most of its competitors


Unfortunately because the cover leaves the iPad fairly loose and vulnerable I don't feel comfortable carrying my iPad around a lot in it, which will result in me not using this keyboard/case all that much

Which is such a shame - I really like Logitech's products and hope that they fix these issues in the next upgrade of this keyboard.

Never have I had problems with a hard drive as I experienced with this drive


I recently started using this drive a week ago
Since that short time with no other changes to my system, I have had applications crash on me multiple times


Furthermore, when the drive is not in use, it emits a chirping sound about once a minute

I am certainly not the only one to experience this problem
Check out the Seagate forums and you will find them stuffed with other customers complaining about various problems and noises with their drives.To even consider upgrading the firmware to resolve this issue is ridiculous
It's not like hard drive technology is new, so why can't Seagate get it right?This drive is going back to Seagate for a refund
I very rarely use the term "never", but I will never buy another Seagate drive

I will stick with Western Digital who has never let me down.

$review_text.: Several years ago, I couldn't find a Logitech trackball for the office to replicate the one I had at home and got one of these. I was very surprised to find that the MS trackball was much better.I  bought two more recently for about $30 each and one is still in the box. It's tempting to sell it but it's almost too good and there are no viable alternatives. After several years my first one is a little "off" but still very pleasant to use. I would hate for it to wear out and not have a backup.

$REVIEW.: I was very excited when I received this unit today

I ordered it to replace a different unit from another manufacturer that I was not happy with
When I opened the bag the two tension screws and adjustment knob fell out along with the gripping bracket for one of the mounts, fortuitously on my desk


I reassembled the unit as I am fairly handy :)

My rate for assembly is apparently very inexpensive as I didn't get paid for it

(You know that was funny, come on)I mounted the unit on my umbrella shaft, but with only two flashes mounted on it, it will spin around
I guess I need to buy another 580 ex II just for balance

Yummy! Seriously, I tightened the bejeebers out if it and it seems to hold so far but I need a real world test.I then mounted a 1/4 spigot to it and it works well on my umbrella bracket


I mounted the two flashes on the bottom two brackets which leaves the flashes lined up fairly well with the modifier unlike a regular top mount which puts the flash too high and off center in the umbrella
I tried using the 5/8 end of my spigot but could not get it to screw all the way in to the bracket.I really bought this to use with my Westcott Mega Apollo 50", so that is my next experiment, I will let you know how that works out.I would give this unit a higher rating if I thought I could lock it down better on the umbrella shaft


I don't want to use pliers to mount it as I am afraid it would crush the umbrella shaft
As a quick note, this unit came from Adorama, not Samy's Camera.***Update 07/16/2013***Okay, so I mounted this unit to my Westcott Mega JS Apollo 50"
As many of you know, the Apollo is a fairly large soft-box built on an umbrella frame
The shaft on the umbrella is very strong so I had no qualms about tightening this bad boy down as hard as I could without the use of pliers


Unfortunately, the unit still spins without 3 flashes mounted to it
I mounted it on the end of the stand so I could tilt the box more which is one of the complaints with this soft-box and it works fairly well

The way I am beating the 3 flash issue is by just putting the 2 flashes on the bottom 2 flash holder brackets.

I live ~25 minutes outside of Boston so that is a major city with major radio traffic and I find that the transmitter works well most of the time.  If I had to give it a grade I would give it an A- as I can hear my music with limited static and that is what I WANT to be able to do with my older non-Bluetooth enabled vehicle.The Belkin Tunecast plugs into my iPhone 5 even with the case on (I was surprised) and the wiring has been made stronger from earlier versions and better lengths so they don't get caught under car seats like in the past.I tune to 97.9 and this is a channel that usually only gets interference from other drivers doing the same thing I am doing so 90% of the time I am a happy listener :)**** RECOMMENDED

I assumed "Okay I'm going to learn something new!" The tech support spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. He finally told me "Give me $39, and I can fix the software in the unit." I replied "Why can't I fix it?" He said "okay," and the conversation ended. FOSCAM IS A PIECE CRAP/HUSTLER! Thank goodness for the competition!!

$review_text.: Well, the player is decent
 I seem to go through a lot of batteries
 Transferring songs on it is easy, their customer service is great

 I find the buttons a little difficult to operate
 Every time that I try to unpause a song, I end up switching songs

 I am slowly getting it to work for me


 I had one problem occur.First, I use Rhapsody to transfer songs to the device
 I also transfer from Cd's, and songs downloaded off of Internet sites


 Rhapsody claims that they require you to re-sync your device every 30 days
 About two weeks into using the player, this following scenario occurred

 The battery went dead one day

 It was several hours before I could replace the battery and resume listening


 When I replaced the battery and tried to play I kept receiving a message to sync the device

 It turned out that I had a corrupted file on the device

 It took several days to figure this out


 Their customer support was very good, and their techs took me through several steps of isolating and fixing the problem


 One I reformatted the player, and re-loaded it, it worked great, and has been ever since

 Ultimately, I found their customer support to be great.The only real drawback to it is the player controls.

$review_text.: This is my 3rd case from KAYS and they just keep getting better and better. KAYS is clearly listening to their customers.This is a very thin and lightweight case. It offers several great features that customers are looking for and also lacks in other ways.Things to look forward too.-Thin-Lightweight-Magnet sleep function case cover-Magnet door secure flap-Unobtrusive but secure mold to hold the tablet itself-Excellent cutouts for power, volume, charging port, and microphones-Several nice stand positionsNegatives...if I had to nitpick-Lots of flex of the outer case when tablet is in place-Not much drop protection-When you fold the front cover all the way back, the magnet is so strong it actually activates the screen off function.  I suggest to not press it back flush against the back.-No microfiber or even soft inner lining on the inner cover. Would be nice to see the screen protected by something soft.Overall, another fair priced, quality, well thought out case by KAYS.  I look forward to putting it through its paces over the next few weeks.

$REVIEW.: I bought this PSU because I'm building a rig that needs a high quality PSU so I decided to get the Antec HCP 750W and I absolutely love it. I love all the products that Antec makes from PSUs to cases and have always bought their products in the past. I have never had a bad experience with their products and their customer service is top notch.Antec is known for making reliable and durable PSUs and the High Current Pro 750W is no exception. The installation process is pretty straight forward and you don't need me to explain how to install it because most of us who purchase these kind of things are geeks and we know how stuff works. Another thing that I love about this PSU is that it runs cool and is very quiet. My old PSUs used to make loud noises but this one is inaudible.The Antec High Current Pro 750W is an extremely well built PSU and Antec has used high quality materials that really show when you hold it in hand. It has great sleeved cables that are nice and long and it's gold certified which is a big plus for me. The warranty is 5 years which is always nice because you never know what might happen in the future. I have had many products die on me a few days after the warranty expires and it's the worst thing that can happen. Antec's customer service is outstanding. They have always been very nice to me when I have had to return a few things in the past.The packaging is also great and Antec did a phenomenal job at making sure the PSU is well secured in the box. It runs super quiet and I can't hear a thing. I even tried running Prime95 for a few hours and I haven't heard a single noise coming from the PSU.Pros:+Quite+5 Year Warranty+Gold Certified+Great Packaging+Well sleeved cables+From AntecCons:-PriceyOverall, the Antec HPC 750W is a great power supply and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something reliable and durable. I have been building and fixing computers for as long as I can remember and I have had a lot of bad experiences with other PSUs but this one really got my attention. I give it a 10/10 for the build quality, sexiness, awesome sleeved cables, warranty and many other features that it has. Strongly recommended! I have always trusted Antec with their products and they are still working to this day.My main rig:Case: Corsair 900DGPU: EVGA GTX TitanCPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 1000WRam: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit

 They have both worked without any problems


 Use one as my time machine backup for my 2TB iMac and the other as a network drive on my wireless

 I am somewhat of a self confessed techno addict
 I can't help myself

 I have an ipod, itouch, iphone, ipad, and several android devices
 I am also pretty hard on my devices as I use them all the time.Having a scratched screen is one sure way to mess up your day


 This product is amazing in several ways that makes it superior to anything else in the market.1) It is self healing


 If you scratch it...it eventually heals itself


 Awesome.2) Self de-bubble-fy


 If you've installed screen shields, you know what I am talking about
 Those bloody bubbles are annoying as hell...and almost impossible to get rid of

 Within a week of installing this, all my bubbles went away...or I could just &#34;scratch&#34; them away to the edge pretty easily.3) Tough as nails
 I have not tried it, but according to the specs...the screen can take a real beating.

$review_text.: I have a 32" Toshiba with a beautiful screen but smaller than desired audio. It seemed that we were always turning it up to almost maximum for certain movies or TV shows just so we could understand what was being said. The solution was this Visio Sound Bar.Connected with an optical cable [AmazonBasics Toslink Digital Audio Optical Cable that had the unfortunate connection position of being perpendicular at almost dead center out of the back of the Bar which can be awkward for certain TVs like mine.] the TV was now completely at the mercy of the Bar's own volume/remote control. Ack! Another remote to keep track of. But it with a few tweaks below, you can get both sound control and the bar automatically turned on and controlled with a universal remote.Fortunately, the Sound Bar can be controlled with a universal remote like a Harmony. But I also wanted it to be controlled using the Comcast universal remote that I like. After doing some searching, here is the set-up procedure and codes for the Comcast remote: (Thanks to Comcast user rmras)After much research, here is a step-by-step for getting your Vizio Soundbar to work with the Comcast remote using EFC codes (the newer remote with the charcoal grey or the one with the red OK/Select button)Aux - Setup (2 blinks) - 11144 (2 blinks)Aux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00169 - Vol Up - Should get 2 blinksAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00168 - Vol Down - Should get 2 blinksAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00037 - Mute - Should get 2 blinksAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00165 - Power - Should get 2 blinksAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00164 - Input - Should get 2 blinksThese are optional, I didn't use them:Aux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00036 - (button to use for TVOL) - Should get 2 blinksAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00101 - (button to use for TSHD) - Should get 2 blinksYou'll want to unlock the volume control and re-lock it to the AUX button to make it a seamless experience. Directions can be found in the Comcast remote user pamphlet on this. But the codes above cannot be found there.The sound is very good without a sub-woofer and plenty loud enough. The sound is warm and not too "boomy". The size of this Bar for a 32" TV is too long, and its height may block the IR of the TV (raising the TV stand a few inches did the trick for my TV) but it will do nicely as a powerful front-projecting sound system for larger HDTVs.1/16/12 *UPDATE* from rmras for those of you who have the subwoofer with this bar:To get the subwoofer volume control to work, try these codes to control the subwoofer if you have one:Aux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00105 Sub DownAux - Setup (2 blinks) - 994 - Setup - 00040 Sub UpAnd of course you'll have to pick a button to assign them to since the Comcast remote doesn't have those buttons. You may have to try a few different buttons, i don't imagine all of the remote buttons are programmable.

Amazon(who is always awesome) overnight end me another to try, when I received it had the same issue! Before I contacted amazon again I called tamron USA, where they informed me that yes this sounds like a defect and would be fixable under warrenty. The issue though is I would have to pay to ship it to them! They made a defect product and then wanted me to pay even more money for them to fix it!!

$REVIEW.: The keyboard keys are comfortable to press, but the layout is frustrating


 Take a look at the keyboard on your computer or laptop

 Notice the following keys and where they are located:- Forward Slash and Question Mark  /  ?- Semicolon and Colon  ;  :- Left Bracket and Left Brace  [  {- Right Bracket and Right Brace  ]  }Now, imagine them gone, and the only way to access them on the keyboard is by pressing the FN (Function) key in the lower left corner and pressing another key


 For example, to type a forward slash like in a web address, you'd have to hit FN+M

 To type a question mark, hit FN+N
 To type a colon, hit FN+K
 On top of those changes, the =/+ key is next to the P key and not where you expect it
 It all takes a lot of getting used to because you basically have to retrain yourself to type on this keyboard a bit, and if you often use other computers in between your iPad then you have to remember you are using a standard keyboard layout and not this bizarre one

 You WILL be reaching for keys that don't exist at times on this keyboard.The rest of the case itself is fairly well-made and well-designed, but I have other minor gripes:- No ability to auto shutdown on close- Viewing angle not ideal if you are viewing from above the case and not at eye-level
 Depending on the table I have it on, sometimes the iPad is just too steep.I feel bad only giving this product 3 stars in a way, because it really is a great case/keyboard combo for your iPad 2..
but it's not perfect.

$REVIEW.: This is exactly what you are looking for if you want to keep the original back cover of your GS4 and adding the ability to wirelessly charge it. The resulting bulge is so subtle it doesn't cause any problem when typing on a table or even when placing the GS4 on the charging pad. Before purchasing this receiver, I had bought another receiver 1.5 mm thick, and the resulting bulge is so annoying I was willing to stop using it. You have to know if you want the receiver to properly work, you have to lay the GS4 towards the upper side of the charging pad. If you don't do so the GS4 will constantly change the charging state to not charging state and so.

$REVIEW.: This router really surprised me to be honest. Several things grabbed me right awayInterface:Let's face it, Asus have made an amazing interface for this router. I've had linksys, dlink, netgear, trendnet, all top of the line routers from these companies and neither can match the simplicity and effectiveness of Asus guiRange:Very very very good range. I bought a repeater as well, because my previous router had very weak range in my kitchen, but with this router it is now just pointless. It covers the whole apartment and the far off rooms have decent coverageSpeed:Well the speed is also very nice. I compare it by downloading stuff from my NAS through wireless. So far I've had these:Linksys WRT 610 - 3 mb/sDlink DIR 655 - 7 mb/sNetgear - 6 mb/sTrendnet - 8 mb/sAsus RT-N66u - 17 mb/sAsus currently holds the top among the routers I've had. Given the speed is not constant and it drops do 11-12 mb/s, but it a rate I see and I've never seen before.Overall, very nice purchase

$REVIEW.: The Gorillapod line of tripods are so simple you'd think any number of other companies would have come out with identical designs. And yet, while a number of companies have tried cloning the Gorillapod, none that I've found even come close in quality and ease of use. It's a simple enough design. The legs are made of a modular industrial hose material (clever!), and they're topped with an ultra-simple quick release fitting that allows you to attach and detach the tripod instantly from the camera.I find my Gorillapod particularly indispensable for nature photography with point-and-shoot cameras. They typically have relatively slow lenses, compared to DSLRs, so long-ish exposures tend to be the rule. With the Gorillapod I can set up my photo and trigger the camera via the self-timer without worrying of camera-shake induced blur. Night photography is another application where the Gorillapod shines.As other reviewers have noted, this particular model is designed for lightweight point-and-shoot cameras only; there are larger, more heavy duty models available for DSLRs and heavy P&S; cameras. I find this one works just find with my old Canon Digital Elph and my Lumix LS6.

$REVIEW.: It does what I need it to do and that is key out. I do have to have my camera setting just right because its not quite as light a green as I thought it would be but it keys out pretty good when lit correctly. As far as people complaining about it being wrinkled run it through the dry and it comes out pretty good. Any back drop will have wrinkles if you don't set it up correctly. After you hang it on your backdrop you need  to pull it tight and clamp it on the sides. Getting it tight is what gets the wrinkles out. Its not a curtain, its not supposed to just hang there.  The only thing I found was that the heam was a little two small when I ran my back drop pole through it  and the material can rip fairly easy if your not careful.

$review_text.: This antenna is easy to install, and the price is nice. I get over 30 channels and use it with a small companion amplifier. I still get drop outs on occasion, especially when a weather front is moving through the area. The bottom line is: I cut the cable and am saving a lot of money. I have no regrets. The 30 channels that I get along with streaming is all I can ask for. I gave it four stars instead of five because of the drop outs. But I think weather and plane (I'm between an airport and a tv signal tower) related drops are the norm.

Unfortunately I did not read closely enough in the reviews to find out there is NO MUTE function on the headset, making it absolutely useless in conference calls!Pros:1) Speakerphone is very clear and loud.2) Handset is very clearCons:1) No mute function on the headset2) Having to transfer the call to the headset is annoying3) Speakerphone microphone is not very sensitive


People cannot hear me on speakerphone but I can hear them clearly.4) The handsets perpetually reads "New Voice Mail" but there is no voice mail!5) Clicking any buttons during a call is VERY loud on the other end.In summary:I can't use the wireless headset due to not muting, and I can't use the speakerphone because others can't hear me talk.Therefore there is absolutely nothing special about this device over a $10 cordless phone.Will be returning for something cheaper.

$REVIEW.: The case felt sturdy and the whole thing seemed great at first
I would have given it a 4 or 5 star that first week.I had to throw it away in less than two months
The case is not actually pink, it just has a pink cloth glued on it, with the smart cover sewn on the outside of it


There is a thin band of colored glue that covers the edges of the fabric
This glue-ish material rubs off and peels if you use your iPad daily

After it gets peeled off, which does not seem like a big deal, the moisture from your hand holding the iPad the same way everyday will cause the fabric to develop huge air pockets and come unglued from the gray case
Before you know it, you have to smooth it out daily with a credit card and some household glue
When it started to come apart, it came apart FAST

Do NOT get this pink model
Get one where the plastic case itself is the color you want, sans glued-on coverings.

$REVIEW.: Other reviewers have noted that once you put the covers in place with the double sided tape "it's on for good"


 That's not been the case for me


 I have painted dry wall and some of these lengths have come loose

 This is in spite of making sure the walls were dirt and dust free.

$review_text.: If I had reviewed this item one month ago, it might have gotten two stars.  Unfortunately, the longer I used it, the more resentment and frustration I felt towards this mouse/keyboard combo.I'll start with the keyboard: it's comfortable to type on.  The keys have a nice tactile feel; nothing outstanding, but it feels better than many keyboards I have used.  However, it uses a non-standard layout for the home, end, and delete keys which can be difficult to get used to.The mouse is smaller than average, but I knew that when I bought it--I thought I would simply get used to it.  I didn't.  I missed the ergonomic feel of a mouse I could rest my hand on comfortably.  Also, the "feet" on the mouse (that it uses to glide across the surface) don't work very well.  At times, they wouldn't "glide" as much as "rub" across the surface of my mousepad... giving the impression that the mouse wanted to tip over to an extent.  This was annoying.This next part is 90% of the reason I'm giving this item one star: The responsiveness of both the mouse and keyboard are terrible.  So bad, in fact, that they're nearly unusable.  Forget about wanting to walk to your computer, sit down, move your mouse to wake up your screen, and start typing.  You'll wait a full 15-20 seconds AFTER your computer has woken up for your mouse to wake up.  Even then, even if you mashed some keys on your keyboard at the same time you woke up your mouse, they keyboard will take longer.  Start typing a word.  There is a delayed response.  The first letter appears, then nothing after that.  Assume the keyboard didn't read your input, so type it again.  Wait three seconds.  Stare at your screen in frustration as "SuddenSuddenlyly" appears on your screen.  Yeah, better get used to that.  I'm not a wireless hater!  I have a Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse combo at work that I absolutely LOVE.  It's as responsive and precise as a wired mouse or keyboard.  But this Logitech... it's total garbage.

$REVIEW.: I'm not sure if I exactly like how the keys punch, they don't have a soft feel to them.  Other keyboards I've owned have a distinct rubbery feel to the keys(how the punch), these all all plastic and hard.  Its rather loud if you type fast, it just doesn't feel smooth and modern to me.  It looks fantastic, had no trouble pairing it with my pc.  It's smaller than I expected and I like that about it.  I don't like where the delete key is located, I have to look to find it each time yet, it's located above the backspace key along with the insert key, just in a strange spot.

$review_text.: I bought this unit to replace a failing APC1500VA LCD unit that almost wiped out my Gigabyte motherboard (aka mobo). Had to reset some of the bios settings to get the mobo to work properly.The Tripp-Lite (aka TL) runs much cooler than my Ultra 1025AP and APC BX1300LCD units. The TL has software capability (you have to go to TL's website to download the software) that will properly save your files and shut down your computer or other equipment within a matter of minutes after going into battery run mode during power outages. This unit has 5 surge suppression receptacles and 5 backup receptacles. Some users do not like the bright front panel display light but I don't consider it so bright for it to be a problem since the office room is usually dark anyway. This unit is not as pricey as the APC units are. I recommend this unit.

$REVIEW.: Hi Everyone,I've had the Marantz NR1402 for about 10 months and I love it. You've read the other reviewsso I won't repeat those, but for me the most important feature:THE NR1402 RECEIVER RUNS COOL - NOT HOT - EVEN MOUNTED INSIDE AN ENCLOSED CABINET!My receiver is mounted in a floor cabinet in a space 21" wide, 19" deep, and only 5" high (closed inthe back).  That means that there is only 3/4" above the top of the receiver and there is very littleventilation.  I tested the receiver on several medium-loud movies, and it never got hot - barely warm.In fact, you can leave it on all day and it still runs cool.  My previous Pioneer behemoth ran so hotthat I had to place it behind the cabinet in a wide open space.  And it still ran too hot to the touch!Highly recommended !!Tom K.

$review_text.: I purchased this to monitor the house remotely. It saved me a couple hundred dollars because I saw that the home aid was leaving up to 2 hours early but charging me the entire time, and I got a refund for those hours. I purchased a second one when it became available. The new one, which I just received this past week, has a new wiring setup. Instead of having a bundle of different connection wires from the camera, there is now only one wire which plugs into a converter box that all the other connection type wires plug into. Makes for a neater instillation. Also I think the wire to the power source is longer. The other change is that the software has been upgraded to give more storage options.Set up with a linksys router to work over the internet is very hard. The auto plug and play does not work with a linksys. As a matter of fact, I was unsuccessful to get the camera to work over the internet with my router. After trying for a week, I finally contacted customer support. They emailed me back right away, and I ended up granting them remote access to my router and they had it working in about 5 minutes. Once I saw the settings they used it was very easy for me to get my new camera set up. Took me 5 minutes. If you can't get yours to work with your linksys router you can comment me and I can tell you how to do it. Googling for this info is useless because there is so much bad information out there. I can't stress how knowledgeable support is, and the info they supply in the booklet. They go into detail how to get a DN so you can use the same 'link' over the internet even if your IP address changes. They also discuss how to set up an ftp server if you want to send pictures automatically to your PC or to a hard drive on your network and to have pictures sent automatically to gmail.They supply you with a CD that has two programs on it. One is just to detect your camera on your network, and the other is to view your camera(s). Since I have two now, when I click the link to the program, two of the 4 'boxes' have my cam1 and cam2. You can also just open two browsers for the two cams, but you do not hear audio over the internet. The 'Multilive' software has audio.The two programs on the CD didn't set themselves up that smoothly, for some reason the programs only detected my new camera. But it was easy to manually add my first camera, just typed in the intranet IP and assigned it which box to display in.The camera comes with an SD card that you can have the camera record to. The biggest pain for me is, I download the video which is great, but it takes a couple minutes to download. It is sloooow. I would like to just get the SD card and pop it into the reader and into my computer, but it is to much of a pain to get the SD card. Have to unscrew the front of the camera to get it and I can't be bothered, I can't reach the camera that easily.In summary:ProsHas a great picture either with light or in pitch darkness of night.Good remote interface on you PC with many options to tweek the video.Records video with many options how, such as 'On Aarm', and where to record the video.Great mounting hardware, easy to install.The IT info is very good and explained in a way that non network people can understand.Customer support is great.ConsIt is hard to figure out how to get it to work over the internet with a linksys router for the first time.Downloading the video remotely from the SD card takes a long time and getting the SD card to get the video fast, usually isn't practical.

On 8/14 I received the iPod and attempted to download music to no avail
I restored the iPod and attempted to download 4 times, but it would always lock up after only a few songs


After notifying Amazon, lalakers699 sent me an email begging me to withdraw my complaint because it would keep him from supporting his family

He promised to make it good

He refunded $15 for my trouble and promised another iPod

I mailed it back to the address on the package on 8/17 and enclosed the mailing label but foolishly forgot to get tracking.So now he claims he never received it.So I guess it could have been lost in the mail, and it's my word against his, but the bottom line is that I have no iPod and I've lost $82.46.

$review_text.: I purchased two of these processors for two separate projects and I am extremely happy with both.  One was built into a home server using WHS 2011 OEM software and it works great.  The other is a security video camera system, using Vista 32 bit operating system, that records video 24/7 outside of my home.  It also is a workhorse and without any problems.This CPU features 2.93 GHz clock speed with dual cores and has a 2 MB cache for fast operation.  I used a Gigabyte mother board with a 775 socket on both systems and the CPU was easy to overclock.  I reduced the clock speed back down to the standard 2.93 GHz and the CPU is rated at 65 watts at that level.  Since both systems are on 24/7 it allows them to run cool and use less power.I am happy with the performance of this CPU and it is a good buy for the price and performance you get for the money.

$REVIEW.: The plastic edges are the only thing holding your $600+ iPad
It is a tight fit for the ipad3

I plan on using rubber bands all around it incase one of the lip edges pops off
The case is difficult at first to put on and take off


I wish the plastic was a bit stronger or had clips that fasten to secure the case to the ipad
Will work great inside, but not for sure how well it work outdoors


May need to build some kind of screen hood when shooting outdoors in bright sunlight.

$REVIEW.: I decided to replace my Midland desktop radio with a newer model that has some additional and better features. I think the portability of this radio is somewhat limited.Finding the owners manual is a trick. It's taped inside the packaging, so you have to hunt for it a little bit. Once you find it you'll need a magnifying glass to read it. It's better to go to the Midland site and download the PDF version of the manual.A lot of the information that should be included with the manual you have to read through the FAQ section of the site. I gained more information about the radio from the customer reviews here than I did on the Midland site.Contacting Midland tech support by phone was a waste of time. The first time I called I was on hold for 45 minutes and gave up. When I called by the second time I got a recording that tech support was close through the holidays and wouldn't reopen until for another week. I also tried the email option, but after 6 business days and no response I resorted to reading through the reviews here to find my answer.The manual has NO information or reference to the battery or the charging. When you put the radio on the charging stand a "charging" light appears, but you never know when or if the battery is fully charged. Pretty much the same with plugging the adapter directly into the radio. The battery indicator just blinks, but you never know when the battery is fully charged. There's also no way to tell what the battery status is as the only time the battery indicator appears is when the battery is low. What a poor design.How hard would it be to include some basic information on how long it would take to fully charge a battery or how long the battery is supposed to last in a manual? They do kindly provide information on how you can purchase additional batteries.The battery they include seems to be pretty useless. After a 24-hr charge it only lasted about 4 hrs on stand-by. A second charge was about the same. That would be pretty useless during a power outage.What good is a portable radio with a rechargeable battery during a power outage if the only only way you can power the radio or recharge the battery requires a/c current? How hard would it have been or how much extra would it have cost to simply include a car charger in with the radio?Overall, I like the design and features of the radio. It's easy to set up and program. My biggest gripe is about the lack of information and what appears to be a cheap battery and the charging issues stated above.One plus is the price I paid here was much lower than purchasing at a local store and it's almost 50% cheaper than the selling price directly from Midland.
$review_summary.: Okay, but they need a version 3 of this radio

$review_text.: I wanted to like it.  It's a speaker system that is the size and shape of a thermos.  Unfortunately the sound quality is mediocre to say the least.  High frequencies are shrieky (as if they're getting cut off into a square wave), and there's practically no output below 100hz (it really is that bad).  They're kinda loud for the size, so if that rocks your boat, then they're good.  I guess they'd be ok for a micro PA system (but really you could yell louder).  Anyway, eventually I settled for a Creative T20 speakers, and for portable use, I have a small lead battery and t20's sounds a lot better, bassier, and louder than those.  Long story short, this is a good idea in terms of portability and looks, but just not executed well enough for me in terms of sound quality.

$REVIEW.: Since I got my first DVD burner with my G4 Mac, I've been buying Memorex for creating video DVDs, as they were readily available. In the last 6 years, I think I've had maybe 10 coasters. And only recently have I come across my first DVD player that wouldn't play these discs. I wish I could remeber the brand, but it escapes me at the moment. I'll continue to buy them as they have performed great for me.I've used them for backup as well asnd have seen a couple of verification errors when done. Unfortunately I haven't had other brands of DVDs on hand to test, but I still hold the Memorex brand in high regards.It's not always the best idea to burn at the highest speed anyway since this can introduce errors, no matter what brand you use. Many repilcation companies will tell you that they burn at no higher speeds than 4x.

It goes through batteries pretty quickly if your just using the smaller size.  I bought a generic large capacity battery and was able to get through all of a wedding reception no problem.  It is funny when people complain about how bright it is.  If it wasn't somewhat bright, it wouldn't work, unless you want the entire video shot in night mode, I'm going to need light.

The battery life is better, which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod, except for the color screen/photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars. There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there, at a much lower cost. Check out the Archos Gmini 400(can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod), iRiver iHP-320(bundled with FM Radio, In-line recording, voice recording), or Cowon iAudio M5(same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller).[...]

$review_text.: I received the iMainGo 2 to review on my blog and loved it so much I later ordered one for my mom


 I've never used a docking station or anything for my iPod because my mom had one and the sound quality was terrible, as were others that my friends have used


 I was a little skeptical about how well the iMainGo 2 would sound but it is MUCH better than any big docking station I have listened to

 I personally wanted the iMainGo 2 because of its portability and the fact that it runs on batteries
 I also love that it has a clear screen on the back so that I can play movies on my iPod and let my 2-year-old watch them


 We used this a lot when we went camping earlier this year, and also for playing music in the tent


 I don't use it much at home because I have an Apple TV to stream music from iTunes, but it is perfect for camping trips, and we also used it when we stayed at Grandma's for a few days where she doesn't have a TV or DVD player downstairs, so my son was able to watch movies all he wanted on my iPod

 We could even take it out in the screen room and he would sit and watch movies while we had our coffee and talked.The batteries last a long time
 I have rarely had to change them, though we have not it a whole lot, just camping and at grandma's


 My mom listens to music quite a bit and also has forgotten to turn it off sometimes so she has had to change her batteries more than I have.

$SUMMARY.: Great sound for portable speakers!

$review_text.: We bought this to evaluate its suitability as a headset adapter for use with Skype on Macintosh

 We found that it is inferior in all respects to a similar product by the same manufacturer, theSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, C-Media Chipset, RoHS

 Avoid this 7.1 version and get the simpler one for the same price that lacks the chintzy buttons, has correct color coding, a smaller and shorter housing, better build quality, and is better identified in OS X.As other commenters have noted, the exterior buttons are very flimsy and do feel like they could break with a strong push


 Their only function is to send a signal to the computer to change the software volume level, which can also be easily done using the volume control in the operating system or via the keyboard if it has multimedia buttons

 On many computers the USB ports are inaccessible anyway, so why bother adding these cheap buttons that weaken the whole case, when many people can't even reach them?The jacks are color coded in yellow and black, not the standard pink and green that headset jacks use
 For what possible reason?  Yellow plastic was cheaper?  They are also labeled with tiny icons that are very hard to tell apart, and the labels are not next to the jacks but on the top face with all the buttons.The USB plug on our unit is angled off-center, again suggesting shoddy construction.On the plus side - it does work as advertised
 Although the device is identified as "Unknown USB Audio Device" by OS X, it does input and output sound fine, and loudly

 The chipset is advertised on the box as the C-Media CM119, and it's a USB 2.0 device
 The "virtual 7.1" gimmick appears to be "3d surround sound" software by Xear, which comes on a mini-CD and is Windows only
 I think it's safe to say this is basically a non-feature.It would be a marginally acceptable solution to using a headset with a Mac or other computer that lacks a headphone jack, but again the similar yet entirely superiorSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapteris a far better choice


 See my review of that device on its product page for more info.

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying, if you like a lot of bass these earbuds are not for you


There is nothing WRONG with the bass, they are just not heavy on bass


If bass is important to you, try theKlipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones

I've owned these for over two years, and they are really great
They are around the same price point as these, but with a much deeper sound


It really is going to depend on your music and sound taste to determine which set will best suite your needs.The buds are very comfortable, and with two of each size, you are sure to find a size that is suitable for your ears and you will always have a backup


You will also receive a cleaning tool, which is pretty standard with headphones in this price point


A nice, although not often used, bonus with this set is the airplane adaptor


Airplane headphones, complimentary or not, are never comfortable

This adaptor allows you to use your own headset while you watch the in-flight movie.My only real annoyance with this set if the fact that you cannot fit the cleaning tool, airplane adaptor and extra ear tips in the carry case

I don't know about your house, but in my house loose accessory tools have a way of losing themselves.

$REVIEW.: I like this drive.  Small and light weight, and rubber armored.  I like using it with my netbook and notebook computers.  Store my music, videos, and karaoke on it, so I can transfer listening to any of my computers.  Downloads are somewhat slow for very large files, but not much longer than expected.  USB powered, so no need for an external power supply, bu tcan drain your portable computers battery if you use it a lot.  I recommend this one.

I LOVE the fact that the scroll wheel allows you to scroll left and right, in addition to vertical scrolling!If you are looking for an affordable, comfortable to use, corded mouse, that never runs out of battery, then look no further!

$REVIEW.: We bought these two new Garmin Nuvis to replace two that were about 8 years old.  We were not disappointed in the newer ones at all.  These Garmins take us places we need to go.  For some unknown reason, my husband cannot drive past the VA in Albuquerque; his Garmin really helps him get around town.  I use mine to be able to get to my step-daughter's house (I always get lost when trying to get there) and go past her street.  With this Garmin, I turn at the right block.  If you need something to help you get from Point A to Point B, you cannot go wrong with the Garmin Nuvi.  We even use ours when we go out of town and it gets us there with no problems at all.

$REVIEW.: This is not a bad TV for the money, if a small TV with a digital tuner is what you are looking for.  I bought this unit to replace my older analog handheld TV which will be rendered useless after June 12, and the digital TV changeover.The internal battery is a very hard option to find in a TV of this size, and makes the Axion all that much more portable.  The battery seems to last a long time, even on full brightness.The additional, remote antenna is very helpful.  Unless you are in a strong digital signal area, it will work better than the built in antenna.The handheld remote control is kind of a joke in my opinion, because the screen is so small that the TV will never be more than an arms length away and then you can just reach over and turn the channel.  I would have  liked a small carrying case instead of the remote control.

$review_text.: OK..

full disclosure..

I bought this for my wife because her old MP3 player / FM radio finally died
She is not much for music, so this is mainly a radio for her as she works.I recieved it 3 days ago


It took me no time to USB-it to my computer, transfer some MP3's, set up a couple of station presets, charge it, and we were ready to go!It looks like the battery does not last 24 hours..

but maybe 16

Not too terrible, so she'll have to remember to recharge more often, but that's minor, as it's more that 2 full work days for her (maybe 3).Sound is good, reception is good
2 GB for under $50, plus an expansion slot

Ease of operation is great.Great buy.

$REVIEW.: I recently upgraded from a HD 4670 video card to this XFX HD 5770 and i have to say i am blown away. I am playing starcraft 2 on extreme (the highest setting possible) and it is smooth as butter. I also tested out bad company 2 on high and i am getting a steady 50-60 FPS.The packaging is very professional and makes you feel as if your money was well invested. The card itself is rather large but i managed to fit it inside my micro atx case (barely). The do not disturb door hanger is Hilarius and cool. I want to mention i did not get a crossfire bridge with this card but i have no need for one (something to consider if you want to buy these for crossfire.The part that blows me away are my computer specs. I am running a dual core e5300 overclocked @3.12 ghz, 4gb of 800 mhz ram, GA-G31M-ES2L motherboard, corsair cx500 psu. These are rather low specs but i manage to run games like starcraft 2 and bad company 2 on max with great performance... the XFX HD 5770 is simply amazing. My previous graphics index with my 4670 was a 6.7, with this 5770 both my graphics indexes are 7.4!I had some concerns with the temperature with this card in my small micro atx case. Using GPU-Z to monitor the temps i am getting around 48-50c idle and 66c max testing games like starcraft 2 and bad company 2 which is great. Overall this is a great buy and such a low price. If you buy a gtx 550 or 460 it will cost you a lot more. I paid $125 for the 5770 and i got a $25 rebate, ATI dominates.

$review_text.: I have owned this t.v. for just about a year.I bought it the day after Christams last year when my 65" died.I knew I wasn't going smaller and I needed to buy local cause I needed it next day which was Saturday.I paid a little more for local, but they gave me a free DVI to HDMI cable and HDMI cables and free delivery.And they took out my old 65" for free.On to the t.v.This has been a great DLP for me. I am an avid t.v. and movie watcher. I would say honestly at least 8-10 hours a day.I run a media center PC - HDMI, DirecTV HD-DVR - HDMI, Wii - Component - X-box 360, PS3, Upconverting DVD player all through an HDMI switch and everything works great.Picture is awesome on HD sources, front HDMI works great with my Creative Vado-HD.Took a little bit to get all the connections, labels, and settings the way I wanted but I haven't changed anything in a year.I run it in power saving mode on startup but really it takes less than 20 seconds to get going.I also keep the screen set at low as opposed to bright since I know I watch a lot of t.v.I just ordered a replacement lamp for $100 from Mitsubishi, don't order one anywhere else or you are paying too much.My old one hasn't died yet, but I know it should be coming soon with the amount I watch.I have only had one problem since I got it and that was about a month after buying it.It wouldn't turn on and kept shutting off with a red flashing code.They were going to replace it for me but it would take a week and I would have to have a little 42" in the mean time... no way.Salesman who sold it to me lives directly across the steet and agreed to look at it that night.Took off the back panel and found the cord for the cooling fan on the lamp was strung really tight at the factory. (after I found online that the flashing code was a lamp problem, he knew where to check.)He released one of the clips to release tension and I have been running great for the past 11 months.I do have a slight sound issue sometimes in the right speaker, almost sounds blown but for the most part I have tuned it out.When watching a movie etc I use surround sound.Pros -Screen sizePicture qualityWeight - my old 65" Toshiba weighed 468 pounds lolInputsLooksCons -SpeakersReally nothing else for meI do have the matching stand for it and it puts the t.v.at the perfect height and the t.v. looks awesome on it.Update 4+ years later, I use my t.v. a lot and there are days it's on for over 24 hours straight.Still a beautiful picture and 2 bulbs later.I have 2 extras since Mitsubishi is no longer making DLP anymore so I stocked up.I will keep this set until it just plain dies.

$REVIEW.: After going through 3 pair of poorly made, terrible sounding computer speakers I stumbled across these. I was somewhat familiar with M-Audio products because I have a pair of their studio monitors for my electronic drum set and have been quite happy with them. These speakers are a miniature version of those. They're old school and I like that - big, beefy, and no subwoofer required. They produce big, clear sound at any volume. Yes, they're quite a bit bigger than your normal computer speakers, but the great sound and high quality construction more than compensate. I have a feeling this will be my last pair of computer speakers and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

It has no volume control of its own -- you regular volume from your iPad or other computer.  Compact enough to carry around in, say, a brief case or backpack.

$REVIEW.: I will preface my review by saying that I love listening to music (and TV and movies) through head phones.  I will also say that I am not an over the top audiophile.  I never owned a reel to reel tape player.  I consider good quality digital recordings with a nice equalized sound to be good enough.I like the clear sound and the removal of other background noise that is achieved by wearing these headphones.  The sound quality is quite good (again disclaimer - that's coming from me not a sound geek) and I find these to be very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I also really appreciate how these can fold down to a fairly small size as compared to how large they are when worn.  The volume control on the cord is a nice extra touch that I find myself using all the time.Overall I consider these to be a perfect pair of headphones to wear while watching something on a tablet or listening to something on an MP3 player in a room where others don't want to hear what you hear.Highly recommended.

Pressing the DPI button on top causes tiny brightness increase in blue LED inside mouse.&#8226; 3 foot cord, braided.&#8226; Good for small hands, this is a regular sized desk mouse.&#8226; Nice raised texture on scroll wheel, my favorite feature of this mouse so far.&#8226; Nice blue LED through dark translucent honeycomb plastic on the palm rest&#8226; Blue LED is not overly bright, but pretty.  Hidden by your hand when in use. Always on.&#8226; Matte painted finish, brushed steel color&#8226; Holes and grooves on sides of mouse provide good grip.&#8226; Light to medium weight mouse&#8226; Standard four glide points under mouse, so not quite as smooth on the mouse pad as mice that have larger glide stickers on the bottom.&#8226; Might not be as good for large hands.&#8226; Red tracking laser on the bottom leaks through under right mouse button and can shine in the eyes of anybody seated in  front of you or reflect off your monitor.&#8226; No rubberized texture.&#8226; Loud button clicks.I think it's a good value for $10, but not as good as gaming mice $20 and up.

$review_text.: This case is completely satisfactory with minor details that might be improved


Everything is accessible on the tablet, nothing is interfered with in the use of the tablet
I did find the elastic for the pen or stylus more or less useless

Managed to rip the soft rubber tip off my stylus trying to put it in the elastic, but no big deal I never used the stylus much anyway.I bought the black version because i was looking for a business appearance


The white stitching it had when it arrived looked a little more like cowboy raw, not very business looking, but a little black shoe polish took care of that

The only thing I can think of that might improve this case would be a loop somewhere for a lanyard

I can't speak for others, but I tend to drop my tablet every once in awhile, so I ran a black nylon string through the top holes cut for the speakers inside across the back of the tablet


Then left enough of a loop sticking out of the bottom speaker holes,to slip my hand through, so when I carry it, if it slips from the hand,  I can't really drop it
I haven't found this interferes with the sound from the speakers, but I pretty much use buds with my Nexus anyway


I guess a person could use the elastic loop to attach a lanyard, but I'm not sure I would trust that.The material does look pretty much like leather, having fixed the white stitching I like the look of the case
 Would be nice if it were available in dark brown leather appearance.

$REVIEW.: I have three of these.  I believe this is an older design but is still being sold as I bought all of mine at different times.  My first one several years ago and the third one just recently (end of 2013).  This was one of the best buys for capacity and price then and amazingly still is.  As you can imagine I've had lots of power outages and these things have been lifesavers (well computer savers).  I use them at home and at the office.  It has plenty of information you need on the lcd.  It's reliable and not fussy, and just plain does what it's suppose to.  The capacity is nice so I can run a lot off it and get enough backup time (for me).  In my office I use clear wireless internet so that's plugged in, my wireless router, pc, two monitors, a laser printer, voip modem, phone, NAS.  If the power goes out (which it does often for a few seconds or minutes) I can just keep on working (with internet) and not miss a beat.

Use as a big tablet for reading graphics-intensive books, playing games, etc., as a laptop for productivity, or plug into my Anker USB dock and use as a capable desktop PC. Even works well for cone beam CT interpretation and display, so I have been pleasantly surprised by the graphics capabilities (Not a hard-core gamer, obviously.)I like the keyboard, overall build style, and solid quality feel.Small, thin, and light enough for easy transport as ultrabooks go.Screen performs well.Long battery life of 6-8 hours or so.Windows 8.1 brings a lot of fun and useful new functionality to the Windows experience compared to 7.Cons: Updating from Windows 8 to 8.1 took a long time during the first couple of days, kind of spoils the new PC experience. Also, Windows 8.1 still feels a bit unfinished, as Microsoft is still refining it. (Very usable and enjoyable for me though.)Touch screen pretty reflectiveNot really a featherweightStereo speakers are both on the right side of the screenOverall, the most fun I have had with a computer. I can't believe all they pack into this little machine!

My most critical question was whether the Media Player is compatible with other Brand other than Sony
He researched and double confirm with his Supervisor and came back with a &#34;Yes&#34; it is compatible with other brand TV..


even though the Amazon specs says it is not compatible with other brand
I bought the Player and tested it
Not working and called Sony Tech Support


TS says it is not compatible with other brand other than Sony


To me, it is kind of stupid to limit the product to just Sony

They slip off  your head  too easy I shake my head or sit back they slip off

i don't like the mic interface

when you turn the mic on you hear yourself and the backround sounds

 because its going through the digital box


The sound quality is very tinny even with  eq adjustments from the digital box.


the bass response is pretty good


 They arnt worth 80 bucks


my old 30 buck z1's had all around better response and were not tinny
I may return them

i am just Not impressed with the surround sound aspect

 The sound becomes hissy like your listening to a low quality mp3


i may just get a refund and buy some normal stereo headphones
i cant really recommend a different pair because these are my first digital headphones
i usually use analog stereo ones

On the Amazon they recommended this for Seagate HDD but there was no way to fit GoFlex HDD in it!!! I kept searching and I found those - working PERFECT!!! They offer enough space for Seagate HDDs, you can easy put in and take out HDD without any problems. Case is hard enough to protect your disk and made from good material with soft coushion inside. There is also pocket as presented on the picture of product where you can put you cable. With GoFlex series there are different adaptor available - I bought eSata adapter and I can keep it in this case also without any problem - cable is permanently attached to adapter.  Don't waist you money, avoid frustration and returning other cases - if you have Segate GoFlex 2,5&#34; External HDD (or similar disk of this size) just buy this one and you won't be disappointed.

$review_text.: So the image quality is utterly outstanding
 My NEX7 + Zeiss 24 1.8 can't touch it

 And my A99 with the Rokinon 35mm 1.4 still geats beat by it, by a smidgen

HOWEVER!!!I could write thousands of words on why I don't like this camera and why it went back after two days of using it.Basically, this was going to be the answer to my dream camera, but Sony sacrificed so much to make it tiny that it just was unusable for me.1
 The battery life is an utter joke
 My NEX 7 doesn't get too many shots as it is, but they decided to use the RX100 battery, which is not even have the size--despite it being a full frame camera

 Forget measuring life in shots...you can't carry this around while on for more than 50 mins of use without it going low

 I thought I had a bad battery, but I ordered a backup and nope--this thing burns through them like crazy.2


 The flash is a devolution in design

 Anyone who has shot with an NEX7, 6, or Fuji X-E1 knows how AMAZING the tilt able pop-up flash is


 You can use it to bounce flash in a room and get gorgeous light
 They engineered the RX1 to pop up LOCKED FORWARD so you can only use head-on flash, which is just stupid.3

 #2 would not be such a problem, if I could use the hotshoe for a flash trigger...except...there is no EVF


 So I need to use the hotshoe for an EVF


 Oh, except that I need to put the grip on the hotshoe because the camera is so tiny that there is no way you can use the controls in manual mode if you have averaged sized hands and are trying to set the shutter speed quickly without moving it away from your face.I could go on, but these are the biggies


 Bottom line is that Sony made it too tiny


 The NEX 7 is already small enough, and it has a great grip, controls, and room for an EVF AND hotshoe

 This is a POINT AND SHOOT!!!  Nothing more!!!  If you buy it as a point and shoot you will love it (except for battery life).

My pair arrived yesterday, so the drivers have not been burnt in. The sound image still vibrates (in a range of about 5%). Although the frequency throughput is 50-27kHz within 3dB, the usual two-way speaker problem is present: there are holes in the midrange. You will probably like these if you have not heard any better. My Martin-Logan Motion 12s sound a whole lot better as fronts. Once the drivers are burnt in, the sound stage will probably settle (although this is not sure, because the bass/mid drivers have extremely soft diaphragms, which can result in permanent (although less than 5%) distortion. I was considering using eight of these for 7.1, but they failed as front speakers. The surprise came when I installed them as centers; I have never heard anything better coming out from center speakers in any price range. They create a true theater ambiance with my HK AVR-240.

So why won't they let me do a backup to a networked location?  Say for example put the USB on a server or PC in another room or another building?  Why is Amazon S3 the only option?  Seems it would be easy enough to point it to any url or network share.  I guess it does the basics, but when you get into the &#34;fine print&#34; it may or may not do what you thought it would before purchasing.  If you want to use some of the more esoteric features that are built in, or even moreso the add-on &#34;Packages&#34;, be sure to read the manual closely before taking the plunge.

$REVIEW.: This AV receiver is one I did not expect to buy. I had been looking mostly at Harman Kardon and Denon, which are both high priced but brands I have no issues with. Sony, on the other hand, is a company I've been weary of lately (mostly because their newer products feel poorly designed and cheaply made). This receiver is not what I expected from Sony. It is enclosed in a very nice full metal casing, has 7.1 channels (130 Watts per channel), a very nice remote, and excellent performance. I decided to buy this mostly because the Harman Kardon and Denon receivers felt a bit overpriced for what I needed. I have a JBL Cinema 500 sound system (only 5.1 channels) and didn't need a "top-of-the-line" receiver to use with them. This was an excellent deal! Although, on a side note, I feel like this is the only area where Sony still feels relevant. I connected my speakers (which was very easy), chose my setup using the display on the front (more on that in a minute), connected my consoles, and was up and running with no issues--a painless process (10 minutes or less).Now, here are the only real issues I have with this receiver, but they can easily be justified because of the lower price:--No on-screen settings menu. This gets really annoying when you have to navigate every setting on the front LCD.--Standby. I understand why this exists, but I get frustrated when it goes into standby every 30 minutes. I have turned it off for every source I have connected, but it refuses to stay on. My TV shuts off when no HDMI signal is detected, so once this goes into standby, I have about 1 minute to turn it back on before my set powers down.--Size. As with any receiver, this thing is big, heavy, and...well, just big. This is only annoying if you have limited space near your TV, and want it to be by your TV.Now, performance. I haven't had any issues with the performance of this receiver, I can't say much more than that, but everything functions just the way I would want it to. My speakers have a maximum wattage of about 100W, so I've never turned the volume up all the way. I have gone to about 40 on the dial, and that was almost too loud. So, I cannot imagine what 100 would be like.Overall, this is an incredible buy if you can get it for under $200. I love how Sony has a two (2) year parts and labor warranty on this, and I don't expect there to be any issues with it. My last receiver lasted 9 years before I replaced it, and it was still working. I would recommend this if you need an inexpensive, nice, simple, and great performing receiver.

$REVIEW.: Even though this was a simple and cheap copuler I was pleasantly surprised by this. I've had it for a little over 2 years now and it is still going strong.The reason I've been impressed by this is because I have two TVs and two XBOX 360s setup side by side in my living room. One TV is fairly larger than the other so it is the primary TV. 99% of my TV use is DVDs, games, and Netflix. If I'm alone I play games on my XBOX on the main TV otherwise I'll switch it to the other TV. So this coupler was used as a cheap alternative to getting a switch. After 2 years of continuous plugging and unplugging cables into this coupler it has held up.Long story short, this coupler has been under heavy use and constant plugging/unplugging and it is still working fine. Never had any problems with it.

The sides are opened for the charging plug and the ear buds. There is a" The  smart feature "when you open the flap ,the tablet comes on ,close the flap , the tablet turns off works very well for me .There are holes where the speakers are.There is a 1" wide elastic band on the side open ended side of the case for a stylus.And on the inner flap that covers the screen there is 3-1/2" by 2" open pocket for a license ,credit or gas card.And a 1" by 1-1/2" open pocket for what I believe might be for a key? Also it has a 5-3/4" by 1" soft elastic strap for you to hold your tablet securely and comfortably in the palm of your hand.The outer side of this case is a soft supple leather and I found it has been easy to wipe clean. I have read some reviews saying their case wasn't real leather .I'm happy to say my case is leather .I am very confident giving this case a 5 star review.THANKS FOR READING, BYE.

$REVIEW.: I got this lens for my Nikon D40 and it takes some good shots and some not so good shots, but that is true for a lot of lenses if you don't have a steady hand.  But, if you keep a steady hand, you will get good results with this lens. I do have some nice shots of birds and landscapes.It all depends on the settings used and the lighting. I've noticed, latley, the lens is acting slow on focusing. I thought mayabe the battery on my D40 was low, but it was indicating full. But, I like the lens enough to use it for my wildlife shots and landscapes. It is great for a budget, like mine.  If you are thinking of ordering one, make sure the place you buy from will return it with no problems first incase you don't like it.

$review_text.: Bought this kit to install a Pioneer DEH-4200UB stereo into my 2004 Jeep Liberty. This kit made the installation of my aftermarket stereo take only about 5-minutes(not including the soldering of the wiring harness). The look of this kit matches the vehicles dash perfectly and I couldn't be happier. One thing to mention is that some detachable face-plates may interfere with this kit since the front of the faceplate will be flush with front of this kit (stereo mounts to the aft face of the kit). If you have a faceplate that folds down or needs to swing out about 25deg before detaching then you may have some interference issues. For my stereo there was no issue.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to like this camera based on the price and specs.  Bought a refurbished model on an online auction site.  The model I received was fine, in great shape, looked brand new.But after tinkering around with the camera, I found image quality to be sub-par.  My Canon SD1200 and my Sony DSC-H20 both take much better photos.  I don't understand why this Samsung has TWO different Auto modes.  Most cameras just have one Auto mode, along with a mode for Scene, P, A, S, M, and movie mode, etc.  It doesn't really make sense.  I got the best results in the auto mode that has the little green icon, not the mode that says "Auto."  Any other mode could not capture movement, everything was blurry.Also I thought the 15X zoom lens would be a great feature, but when I took photos all the way out at 15X, everything turned out blurry.  I stood on my back porch and tried to take a photo of the flowers on my cat's grave on the other side of the yard.  Every photo turned out blurry with a lot of noise.  Somebody below mentioned that you need to use a tripod if you expect to get clear photos when using the long zoom.  Not true.  My Sony camera has a 10X zoom and I've been able to take plenty of still photos all the way out and it can take photos just fine.  You shouldn't have to use a tripod for a point and shoot camera!And video mode was VERY disappointing.  I used a SanDisk class 4 SD card and filmed a few video clips at the 1280 size (NOT in HD mode, just regular.)  After playing them back in VLC player, every single clip had a problem with jumpiness and pixelation.  None of them were smooth.  Somebody had mentioned they thought it was some kind of processing issue with the VLC player.  But my Sony camera also records its video clips in MP4 format, just like this Samsung, and I've NEVER had any kind of problem like that with my Sony, and I always use the VLC player to play its video clips.I also noticed this camera had a problem focusing on close up items for the macro mode.  I tried both of the auto modes, and close up photos turned out blurry when I tried to take a photo of newspaper text close up, but on the other hand it worked okay for flowers.I don't like that when zooming, the camera doesn't show you a number to let you see how far out the zoom is going - all you see is a line sliding across a bar.  Also when selecting video file sizes in video mode, it doesn't tell you how much time you have left to record on the SD card for each file size you select.  (My Sony camera does both of those things.)Some people complained about the menu structure, but I actually didn't mind that.  In fact I liked it better than what I've seen on some other cameras, like Olympus and Nikon.A certain digital camera reviewing website based in the UK (you know which one I'm talking about!) gave this Samsung camera glowing reviews, but I'm not sure why.  After I went back and looked at close up views of their "studio comparison" shots from the cameras in this class (the photos that have all the different colored objects positioned around a white background), it was clear to me that the Sony H55, HX5, and Canon SX210 all had sharper images with more accurate color.  I think that website is always a little too obsessed over whether or not a camera has a "wide angle" lens, but to me that's not the most important thing.I followed that website's recommendations once before after I read their review of a certain Kodak model, and I was disappointed with that camera as well, because every indoor photo that I took always had a yellowish/green cast to it.  I think I'm just going to stop reading anything on that site and only read reviews at Amazon from now on.  Seems like the reviews here are more accurate and honest!Maybe there's a reason why, whenever I go to a certain big box electronics store, they always recommend Canons and Sonys.  Which is what I already have anyway!  I keep trying to find the perfect camera that will have a little bit bigger zoom than my Sony and would combine the best features from both of my current cameras (they both have their little quirks, but overall are good cameras) but I guess I'll have to keep looking.  I thought about getting the Canon SX210, so maybe I'll go ahead and get that one instead.  I think this Samsung is going back up for sale on fleabay!

$review_text.: I should first say that I really like these speakers. They sound great, though I won't claim they sound better than $30 speakers, because I probably couldn't tell the difference. I was surprised at the size of the sub, I was expecting/hoping for something that doesn't take up so much space. The main reason I docked a star is because at very low volumes (where I actually listen to most things), the left channel cuts out before the right channel, and in the end, both channels cut out rather than fading away to nothing as I turn the volume down. This occurs with or without headphones. My solution is to turn down the system volume and turn up the speaker volume. There is also noticeable static when touching the volume knob with headphones on. These speakers were sufficiently expensive, (though much cheaper at your favorite retail electronics store than on Amazon) that I do not expect to have these kind of issues.

 As a non-modeler, I cannot justify a full license of ERwin or any of the other modeling tools, however I do need to create and review models as part of my regular work

 Visio WAS the perfect tool for doing this for my use case, given it being relatively inexpensive and multi-purpose

$REVIEW.: My Dell Dimension XPS 400 Windows 98 SE had the Linksys WMP54GS card in it and it used to work perfectly. (It worked perfectly the first time I installed it!) This computer has a modem and didn't have a wired ethernet card.I have installed and removed lots of networking and VPN software on this machine. Apparently the Windows 98SE Operating System has drivers and modules and registry entries in it that don't let it boot up when this card is in the machine.I got so frustrated I considered moving to Windows XP home (clean install).  Then I considered the cost and the possibility that there might be a problem with the machine that would still preclude correct operation of the WMP54GS.So I bought a new Dell Desktop with Windows XP Home, and then installed this card.It works flawlessly.  No issues at all.The nightmare of weekend after weekend trying to get this card to work in the Dell XPS R400 Windows 98 SE finally ended!My conclusion - if the wireless card doesn't work after a day's effort on an old machine and operating system, then give up or buy a current machine with windows XP.  Unless you have nothing else to do with your life and find struggling with technology that doesn't work to be your life's ambition.It appears that older computers and operating system, have unique charateristics that preclude using wireless cards. It might be in the BIOS that recognizes cards, it might be bus speed, it might be the use of PCI connector pins, it might be the operating system, it might be the incompatibility with the cards driver. I don't feel compelled to diagnose what is wrong.Looking back, it appears that the newer wireless lan cards are throughly tested on Windows XP and Windows 2000 computers (the install is usually much easier according to my wealthier friends) and minimally tested on Windows 98 SE and Windows ME computers.By the way, a generic wired LAN card works perfectly in the Dell XPS R400 Windows 98 SE.Had I known that wired was the way to go, I'd have spent the time wiring the house with CAT5 cable connected to a 4 way router, and have had it working in a weekend.Wireless is easy only with new technology.

$review_text.: I got this used so results may vary, but the lens that I bought has met/exceeded my expectations.  It was not expensive, it is light and takes nice sharp photos.  It is also not too big so it is convenient to carry around.  I use it as my default lens on my D90 because it takes nice shots and is convenient to carry around due to its light weight and small size.  The construction is plastic with a plastic connector as is typical of kit lens, but the photo quality can hold its own.

$review_text.: If you want to travel light, or be less obtrusive than with a longer lens, this is perfect. Remember, some of the most famous photographers and photos utilized a Leica rangefinder camera. This lens returns you to that convenience, comfort, and versatility without sacrificing DSLR TTL benefits.This is an auto-focus lens but not an image stabilizing lens. That is of little consequence since the light weight and shorter length provide excellent balance and stability,The short length, while not being wide angle view, makes the camera less conspicuous and intimidating to others. This is the equivalent of a 64mm lens on a 35mm film camera. Therefore, it acts somewhat like a &#34;Normal&#34; lens with very slight flattening of perspective. It allows you to be intimate with your subject without unpleasant lens distortion.

It even works on the completely locked-down ones I am typically assigned by my big corporate clients (where I can't adjust the power settings), and is always completely unobtrusive. By making continuous, undetectable mouse movements, it prevents your PC from ever going on standby - or the corporate VPN from timing out. Presenter's laptop's frequently go on standby during Web seminars and presentations, while world-wide audiences wait for them to unlock their PCs. I buy 2 or 3 jigglers at a time, and always carry a spare in my laptop bag. Then, when the inevitable happens, I simply hand it over and buy another.WARNING: Don't buy the Fast Version of this device - it makes your mouse fly erratically all over the desktop until you unplug it. I wonder what purpose it serves?

Coupled with a Verizon wireless card and service (costs extra) you can go anywhere and still be productive. (Even without an extra card, you can use the built in WIFI as long as you're near an available access point.) I've used it on the Chicago subway, coffee shops, and even the tiny waiting room of a Jiffy Lube. I've always got the internet at my fingertips. Yes, it's a little cramped if you're used to working on a desktop, but it's small and relatively light and does everything I need it to do. I've had no need to upgrade the 1 gig memory to 2 gig, and Windows 7 starter is fine too. Yes, it is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. So what.

$REVIEW.: As a Macbook user, I've long suffered the discomfort of thigh-burns due to the well-known heat sink that sits on the bottom of Mac laptops. I'd been considering something like this for a long time, but felt kind of silly ponying up the money for yet another piece of plastic in my life. So, I was pretty excited to get one free via the Vine program. The bottom line is that while I am glad to have it, I would probably have returned it if I'd bought it. The basic premise is good (laptop ventilation + storage), but I've encountered a few problems.First of all, the surface is hard plastic, which means that there's no grip or anything to keep my laptop in place. I was expecting a more rubberized plastic to keep the laptop stable, but instead it just rests against the thin lip of the handle, which sort of keeps it in place.Another issue I have with the synthetic fabric-covered foam on the base (the part that rests on a table, lap, etc.), which, seems to attract every stray crumb, oil spill, jam smear, etc. on every surface I put it on (I use my laptop a lot in the kitchen and dining room), and then transfers that the next place it rests. I realize this probably falls outside typical usage, but it's proved annoying to me. The storage space is a nice idea, but not one I'm ever likely to use, especially as I don't have an peripherals I use with it.Finally, the construction and materials just feel kind of cheap to me. I can't put my finger on any specific flaws (although it looks like others have had issues with the snap locks on the handle), but it feels brittle, the kind of thing that will crack and be useless after the first or second time I drop it. I realize that may not be fair, and that what I "feel" is cheap, may in fact be high-grade plastic and the thing will hold up well over time -- but that's my general impression after having and using it a few weeks.Bottom line, I'm glad I have it, but more glad I didn't pay for it.

$review_text.: I'm late to the game here; there are already a ton of reviews detailing everything about the fantastic 1000HE - so I'm going to jump in with a few points that I find relevant that have been LESS detailed in other reviews, while giving this netbook a ringing endorsement.First, KEYBOARD: As many have said, the keyboard is excellent.  The keys protrude from the deck in a style some call "chicklet" but that has most recently been seen on Mac laptops.  I like it a lot.  Less space between keys means less chance of Frito bits dropping into my keyboard, and the size and distance between keys is excellent for my reasonably-sized hands (I'm 6'1" with average paws).Second, COLOR: I bought the blue because the black was taken offline for a bit the afternoon I went to purchase it.  I'm actually really glad - it's not as bright as it appears in the photos, and doesn't pick up fingerprints quite as easily as the black model. I'm not *totally* OCD, but I do like my laptop to not look as if a dog has been slobbering on it.  So ups to the blue model for me.Third, TOUCH PAD: While the larger touch pad is great (larger in comparison to the Acer that is its biggest competitor), it CAN get a bit flaky, responding oddly.  This could be a function of my spastic fingers, but I think it's just a bit over-sensitive.  HOWEVER, that's when every gesture is enabled.  By disabling zoom, I've minimized the problem, while still allowing two-finger scrolling and three-finger swipes to move between web pages.  Would I like it to be slightly less finicky? Sure - but it still rocks.Fourth, SPEED: it's way faster than I expected. I got rid of the minor amount of bloatware, did some minor interface tweaks to XP, and it's really fantastic.  It also comes pre-partitioned into a c and d drive, so I dropped the new (free! well, until next spring) Windows 7 on the second partition and it runs GREAT, even with just the stock 1GB RAM, which brings me to...Fifth, UPGRADE: upgrading to a 2GB ram stick was quick, easy and cheap.  I used theTranscend JM667QSU-2G 2GB JetRam DDR2 667 SO-DIMMwhich went in and was recognized easy peasy lemon squeezey, and I'm very happy.Sixth, AUDIO: I have NOT had the audio issues others have had, so I can't speak to them.  I did upgrade the bios (very easy to do using the included tools) so perhaps that resolved any issues, but it's loud enough for me with headphones or open-air.Seventh, BATTERY: Getting the same crazy battery life everyone else seems to be getting. It's actually hard to measure, as I never use it for 8 hours straight.  But I'll charge it, use it a lot, simply close the lid over night, then use it again the next day. Windows usually indicates about 7.5 to 8 hours at 100% charge, with display at about 50%, WIFI on, bluetooth off, being used for general browsing and writing.Eighth, CONNECTIVITY: Absolutely no problems jumping onto wireless networks at all, and it never drops the connection (unlike my Vista laptop AND my old Mac laptop).Ninth, PORTABILITY: Obviously great, though frankly I wish it were a half pound lighter.  HOWEVER, they'd probably make that up in the battery, and I'll take a larger battery and the added weight as long as I keep getting this crazy battery life.Tenth, THE SILVER KEYS: There are four silver keys at the top of the keyboard above the function keys.  The first two turn on/off the back light and change the screen resolution, the second two are user programmable though are set at default set to change the Asus Super Hybrid Engine, (which is great by the way as it allows you to easily change the performance profile of the computer on the fly), and to launch Skype.  Frankly, I forget they're there, and have no use for changing the screen resolution or turning off the back light.  So if I DID use them, I'd want them all user-programmable.  But as I said, I keep forgetting they're there, so it's not a big deal. Weird though that only two are user programmable.Eleventh, SUMMED UP: So overall - fast, portable, easy to type on, CRAZY battery life, good screen....it's EXACTLY what I wanted, and I love it.

I love using I Tune U for taking college classes for free. Every AP works well unlike other operating systems, there are rarely any glitches. The battery last long even with constant use. The updates are not obstructive in nature. Every time I put it down I can't wait to pick it back up. I also like the fact that I can use Sprint data plan on a month to month bases and it's prorate if I only use a percentage of the allotted amount. So far there seems to be no cons to speak of.

$review_text.: I usually use MX-2, which I still love, but I wanted to try this stuff just from all the great things I had heard. I bought this originally for my GTX 480, which did a marvelous job at bringing down temperatures, but, beware, this stuff is difficult to apply. This is especially true with heat sinks that don't have a smooth surface, such as my Hyper 212. I tried everything that the website recommended for applying this stuff. I soaked it in hot water and turned my computer on with a dab on the CPU to heat it up, but every time I booted up Prime95 it would have very uneven temperatures on all four cores. Some as much as a 10 degree difference. Before anyone starts accusing me for not applying thermal paste correctly - I use the rice grain technique and let the heat sink naturally spread it. I even tried spreading it myself using a ziplock bag, but that didn't work either because this stuff is just way too thick. It's more like a putty than a paste.So, if your heat sink is flat and smooth, then go for it because it really is great stuff. Otherwise, be cautious. This stuff might be more trouble than you're willing to get into for such a small difference in temps.*EDIT*I've raised the score because I've recently found that thermal paste, in general, doesn't spread well on Hyper 212+'s, but this stuff is still really expensive for how much you get. I've recently moved onto PK-1 because I get way more of it for the same price and it seems to get me better temps than this as well.

$review_text.: This FM Transmitter is great! It's cheap, and works wonderfully. I was looking for a solution to play audio from my iPhone in my car, and since I don't have an aux port or tape cassette deck, this was the only option. Overall, I'm very happy with this little dongle. It plugs into any device with a headphone jack, and instantly starts streaming audio. For me, it was an added bonus that it was the same width as an iPhone, so I can keep it on my device even when I leave the car, and I barely notice it's there. It comes with a microUSB cable (very standard, so if you ever lose it, it's very easy to find another one). It charges in under 2 hours, and lasts for over 4 hours. Audio quality was clear for the most part, and I only found issues when I chose a station which was not entirely empty. However, this issue would occur with any FM Transmitter you purchase, as the key to using them is all about finding an empty FM frequency so that there's no interference.I highly recommend this for the price point and convenience this little adapter provides! Please comment below or contact me in my profile if you have any questions.

The new battery has good charge life and is not showing signs of lessening performance, after 18-ish months. Please be aware that the model number is quasi-useless in determining the right battery to buy, as it refers to a number of different machines. You absolutely MUST use the full mfr's part number (located in the battery compartment of this particular machine), check it on HP's site to determine the genuine replacement part number, and then shop with that information in hand.

$REVIEW.: I bought 2 of these kits to install a couple extra amps in my van. The 4 gauge wire is small, but worse is the terminals are for 4 gauge, so 2 or 3 of these wires will fit. The fuse holder is also for 4 gauge, it's a good thing the wire is small for this, even so, if you tin the wire, it is too big and the allen screw protrudes and prevents the holder from screwing together, I will have to file it down. I'm not using the RCA cables, they look a bit weak, I'm using RG6 with compression fittings instead, since I have the tool, if you dont have the tool there are screw on fittings, a little more expensive, but good. the blue wire is large enough, but I have 4 amps so I use a larger wire. I figure the wire needs to be a bit tougher in a minivan, cause I use the van for hauling stuff, and I don't want to have to fix broken wires. The speaker wire is ok for mids and such, for subs, get better wire. I'm using it on some 6's and 5-1/4's. Overall, not a total loss, but not too great, I'm looking at just getting my own wire and ANL fuses from now on.

$review_text.: First off let me state the good:It doesn't get hotter than 51c when running intense applications.Only the pump gets installed on the mobo, so its less likely to warp the mobo.Long tubes, I like it.Very cool lightning, that's the reason I got it.Now for the bad:Software is totally lame.  They also need to find a better way to install it.  You gotta install the software before installing hardware, so if you don't already have a heatsink/fan lying around you gotta somehow make it far enough to install the software without any cooling on your cpu the entire time, then turn it off and install the cooler.  Otherwise software will give you errors.One fan works, the other fan just goes all out max no matter what I plug it into.  It is uncontrollable, and it goes so fast, over 5krpm that it starts rattling unbearably, on top of sounding like a jet engine.  I decided to unplug it and maybe buy another 140mm fan to replace it.  For now it runs on one fan, which is pretty impressive that I got no higher than 51c doing some pretty intense stuff.Its performance is limited, but it could get better if I plug in that annoying fan.  For now it's about the same as a coolermaster air cooler.They say that it fits in my thermaltake chaser mk1 case with some modifications.  Well yeah it does, but barely.  I can't plug anything into my topmost 5.25 bay, it sticks a little bit into there.  I guess its fine though I only currently use 3 bays.  Also, you gotta modify it to get it to fit (drill holes or ziptie, I went with zipties).  Well, this could also be a con for the chaser mk 1 case too.Edit:  replaced the faulty 140mm fan with a noctua fan but temps only went down an average of 3c.  I'll reseat the pump later and see how that works out.

The sound does not crack when you increase the volume on your phone/laptop (although I did not dare to go all the way up)


The battery charge lasts for a fairly long time and standby(off) battery charge is also excellent (I did not use this for almost 4 weeks and when I put on the speaker they played as if they were off for just a day)

$review_text.: ** Be sure to read the comments **Yes, there is a wire for EVERYTHING now days...and even better, Amazon has their own line of them!!  I own quite a few of the AmazonBasics wires and they all are of excellent quality, if not better than the brand names.  AND, this bad boy comes in the frustration-free packaging....no more ER visits for sliced open hands from those hard, clam-shell plastic packages...woo-hoo!!  Anywho, the wire itself is a perfect length (6.5') and has this awesomely (yes, that is a word in my world) soft feel to it...kind of like a brushed cotton feel, which makes the wire less slippery.  The connectors have a solid feel to them and feel like they will hold up for some time...although I don't recommend pulling them out by the wire but rather pinching the connector itself and then pulling.  This should be done for all plugs, but come on...admit it, there is a lazy side in all of us and we rarely pinch the connector.  I mention it should be done correctly on this wire because although the main part of the wire is thicker, the connector end separates into 4 wires (red, white, yellow & USB) and those are much thinner than the rest of the wire.  I'm sure yanking on those thinner wires can't be good, but we'll see.  I say we'll see because I am one of those lazy people who rarely pinches the connectors.Okay, moving on...this wire is no different than the Apple branded one or any of the other aftermarket wires.  It doesn't have special Jedi powers making it do more than the other wires.  It simply displays videos and pictures along with music on your TV.  I must admit I was hoping I could play Angry Birds on my 60"...but no such luck.  I was amazed with the clarity of the pics on my ginormous TV...unsure if that can be credited to the wire, my TV, or if my kids iTouch just takes darn good pics.  Either way, I was in awe.Sooooo...if you have an iPod, iPad, iTouch, iPhone...all of them, or a couple of each like our family does, this is a handy little wire to have around.

$review_text.: I have been using Garmin GPS units for many years
 I just picked this unit up at Costco yesterday, and it is going back today


 The reason?  Garmon has decided to put advertisements on the home screen and on the map screen when you are at a stop
 This is completely unacceptable!  I am sorry, but I do not need advertisements popping up in my face while I am driving!  A few other quibbles came up in the short time I used it:  The map draws slowly when it is first displayed


 Seems like they need a faster processor

 When the battery is low, a warning window pops up OVER THE MAP completely covering it until you press the OK button
 The strange thing is, this happens a few seconds after I started the car when it was plugged into a power source charging
 It is rather annoying to have to reach up to the dash to acknowledge an alert that is basically meaningless since it is plugged in


 One last thing:  The amount of information displayed on the map screen is very limited compared to other GPSs I have seen

 For example, you are only given your arrival time when you set a destination

 My friends Tom Tom gives him the arrival time, the distance in miles, and the time left to get there..

All in an easy to read display

 Another example

 The traffic alert on this Garmin is a small colored circle


 Green if there is no traffic, red if there is traffic

 You have to touch the circle, and then navigate another menu to get more information about the traffic

 The Tom Tom displays a bar graph on the side of the map screen

 If there is traffic it shows you where on the graph it is (The graph representing your trip distance) and how many miles ahead the traffic is..
It also tells you how much of a delay the traffic will cause


 Again, all on your map screen and it looks really nice.Looks like I will not be using Garmon GPSs any more

 Its a shame


 I have been happy with them and would have loved to continue using them, but there are better brands out there now...

$REVIEW.: I purchased this cable to hook a Dreamcast system up to a projector. It comes with an audio cable imbedded in it as well. It seems to work flawlessly, so I'm satisfied. I gave it five stars simply because the cable I bought before this years ago did not come with an audio cable so I'm assuming that is not always standard.

$review_text.: Why pay more? These seem to work just fine.A cable is a cable, usually either it works or it doesn't. These cables don't tend to move around a lot so there's no reason to buy anything super sturdy or strong, nor am I saying these are not super sturdy or strong. I'm just saying, why pay $20-30 at a store when you can pay $10+ shipping here? I have 2 of these and both work just fine.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted a desk mount monitor stand to clear up some desk space that I desperately needed. This desk mount failed entirely. I tried several different monitors with this mount, and they all resulted in the monitor hanging crooked. Each monitor was less than the 33 lb max weight with one being around 10 lbs. and still was too heavy for this stand. It was really disappointing considering that this stand was cheap, looked great, and seemed to be made out of solid materials. All of that doesn't matter if it can't get the job done though. Its safe to say I won't be buying any more monoprice products in the near future.

$review_text.: I originally had the D-Link AC1000, but had a HECK of a time getting it set up, and it never did work as advertised.  When I replaced it with this one, I had low expectations.Surprisingly, the set up and workability of this AC Gaming Router 1300 is simple and streamlined.  Just follow the directions (exactly) and it will work!  The speed is super fast!  I can wirelessly stream HD movies with NO lag (in another room).It automatically found my networked printers, and set itself up. The way it decides who gets priority is mysterious, but it works!The documentation is better, clearer, and of better quality with the 1300 than with the 1000. The computer interface is stronger, more user-friendly, and never glitched on me like the AC1000's interface.I have used D Link routers for years, (all the way back to their first gaming routers) and have never had an issue until that AC1000...I'm glad it was a lemon and that this 1300 is such a gem.Skip the AC1000 and get this one!  :)

$review_text.: Hello everyone...I finally decided to write this review for DNS-323 and giving it a 5 star.I am a media enthusiast. I have several movies and music that I want to play from my computer and play it in my TV with sound coming through my home theater system. I have purchased an LG DLNA Blu-Ray player that can stream media from a computer or any DLNA certified device. But I did not want to leave my computer running all the time either (its upstairs and TV is downstairs) and did not want to have to go upstairs to start computer each time I wanted to stream local media. At the same time I wanted to make sure all my data, photos, home movies, etc is backed up and also available for streaming anytime.This is when I decided to buy a NAS drive. I must have spent almost 2 months researching (I wanted to be sure and was not in a hurry). I considered lots of alternates including DNS-321 before finally deciding to go with DNS-323. I picked it up at local Fry's electronics for $150.It is connected to my Belkin Gigabit router with Wireless N wifi.Ease of setup:--------------OK, Setting up this device was super easy. I just dropped in a 1.5 TB SATA drive and it recognized it. I had pulled the drive from my windows pc so it was NTFS. When I went to the setup page which is Web based so any browser will do, it found the drive, I formatted it to ext2 and that's it. It took a while though - like 2 hours - but probably that was due to the 1.5 TB size. After the format was done I used the software provided on CD to map a drive on my windows PC.Speed:------I copied some files back and forth to see what the avg speed was. On a wired Gigabit LAN I get a max Read speed of about 8 MBps (64 Mbps) and write of about 2 MB/s (16 Mbps). On my wireless N (my laptop has N as well) I get read of about 5 MBps (40 Mbps) and read of about 1.5 MBps (12 Mbps). These speeds are a lot less than what the actual network supports, but I guess thats the limit of this device.If you are using this device to backup data, allow for more time to copy data over...DLNA/Streaming--------------OK, here is the best part and why I chose this device. I have copied all my music, videos, and photos to this device. I can stream it without any single issue on my LG blu-ray player (which has built in Wifi - N) and it plays everything flawlessly. The 5 MBps read speed does not cause any issues.Changes I made--------------One thing that I found annoying was that the drive power down time is 1 hour max. Which means that if you do not access the device for 1 hour, the hard drive stop spinning to save power. Great feature but a spin up from sleep takes it about 30-45 seconds. When I want to stream video, I dont want to have to try three times before the folders are found (on my blu-ray player, I dont see the drive at all). So the only change I have made is to disable the power down of the drive. I know it spends more power now, but I have my instant gratification!!!Overall recommended for normal day to day use.Not sure if you want to to be able to hack and stuff... but there are other reviews that talk about it.

$REVIEW.: The main reasons I purchased these was for the listing "Outdoor", so I figured they were intended for use while doing yard work and would be good for listening to my MP3's while mowing the lawn 





well no, not so.Currently I use a set of Bose headphones (not the high end ones) and I'm prone to leaving them either in the garage or outside or wherever so I wanted to replace those with a good quality lower cost pair that I would not worry about when I forget them

Well the sound is top notch, no doubt they sound fine, great highs and wonderful soundstage in this pair, I cannot complain because they are better than I expected, for the price they are really good
The thing I didn't expect was the background noise to be as high as it is, the padding around the ear-cups is not sufficient to stop any background noise including people speaking in a normal tone of voice

How can these be for outdoor, if they allow so much outer sound to be heard these are simply for use indoor with little to no background noise at all.I ended up using these for my computer watching movies but even then if my wife is watching another show on TV the sound from that bleeds through with no problem which is not what headphones should do, well that's my expectation anyway, maybe I'm wrong but that's my purpose and they don't meet it.A reasonable set of phones should block the background noise level enough to not be disturbed by them and can hear the background TV or music or whatever.Like I said they sound great, nearly as good as the Bose but if they could block out at least some greater level of background noise I would have given them a higher rating.If you intend to use these for yard work, lawn mowing and such these will probably disappoint you, even cars going by can be heard clearly so what's the purpose of the padding, it certainly isn't to block out sound so I guess it's designed for comfort, in that they are fine but again only for indoor use, as for the idea of them being weatherproof, I don't think so


No headphones that I have ever seen are weatherproofed, if you ever left them in the rain they would be ruined, any set would be so I don't know what the word OUTDOOR indicates


I guess from the construction they would hold up better, they do have a heavy plastic layer over the speaker face but they certainly aren't weather-proofed.Again these are exceptional for the price, great sound and good range, no problems but they simply can't serve as well as others for blocking outside noise - even during indoor use

With these my lawn mower is just as loud as ever so I'm back to the Bose outside for now or till I find some other pair I won't worry over forgetting in the yard.Oh well, I can't say they are a waste of money because they are worth every penny and are a good quality, for the low cost these are well worth buying but just don't expect them to shield out other noises because they simply do not

I own ear-buds which block out more background, now that's sad.Good set for desk / office use in a quiet settingBad set for noisy environment.Good set for the money (an "A" Plus)Bad set for "outdoor" expectations.

$REVIEW.: Having recently purchased a new Sony Xperia Tablet Z, I knew I would be using it while traveling and around to friend's houses to bring movies/shows on, and I needed a way to connect to a TV.  The Xperia Tablet Z uses the MHL 5pin adapter, hence why I landed on this product.Packaging is simple, but gets the job done.  Included in the packaging is the adapter, a 3 foot Micro-SD cable, and a quick useage diagram.  The cable and the adapter feel solid in construction and do not feel cheap, which is refreshing - many adapters now-a-days feel like garbage and feel like they are going to break after initial useage - not in this case.I should note that this product does not work with the newer Samsung Galaxy S3/4, or any other new product that uses the MHL 11-pin standard.  This is a 5-pin MHL adapter, and only works with devices that use this.  Please check with your device manufacturer before attempting useage as the 2 standards are not interchangeable.Overall, picture quality out was perfect, and I had no issues with using the adapter.  And for $11, it's perfectly priced for a tablet companion for me.

Just pull gently on the top of the case and it slides open.  Set the SSD inside and push it against the SATA connector.  Then slip the top of the case back on.  This is plenty secure enough to hold the drive without any rattling.  Plug the USB cable in, and you're in business.It's worked fine since I got it and delivers good file transfer performance.

$review_text.: The Sony V900 Headphones have a printed frequency response of 5-80,000hz and I believe it.  They are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels.  They have great imaging.  The only thing that is wrong with them is that don't fit my head the way that they were designed and I have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear.  I can wear them hours on end.I listen to mostly classical music, but right now I have some Lords of Acid on which is dance/electronic.  The response is fairly flat, but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt!  My opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral.  Someone mentioned the Sony model 7506 which to me has a more forward mid-range.If you can't afford these headphones the Sony DJ MDR-700 seems to be just about the same, but a tad less comfortable.  It has about the same response and sensitivity.But I would recommend this model for long term use and happiness.  The only problem I have had is the ear-cups have worn out and that is because I am in Florida and sometime when coming in from the outside I have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of that.

$review_text.: First of all, this thing is LOUD.  I'm amazed at how much this thing can rock my house with 10 D-cell batteries, and how incredibly long those D-cell batteries can last.  Separate knobs for volume and bass control is an awesome, and the side-firing sub-woofers put out great bass.  I love taking this thing to parties.  There is one plug for a microphone or guitar and there's a switch between the two, so it's easy to use as an amp, a megaphone, or a karaoke machine.  You can control the mic/guitar volume separately from the main volume, so it's easy to control how much of your voice is mixed in with the music.  The shoulder strap makes it easy to carry.  The USB port on the front will read media off a thumb drive or search the internal storage on a device like a phone, and can also be used to charge devices, like phones.  I connect my phone to the USB but connect the headphone jack to the audio input so I have full control over what I want to listen to while charging my phone.  It makes an awesome Pandora setup.  CD-player up top just in case, good antenna, programmable radio stations, AC and DC power inputs (but only comes with AC power cable), sealable iPod dock protects your iPod/iPhone, remote control, equalizer presets, headphone jack, and a video output for iPod/iPhone videos.Overall it's just a really well engineered piece of equipment.  JVC left no stone unturned.  It does pretty much everything I could ever want it to do and more.  It's just so versatile it makes it perfect for parties, flash mobs, chilling out, whatever.  It makes me wish boom boxes never went out of style because it's just so awesome.  Definitely my favorite toy.One tiny little problem I should note.  It is not hot-swappable between AC power and battery power.  It turns itself of when you switch from one to the other.  Other than that, no complaints here.

$REVIEW.: Nothing like a unit being bad right out of the box


 Too bad I have to waste the time to send it back to get an exchange or a refund.I bought this device as a replacement for my faltering ASUS AC network adapter (Still in warranty) so I would have a connection while it is being serviced

 So much for that


 Looks like I will have to dig out my old N adapter in storage so I have a connection while the Edimax one is being returned and my ASUS one is being serviced.Running Win 8.1
 When installing I followed the directions on the Edimax web site


 With Win 8.1 the user should not install the drivers that came with the device (disc) or the Edimax web site


 If you have, you will need to remove the adapter and uninstall the Edimax driver

 Once that is done, all you are supposed to do is plug the adapter in and use the included drivers included with Win 8.1
 That is it.I'm not expecting to get the theoretical speeds so when it was connected to my router briefly, It achieved a connection speed of anywhere between 192.5 - 295 Mbps with a max signal connection

 Good speed being my router is approx 25 feet away and through a couple of walls

 Compared to my ASUS USB2 AC network adapter that usually only sustains 58.5 Mbps max.The brief time the adapter did stay connected (around 15 minutes at the max) it seemed like I was on a dial up connection


The GMail login page took at least a minute to fully load up

 Other pages..
forget it
 I tried Amazon, facebook and a few other web pages

While they eventually did load, it seemed like an eternity

 My NNTP connection suffered as well
 I pay for a 25Mbps connection and the Edimax network adapter only maintained around 9 - 10 Mbps with a brief max of around 15Mbps

 The ASUS adapter sustained right around the Max of 25Mbps consistently
 Other than that 15 minutes, this adapter continually dropped the connection and I would either have to use the Windows troubleshooter to reconnect or I would have to disconnect and reconnect the adapter frequently
 Good thing I have not returned my ASUS adapter for service yet or I would not have been able to write this review

 The ASUS is experiencing disconnection issues too


 Not nearly as frequent as the Edimax one.I will be happy to adjust my rating should the replacement one be a &#34;good one&#34;.

$SUMMARY.: Must have received a bad one... It's going back for an exhange.

However, I don't recommend doing so if you value your back. This load is made easier to carry with aDomke Shoulder Pad. When shooting, the removal of one camera makes the weight a lot easier to carry around, but the bag's biggest weakness is it's size when moving through crowds. The good news is that like every other Domke bag it's soft enough to collapse a little when gear is removed.If you are looking for a bag that will coddle your equipment, this is NOT the bag you want. But it is the bag you want if you like to work out of a well thought out, incredibly durable bag. The bag itself is heavy canvas. There is a padded board in the bottom of the bag to protect it rough rough landings when you set the bag down. However, the equipment dividers have thin foam pads that seem barely adequate if you are used to the stiff, heavy foam in products from other manufacturers. This is by design; a Domke bag is meant to work out of and collapse against you. And the little padding that is present is more than adequate to keep your gear from getting beat up as long as you are smart about how you pack it. The relatively open design means you can dig through it and find what you need with ease. The stitching is heavy, and on this bag the shoulder strap D-rinds are secured by two pieces of webbing slightly offset from each other for extra load-bearing capacity.

$REVIEW.: My old tripod died. I dug a hole in the backyard and laid the old dog to rest. Many stories were buried on that sad day,even a tear or two was shed, but I needed to move on. I needed to find another partner who would be strong and dependable but who would be smart and responsive to my needs. I've got a new pal now. The name is Slik. Let me tell you why I'm loving young Slik :1. The heft and stability of this tripod is greater than I thought I'd get for my money. I don't see anything breaking on this anytime soon. I've shot video through a big telephoto, shot in high wind at the ocean and done lots of macro in the studio. I haven't seen a bit of shake. That said: the literature says that the alloy used provides greater strength to weight ratio,I believe it, but this is still a heavy tripod. Any fantasies I had of taking this tripod above the treeline have been dispelled.2. The circular mounting plate is all metal, built to last, and you don't have to fuss with it. Your camera goes on straight and stays there. Nice design.Notes:+Slik calls this the Pro 700Dx. I don't know where Amazon gets the 615-315 number but they are the same thing.+There are bubble levels on the head for declination and horizon but when you flip the camera into portrait orientation you only get the declination, so there is no level to tell when you are plumb.+The center column unscrews so you can flip the head upside down to get real low to the ground.+This tripod comes with a nylon/polyester carrying bag. I haven't tried it yet****update 8/1/2011****  I sold this tripod this spring and got a Manfrotto Carbon fiber tripod and a ballhead. While I am in love with the light weight of the new tripod there are a few features from this Slik model that I miss. 1. The circular mounting plate was so easy to attach to the camera I could often keep observing the scene while I attached it. 2. The three-way panhead was easy to position and lock. I only had slippage issues when there was user error.While it wasn't plausible to take Slik up the 3k-4k elevation gain trails due to weight it was handy in all other respects and I'd still recommend it to those who's budgets don't allow the carbon fiber option.
$review_summary.: Value = Utility/Price  &  Slik = high value.

I am mostly a desktop computer user, but am so happy to have the Lenovo Yoga for the infrequent times I need a mobile device.

The only stations that she regularly watches are the two local PBS stations.  When I installed this antenna, it did pick up most of the local TV stations.

$review_text.: Installing this was a breeze.  It has run fine for several weeks and is perfectly stable.  It never drops my connection.  As you can see in the picture it doesn't have any antennas but it has very good range, about 10 to 12 yards with the unit only a foot or so off the ground.I was a bit disappointed to find out that it doesn't allow an optional guest account.  You need either an entirely different wireless router that broadcasts two channels or to add a wireless access point (to transmit a second channel) if you really want a guest account.  Just FYI if you have a lot of friends and don't trust them all with your main channel password.

$REVIEW.: I have a lot of gripes about this camera, but I do believe it is worth every penny.  1. You need to purchase a license for Blue Iris to overcome the build-in software limitations.  The built in motion trigger is not fast enough, and you'll miss the action.  Blue Iris solves that problem.  You get a trial copy with the camera.  2. The color is terrible; it might as well be black and white.  3. The night vision works well indoors, but if you put it in the window, you will not be able to see out the window at night due to the light reflecting back off the glass.  4. After a power loss or reboot, the camera looks up, and you have to re-adjust it.  5. You have to use Microsoft Internet Explorer to get full features.  6. There's no zoom, and faces look grainy from a distance, and forget about reading license plates.  7. It's big, so you'll need a decent ledge space to set it on, or you'll have to mount it.  Despite my gripes, I think it is well made, and it does what I need it to do.  I can view in to my home remotely from work and look left, right, up, and down.  It's not bad.

I don't understand why they are stuck in alkaline era and why can't adopt Li-ion technology

This is really annoying.

$review_text.: This is an excellent choice in a mid-range compact camera.  The camera works flawlessly, with auto focus, menu negotiation, and picture quality all excellent.  Uploading images to the computer is easy.  The widest angle isn't all that wide though, and the 3X zoom is somewhat limiting; for example if you want to zoom in on your child playing at the playground at a bit of a distance.  Video quality is also excellent; only problem is again the zoom: it's set - and won't move - once you start shooting.  In conclusion, this is a very good mid-range camera: it takes excellent quality pictures and video.  However, the zoom's limitations also limit the camera somewhat; but then again, a more versatile zoom could only be found on a more expensive camera, and if this isn't that important considering your needs, then this would be an excellent reliable camera, and an excellent value.

$REVIEW.: I use this on the AV cable on my Xbox 360 and attach my headphone, works great. BUT, you have to use PLAIN headphones, NOT the ones with a mic on it that you use on your cellphone, or else it will produce MONO. The contacts on the end of the earphone I used don't match this adapter thus producing mono audio. I almost gave it a 1 star, but then I tried my regular headphone and it WORKED! The audio is surprisingly quite good, as I thought it would be very low. If you want to play games like COD or GTA5, get this, it's way better than TV speakers. I play much better at COD as I can very accurately hear my opponents' footsteps and gunshots and know where they are. I should have got this a VERY long time ago. TV speakers SUCK, they do not get you immersed in the game at all, as most lack any kind of bass. I don't even hear character voices properly and get lost trying to figure out the plot. Headphones also block out any background sound that may distract you. All gamers should get headphones for maximum immersion. This little 50 cent product really changed my gaming experience. I love it!
$SUMMARY.: THIS IS STEREO (USE ON XBOX 360), BUT USE PLAIN HEADPHONE (NOT WITH MIC)!

$review_text.: The case/cover is ok


It does provide adequate protection for the back and corners, and extends to meet the edges of the screen
The silicone isn't as easy to hold on to as I'd hoped

It slides out of my hand, which defeats the purpose for which it was purchased
The flaw of the iPad is how slippery it is to hold

I'd hoped this would be an attractive, easy solution

We were snorkeling and diving for scallops so I needed my hands free. This float has a little loop on the top which I used to tie a neck strap (cord) to, and was able to hang the camera around my neck, the float kept it out of the way while collecting the scallops.

$REVIEW.: Wanted to get a large capacity flash drive for big files transfer, so I upgraded my 4GB flash drive to this. Few days usage, my view on this product.Pros:- Large capacity (obviously)- USB 3 for fast transfer, so far my average write speed is ~80-90MB/s, not up to my expectation but might be due to my lenovo laptop setup.Cons:- The middle black strip part will have your fingerprints on it- Generate heats while using it. I can't understand why it's so hot, be it transferring files, or just plugged in without using it.Practical usage, small in size, big in capacity. The only thing I really don't like, it's the heat generated.Edited: I don't understand why it's default formatted as FAT32, for a 128GB drive!? So first thing to do, I'll recommend you to format to exFAT before using it.

$review_text.: Just received my silver X20 several days ago. Here's my quick take on it. (BTW, I also own the previous X10 and also a Sony RX100)Pros:-- Excellent overall image quality from ISO 100-400; very good/good image quality from ISO 800-1600. Obviously, some noise is there as you increase ISO, but playing around with the menu settings helps things a bit. Even with the brand new sensor, not a huge difference in image quality compared with the X10, but rather it's subtle (i.e. little better image detail and shadow highlights). Compared to the Sony RX100, overall image quality is similar most of the time, but the Sony wins easily in resolution. Colors look a bit better on the Fuji.-- Generally excellent overall performance. AF is usually fast and dependable most of the time, however, as to be expected in most compact cameras, it doesn't do that well with fast action or in challenging lighting conditions.-- Excellent build quality:  I love the chic "retro" design in the silver/black X20....gets great compliments from everybody that sees it. I only wish the rear LCD screen had swivel and/or tilt feature.-- Very good movie mode:  It's finally full HD (1080) and much better than the X10 in this regard....However, the RX100 is easily the best in this area......much smoother and more detailed.Cons:-- Menu still antiquated compared to the competition.-- Rear LCD screen has no swivel/tilt feature-- No dedicated "movie" button-- No WiFi feature-- Easy to lose lens cap-- Somewhat bulky (compared to the RX100)-- Flash a little weak and not tiltable like the RX100's

$REVIEW.: Bought this to run a headphone cable from our amplifier, around the perimeter of our living room, to hubby's recliner, so he can easily watch/listen to TV without having to raise the volume to compete with ambient noise levels.  We're lucky to have carpeted baseboards in that particular room, so we were able to &#34;tuck&#34; the cable into the edges where baseboard and carpet meet, using a simple wooden paint-stirrer (and a lot of patience).This worked PERFECTLY for the job.  The sound quality is equal to a heavier, more shielded cable we'd purchased years ago from an electronics store.  Stereo output is excellent; very happy with the quality, especially for the incredibly low price. Great buy!

$review_text.: Again, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.i tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.right now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review.I love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too.

The Velcro is pretty strong and it keeps the device in place. I contacted the seller, and got a quick response. My stylus pen was missing, but they promised to send a new one the next day. Well, I got an envelope but no pen....I'm starting to think it's the mail being tampered with. But at least, HHI tried to fulfill my request so I don't blame them because at least they tried.

$REVIEW.: Within its capabilities, Tamron's 70-300mm F4-5.6 SP Di VC USD XLD lens delivers solid results on my APS-C Canon SLR's (7D, 40D, 30D).  In the fall of 2011, the price of the lens dropped $60 to $389.99.  With a qualifying purchase Tamron offered a $50 rebate, bringing the cost for some lucky buyers to $339.99, which was an outstanding value for this already economical alternative to higher priced Canon lenses in the same focal range.  The lens has since risen back to $450, but at this time the $50 rebate is still available.With a plastic body, build quality is good, although not specifically designed to withstand outdoor conditions.  Similar to many other users, there are things I don't particularly like about this lens.  One is the large lens hood.  Like most lens hoods, it is stored reversed on the lens barrel, which blocks access to the zoom ring.  This is to be typical for most lens hoods, but the oversized 3.5" long hood, can be awkward to handle at times.The 0.7" wide focus ring is closer to the base, while the 1.7" wide zoom ring is closer to the barrel.  As I rarely use manual focus on a telephoto lens, having the locations reversed would work better for me.  Operating a zoom ring that is so far forward, reduces the stability of my grip.  It's not a deal breaker, but I simply can't zoom and fire as fast.  In addition, the ring width could probably be reduced without much loss in functionality.Tamron's standard design convention for the zoom ring is opposite from Canon's.  To zoom in on a Tamron lens, you rotate the ring clockwise, which is the opposite from a Canon lens.  Again, not a deal breaker, but it can slow you down, and is something that can be particularly annoying if you are shooting sports, or other fast moving subjects.  Both the zoom and focus rings have a tight fitting rubber grip, which provides plenty of traction.  Filter size is 62mm, which is not the most common.At 27 ounces, the lens is relatively light and is generally manageable hand held.  Tamron's vibration compensation (VC) image stabilization system, does a fairly good job, which is good as with a nonmetallic body, there are no provisions for attaching the lens to a monopod.  Your best option might be to attach a monopod to the tripod screw on your camera.  Fortunately, when the lighting is adequate, the VC system usually works well, although it is a little noisy at times.  A major plus is that there is no evidence of lens creep, and Tamron apparently having confidence, provided no locking button for the zoom ring.I have been using a Tokina 70-200 F2.8 lens for over a decade, mostly for shooting basketball.  It's a great lens, that's built like a tank, but I was looking for something a little lighter, and with a bit more reach for shooting outdoor sports.  Within the 70-300mm range I considered three lenses, this Tamron, and Canon's EF 70-300mm F4-5.6L IS USM, and 70-300mm F4-5.6 DO IS USM IS.  Prices fluctuate, but as Canon's IS L and DO IS lenses were so close in cost, I eliminated the non-L DO IS lens.  The decision came down to the IS L at $1400, and the Tamron at less than $400.As you would expect for an L series lens, Canon's EF 70-300mm is easily the better built lens, with a metal housing and probably better glass.  Although heavier, it also doesn't come with an integral tripod ring, so ease of handling is probably similar.  Although relatively compact in length, unlike most of Canon's L series telephoto's the 70-300mm isn't a fixed length zoom.  Reviews of the lens on YouTube were generally favorable, but not exactly glowing.Since my Tokina telephoto can handle most situations, I could not justify spending an extra grand for the Canon L.  I own three other Tamron lenses, and am very impressed with the quality of the brand.  Tamron's 17-50mm and 18-250mm zooms, are a couple of my favorites.Tamron's 70-300mm lens has low distortion (LD) glass, with extra low dispersion (XLD) elements, that are supposed to reduce chromatic aberrations.  The deep lens hood probably helps a lot too.  Unlike some of their other lenses, this one is designed to function on full frame cameras as well as APS-C.  Tamron processed and sent out my rebate check in about three weeks, with a confirming email.  If like me you have been ripped off by Canon's rebate system, you will certainly appreciate this kind of efficiency.  Tamron also backs their lenses with a six year warranty.My results shooting basketball in a well lighted gym were poor, so unless your subject is within flash range, this lens may disappoint when used indoors.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the performance of this lens, and I recommend it to Canon users on a budget, who expect to be shooting in decent lighting conditions.  The relatively low cost is a big plus, but issues with ease of use are significant enough for me to drop the rating down to only four stars
$SUMMARY.: good optics, performance, and price, although the design has some issues for Canon users...

$REVIEW.: I got this to see whether a drive supposedly fine tuned for a RAID would work as a regular drive. I thought the greater reliability they were supposed to have would show up in normal service as a data drive or main computer drive.It would not work as a USB data drive in a toaster style drive enclosure. I would probably have to reformat it, but decided to go on to the main drive test instead.I swapped out the drive in an MSI Wind desktop to try out a new fork of the Ubuntu Linux line called Zorin. Zorin has gotten my attention because they have listened to the users (for a change) and created a flavor of Linux which can have an interface which looks like anything you've ever used: various flavors of Linux GUI, Mac OS, and several flavors of Windows. I don't know why it took someone so long to figure this out, but I'm glad someone finally did - give the users a choice in their GUI interface. Why is that so hard?But I digress. The drive installed easily, and I was able to install the Zorin Linux OS without incident. It seems to be running just fine, and has increased the speed of the machine it is in. That may be more due to the OS than the drive, but a fresh 1 TB drive certainly doesn't hurt.I will keep an eye on it and see if it develops problems like those some users have reported in RAID arrays. I have had very good luck with WD drives, and do not expect any trouble.

$REVIEW.: This Speaker Base fitted nicely beneath the 42" LG TV in my bedroom and gave it a little more height which makes it even easier to view from the bed. The sound is very nice, a definite improvement over the LG flat panel speakers especially with surround sound turned on. It's more fun to watch movies with surround sound. I did not need a subwoofer since I was going to put this in the bedroom but I found it gives a good effect and I don't miss the subwoofer at all. I programmed my LG TV remote to learn the controls for this system and turn them up or down and also mute with the TV remote. I still have to program the Comcast Cable Box remote to learn the controls for this system. It also works with a Tivo Remote as I have tried that in the past.I also have the BA Tvee Model 30 system with the subwooferBoston Acoustics TVee Model 30 Sound System with Sleek Sound Bar and Wireless Subwoofer (Black)in my living room and sometimes have to turn off the subwoofer when I am not watching a movie as the thump can get annoying if you are watching a talk show. You also need to be careful if you have neighbors below you when you use a subwoofer as it can get loud. For that reason, I prefer this base as it's nice and compact, and has pretty good sound without a subwoofer. It is also a little more expensive than the sound bar system with subwoofer.Overall, a nice system to get if you want something compact that can slide under your TV. Otherwise, there are many choices in this price range, including 5 speaker sets that sound really great - especially if you already have a receiver.
$review_summary.: Nice sound, slim design fits nicely under TV, control with TV remote.

$REVIEW.: um, this camera is wicked awesome. video out to tv via hdmi? check. Auto settings and a wide range of presets for camera pics? check. Under 200$? check. good picture for video and pic quality is good as well? check. people have stated that the audio from the video may not be the best BUT: i had to take video of an error message on a data center floor. Upon playback i could hear myself over the blaring fans of 100,000 devices in the background. let me stop here and advise that i havent had a camera since the disposables(film) came out, but i really think for 200$ this is a great buy. easy to use, plenty of settings, extremely portable. whats not to like? make sure you grab a class 4 or higher sdhc card with your purchase, as well as a mini hdmi -> hdmi cable for your video out.

This case is extremely well-built and works great especially if you are using a Corsair Power Supply and a Corsair cooler. The case is easy to use and includes handy places to route your cables. Installing Hard Drives is quick and painless. The fans that come with this case are absolutely amazing and make almost zero noise. Overall I am very impressed and would quickly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a premium no-frills computer case.

$review_text.: Pros: Works, if you follow the instructions carefully.Cons: The stuff is really sticky, i.e. hard to remove if you get it on where it should not be. :)Other thoughts: This is a _pressure-applied_ adhesive, i.e. one has to apply pressure to it after it has been put on the first surface (after the clear plastic is removed, but before the removal of wax paper). One will have to try it once or twice before they would get the hang of it. As with everything else like this, clean the surfaces sufficiently (and dry!) for it to be applied properly. My application was to surfaces that are much smaller than the pad - had to cut one pad into multiple smaller pieces (made this harder than it would be with the whole pad applied).

$review_text.: The quality of those Slim Jewel Cases is reasonable, the price is very attractive, delivery is fast and the seller is good. The only problem with these products is there fragile nature which makes them susceptible to damage in transportation. I ordered a box of 200 and although the package was reasonable, 15 cases were broken inside the packaging box when I received it. I highly recommend not to buy a package of large quantity such as the one I bought (200 cases). Ordering a box of max. 50 cases will have a much better chance to stay intact during transportation.

$review_text.: I sifted through the product reviews of this before I bought it, figuring that if the keyboard part was as bad as some people said, then at least I could remove it, since it's magnetic. Well, I got it, and I love it. The keyboard works wonderfully, I haven't had any keys pop off, and they feel as though they're stuck on there well. I enjoy the look of this case, and the buttons are easily accessible, contrary to what somebody else wrote about it (maybe they had their kindle in there the wrong way?)Anyway, I should mention that the keyboard is small. I am a female with larger hands, although not quite as large as a man's, but I could definitely see where a man would have issues typing on this. I almost laugh to think of my father trying to use this, as he has very large hands. So, a word of advice: if you have xsmall-medium hands as a woman, this will probably be alright for you. If you are a man and have xsmall-small hands, this would also probably work for you.Otherwise, this is a wonderful product and I couldn't be happier.

$REVIEW.: After losing one hard drive I've always been worried about future drives failing.  You end up losing photos videos and personal documents that just can't be replaced.  Data redundancy is something that every one should have any home solution.  Netgear's readyNAS box accomplishes this.  With just a minimum of two hard drives your data is safe just in case one drive fails.  I considered Drobo FS but found that the speeds just weren't there.  I didn't want to sit through 10 hour backups instead the netgear readyNAS offers speeds around 80 MB per second.  When backing up large amounts of videos photos and documents, readynas accomplishes in a short amount of time.  The device is not difficult to set up at all being a person who deals with corporate raid arrays this box is relatively simple.  A few problems that I need to point out which reduces my five star rating to a four star.  Netgear's x-raid2 has horrible rebuild times.  Instead of doing it at a per file basis it actually recopies every single sector on the hard drive regardless if there's data or not.  I have used corporate raid solutions, the amount of time to rebuild an array is solely dependent on the number and size of files.  If you have an empty raid it's instantaneous to rebuild.  Unfortunately this is not the case with net gear's x-raid2.  For a 2 TB hard drive it took literally seven hours to do what is called a resync.  In the raid world is called a rebuild.  Second problem I discovered is do not use green drives.  Green drives have a tendency to trick the raid array into thinking a drive failed.  I highly recommend you go with the basic hard drive or a performance hard drive and skip the green drives altogether.  There are plenty of applications you can install on readyNAS to expand the capabilities of the device.  Have a large iTunes collection no problem.  DLNA support is out-of-the-box standard.  It works flawlessly.  If I would have to recommend this box I would say go for it it's definitely worth every penny.  However do not rely on Netgear support as they are completely uneducated towards the products they need to support.  You will find far better support on their forums due to community members having more intelligence and more experience.

$review_text.: Very easy to set up, and works well with a strong signal. I have a large house, and I find that the signal travels well to all corners of the house. Still, it is not magic: my desk was blocked by an air handling (HVAC) unit from a line-of-sight signal on the old G-level router and as I expected the signal remains poor now. I still use an ethernet-connected WAP to get a wifi connection for my laptop from this desk.One point: you do not want your wifi-connected printer to be on the guest network. Our windows computers and IPAD's kept defaulting to the guest network until I unchecked the option (in the network and sharing center) to connect automatically to the guest network, so the printer didn't seem to work at first - but it does once both are on the regular network. Also, if you need to call Asus tech support ( I did on this issue), the help is of varying quality. The first agent I got was technically very weak and seemed to me to be offering very bad advice. So I ignored him and called back. Got someone who set me straight quickly.

$review_text.: I looked around to pick a good digital camera. I had a few things in mind that I wanted but I could never find a right all together piece. I think that Sony was the best compromise in terms of features, size and durability. I shoot a lot of film and a lot of times I really don't have to, since the pictures don't go further than web. Using S85 saved me on processing cost, time and gave me more options as far as manipulation of the images go. Since my original purchase was to ease the load and free me up in my "professional" life I find that more often I happen to pack the digital on my hiking or camping trips. I still carry my film camera but I supplement my film shots with a lot of digital snaps. Using Sony manual modes also allows me to become better photographer and it's really fool proof. I see the results immediately and if something is wrong I can re-shoot it again which was impossible with film. I mean yes I can always shoot two or three frames but you surly never know until you get the film from the lab what came out. When I shoot concerts or band shots this is a one time deal. They can't go back and replay the gig. So to be perfect and on the dime is very important for me. I choose S85 for couple of reasons:1) Optics. Can't go wrong with Carl Zeiss glass. It's a really sharp and warm saturated tone that keeps me buying into Zeiss family.2) Lens brightness (f/stops). Maybe there are better cameras out there with higher zoom range but f/stops on this camera (S85) rock. It's bright and fast enough which means that in combination with faster film setting it will get the job done.3) Battery life. I originally was very skeptic of using rechargeable battery because of the possible what if I run out of juice scenario. I assumed that I will feel more secure with AAs that rechargeable proprietary battery. I was wrong. Sony battery lasts forever and with one spare everything is pretty much covered.4) Quality. Good enough for nice and crisp 8 by 10 shots. If I really push it I can get 11 by 14. But for my application it gets the job done.5) Controls. Easily accessible, options are always at the finger tips.6) Construction. It's a one big solid unit. No swivel lens, sliding doors, build in lens covers or pop up flashes. There is very few moving parts which makes it a durable piece. Plus build in charger keeps all your things organized.7) Flash and Sharpness control. At the finger tips I have full override on functions that were always problematic with digital cameras. This saves post production time required for touch ups.What could have Sony done to make it better?1) ISO. Highest ISO setting is 400  I wish they went for 800.2) Accessories. There is a load of after market accessories for this camera by other manufactures than Sony. I would like to see some more lenses or maybe even external battery packs made by Sony itself. Underwater housing would be great.3) Little bit slow start up time. That needs some works.4) Memory stick. Great concept and I couldn't care less if I'm using memory sticks, flash cards or smart media cards but with 128 MB max Sony media is not the hottest choice out there.Sony S85 is a good camera, probably the best out of the bunch out there. I would highly recommend it to amateurs and semi pros alike. It's a good value for the money.

$REVIEW.: OK - wow! I took a gamble and it paid off. I've been using a very expensive "lifestyle" speaker, ie. all show, no go. It was narrow to fit under the TV, but little drivers simply can't cheat physics. So I wanted to return to a big box with dual 6" drivers. The BIC sounds amazing. It has surprising punch in the low end, it keeps impressing me as it breaks in. As other reviewers have stated - out of the box the bottom end is disappointing... just give it a few days. I now see why people buy 3 of these to use as mains. This one change to my setup has completely changed the quality of TV watching. I just ordered the DV64s because the prices are so cheap for what you get and I just had to know what the trio will sound like.

$REVIEW.: I love this thing. It was cheap, and it keeps my laptop from blowing up! lol. I usually use my laptop on my bed, but the blankets heat it up quick. I kept wondering why the pc would shut off, so I found a free software that tells me my laptops temperature. I found out my laptop gets up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and it just pops off. I bought this since it was only $5 (and I got it free thanks to swagbucks), and I plugged it up. I didn't think it would work, but the highest my laptop temperature would get was 150 degrees Fahrenheit! Yes, it's still hot, but for $5 that's a big difference. I uploaded some photo's for you to see a better image of the device (Using my Kodak Zi8). I don't like the blue light, but it doesn't bother me to much. I do not like that when I set this on the bed the fan will stop because the blankets touch the fan. There's nothing to stop from stuff touching the fan below (no gate to stop things touching it). Still my laptop doesn't heat up so easy! I love this device, and for the price it's great. This device also seems to be sturdy. It's flexible, but doesn't snap when a laptop is set on it. This device does seem kind of cheap, but it's not a $25 so this is the best one I could find. I hope my review helped.

 I did a little troubleshooting and it appears something went wrong with the little connector pins at the bottom

 This seems to be a common issue and the only thing you can do is replace the cradle if your GPS is out of warranty.This is exactly like the cradle that comes with the 550

 They even include the two tiny screws to hold the electrical connector in place


 I am not happy about having to replace the cradle, but this one got me back up and running in no time

$REVIEW.: My case arrived before my iPad mini.  It looks like it will hold the iPad really well and provide a great stand, so I am all excited as I open the sealed plastic bag that contains the case......When I open the plastic bag, I am immediately overcome by obnoxious chemical fumes coming from the case.  The chemical smell is worse than being in a room that has just been painted, with all the windows closed.So, I put the case in my garage hoping that like fresh paint the smell will go away in a few days.  As I am opening all the windows in my home, I notice a splitting headache, and start to wonder what toxic chemicals I have just been exposed to.........The next morning, the chemically induced headache is about half gone (but still pretty bad).I will give the case a week or so to air out, then update this review.  In the meantime, I am looking for a case that is not laced with carcinogenic chemicals.--------------------------------  Update November 9, 2012  ----------------------------------After a week, most (but not all) of the obnoxious chemical odor is gone.  The odor must be some glue, dye or solvent used in making the case. I am guessing that it is the glue that holds the soft inside to the outside of the case.  I will update.-------------------------------  Update December 2012. -----------------------------------After almost two months the odor is finally gone, and this is a really nice case.

I have this adapter plugged into the tape deck adapter and the cord from the tape adapter is neatly wound up around the miccus and tucked away in the ashtray.  I can close the ashtray and now I have only one very short cord from tape deck to ashtray.  No unsightly mess or tangled cords anymore... Plus my phone can be anywhere... even in my purse.Pairing is easy.  The iPhone automatically connects when bluetooth is on and music begins playing right where it left off from a previous drive.  One really cool thing I discovered today is that I can pause the music with one click on the miccus button and skip to the next track with two clicks.  Now I really can drive safely.  Still trying to figure out how to get the miccus to skip backwards.  Three clicks or more doesn't do it.This is a GREAT little gadget.  And I LOVE IT.

$review_text.: Wow, I haven't reviewed this yet?  I've had it for at least 3 years!  Well, I can easily say this is the best TV I've owned.  I did months of research and testing in home theater speciality stores.  I am quite a home theater snob.  At the time, the battle was raging between plasma, LCD, and DLP.  This TV uses technology closest to DLP, but it is unique (SXRD).  The color reproduction is superior.  I use calibration to control the quality and HDMI 1.3 among my set-top box, PS3, etc.  It took some doing to nail in that perfect color; the menus go several layers deep.  I don't use the built-in speakers, so I can't speak to the quality of the unit's audio.  Just recently, the light bulb blew.  (Note that it lasted about 3 years.)  It is quite a pricey replacement, and don't expect to get one from Sony.  They seem to be permanently backordered.  Luckily, a shop in town had the Philips equivalent, but be aware it is a $200-250 replacement.  It is meant to last 8000+ hours--several years worth of watching--but you'll find mixed reviews when it comes to replacement longevity.  This unit was also the subject of a class action law suit last year regarding a piece of equipment within the set.  I was not having any issues with that piece, so chose not to take part.I'm very satisfied with this and it makes me feel good when friends want to use my house for big games and to watch movies.  I honestly believe I have a better viewing experience than some theaters.  I think everyone who has seen my setup agrees.

$REVIEW.: I bought this as an upgrade to the Nuvi 660 that I have had for several years.  The features of this GPS are great.  I like the routing, multiple waypoints, qwerty keyboard (more, later), traffic, lane assist, and the ability to sort MP3 files by album after selecting the artist.  I would have given this unit four stars.  However, the touchscreen could not be properly calibrated and constantly gave bad responses to my touches (sometimes off by two lines on the keyboard screen).  We used this for a week while on vacation in Arizona and just could not live with the touchscreen errors so we returned it.  Unfortunately, Amazon is out of the Lifetime Maps bundles and buying them separately is much more expensive.  I am ordering a refurbished unit, instead, and will order Numaps Lifetime, if the refurbished unit is working well.Other comments on this unit - the qwerty keyboard is a step in the right direction but Garmin elected to put the numbers along the top and this reduced the key size considerably.  The screen images do not appear to be as sharp as on the Nuvi 660.  The internal antenna is okay but I like the option on the 660 of turning off the GPS receiver by folding up the antenna - on the Nuvi 765t, you must navigate the menus and enable Simulator mode.  I also prefer the 660's "music" button on the map display that allows one-tap access to the MP3 player at any time rather than several clicks to get there through the menus.  The 765t shows the music button while music is playing but it disappears when the songs stop.  The 765t's Bluetooth would not allow my Blackberry to download its phone book - this works on the 660.I am concerned that Garmin is dropping the MP3 player from its Nuvis.  I love this feature and use an RCA mini-jack cable to connect the Nuvi directly to my car stereo - it works much better than the FM transmitter.  If they had MP3 in the new 3790 model, I'd be there - it's gorgeous.
$SUMMARY.: Great features but returned due to flaky touchscreen

$REVIEW.: I bought a Probox with 4 HDs bay and so the most cheap 4Tb option in Amazon was this baby. I bought 4 already and opened the case (there is a tutorial in youtube for that). It is cheaper than the HD alone so I kept the cable and the e-sata external dock. I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: After reading all of the reviews (most were negative), I went against my better judgement and picked up this mouse

I was happy to find out that it's not the terrible mouse that everyone is making it out to be (personal opinion, hold the flames)
I find the multitouch commands to be useful in my line of work where I always have at least 10 windows open and use multiple display
The snap-to commands are easier/faster than using the keyboard shortcuts, same thing with maximizing/minimizing


It did take a few hours to get used to the multitouch, but I'm so used to it now that I find myself swiping on my other mice

While the mouse is good for office work, it is absolutely terrible for gaming


Even though I enjoy using this mouse, I'd personally recommend skipping it unless you are feeling adventurous.Pros:Can be very useful when working with lots of windows and multiple displays.Cool looking mouse (and packaging).Small wireless dongle.Cons:Might be hard to get used to the multitouch.Scrolling is tricky.Terrible for gaming (and I mean TERRIBLE).Not for everyone
Most people will prefer a regular mouse.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this to use it with a desktop in the upstairs bedroom directly avove the room in which the router is placed.. We recently switched our service provider to and the connection speed of 50 Mbps. My laptop connects without any problems when in upstairs bedroom with its built-in wifi and the speed I get is about 22 Mbps, when I take it downstairs in the same room as the router it jumps from 22 to 30Mbps, (45 Mbps via ethernet).I tried the Edimax with my laptop which has no problem connecting when downstairs but in the bedroom it keeps loosing the signal intermittently. My laptop has Windows 7 installed.I tried it with my second laptop which is an IBM Thinkpad with Ubuntu 12.04 installed. The speed I was getting downstairs was 12 Mbps which I thought was not bad but upstairs the speed dropped to barely 2 Mbps and sometimes no signalI decided to return it and selected another adapter TP-Link TL-WN722N which worked like a charm on all my machines.If you will be using the unit in the same room as the router be it Linux or Windows, this will work for you but if the router and the unit are at a distance, particularly on different floors you will have issues.The main reason for poor performance could be attributed to the unit being very tiny and the built-in antenna is not powerful enough for it to work at a fair distance from router particularly if there are walls and floors in the way.

$REVIEW.: First, I'll cut to the chase: the iHome IH-A600KB numeric keypad works with Macs, as long as its Num Lock function is turned off.Now here's the rest of the story


I tested the keypad on an i7 iMac running OS 10.6.8, connecting via the USB port on a wired Apple keyboard and then via a port on a powered USB hub


No configuration or driver downloads were necessary after plugging the keypad into either port (a Keyboard Assistant window pops up but this window can be safely dismissed).What I like*USB cable is long enough to allow convenient placement for both lefties and righties, even with large laptops.*Well constructed, with strain relief on both ends of the USB cable.*LED indicator for Num Lock.*Keys for both "0" and "000"*LightweightIf you've done a lot of 10-key input by touch on Apple keyboards, though, this keypad has some significant drawbacks:*The ridge on the 5 key is not very high and is too close to the edge of the key
This makes it difficult to center your fingers.*A backspace key has been placed in the upper right hand corner so the * key (multiplication) and the / key (division) are not in their usual Apple positions.*There isn't a key for =.Bottom line: the iHome keypad has several nice features and feels sturdily made


Those who do not rely on touch when doing 10-key input may find this keypad to be a good choice but I found it difficult to use quickly and accurately

Two stars.

$review_text.: The built in screen protector works really well, I didn't notice any degradation in touch sensitivity but it might be a tight fit if you have another screen protector already on the iPad.  It has rubber covers for the headphone jack and lightning port, the buttons are covered as well with a little pop open tab if you need access to the mute switch, and there are windows covering the camera holes.  This makes it pretty splash proof but I wouldn't take playing with liquids too far since there are cut outs for the microphones and speakers.  The standout feature for me is on the back.  The leather hand strap feels great and makes one handed use very secure, though I'd like if it was adjustable somehow.  The disc on the back rotates so you can adjust it to whatever angle you want.  The kickstand built in under the leather strap is also very robust, not cheap feeling at all.  It props the tablet up at a great angle for desk use but again, it'd be cool if the angle was adjustable somehow.The case manages to add a great amount of protection without adding a ton of bulk to the air and I think its great.  If you find yourself using your iPad while standing often this is a great case for you.

$REVIEW.: Wacom has brought this technology a long way. Many shopping for Wacom tablets probably have owned similar products in the past. This product is more affordable than the higher end Intuos3 models, yet powerful enough for many pros.For me, the small size is perfect.  The "medium" sized tablet is suited for hard core graphics people who need to work at the pixel level for large images. Those using this for the mouse also may prefer the medium size.  However, most users will find the small size probably fits their needs. Either way, the tablet maps to your screen size for any of these models.This unit comes in a variety of colors and configurations. I prefer the look of the black tablet, but there are silver, white and blue ones also.Bamboo Fun (Medium) Silver Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics SoftwareBamboo Fun (Medium) Black Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics SoftwareBamboo Fun (Medium) Blue Tablet with Pen, Mouse & Graphics SoftwareUpon plugging in the device, the mouse worked immediately! The pen also works as a mouse or as a pen/brush for drawing applications.The mouse is nice because it allows you to free up a USB port if you're using a USB mouse. Power users will need more from a mouse though. If you're anything like me, you prefer a mouse with many more options than this one provides.Installing the drivers and software allows you to access the settings and tools that make this device versatile and customizable. The Bamboo software also allows you to customize the buttons. Left-handers will greatly appreciate this!  Be prepared to spend some time tweaking this unit to your likes.The software included with this device is a nice to have. Many people who buy this will already have or need full blown Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Elements gives you everything casual users need. The Corel application is nice to play with. But other than a few "macro" type functions I have yet to find anything I can't already do with Adobe. Perhaps newer users may find the Corel product more user-friendly.Pros+ USB connection+ Works on XP and Vista almost plug and play - before software installation+ Nice customizable software+ Nice bundled applications - Adobe Elements and Corel Draw+ No additional power adapter needed+ Traditional or pen mouse for casual users+ Small size is perfect for users not using the mouseCons- The scrolling zoom function does not work uniformly on all applications- The mouse with this model will not suffice for power users- Default settings require a lot of adjusting for graphics editing- The tablet would have been ideal with several additional USB portsOverall, the graphic artist or visual junkie NEEDS one of these. If you are a casual user, it is worth getting one on sale. The small model with pen only will meet most users' needs.Enjoy.

$REVIEW.: I read many reviews that these speakers create distortion at higher volume level.  Well, if your goal is to shatter your windows, this is not your set. But if you just need high quality sound for your immediate surrounding near your computer (or for that matter, little space around your iPod), this set produces ample sound. While bass may not be overwhelming, it is definitely there. And it doesn't compromise mid to high range either. This set maintains high quality sound at lower volume level. I thought that lack of treble and bass control would bother me, but no, I didn't need them at all, as it sounds good right out of the box.  I wouldn't pay more than $100 for it, but at the current price range, it is a good deal.

$review_text.: Oh How I wish I had one of these boxes 5 years ago when I built my first HTPC. That one was a monster that cost me a small fortune. My other desktop died and was in the market for one. I stumbled upon the zbox in some of my searches. Basically I just decided to use my htpc as a desktop and buy zbox for media stuff.It would be an under-statement to call the setup a breeze. It took literally 2 minutes to pop off the thumb screws and pop in the memory and ssd. Installing the excellent OpenElec media center on the ssd using a usb drive took 2 more minutes. Configuring the hdmi audio out by editing one text file took 1 more minute. So within 5 minutes I had a fully functional htpc that could stream my HD media off of my NAS and onto my receiver and HD TV.The construction looks solid, the box itself is very light and sleek. Only thing I would like to get changed is the bright green halo on top. Its not a major issue though.I heartily recommend this box for any htpc lovers. It does mean less tinkering and custom installation which might not be appreciated by the true hackers. However if the goal is to get a light, cheap htpc that can stream virtually any media file, zbox+OpenElec cannot be beat.

$review_text.: As an IT professional, I have an interest in gadgets like the Macally PowerLink Emergency Battery Pack.  On the surface, this seems like a cool accessory to own, and offers more versatility than just a plain flash drive.As a flash drive, 2GB is small by today's standards.  A decently ratedKingston 2GB flash driveis priced below $10.  I couldn't find a way to transfer data from the flash drive to the Apple device either.  The much higher price of this item makes the flash capabilities a secondary benefit.  Adding more storage space would unquestionably add value.As a data sync the PowerLink acts as an adapter between the Apple device and the PC.  This too is a secondary benefit, as using the suppliedApple dock connectortakes less space for travel and is simple to use.  However the PowerLink is a worthy alternative.As a battery pack, this unit takes about 3 hours to fully charge using a USB port. We were able to use the battery power for over two hours on the iPod.  The battery strength is indicated on the PowerLink using three indicator lights, while the Apple device indicates a charging mode.  This function is the primary reason to own the Macally PowerLink.The PowerLink does what it claims and comes with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty.  For the price, the flash drive capability is small; increasing the storage amount would definitely add value.  The data sync is a nice to have.  The primary reason to purchase the PowerLink lies with the battery backup capabilities.  If you often run low on power, consider the PowerLink as a solution.  Also consider the less versatileKensington Mini Battery Extender.PROS:Versatile 3 in 1 device1 year manufacturer's warrantyCONS:Small 2GB flash drive size

$REVIEW.: I looked over all the cases for my new Kindle Fire HDX and I finally decided on the black Poetic Slimline case. I am so glad I bought this one! It fits my Kindle perfectly like a glove, so much so that it almost seems that it is part of the Kindle itself. It is slim, lightweight, form fitting, and it looks great too! It has a wonderful wake/sleep feature that functions just by opening or closing the cover. The front cover can also fold back and under to form a little stand for the Kindle to rest against while I am busy doing other things, unable to hold it. This is a beautiful, very well-made case, and I plan to buy it in other colors as well.I highly recommend the Poetic Slimline Case for the Kindle Fire HDX.

 So far nothing can beat my Sony EX-81 headphones
I got these in hopes that they would be better, but sadly, they are not.They are comfortable headphones, without a doubt
They stay in place while running which is a HUGE plus


 However, they do NOT block out any outside noise whatsoever, which really interferes with my listening


It makes my music sound like messy background noise


In addition, the sound quality is terrible, most likely because I can't hear my music due to all the background noise.These are good for small ears, but people with larger ears may need to look elsewhere


 They do not include different size inserts for the ear tips.All in all, I was disappointed in these headphones

I Own(ed), Marantz, Pioneer, Sansui, Infiniti, Bose, you name it and I've had it over the years

I have a recording studio in the lower level of my home and when my old standard yamaha bit the dust, man it was hard to find just a 2 ch


amp to replace it

Everybody had this 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 home theatre linw-up but nobody had a simple 2 ch amp for just music


Well that is except Onkyo, so I got one


Impressive to say the least


The power raiting for Onkyo is kinda like getting the true horsepower from Corvette, they under estimate it a little bit

Why is this an issue, power is where the big boys fall flat on their faces when you crank it up on a hot Saturday Night with Led Zeppelin being crammed down your throat, Amps clip, Speakers blow fuses, you know the drill

Well Onkyo, it takes it and takes it and takes it


The sound is incredible

Fast forward from that amp in 2006 to today

I just bought a 73" Mitsubishi Diamond Rear Projection TV
it's a hog and I love it
But guess what


My Yamaha Home Theatre A/V Rcvr (which is still very very good) doesn't support HDMI, in fact the highest quality output is Component, which is still a pretty good standard
So I had to get a new one to bring the best out of the TV right? right! It was a no brainer, go ahead compare the stats and specs all you want, bottom line is, Inputs, Inputs, Inputs, right? Right! You simply cannot get a better A/V Rcvr for the money, In fact you can easily spend hundreds more and STILL notb touch the Versatility and Quality of this 706 from Onkyo

Talk about inputs, how about 4 HDMI, yeh 4, the best near this is 3 and you get a lot less in the audio side as well

Look I have 10 components I need to attach to this puppy, Turntable, laser Disc(remember those? LOL), Karaoke, DVD and now a Denon Blu Ray, XBox360, PS3, Wii, not to memntion the Cassette Deck and Cable Box right?, so it's got to have head room

Onkyo has it and then some

But that is not where the beauty of this A/V Rcvr hits the road
Thats the nuts and bolts but how does it look compared to Component and how does it sound
OK to be honest it is hard to see a great deal of difference between HDMI and Component as far as video quality but it is there, it is noticeable, just not by a lot so don't be expecting Angels to sing and your heart to skip a beat


But there is a slight noticeable difference

The sound is awsome, similar to the Yamaha but hey when you team up any decent Rcvr with Cerwin Vegas, you can't miss

as for speakers, look i have tried the no lows of Bose, the Phiny of Sona, and the lacluster of Infinit and a great deal of others


you want punch in the face bass, ram it up your A** Midrange, and highs so crisp you could swear its Bacon, get Cerwin Vegas Classic 12's or if you want to knock the walls down 15's
They simply rock
I love classical music too so don't think it always 2 fists pumping Metallica, Beetoven, Bach, get real, crank up these old timers and you can hear where music came from


Don't laugh, some of this stuff rivals the best S$!& you've ever rocked out too

But hey back to the 706


I give this a solid 10 for looks, performance, and value
You can spend or I should say WASTE more money elsewhere


But if you're a Bang for the Buck kind of guy like me who works hard for the dough and wants kicka** performance without breaking the bank
YOU CANNOT MISS with this ONKYO Unit

NUFF SAID

 See Ya


Please forgive any spelling errors or misnomenclatures, this is not a product review from an Onkyo employee or anyone in any way affiliated with anybody except the working human race and I only type with 3 fingers..LOL...Rock On.

$REVIEW.: My card failed just past Amazon's 30-day warranty
I then spent more than 90 minutes talking to 6 different Sony reps in 6 different departments (and probably 6 different countries), trying to get a replacement card


Most reps didn't know what I was talking about, and all gave useless advice, and argued with me about the warranty
(One said that devices sold by Amazon may be counterfeit, so the warranty is only 90 days

I doubt this is true, but why argue with me about it, when the card is only 44 days old?) I was cut off twice, and had to repeat my info more times than I can count


Absolutely atrocious customer service

So, if you get a good card, great

If you get a bad card, you're SOL.Update after 2 weeks of playing with Sony: I have now spent at least 3 hours on the phone with more than a dozen different reps, plus several emails, and they all keep passing the buck
I finally got a direct phone number for the Sony Media Storage department (877-440-3453), but when you call that number -- and I've tried every day for the past 10 days -- you get a message saying they're not available now, please leave a message -- but you can't leave a message, because "the user's mailbox is full." Unbelievable


Normally I wouldn't go to this much effort for a $20 product, but now it's a matter of principle
Sony makes some cool stuff, and I've bought a *lot* of it over the past 40 years -- but never again.

She has easily read 6-8 books in the past year and the light is now ready for a new battery which I will pick-up today

 If you use your kindle in the traveling in the car, day or night, the light will not bother the driver or passengers

It had an 18 month warranty and I bought a 4-year extended warranty ($200)from SONY


Good thing to


The main digital circuit board and LDC panal failed at 17 months 20 days, just before warranty expired


 SONY has been very responsive for service and is replacing the entire unit with a KDL40XBR9(refurbished) unit under warranty
SONY no longer offers the KDL40XBR7 set except as a refurbished unit for $1350

I'm otherwise very pleased with the set except for the major component failure at 18 months

 The Amazon price is a good deal, but try to get an extended warranty from a reputable source


The replacement unit (KDL40XBR9) is a better unit with faster refresh rate (240Hz vs

120Hz for the XBR7).The replacement KDL40XBR9(refurbished) unit has performed excellantly


Very pleased with it to date.

$REVIEW.: I needed this to enable me to hook up my MacBook to my HDTV. It serves the purpose but any slight movement of the computer while it's hooked up results in losing the signal. Apparently the mini-DVI connection has just enough play to cause the connection to drop out. I don't know if the Apple OEM adapter cable is any better or not, but this one just feels a little cheesy. If you don't need a mission critical cable, this will probably do but for critical work you may want to spend the extra bucks for the real deal.

$review_text.: I purchased these for when I work at my computer in my office.The Good- these really are fantastic wireless headphones for the price. The signal is clear, the audio is balanced. I wasn't looking for audio-file quality, I just needed headphones that didn't keep me tethered at my desk. For that, these are excellent. I've only had them a few days, so I can't speak to the battery life or anything, but all in all, they are really good. They are mostly comfortable too. See "the nit picks" below.The BAD- 1 word: auto-on/off. (Yes, I know that's more than 1 word). If the base unit detects an audio signal, it turns on and begins transmitting. This is all fine until you're sitting at your desk working and not concentrating on the audio coming out the headphones, and the audio signal ends. No biggie, we all have sat at our desks working, headphones on, listening to nothing. Then, all of a sudden, the base unit turns off, because of course, no signal, and your ears are pierced with the heavens-splitting sound of static. Heart-attack, pooed pants, and bleeding ears. Argh. This, to me, is a huge flaw and I don't think a sound mitigation feature should be a premium component to these headphones. So what I have to do is continuously turn the damn things on and off (on the headphones themselves) and really think through if I'm listening to something or not. Surely this can be done differently. Quite frankly, I could do w/out the auto on/off "feature".The Nit Picks - I hate the foamy flat-on-your-ears material, but I guess that's a result of the price point. Just personal pref. I'm thinking about replacing the pads with crushed velvet.Conclusion- you can't beat the price for a budget set of wireless headphones. Buy these if you plan on watching movies, actively listening to music, etc. But, if you're like me and work with headphones on, and listen to things that periodically go on and off, these may not be your cup of tea. The auto on/off thing is a real deal breaker for me.UPDATE - On top of my dislike for the auto on/off feature, I've discovered another related gem. If the output of your device is below a certain threshold, the unit effectively thinks there's no sound and shuts off. You guessed it, blasting your ears with static. So, if you turn your music/sound down below a threshold that you have no way of knowing, the base unit will shut off. Sigh.

 :DThe cable worked, the video came in well, just as good as it did with the other cable we all ready had and the audio worked just dandy, no issues there


 So, would I recommend it, sure!  Its not a bad price and it is a quality product and you're not going to get too much cheaper, if at all, for a cable of its kind, so you really cannot go wrong!  :DGod Bless ~Amy

$REVIEW.: This is an industrial strength business router.  Rock solid reliable, chock full of features.A beginner might get some basic functionality out of this router through the wizards.  I couldn't be sure but it seems possible.  I want to recommend this for a beginner, but can't.On the other hand, an IT expert is rewarded with immense functionality & customizable options.  Once you learn the SonicWall "way" it is very sensible, and as an added bonus applies fairly universally across SonicWall devices big and small.Out of the box features include rate limiting, decent metrics reporting, IPS firewall, VPN tunnels, "real" DMZ ability and a bunch more.  Good stuff!EDIT:  After over a month living with this product, I am sorely disappointed.  I've overseen numerous SonicWall configurations, but this device is unreliable.  Unable to go more than 7 days at a stretch without failure.  Furthermore, I don't feel particularly convinced the support staff really want to resolve the issues.  Demoting from 5 stars to 2.  For shame SonicWall.  For shame.EDIT: 3/8 After two months, support is a disaster.  It's disorganized, misguided and has been a complete waste of my time - and a lot of time at that, as I tried to play nice until my client told me "we want our old router back".  Now I am trying to get a refund, but SonicWall is putting up resistance all over the place.

$REVIEW.: For the budding camera person this is a fun little kit to use.  Basically you are photographing someone with a "green screen" behind them and then the software allows you to change the background image so it looks like the person(s) are in a different place such as a beach or in Paris.  It is a nice little starter kit but it is just that, a starter kit, in my opinion.  The green screen works well but you MUST be sure all creases are out of it before taking the picture or it will not work properly.  There are other limitations which make this a recommended buy only for the most basic users such as: can't do basic cropping, some filter and effects functions not available, mask functions not available, overlay function requires additional purchase and download.  Overall this is a nice little kit for a very basic beginner.  But personally I don't think it is worth the price.

The Phone button, lets you answer your phone, is on the exposed end of the ear bud. The Play/Pause button is the same but on the other ear. If you want to put ear muffs or even a hat down over them you will bump them. The volume controls are stiff. Changing the volume requires some force to get them to do it. I am reasonably happy with this set and now that I know a few things to look for I can get a better pair at some other time.***UPDATE***I bought this set mainly to use when going on my long walks on the weekends. I did not even get out of my yard before I knew they would not work for me. The second I started walking they started cutting out.

$review_text.: I use my nexus for business and personal use. My business consists of traveling to large and often grimy construction or manufacturing sites. I keep my Nexus FHD in this case at all times.Pros:Well built sturdy case. I've reviewed numerous cellphone cases and said that they dont feel cheap, but this one raises that bar. Build quality is that of a $40-$50 case.Autosleep works flawlessly - At first I thought I was crazy I kept trying to open the case and after I would press the button to wake it up. It would subsequently shut back off. That's BY DESIGN. With this case all that you have to do is flip it open and the Nexus will wake up. The same goes for closing it (goes to sleep). This really helps when working on the fly.Lefties rejoice! For once in our lives WE get the benefit from a design. The hand strap is perfect for taking pictures. If you put your hand through and clench your fist just a little (while keeping your thumb on the spine of the case for support) you can take perfect and quick pics. Righties, you can do this as well but it's just a bit more awkward. Deal with it, we have to deal with a right handed world our whole lives :).Cons -Due to the demands of my industry this case gets dirty. I can wipe off the exterior easy enough, but the interior cloth is a bit more difficult. This isn't a show stopper nor is it impossible to clean, it just takes a little extra effort. Its a design choice not a design flaw so no stars lost on this.Stylus was lost within 2 weeks. It was a little awkward on the outside of the case. The next generation should try to work this in somewhere a bit more secure. Again, due to how I use this case anything extruding is a liability.True rating 4.5 stars for me. If you are dependent on a stylus than I would give it a 4 star review.

$REVIEW.: I replaced a corrupted Apple factory hard drive in my early-2011 Macbook Pro 15&#34;. This installed flawlessly.It's faster than the 7200 that was in there, but no comparison to the speed of a true SSD drive. It also runs a little noisier when spinning.If you want to get more performance out of your hard drive, without sacrificing capacity or your wallet &#8212;I'd recommend this.Pleased with it's performance over the past 4 months.
$SUMMARY.: Better than a standard HDD, not as good as an SSD.

IN OTHER WORDS: CONS ARE NEGLIGIBLE.pros: everything else, including the price, the automatic wake function, the simplicity, the fit.  I take the iPad mini everywhere, so this provided really good protection.

$review_text.: Why would you spend the extra money for this monitor?  You can get a nice 24" monitor for a lot less than $400 . . . I know because that's what I did about 18 months ago when I bought my 24" Samsung Syncmaster 2433.  I was very happy with that monitor, and now my wife is very happy with it on her computer.  Before buying the Samsung I didn't do my homework and so I was just looking for a larger size for my video and photo editing.  I didn't dig deep enough to learn about things like TFT and ISP.  Among many other differences I didn't know that TFT monitors are really 6 bit with an algorithm to make it look like you are getting a lot more colors than you really are and that ISP monitors are true 8 bit.  After about 9 months with the Samsung I really began to notice that when I was editing images I kept moving my head and/or tilting the screen to see it at the best angle.  I also found I was standing up and stepping back a few feet to get a better look.  That's when I started researching and finding out why some monitors cost a lot more than others.  Yes, you can pay $1000 or more for a monitor, which I don't need because I don't make a living with my graphics, it's just a very serious hobby.  Fortunately for me, like a lot of technology, the price on good ISP monitors has dropped a lot in the last year.After spending several hours in research I decided that the HP ZR24w was probably the best value for my budget.  I read numerous reviews both here on Amazon.com and others.Like others, one of the first things I noticed when I opened the box and started to unpack it was the shear weight and solid feeling of both the monitor and the stand.  I also noticed that every kind of cord was included so whether you want to connect by VGA (I wouldn't recommend), DVI or Display Port, It's in there.  They also included a USB cable to connect to use the monitor as a USB Hub - very handy.The next thing I noticed was that it didn't look like the photo on the Amazon site. In the photo it looks like the top and bottom of the frame around the screen is bright chrome.  I was worried about a bright reflection being distracting.  I was happy to see that the monitor is surrounded by flat black on all four sides.  The control buttons are on the lower right front, which have not been a distraction for me.As hinted above, the stand is very solid and substantial.  It also provides a good solid base that does not easily slide on the desktop.  The connection of the monitor to the stand is very well engineered and built with the added bonus of a passage opening through the base to guide cords.  Again, well done. There appears to be plenty of adjustment in height, tilt angle and rotation angle and as a bonus it seems quite smooth in all directions.Knowing that I was not going up in size the only reason to get this new monitor was for a better image for my photo editing and hoping that it would be a little easier on the eyes because of it.  Again, not being a business use, I do not have the equipment required for calibrating the color like it should be but I had read enough reviews to know that It would come on very bright and so I really didn't waste any time viewing it at factory default I went in and immediately reduced the brightness to 7.  I know a lot of reviewers said they went to 0, but I read some tests in one in-depth and very technical review and their tests were very good at 7.  I then changed some of the RGB color settings based on the same review, and I was not happy with what I was seeing, so I went back and re-studied the review and saw my error.  I finally settled on brightness of 7, contrast of 100 and color setting of 6500K - sRGB.  I have one of my favorite photos as my desktop and when I went to it it was like going from watching a DVD to watching Blu-Ray.  Though I was happy with the image on the old monitor this one gave me greater detail, depth and vibrance especially along the edges and corners.  I went to my blog and flickr and looked at the photos there and the difference was again very visible.  Since my wife is using the Samsung monitor that I switched out I can easily compare the images on the Internet. The improvement is very obvious with the ZR24w.In my home office I have a large window behind me at about a 150 degree angle and I've had no issue with reflection/glare.The bottom line, as they say, is simply this:  It appears that I made an excellent choice, and even though I do not have $$ to throw around I feel this was a good investment in my photography.  I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone who needs or wants the quality of an ISP monitor for video/photo editing and graphic work.

Right now our network consists of -- cable modem connected to Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WNDR3700 - the Router is uplinked to both a NETGEAR GS608NA 8 Port Switch and the Cisco SR2016T 16-Port Rackmount 10/100/1000 Gigabit Switch.  We currently have - 8 computers, 3 X-Box 360's, 1 PS3, and at least two printers connected to the network at various points (what can I say - its a big house) with absolutely no trouble.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this for months now and I use it for a dash cam. It works great and one battery will last about 4 or 5 20 minute recordings. Regular AA batteries only lasted half that long. It's easy to use and records great. There is only one issue, charging the batteries. Everytime I plug it in my car to charge the battery it starts charging, then later it stops and shows on the screen that it is hot and paused charging. It charges fine in the winter time when the car is cold, *****so now I place a towel on an icepack and lay the recorder face down on the towel so it stays cold while charging and it charges fully everytime. Just dont lay the lens on the cold part because moisture will build up under the lens.

$REVIEW.: Overall I really like these headphones for exercising.  They stay in your ear well and are comfortable overall.  Note that they don't fit inside your ear canal like traditional earbuds, but sit in your outer ear with a small inlet into your ear canal.  This means that they don't block out ambient noise quite as much as in the ear earphone buds, which may be a good thing if  you are using these outside for situational awareness (assuming the music isn't too loud).  The only downside is that air noise can be a problem if it is really windy, or most noticeably if you have a fan blowing on your face on a treadmill.

$REVIEW.: So I purchased two different monitor arms a few weeks ago
I purchased this one (Which I am using with a 22 inch lcd), and a more heavy duty Mount-it one (being used with a heavy 26 inch LCD).The one for the 26 inch worked with out a hitch..this one on the other hand had some construction problems.There is a metal ring and plastic piece that go under (or over?) the metal bar that slides into the bottom bar

There is a thing you spin to tighten it down and adjust the height.I had problems with this particular part of it


It basically fell apart as I was adjusting it.Literally
I wasn't messing with it in a way that it shouldn't be


I wasn't rough housing with it
I carefully pulled the top part up and the metal ring just kind of fell out


Then there was circular plastic piece which looked broken, which I slid off easily

After this I couldn't get the thing to raise up
It wouldn't tighten and it would just slide all the way down, which wouldn't work for me because I wanted to elevate the monitor so it is level with my others.Anyway, to make a long story short, I was able to fix it in the end


And by fix, I mean figure out where the pieces that fell off fit back together, and was able to get the thing to tighten up again


and have had no problems since

I will admit, however, I m not looking forward to ever messing with it in the future
I feel like it might fall apart.All in all, I am okay with the purchase


It is working the way I wanted
If you are in a budget, and willing to deal with a few hiccups, go for this guy


Otherwise- spend a little bit more money and get something else if your budget allows.

$REVIEW.: I needed a pair of speakers to go with my laptop (iBook G4) and I didn't want the hassle of an extra AC adapter, and these speakers fit the bill. Some of my friends have cute portable speakers that are very small, but the sound suffers accordingly (especially when they obliviously push them far beyond their capabilities). These may be larger than some portable speaker sets, but they sound great and the carrying case is super handy. My major beef with these speakers, though is the cabinet design. Certain resonant low-end frequencies cause the speakers to buzz and walk across my desk. It's annoying on two levels.Somewhat related: There's something funky with Mac's DVD Player app: Loud sounds in movies will cause the sound level to drop drastically and then gradually come back to the set level. I thought using the USB output might mitigate the problem, but this is the case whether I'm using the speaker output or the USB port. FWIW.

$REVIEW.: I'm new to photography and, thus, photography accessories


I bought this bag looking for a few things:1
A small bag to fit my D5200 with the 18-55mm kit lens attached.2
A cheap bag with a good reputation.3
Something that didn't look terrible.So I heard that Case Logic is one of the creme-de-la-creme of camera bag makers so I ended up going with this here DCB-306 SLR Camera Holster thing
Here's what I liked.1

It fits the Nikon D5200 with the kit lens perfectly

It also fits my girlfriend's D3100 with her kit lens perfectly
Not at the same time, obviously, but each one fit in there rather well


Nice and snug so I don't worry about it moving around in there.2

The three extra pockets (one under the top flap, the two side ones) are more than enough storage for me

I keep my SD card, my lens cap, etc in there


Everything fits well
Nothing breaks.3


The bag itself feels of high quality


The material is thick, the stitching looks well done


This looks and feels like a high quality camera bag (unless there's some ridiculously high quality camera bag I'm not aware of that makes this look like trash...but I doubt it).4
The price was right.And here's what I didn't like.1
The shoulder strap sucks


It's thin and the fabric is uncomfortable


I wouldn't want to carry this around, say, an amusement park or a zoo all day on a hot day


The word &#34;chafing&#34; comes to mind.I really bought this bag just to keep my camera in because I have a stigma about just leaving it on a counter top or a desk

I like &#34;putting it away&#34; so I know it's safe

This case is everything I needed it to be

I would recommend it


5-stars.

$REVIEW.: Have used thisThinkTank Artificial Intelligence 15 V. 2.0 Laptop Bagfor over a year now, and found that it has exceeded my first expectations by quite a bit.  Got it at a time when I had another laptop bag fail with a pathetic zipper at a very inconvenient time and needed a sturdy replacement and needed it fast.  This was it, and I haven't looked for another since.The bag is deceptively thin and the main compartment is well-padded, though not puffy like some, and it has a sturdy yet professional appearance.  MyMacBook Profits quite easily, even with its additional hard shell case.  The main zipper is smooth and sturdy, as it's a premium YKK RC Fuse (I looked after my last debacle with the other bag), and this coil zipper has a decent pull on it.  Its interior is properly lined, and won't scratch your computer when you're removing it.  The stitching and workmanship is exceptional, putting it simply.There's an expandable front pocket with that same YKK RC Fuse zipper, and this has convenient double sliders.  The front pocket opens wide enough for your computer accessories, and there's an organizer inside.  You probably won't spill your contents as there are restrictive fabric panels that limit how far it can open.  I regularly pack my Mac's external power supply there, along with a small USB hard drive, cables, pens, small notepads, business cards and such.  There's also a small strap with a key ring, but this one has a Velcro fastener so that you can remove the original ring and substitute your own.  It's that kind of detail and design that one appreciates after you've bought the bag and discovered it there.The top has a sturdy grab handle, and there's a back pocket as well.  This one has a Velcro closure, and I've found it big enough for magazines and such picked up while on the run.  The strap is quite sturdy and comfortable; a failing with so many laptop bags and cases, and the shoulder pad is excellent for hours of use.  The strap's quick-release attachment hooks are metal, and attach to the loops quite easily.  They are very secure, yet here's the difference: because there are additional fastening loops, two on each side, you can carry this bag in either a vertical or horizontal fashion, and on either side.  That's convenience.It's worth noting that Think Tank offers an interesting lifetime guarantee that they call their "No Rhetoric Warranty."  From personal I doubt that I'll never need to use it, but it's reassuring to know that this company is willing to stand behind their products this way.Be sure to measure your own computer before getting one of these. Its internal dimensions are: 11" wide by 15" high by 2" deep.  If yours will fit, then this is a great choice.  If not, there the largerThink Tank Artificial Intelligence 17 V 2.0 Bag.  Checked the specs and this one has inside dimensions of 11.625" wide by 16.375" high by 2" deep.  Because laptop computers are by the diagonal of the LCD screen, a 17" MacBook Pro has a width of 15.47", a depth of 10.51", and a height of just under 1", so it will fit.  But check your own computer so that you won't be disappointed.I've traveled with this bag by plane, train and subway, so it has seen quite a bit of mileage in the time that I've owned it.  It's been exposed to snow and rain a few times, and though it doesn't have the rain cover that some of my other Think Tank products have, my computer has remained dry and without moisture.  Have used a number of other sleeves and cases from other manufacturers, the good, the bad and the ugly of computer carrying gear, and this one remains at the top of my list for convenience and quality.  Highly recommended, and I will get the 17" version for my PC notebook.Kudos to the designers for the quality of this one... it's a winner.  It's Artificial Intelligence?  I call it pure genius.

$review_text.: I just got these today in the mail, I went a head and threw on the UV Filter and walked around town and took some shots


The Zeikos UV Filter works 100x better than the cheap one, I can't remember the brand name of it

But I know it's a KNOWN UV Filter, that causes gnarly ghosting.The UV Filter might be working well because I received my lens hood as well :P So maybe the stray light thats not hitting the filter is the reason for no ghosting?I haven't tried the black/purple lens yet, but I think from the performance of the UV one I think it'll be more than acceptable for $10.Great set and comes with a nice thing to put them in
They come individually wrapped in plastic and are clear as day.

$REVIEW.: This Nuvi solved a big problem for me: reading maps while traveling

I got a chance to relax and enjoy the drive, knowing the Nuvi would get me there.It had one glitch during a 1,400 miles trip

Mysteriously, while I was on a major freeway, it said it was recalculating and told me to make a[non-existent] left turn
In about 3-4 minutes it suddenly showed the car icon right back on the freeway


It did so well for me that this one glitch was not a big deal.Two things I like are being able to get off the freeway, go into a town for food and not worry about the turns to get back on the freeway, and the other is being able to find out ahead of time when a turn is coming up and which lane I should be in.

$REVIEW.: I recently upgraded my desktop motherboard, installed a new cpu, increased the ram to 32GB and added a 500GB Samsung SSD.  It now nearly instantly boots, shuts down, loads programs, processes requests and in general offers instant gratification.  I have also owned notebook computers since 1990, 6 of them and wanted one offering the same gratification as my current desktop.My wife has a dated Acer Aspire One A0722-0473 that she purchased from Costco for $279 about 4 years ago.  It was beginning to excessively slow down and I heard constant complaining from her about it.  So I doubled the ram from 2 to 4GB and installed a Samsung 256GB SSD.  It was super easy to do because Acer  designed an easy way to take the bottom off to access the HD and ram slot.  She is extremely happy with the results, and I grew to respect the low weight and design of this low-end machine--not adequate for my needs but still a nice form factor and speed for her.Instead of this machine that I am reviewing here I actually wanted the Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus, but only the one with 4GB ram and 128GB SSD were available-not sufficient for my needs. On top of that, it was not upgradeable.  I found out that Samsung had soldered the ram in place, so that I couldn't even take the financial hit and replace the ram myself.  I called Samsung customer support, and they verified that the ram couldn't be upgraded and that the warranty would be voided if I opened the back up.  Soldered ram and no access to the SSD was a deal killer for me.  So, I decided to look harder at this Acer A7 with 8GB ram and 256GB SSD running in RAID 0.I was a little reluctant to purchase a notebook that has glass on the back side of the screen, but now I've grown to appreciate it.  The Samsung ATIV 9 Plus would have scratched whereas the Gorilla Glass is very hard to scratch.  Fingerprints easily wipe off.  The only plastic part of the case is on the bottom, and even that is done tastefully. The entire area around the keyboard is a matted aluminum finish--real aluminum that extends all the way the edges of the machine beyond the plastic bottom.  The same goes for the area around the screen.  It is the matted real aluminum that is the same edge for the front and back of the screen.Some reviewers have complained about the keys not registering when typed, especially the space bar when it is hit away from the center.  Mine isn't doing that. It doesn't have the feel of my Razr gaming keyboard, but then again it's an extremely thin ultrabook.  I am an accomplished touch typist and don't even need to see the keyboard to type. I'm finding this keyboard meets my expectations very well for this type of implementation in such a shallow form factor. I've also read negative reviews about access to the function keys, and this is one of the reasons I was considering the Samsung ATIV 9 Plus because it had another row of keys.  I've had no issues finding keys or wasting keystrokes hitting wrong keys.  The keys are also as wide apart as a conventional keyboard, which leads to fewer occurrences of unintentionally hitting multiple keys at once.  I'm also not having any issues with the mouse pad as others have stated.  It works just as I expect it to work.  I even turn it off sometimes as I've done now as I type this using my now ancient Logitech MX1000 Bluetooth mouse instead of the keypad mouse.  The built-in Bluetooth on this ACER A7 easily recognized my Bluetooth mouse and always does when it comes out of standby or from a reboot at my desk.The screen is easy to see from other than straight on, and I find it easy to magnify the area I'm looking at either by using my finger to stretch the screen wider or by using the keypad.Performance:  I have many, many applications loaded on this A7, and all of them load as quickly if not faster than my high-end desktop machine with SATA6GB (Sata3). The slowest loading app is QuickBooks 2013 because it makes calls to the Web as it boots--same for the desktop.  I can shut the lid on this A7 and come back directly and nearly instantly to where I was in any program. No problems with the WiFi connection disappearing as on my Lenovo ThinkPad. I can turn on tethering from my Samsung Note2 android phone and have an instant high-speed internet connection anywhere I can get 4G from Verizon around here.  I still have an unlimited data plan.  I have experienced absolutely no issues instantly connecting to the WiFi on my phone or to my NetGear router.  I get the same download speed as my phone and other notebook connections have gotten as measured by Speedtest. It just connects and stays connected. I also use Acronis to backup to a USB 3 external HD.  I do this by plugging in an external DVD played into 1 of the 2 USB3 ports on the A7, booting to Acronis on a CD on that drive and writing an image of the drive along with its hidden partitions on the A7 to the USB3 HD on the other USB3 port on the S7--no issues, and the image is created in about 10 minutes.  I'm very happy with this performance (and insurance).I took this Acer A7 with me all day long and didn't bring the power cord.  I only opened it each time I had to write a receipt for my business, and each time it performed flawlessly.  I had it on standby from 12 hours using it intermittently when I needed to.  At the end of the day the battery registered 95% full.  My other notebooks' batteries would have left me high and dry--not to mention that they pretty much choked when it came time to run QuickBooks 2013, which needs too much horsepower these days to run on older notebooks.  Also easily got onto the internet via my Note2--instant connection with great speeds through Verizon 4G in Pleasanton, CA for the day.Using in Bed:  I don't have to prop myself up to use it.  I just straighten out the screen to 180 degrees, and the edge sits on my covers.  This way the  screen is much higher and in my line-of-sight without having to kink my neck or nearly look over my cheeks and nose to see the screen.  It weighs so little that I don't really notice the weight on a thin edge.  I use the bed duvet to disperse the weight, I suppose.The leather case that comes with it fits extremely well and is very well made.  I will use it when in clean conditions but also purchased a Thule case at an Apple Store made for a 13" MacBook Air that is black and also fits the S7 perfectly snugly.  The case won't show dirt, and will protect the S7 edges if dropped on edge.I originally paid over $3,500 for the ThinkPad this A7 replaces. I've disliked the ThinkPad for all of the 7 years.  I am extremely happy and satisfied with the purchase of this Acer S7.So far, I've grown to really appreciate this Acer A7.Update March 16, 2014:  Replaced this Acer on 12/13/2013 with a Samsung Ativ Book 9 Plus Model# NP940X3G-K05US that cost $1799 at the local brick and mortar Microsoft retail store.  Two months later Microsoft lowered the price $200.  I threatened to return it because the Samsung bundled apps weren't on their MS model, and they gave me a refund of $300.  I kept the Samsung Ativ 9 Plus with same specs as the Acer, but better 4K resolution screen and much better key board.  I don't look at the keys when I type and began to realize that I had to make corrections where the space bar didn't register about 1/3 the time.  I sold the Acer A7 to a friend in January for $1200.  The keyboard is no problem for him because he's a "hunt and pecker" typist.  I had no other issues with the Acer other than the keyboard.

$REVIEW.: This went in my Early 08 MacBook 13" (white) easily. Interestinly, these Kingston modules are a bit of an upgrade of quality as well as quantity. WHen I removed the Apple installed 1GB modules, they turned out to be essentially generic RAM, a brand I've not heard of in 17 years of Mac-ing it (and 5 PowerBooks, a G4 Cube, an original iMac, a PowerMac 8500,  a Quadra 950, and a IIci, all I still have and all still [mostly] work). So I am very happy to have 4GB of Kingston RAM in my little friend. Install was a breeze, and operation and compatibility is full after over a month and all apps and tasks run and done. I paid [...] bucks plus tax (shipped free) and can hardly believe the good deal I got. With a lifetime waranty from Kingston, why would you pay 55 or 70 for the someone else's 4 gigs? Just great! Should work great in any MB, MBP, or iMac specced to use PC2-5300 DDR2 SODIMMs (NOT for the new UniBody Aluminum MacBook, that uses PC2-8400!).UPDATE 3/10: still running strong for over a year, not the slightest problem or issue to date. Still strongly recommend, though I see the price has more than doubled (I paid $37.93)
$review_summary.: Best value for MacBook/MBP RAM (10/08 and earlier); Cheap, easy, and Kingston quality and warranty!

$REVIEW.: Love USB 3, this new drive has lots of capacity, good and simple design, and uses the new faster interface for much quicker transfers.I back up a work database every week with this drive and take it home for redundancy issues. I used a USB 2.o drive previously and the transfer seemed to take forever. Now I transfer the same database in what seems like half the time. I have not clocked it - so it is all anecdotal ... but the impression is that it is much faster. So I am a happy camper.Again, design is nice with a wraparound aluminum that makes the drive very classy and upscale compared to the other hard plastic designs that are out there. It also helps with surface scratches. Really hard to find any faults. Good price, good aesthetics, and good performance. I am happy!

I have the basic actiontec modem that works fine, the actiontec one has fewer options and bells and whistles, hence why I wanted to upgrade to this one.  I plug the actiontec one in autodetect in about 2 mins it asks me for wireless name and password done.I plug this one in it asks:pppoe or pppoa (ISP tells me oa and the auto detect that works says oE entered both settings for the TP link and fail, Fail)This one asks for what type of connection vpi and vci numbers (got them from ISP)Asks for login and password again I got these from isp though I have never needed them.After a week of messing with it and all the calls the only thing I can see in the setting differences is the actiontec autodetect says the connection type doesn't require a password or username so it doesn't ask me and don't put one in.  The TP link will not allow you to go through the setup with these lines blank.In the end I have a 100$ paper weight

$REVIEW.: Let me start off with giving a breakdown, as you may know the remote controls up to 5 devices.  In my case I am using it to control a 37 inch Vizio LCD (720p) TV, an RCA Amplifier/Home Entertainment system, and a Sony Blu Ray Player (BDP-S590).Once I got the remote and put in the included (AA Duracell batteries Made in China) I connected the remote to my laptop and connected to the Harmony website and programmed the remote.That part is extremely straight forward and easy, just make sure you have the exact model #'s of your AV equipment.Where I am running into frustration, is with the &#34;Activities&#34; buttons at the top of the remote.These buttons allow you to set custom functions, such as the &#34;Watch TV&#34; powers on just the TV.The &#34;Watch a Movie&#34; power on TV, changes the connection to HDMI, powers on the Blu Ray Player and powers on the RCA Amplifier.So where is the problem?  Lets say, you &#34;Watch a Movie&#34; and all turns on correctly, you watch a DVD or Netflix, but then stop watching the movie and leave the room for a while.  When you return, the Blu Ray player has powered off as part of the power save, not a problem with the remote, however, the remote is now confused and cant turn on the Blu Ray.So you have to go into the Help button on the remote, or the devices feature to power on the Blu Ray.Where the annoyances reside is say you &#34;Watch TV&#34; and only the TV powers on, if you manually change the channel or volume on the TV itself, the remote is confused and wont power off/on the TV.The second annoyance is when you &#34;Watch TV&#34; and want to &#34;Watch a Movie&#34;, the TV powers on, the RCA powers on, the Blu Ray powers on, all is expected.When you &#34;Watch a Movie&#34; and now want to &#34;Watch TV&#34;, the device won't change to the correct settings.Remote is Made in China, and there is a slight rattle in the remote, this appears to be due to a switch that power saves the remote, when you move the remote, this internal switch powers up the remote.So these are my minor gripes, not a huge deal, but in my case trying my patience.
$SUMMARY.: I am mixed as to the usefulness of this remote, in my particular case

$review_text.: This is a great gadget for the price.  I've had no problems using it with my home wi-fi.  This is ny first tablet so I have no comparisons.  It seems to have quick response.  I have been fasicnated with tablets since they first came out, but,with a 3 computer home network, including 2 laptops, and also a smart phone, I jsut couldn't justify spending $600 plus on a tablet that I didn't really need, plus a monthly cell service for it.  So, I settled on this $199 wi-fi only tablet.  I was already setup with Samsung and Google through my Galaxy SII phone, so this tablet was easy to learn and setup.  I find the display quality very good.I plan to use the 32gb micro sd I bought with the tab to store my music and pictures on.  The reason I chose this over the Kindle Fire was because of the ability to expand the memory with the micro sd, the Android OS, and the built-in GPS.  I have not used the GPS yet, so I will add to this review if I have something significant to add.  Even with the kind of bulky case I got for it, I can put it in my big purse.I teach a computer class at our local Senior Center and I like to stay up on the latest gadgets available so I can help others with theirs.  This would be a great beginner computer for somebody.With no trouble at all, using the Smart Remote app that came on the tab, I had it setup to control my TV, satellite receiver, stereo receiver, Roku, and 2 Blu-Ray players.  Very cool.  I love how I could re-install apps I had already installed on my phone on play,google.com to my new tablet.  If the app says 'installed' click on it, then it will tell you if it is compatible with your new device, and you can install it to just the new device.I have not tried the camera yet, but I didn't buy this for the camera.  It probably doesn't take as good a picture as my phone or digital camera, so I'm not worried about it.  It would be good enoug to video chat on.The only thing I don't like about this tablet is the propritary plug in for charging.  I will just have to carry this plug with the tablet I guess.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to connect to the internet when not near a wi-fi, and wants a nice functional tablet at a very good price.

$REVIEW.: The Television:The settings are easy to use

 The picture is crystal clear
 HD channels are perfect

 Blu-Ray is expectacular


 Blacks are black and whites are blindingly white

 Vivid selection is on most of the time and easy to adjust to anyone's taste


 No bleeding colors or bands or any dead pixels.The Presidential Inaguration looked fabulous in HD.Local channels are annoying, there seems to be face movement within the faces and maybe the firmware will resolve that since it is the same on the 60hz tv as on the 120hz
 I'll update as soon as Sony sends them.The looks of the tv are very pleasing, we ordered the silver because the black one was not available at time of ordering


 The Silver frame surprised us by how great it looks and it does not shine like the black bezel on the other tv
 Also, by sheer coincidence, it just happens to match the brushed metal pulls of the furniture surrounding it, so it makes the room look very pulled together.Remote:Clunky and large


 However, I read in another review that this is a universal control

 I have not tried it all yet, but if that is the case, I'll gladly put up with clunky to get rid of 3 other remotes.The Stand:Stand on tv tilts forward and does not hold the tv upright
 Design flaw on Sony's part


 See Amazon forums regarding this if you experience the same problem.Customer Service:Amazon customer service rocks by taking over Sony's dissapointing and aggravating customer service


 For future reference, her name is Mary Ann and she contacted Sony for me as well and she resolved everything expectacularly well and I now don't have to worry about the tv falling over the kid's heads

 Thank you MaryAnn.Delivery:We got the same great delivery we got the last time, including the setup of the tv


 However, both times CEVA only sends one man to deliver and this time, the box opened while he was taking it out of the truck and the t.v
dropped to the ground

$review_text.: I'm using mine to type this review.I went to high school in the 1990s.  While I was there, I took typing because I like computers.  So, I learned to type with all 10 fingers, not just my thumbs.  I've also had computers for years, so I can type pretty fast.  However, I decided to plunge into the world of tablets a while back, so I got my SG Note 10.1.  I love the tablet, but I hate the on-screen keyboard.  I don't have a smartphone, so typing on that thing is a completely alien experience for me.  I've even tried laying the tablet down and typing normally on it, but that was weird too because the screen doesn't feel like real keys and the screen is flat instead of being raised.So, I bought one of these.  Not only is it a good price, but it got the highest rating of the 3 available Note keyboards.  So far, I'm very pleased with the purchase.  The case is nice and sturdy  reinforced leather and it seems like it will protect the tablet well.  Plus, it has cut outs for the speakers, power conector, cameras and S-Pen.  Those are very convenient, though you can't have the tablet upright while charging.  The keyboard is nice, but has a few flaws.  I like the feel of the keys and they're easy to hit with my long fingers.  Though, they would probably be harder for a  person with thick fingers.  I also like the buttons for tablet functions; back, power, options, Internet, E-mail, search, media playback control buttons, volume control, programs, task manager and home.  I've already used those a lot.  Typing is mostly good.  There's only a shift key on the left, which was easier to get used to than the moved apostrophe key (I keep hitting Enter by mistake.)  But, I can get used to that stuff.  What keeps this product from being a 5/5 for me is the button sensitivity.  Sometimes, you hit a key and nothing happens.  More often, you get 2 of the letter you're trying to type.  But, for the price, I really can't complain.  Even with the flaws, this is still preferable to the on-screen keyboard for old school typists like me.

Works great, no problems 2 months later.  The unit itself is cheaply made and very light, but for the price I expected the worse. So overall I am pleased with this item and my only complaint would be it should be heavier so it stays in place. Thanks, and I hope this helps.

$REVIEW.: I owned the original EF 35 2.0 since the early 90s and longed for an update with modern AF and optical design. Finally, the redesigned EF 35 2.0 IS USM emerged from the mists of Japan and didn't disappoint: durable build, fast and sure-footed AF, excellent edge to edge sharpness, silky smooth manual focus and image stabilization. The updated cosmetics and fingerprint resistant matte finish are attractive and professional in appearance. Although larger than the previous model, it's petite compared to most zooms.Wide open the 35 2.0 IS delivers tack sharp images with pleasingly smooth bokeh (background blur). There is virtually no flare or ghosting in images of sunsets or streetlights. And distortion is well corrected, making it a great optic for architecture or artwork. No "purple fringing" in high contrast situations, e.g., tree branches against a bright sky. The only negative I could find is it exhibits a tiny amount of light falloff wide open. Stop down a bit and light falloff disappears.The ring-type USM yields blazing fast and silent AF on my 6D. AF could accurately lock in any light I could see in. Plus, macro and video buffs will dig its manual focus: silky and precise, no slop or play and long throw for smooth transitions. Plus, no need to flip a switch to engage manual focus: simply grab the well ribbed MF ring and turn. The front element doesn't rotate during AF operation, making polarizing filter use a breeze.The inclusion of image stabilization (IS) kicked it over the top for me. IS grants me 3 stops of slower hand holdable shutter speeds than I can normally muster. However, Canon's claim of 4 stops was a no-go for me. Nevertheless F2.0 with IS engaged and I can get sharp images in dim bars, restaurants, casinos or stages.My only wee complaint is Canon didn't include a lens hood. For six bills Canon should toss one in. And, if you want the dedicatedCanon Lens Hood EW-72hood, it will cost you a pretty penny. UPDATE 1/22/2014: There were no knockoff EW-72 available when I bought this lens Fall 2013. However, they are available now and may be worth a try:RainbowImaging  HEW72 Lens Hood Replaces CANON Lens Hood EW-72, for Canon EF 35mm F/2 IS USM Lens.FINAL BLURB: I find the semi-wide perspective--63 degrees--of the 35mm lens easy to use on my full-frame 6D and ideal for showing a subject in its environment. If you shoot APS-C, e.g., EOS Rebel, 7D, 60D, 70D, etc., this lens has coverage similar to a normal lens and is not semi-wide. This lens is nimble, petite and a joy to operate. The fast aperture also makes for bright viewfinders, an essential feature if you shoot in dark interiors or twilight. Finally, the EF 35 2.0 IS USM is an extremely sharp and distortion free lens. Canon got just about everything right with this redesign.

$review_text.: Purchased this in March 2010 and promptly registered both online and with AAA for the extended warranty.Bad:A significant lag between where you actual are and where you are shown to be on the display.Customer/tech support was difficult to reach, but it didn't matter because they were useless


 This device is not so well designed, reasonably well functioning that competent, customer friendly tech support will not ever be needed.Maps were significantly outdated

 An update came out some three or so months later, after expiration of a very short "free update" period.Mildly annoying banner advertisements, justified somewhat as "compensation" for the "free" lifetime traffic- except that the annoying ads continue, even when the traffic feature is turned off.Every now and then, at completely unpredictable and seemingly random times, the device interrupts the route to reset itself.Couldn't log into Magellan website recently and had to re-register

 This is due to a defect on their part, not mine, as they apparently changed ownership and either neglected to or made a conscious decision not to maintain registration/warranty records.Customer support still is extraordinarily bad

 Among other things, to "submit a ticket" has required a minimum of six attempts to get through their verification process
 This, according to Magellan, "is required to prevent automated submission of tickets."  The effect of the design is to discourage customer service by making submission unnecessarily cumbersome.Good:For the price, very well featured.They eventually fixed the lag
 After the secret update (a secret because they didn't tell me about it, even though I was registered with them and they probably have my email address on file still from previous inquiries), the device now accurately displays the actual location.Lots of points or interest, significantly more with other GPSes I've owned or used.The AAA TourBook is just awesome

 Handy and efficient.The quick spell feature is functional and useful.The one-touch favorites is a very well thought out and useful feature.All the standard GPS features are as good if not better than competitors' products
 Some require some getting used to
 For example,  I had a problem initially with a search for gas stations


 It tells you how far away they are, but not in the directly relative to either your present position or direction of travel, as is standard on Garmins

 Eventually I discovered you can see at a glance where the stations are located on a map

 However, this requires more button pushing and less attention to the road, so on the whole it may not be as useful as the Garmin.Conclusion:Customer/tech support is still neither customer friendly nor particularly helpful
 The annoying ads still appear, even though the traffic feature is shut off
 The device still resets randomly


 Fix the first problem, and I'd give a strong recommendation to by a Magellan GPS


 Otherwise, all I can say is my next GPS will be either a Garmin or TomTom.

$review_text.: This is a truly wonderful device. I love it. I can't compare to other units since this is the only one I have owned, but I'm very happy with it. I've used it to get to places literally in the middle of nowhere, with what seemed like 30 turns, some onto tiny little side streets. We took it on a driving vacation to Maine and it was such a pleasure - we drove all over and always knew exactly where we were and how to get to where we wanted to go, even without entering a destination. While I have the 330, I recommend getting the 340. Having the voice say 'turn left on 8th st' has got to be better than 'turn left' when you are in an area with short blocks - sometimes I am not sure what left it is referring to and have to check the display, which does show the name. Aside from that I have no complaints. If you are thinking about getting one of these, stop thinking and order already!! Even if you don't get this brand/model, I'm sure there are many good ones out there.Negatives:- wish I had sprung for the 340.- Has once or twice taken me to stores that don't exist (selected from the internal directories). But anybody who complains about these things not being perfect should have their head examined, or stick to those wonderful paper maps, or revert to asking the nearest wino for directions.

$REVIEW.: After having great success using Mediabridge HDMI cable in my home theatre setup, I didn't hesitate to use these USB cables in my car stereo installation. I have two of them routed down the middle console, and into the storage area of my center storage console, for use with an iPod, a Flash Memory Stick, or just as a charging port.The thing I like about these is the reduced cable gauge, which is extremely flexible, and forms quite nicely into tight spots. In my opinion, you truly cannot go wrong with these cables from Mediabridge.

$review_text.: Just how do they fit so much in such a tiny space
 I remember when I was a kid, a 600mb hardrive the size of lunchbox was an amazing thing, and now its 2GB in the size of your pinky fingernail (or at least mine)

 Enough of the nostalgia, and on to the review.Pros:Small - one could theoretically carry multiple ones around in a tiny case and have all ones digital media with them, or have just a ton of memory for their camera, phone, or gps unit.Solidstate - I've dropped mine because of its size, from rather high, and its fine.2gb - Thats a lot of space (think, thats nearly three cd's worth, or half a dvd).SanDisk - Hey, its from the guys that came up with it, with the big name in the industry, if theirs doesnt work, neither is anyone else's (for all you cell phone people out there).Good transfer speeds - Now, unfortunatly I dont know the actuall spec's, but I know I have had my PowerShot G7 on continuous shoot (around two exposures/sec) and run through 512mb of space and didnt have one issue with write speeds


 Similar goes for read speeds, uploading to the PC goes pretty quick (again, I dont have the actuall speed handy)Cons:Small - Yeah, its a con too
 Its so small and light, its an easy thing to drop, but thankfully its rugged (see - solid state in the pros)
 That doesn't keep it from getting itself lost though...Insertion/Removal - Its so small, it really helps to have nails to insert this into whatever device you're using, since you have to push it into a tiny slot (most of the time), and gettng it out is even more challenging without nails.Overall - Five stars (as long as you have a fingernail ;)

$review_text.: If you spend most of your day in front of a monitor, and if you want something that will make it easy to manipulate large images or multiple applications, you can't do better than this, IMHO. I run two monitors simultaneously, and run this one side by side with the old type, and there's no question that a second monitor--just like this one--is in my future. I have been happy with every Sony product I've purchased, and this monitor is no exception. The brightness and picture clarity is unsurpassed. We looked at a alot of monitors side by side, and this one won, hands down. I have not regretted the additional $$. Make sure you send in the rebate before the deadline runs out.

$review_text.: If your run NVidia or other cards, you need Corsair or better!Espcially if you are running NVidia cards.  This card is certified for SLI and CrossFire (ATI) cards, and truly has 12V 50+ amps on the rail for a great price.  It is also a snap to put in, although I only have a mini-tower and it is a bit to big - but no problem. This product is also 80 certified and will give you consistent power.  If you are running 2 cards, I suggest moving up to a 750 or higher model.  It also works with most motherboards and has 20+4 pin connectors.  It has A LOT of cable connections, which worry me, so make sure you use the ties to organize your cables after you connect the appropriate connections. Keep in mind that the more the merrier when it comes to Watts, espcially if you are a gamer or do some real intense video and graphic work.  Great buy!

$REVIEW.: I use these as a pair of mono center speakers so the frequency response is not as critical. They work find with my T20 II front, T40 rear and Yamaha subwoofer. I am using the Creative 5.1 Channel Surround off of USB using adpaters. I managed to make the Creative X-Fi Wireless trasmitter work by powering them from a USB Powered Hub that is not connected to my computer. Both will not work together. Keep your cables away from other speakers and EMF sources if you manage to figure out how to configure adapters from Radio Shack to get the whole thing to work. I managed but don't have time to explain.Unfortunatley the speakers are not covered and I managed to damage one of the center domes incidentally without noticing until later. So they get 4 stars because I only use them for center/voice channel.

$REVIEW.: I have looked all over for a stylus and since I have purchased other Amazom basics/branded products decided to try.  I did nto realize this was metal, and was pleasantly surprised when I found it was.  I guess I just did not read that.  It is perfect size for me and well made and sturdy.  I did not think I would want to use one, but the fingerprints started to really bug me.  I had checked at all the local computer and electronic stores plus Wally World, and simply could not find a suitable and reasonable priced stylus. This can be used on virtually all phones and tablets and I cannot think for one reason it would not work on any device with a screen protector as I have on my ipad. One thing to watch out for however is that Amazon seems to change the price on this several times per week, if not daily.  I have seen anywhere from about $7.00 to over $10.00.  But even at about $10.00 it is a well made item.

$review_text.: The PowerShot is great for normal shooting but for real distance you definitely need a tripod. For stills the photos are very sharp and clean but if you try and take advantage of the 30X zoom or anywhere close to 30x the camera becomes vey sensitive to movement. This is not a camera for taking shoots of things that are even slightly moving. That being said we shoot pictures of wildlife that live in the wetlands behind our house and with the use of the 30x zoom and a tripod we've gotten some amazing shoots. Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 shots to get a good one but it's worth it. The regular still shots using some telephoto to crop come out amazing. The PowerShot uses a special rechargeable batteries so I also bought a couple of spare batteries (they are not very expensive) and keep them charged in the camera bag. One last thing. Be sure you buy a standard size SD memory card. The camera does not come with one and will not work without it as there is no on board memory.

$REVIEW.: This tower aided in creating a monster!  I recently did a build and this complemented every component I could throw at it


 I love the top loading hard drive port, effectively turning any HDD or SSD into a semi-external drive that you can mount and unmount at your own discretion


 I also like the USB 3.0 headers for their incredible speed and ease to use


 The case has plenty of room to work inside of it, even if you have some huge video cards you want to crossfire, they'll fit


 It has an amazing amount of slots for drives and devices and can support up to 11 fans! The included fans are incredibly quiet, but I couldn't get them to light up for some reason (I'll have to look into that)


 It comes with three, with one on the front and two near the back that keep a good airflow for cooling
 The area for wire-management is very ample, enough to fit all those cables in and make the inside look nice and pristine.If you're building a computer, definitely look into this case.

Edit time


Since I have owned this, it malfunctioned on and off (after about 4 months of lite use)


It was great while it worked


This thing is GREAT!!! I have owned a few different brands of this kind of device..
The biggest thing is the switch to turn power off and on to the hard drive you want to work with

A lot of other brands have timing issues because they just have a directly connected power cord which makes hard to mount some drives

This adapter also has cables that let you connect to a laptop SATA drive without having to take it out of it's carrier! Most don't! I love this thing!!!

$REVIEW.: I bought this as a Christmas present for my teenaged daughter.  She is a big fan of a number of musical genres, and thus much happier listening to her iPod than to any radio station.  Still, she is more on the "appreciation" side of audiophilia than the technical.  She was asking for an iPod-FM transmitter, and, after combing through multiple reviews, I settled on this one.My observations after one month:1) Ease of use - I was not needed for the setup, and my only role in the installation was pushing the DC charger into the outlet. (It went in fine, but she was worried about breaking it if she pushed too hard).2) Function - We live in the Greater Seattle metro area, so the electromagnetic spectrum is kind of crowded.  Despite this, the device "works great" according to my daughter.  She has had no problems with finding a usable frequency or poor sound quality.3) Form - It actually sits in the between-seat compartment, where her car has a DC outlet.  It does not clutter the interior with wires.4) Issues - Like many who have commented here, I think it is a shame that the device can't also charge the iPod.  Still, if that is my only complaint for a piece of electronics equipment that has been otherwise plug-and-play, I feel like it was a good purchase.  I am getting one for my car now.4 stars.

 Good quality, especially with non-sticky jam-free zippers being a VERY particular point with me

 Pouches make secure but still easy removal and  storing,  and as long as you aren't shoving your hound into a pouch to get a card out, they don't tear any much more than the standard credit card sleeve.She was tickled and immediately put it to use, and I don't have to examine at a chair before sitting down at her house

$review_text.: I've been able to handle an Alpha 350 one and off for about a month now, and I'm quite pleased with what I've seen so far.First, the camera's appearance is very much like that of the Alpha 200, and identical to the Alpha 300


 All share the same, comfortable grip that uses a full-size lithium-ion "info" battery, and should feel good in most peoples hands

 The tilting LCD screen is added from the A200, and makes it a bit thicker at the back
 This thickness doesn't seem to be much of a drawback for handling, but it might make it a bit more ackward for those who wear eyeglasses.Most of the camera controls are located in easy to use places, although the rear toggle might be too easy to hit (by mistake) for some, the idea is for it to be quickly accessable.Performance wise, the camera seems to be greatly improved from the older Alpha 100


 Image Quality (IQ), both sharpness and color wise, appear to be very good

 Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do critical, side-by-side, low-light/high ISO testing, something which is of a possible concern with such a high megapixel CCD sensor

 Visually, those images I shot in poor lighting appeared reasonably good, but more serious testing needs to be done.Autofocusing speed is very decent, especially when the eye-start feature begins the AF process for you


 The 9-point AF seems fast and accurate


 My only disappointment is that an upgrade camera such as this does not have the "instant" manual focusing ability of the Alpha 100

 [This feature allowed you to use the camera in AF
 Once the camera focused, it released the gearing, making manual focusing instantly possible to make corrections, without fiddling for an AF/M switch].Of course, the built-in anti-shake ability is great
 Although we can argue the merits of in-camera vs
in-lens, there is no doubt that this feature is much less expensive, and works with lenses that neither Nikon nor Canon offer with IS/VR (e.g


50mm f1.4), and a whole bunch of older lenses as well.Like the anti-shake system, everyone will have their opinion on what's the best way to implement Live View
 I prefer the way Sony has chosen to use Live View, where AF speed is unaffected


 The drawback is that only 90 percent of the actual image is previewed with Sony's system


 Adding the articulated, nice quality LCD seems to me to make this system a bit more useful, and the 1.4x and 2x digital cropping may come in handy (but keep in mind, you're just cropping out megapixels).Another feature I would have liked for this price is a wireless shutter release (it does offer a wired release).It will be interesting to see how this stacks up to the competition
 The biggest threat will come from the Canon Digital Rebel XSi


 The XSi will be smaller (using a new, smaller battery), and have a 12 megapixel CMOS sensor, which may prove to be better from someone doing low light with high ISO speeds (such as museum or stage photography)
 Also, for $200 less, the Alpha 300 will need serious consideration
 The only feature difference is it has 10 megapixels vs

14, and this may actually improve IQ in poorer light.Overall, a very fine addition to the Sony lineup!Canon Digital Rebel XSI 12MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Silver)Sony Alpha DSLRA300X 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Super SteadyShot Image Stabilization with DT 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 & DT 55-200mm f/4-5.6 Zoom Lenses

I use it all of the time for my iPhone 4S while on walks. I can listen to music, answer the phone and listen to my app tell me my walking stats, all without looking at the phone. Just needs to be a bit thicker so it won't tangle so easily.

$review_text.: I saw the bad reviews for it but the good outnumber the bad


After I broke my other headset I had a limited budget because of the limited cash i had on amazon.I found these cheap headphones and decided to buy them

These came exactly on the day they were supost to come on


It was boxed nicely

No damage
I hooked these up to my computer and the headphones were detected right away

These are quite flimsy though and are made of a cheap plastic but it works


The sound quality isn't as nice as my other ones but they do the job
The mic's sound quality is really good and is better then my older ones that cost more then these
Overall i would definitively recommend this product to a friend.

$review_text.: Exactly what you would hope for in an HDMI cable - sturdy, well constructed and delivers a quality picture from the device (the Cable box in this case) to the LDC TV.  This was a bit more expensive that some of the others I found, but I thought that it would be worth the price, and thus far that seems to be the case!  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I had never owned a digital music player before I, on a whim, really, ordered the Rio Carbon "Limited Edition" (first 500 units made).  I travel a lot and wanted to be able take my music collection with me in the car and on the plane.When I received it, back in September, I was amazed at how small it really was. I started loading it up with my CD collection, and found that I had plenty of room left over.  Syncing it with Windows Media Player 10 was a joy, as was the ease of use and the great sound quality.I had never really thought about the Audible support, but I tried the free month and was hooked, downloading books and the daily New York Times.  I listened to Bill Clinton reading his "My Life" during a long car trip, and was enthralled.  The Carbon does Audible navigation very well, allowing fast forward and rewinding, skipping forward and backward through chapters, and has the ability to save up to 10 "bookmarks". It has the iPod beat here in many ways.The battery life is truly astounding.  The meter will appear to show that it is low, but it will keep playing for hours more.I do have some minor gripes - the user interface can be confusing in some places, where you have to know which of "click the scroll wheel", "press the menu button" or "press the OK button" you need for a particular function.  But I picked it up soon enough.  I would also like the ability to create playlists on the fly, rather than having to upload them, but that is minor. Lastly, the case provided protects the player well, but you can't get at any controls when in the case!I do like that the controls are all findable "by feel", even if the player is tucked in my pocket.I've now owned the Carbon for almost five months, and it is giving me a lot of pleasure.  If you're in the market for a small and sexy hard disk player, this is the one to get.

$review_text.: I purchased 2 of these; one for my 2001 Toyota 4Runner and the other for my wife's 2000 Toyota Avalon xls. Each required a bit different install as the Avalon has a "factory" JBL system and a sub in it (I replaced the dead sub with an after-market one). I wanted to use the Pioneer on-board-amp and by-pass the factory amp but retain while the fade ability along with the sub. This requires a specific Metra connector. The 4Runner does not have the JBL system nor does it have a sub, BUT there is an outboard amp that I removed and again, a specific Metra connector was used. Also of note, both Toyota's have 2 antennas so there is a need to combine the 2 ant leads into one (after getting an adapter as the one ant lead in miniature on both vehicles). I also used a parking break by-pass so that the passenger can watch video (any driver that watches this while driving is in the same group as texters while driving....not very smart boarding on the plain stupid). We also had to get the connectors for iphone as we just broke down and got smart phones (iPhone 4s). One of the main reasons I got this unit was to use the iPhone apps on it. The pairing with the BT was a no-brainier; Pandora works without a hitch and the mic works excellent for BT calls. Reception is very good and the amp sounds better then the junk factory stuff. I may not have to replace speakers until they blow. I am using Motion-X GPS on the phone and when I plugged it in using the iphone connector and touched the ipod icon, DONE !... we were seeing my GPS from the phone on the 7" screen!! .....then on the phone I touched the music icon and we had my saved songs playing over my wife's JBL system, which faded to the background when given instructions by the lady in the GPS. We like our vehicles and saw no need to get "newer" ones so I opted to upgrade our receivers to handle our phones. No regrets at all! I was watching a YouTube video in the driveway (low level Mirage F1 flown by the suicidal French pilots in Chad) and I could get either video or sounds but not both. I am certain it is me not pushing the correct buttons/icons, so will try again today. We are both pleased with these units and I do recommend them. Install was reasonable if you are use to doing installs and only a little challenging if you are handy but have never tried an install. I mentioned to another guy hare that the face is NOT removable so thought I would say that here also.

But it does not fit under airline seats if full. As a laptop carrier, it is very comfortable and very protective of the laptop. I recommend it highly.  Why not 5 stars? Well, I personally would like to see more reflective material (hey, I use this on my motorcycle!), and it is not water/rain resistant.  See those circular grommets? Yes, they are useful for attaching things, but they are holes that allow water in...

$review_text.: I purchased two NP-570 LI batteries for my older Sony camcorder.  I previously used NP-370 batteries, but they were failing over the last 2 years.  After they (several) failed at yet another critical moment, I bought the NP570s for myself as a Christmas present.  I charged them up and took them out for a trial run.  My old Sony TRV900 camera worked great and will now record for about three hours.  During a recent snow, I recorded snow scenes and the new battery stayed strong for the entire session.  Buy one or two of these if you have been having trouble with your Sony video or camera equipment running out of power just when you need it.  It will put new life in your old equipment.  Mine arrived in the mail in a couple of days and were in the original packaging.  It always works out great when I order through Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I ordered the Speck SeeThru Satin Soft Touch Black case for my 2010 MacBook Pro 15" and I am loving it.I should tell you up-front that the product had not been update for the 2010 model - the updated power supply magsafe plug does not rest evenly against its contacts, but still charges fine.Some other reviews have reported that this and other cases leave a little bit of a gap when the lid is closed so if you hold the laptop upside down with the case installed, the lid will open by itself. However, this has not caused me any trouble whatsoever.The soft touch case needs a microfiber cloth to be cleaned properly - it does attract finger prints, etc. quite a bit.Overall, I really like this product.

$review_text.: I'm sure this is a great router. However it says compatible with Century link connections and although that may be true for their older systems this DOES NOT WORK with newer tech. . IT WILL NOT WORK ON A VDSL system!!!  Check before you order, the newer VDSL router is completely different and incompatible with ADSL systems.  Available locally new for around $100.  I advise leasing thru your provider for several months until this tech is more affordable. It does say compatible with Century Link on the box, I guess you need to know which tech you have coming into the house. Another suggestion is to replace the telephone dsl line with a high performance one such as Belkin High-Speed Internet Modem Cable, RJ11M/M.  Also in shorter lengths.  DEF worth the upgrade to your modem connection.

I needed a charging device that will allow my phone to continue operating with all of the services I need open while at the same time not allowing it to drain its battery slowly.  With this power bank, I can run the apps I need, all simultaneously, with GPS, Bluetooth and HotSpot enabled and instead of slowly draining, my phone gets charged!  It's a good feeling to do all the things I need/want to do and exit my vehicle with a fully charged phone, instead of one complaining that the battery is low.

$review_text.: I'm a serious-minded photographer who does a lot of on-location work with models for portfolio development.  I'm also a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to lighting and always find that I can effectively enhance even the best natural lighting with some supplementary off-camera lights.  Unfortunately, dragging a 22" beauty dish, a couple of studio heads, and heavy battery packs isn't always practical when working alone without an assistant.  Being able to shoot with speed lights can be equally as effective if you've got the right conditions and light modifiers.  The ePhoto beauty dish has become a valued addition to my "go light" on-location set of equipment.  It provides the quality of light that photographers have come to expect from a beauty dish, in a small light-weight design that has been optimized for use with speed lights.  The light is not quite as soft as with a larger, white dish, but that's simply a matter of physics.  For it's intended purpose, it does an excellent job.  As an added bonus, Nikon speed light users will also have the ability to use the dish in CLS mode since the infrared sensor can easily "see" the pulses coming from the "commander" unit.  I recently did a shoot using CLS with an SB800 mounted on top of my Nikon D3s about 30 feet away from the subject using a 70-200mm zoom.  The Nikon speed light was mounted with the ePhoto BD as my main light, and it worked flawlessly, giving me the added creative flexibility of shooting with very high speed sync speeds.

$REVIEW.: As far as (essentially) stand-alone audio systems go, Marantz has created a great piece of equipment here to serve as a modern update to the stereo systems of days gone by. With just a pair of even basic, low-end speakers, the audiophile can stream his or her music collection from a variety of sources quickly and very easily, with a clean, attractive, sharp-looking interface. And, in light of the small footprint of this receiver, you can essentially hide your sound system's components just about anywhere, including a small, wall-mounted bookshelf or three...Setting up this Marantz audio receiver took me all of about 7 minutes for basic setup. Since I, personally, don't happen to be terribly knowledgeable when it comes to system networking in my home (really, it's just me, so creating a network for my various devices is, literally, something I've only just recently done within the past month or so). For those of you that are better informed, it'll probably take you little more time than that to get this receiver fully set up on your system, and connected to your own devices.As the final step for full functionality and connection to my receiver, I downloaded and installed the app to my Galaxy Note 2, and was controlling my various devices pretty quickly and easily with it. Using the app is quite simple, but the app IS missing a few of the controls that the included remote has, so that was a little odd to me. I found myself picking up the remote more frequently and foregoing the use of the app on my phone for more thorough control of my receiver. Either one, however, works very well, and I DID find that the app has a better direct connection for some uses than does the IR-controlled receiver (obviously). I found that I could turn on my Marantz from anywhere using the app, and that the Marantz receiver simply picks up where it left off in audio playback. There, unfortunately, is no field in the app itself that will display what is currently playing on the device; there is simply basic information informing you of the source of the audio output. If Marantz updates this, I can only see it as an improvement to just how helpful their app will truly prove to be.The only other peeve I truly can admit to having here is directly related to the total lack of NFC, or Near Field Communication, as a connection option for my mobile device. I guess I've gotten spoiled over recent years in feeling that NFC receivers should be part and parcel with any and everything audio, but the lack of it here annoys me just the smallest bit. Add to that the fact that I have to actually have my mobile device physically tethered to this Marantz receiver via its data cable in order to play anything directly to it using my Smartphone, and you can probably understand my minor frustration.When connecting my device via the data cable, I had to pretty much figure out what option to select to successfully play my music back on my Marantz receiver. Now that I HAVE figured it out, I doubt I'll forget again, and now I'll probably know how to do this in the future with other devices, but there was no information given anywhere on what to connect to (aside from on my Note 2, which simply declared that there were available devices nearby, and nothing on the Marantz screen, aside from an automatic selection of the USB port I selected, followed by an indication of an unsuccessful connection, until I selected the ambiguous computer-monitor-with-lines-over-it icon that was visible on the upper left hand side of my music player's screen). Once I got my device connected, though, it was the same case as with the low-end Sony speakers I picked up to try my Marantz receiver out with -Sony SS-B1000 5-1/4-Inch Bookshelf Speakers (Pair)- the audio quality here is GREAT!I had initially been considering thePolk Audio T15 Bookshelf Speakers, Pair, Black(which I found at my local best buy for a hundred bucks), but I decided to try out the Sony speakers instead, and, for such budget-friendly speakers, the sound coming from them via my Marantz receiver truly does leave NOTHING to be desired! Considering the high quality sound coming out of these low-end speakers, I can only imagine what great sound you could get from something even higher end here! The tones are rich, the sound carries beautifully, and even at low volumes, I can enjoy my music anywhere in my home without any loss of audio quality!I can imagine that this receiver, and just about any speakers you pair with it, would make a wonderful addition to your family room, living room, man cave, or general party central in your home. The paperwork included here does make a vague reference to connecting this to a video output, so it offers options as a basic alternate sound source for your computer or TV, but i can imagine the creative consumer can find many other ways to put this receiver to use.Overall, this unit, even with its minor tweak or two that I, personally, would appreciate, creates GREAT quality sound with super-simple setup, and offers many options for use! It's solidly built, looks great on the shelf without taking up too much space, and only improves any components you connect to it! It's a great central component to have around to make your audio system truly sing!
$SUMMARY.: Great piece of audio equipment, with just one minor improvement to be made!

Problem most likely is not with battery cells but with Nikon not playing nice with non-OEM batteries (i.e. embedded recognition chip in the genuine Nikon stuff not found in off-brands ...) Until the fix is found, I don't recommend getting these for P7000, for now.  P7000 was updated with latest firmware update version 1.2 prior to inserting the batteries.Seller was nice enough to refund the shipping charge too.

$review_text.: I purchased two of these for a 'trial run' and now plan on purchasing three more.  I've had the two for about 2 weeks and so far they seem to be working well.  Windshield mount holding strong.  Camera activates itself and immediately starts recording when power is applied with the 12v outlet.  The casing is plastic and seems like poor quality...but again is holding strong.The images that it captures are OK.  Nothing fantastic.  And at times the video playback pauses and jumps (it's not a smooth video playback all the time).  No night vision (didn't expect it).  But the night images actually aren't bad provided there is adequate outdoor lighting.  It also captures decent audio as well.It clearly wasn't made for US market.  The written instructions are in very poor broken English.  So certainly don't rely on them. And when you first turn it on, the language is in Chinese I believe.  So it took me some time just to figure out how to change it to English since there was nothing on the screen I could understand.  Navigation of the LCD screen is a bit cumbersome and takes some learning just by pressing buttons to see what they do.  But anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics can figure it out.All-in-all...not a bad product.  I just wouldn't t give it five stars (maybe 3.8??).  And I do plan on coming back later to post follow-up reviews once I've used these for several months.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty good so far

$review_text.: The NZXT Elite 210 is a great case, doubly so for the price. The one downside is the cable management system is a bit too slim for most PSU cables, and comes crowded out of the box. I did manage to make it work, but it took a lot more effort than most cases would.The top features in this are:Quick access HD bays - only a half twist on a large nut to unlock or lock an HD in place. Super fast and easy.Great pricepoint for value. Really clean looking caseSmart Setup and inclusion of USB 3.0 at this price.The stock fans (2) are fantastic. They keep my system running very cold, and this case allows up to 7 fans. I added one additional LED Fan to the side panel and it shows up great, and adds even more cooling. An additional feature that is very useful is that the PSU unit is intended to be installed with the fan facing downward, which is great. Should be a standard in the industry.The thumb screws are easy to use, making opening up the case simple and very fast. All the hardware included was sorted well. The instructions are pretty vague, but do a decent job of indicating what screws to use.I installed a Micro AMD Mobo and it fit perfectly, the only stretch was getting the fan cable around the GPU I added in. I wouldn't hesitate a moment to pick up another one of these for my next build.

$review_text.: Well, first of all the product is awesome BUT it had some problems. Let's start by, when Amazon published the pictures it showed a fingerprint reader which DIDN'T come with the laptop (this model DOESN'T HAVE FINGERPRINT READER!!!).Secondly, the laptop came non functional, the reason? HP has some problems with their laptops (because I found over the Internet that I wasn't the only one with the problem). There's a piece of connector between the motherboard and the hard disk that did came broken, it had some connectors in bad shape which made my laptop to not recognize its hard drive, it just turned on but for the BIOS there was no hard drive to connect.Anyway, after few calls to HP Latin America (because I live in Caracas, Venezuela right now) they told that HP-US has to fix it because I haven't bought it here, I called HP-US and they told that HP Latin America should take care, anyway I was very upset and I told them so. After that HP responded telling me they were going to send me the broken part.Amazon responded me too offering me a 20% discount in the price of the product for the all the problems I had, so I think they did a responsible job.

$REVIEW.: Bought this eSATA drive to backup my laptop hard drive which was exhibiting problems

 Copied my files to the Toshiba and put it aside for about a month


 Laptop drive was getting worse, so I began using the Toshiba daily


 I'm a heavy VM user, and the eSATA speed is great


 eSATA cable must be purchased separately.Opened Dell warranty claim for my failing laptop drive

 They had me run a test and sent me a new drive overnight

 I installed the drive and tried to copy my data off the Toshiba


 Failure
 Very slow

 Lots of clicking
 Failure
 Rebooted and the SATA portion of BIOS now said the Toshiba was "Incompatible"


 Windows wouldn't recognize the drive at all
 The Intel AHCI software said there was a problem with the drive and wanted me to re-initialize losing all data

 Nope...Disconnected eSATA and rebooted to Windows
 Used the USB connection to get some files from drive, but not many


 VERY slow (all weekend to copy 20GB)

 Tried using TestDisk to recover files
 Nope
 Toshiba drive completely failed me miserably

 Wound up getting most of my files from my old Dell drive.Went to Toshiba website to open warranty claim

 Website told me all external drive claims processed on phone at 877#
 Called the number but they were closed

 Called back on Monday and talked to a nice lady, but she told me I had the wrong number


 Gave me a new 888# to call
 Called that number and pressed 1, pressed 2, pressed 1, and then I waited for over 30 minutes to talk to a person


 Got a guy on the phone and asked for replacement
 He told me to go to the website!!!  I explained what I saw on the website

 He told me to open my claim on their website, and ship the bad drive back to them, and then they would ship me a replacement


 I said that was not acceptable
 I've been in IT 20 years and no company does it that way

 I told him to ship me a new drive and I'll send the bad one back with the shipping label he'll include

 He said no, the only option was for me to pay for shipping their almost new but poorly made and faulty product back to them
 I asked for his supervisor.Talked with a nice lady
 She got my serial # and told me I was in the wrong department
 Transferred me to another recording that wasted about 5 minutes more and then hung up on me
 Nice...real nice...Went to the website and opened my claim there


 Got an RMA number and it told me to pay to ship my bad drive back.UPDATE - After I shipped the bad drive back they issued me a credit for their Toshiba site

 The credit was based on their estimated value of the hard drive


 The credit was actually significantly more than the cost of ordering a replacement of the same model hard drive

 So I used the credit to get a replacement hard drive, and also got a nice tri-pod for my camera


 The credit was enough to cover the shipping costs, and I paid only the tax.The new drive arrived, and I used it to backup all my data and virtual machines
 It has been working fine for a year now

 I typically perform my backups about every 2 months, and each time the drive has been fine


 Hopefully it will work if I ever need to perform another restore operation
 The camera tri-pod is a very well made unit.Their method of RMA is out of the ordinary, but overall it did make me a happy customer by giving me more than I had originally purchased.

$REVIEW.: I am impressed with every aspect of the drive. Playing, recording, and burning Lightscribe were all great.  Installation was a breeze.  Install: Took the front panel off, removed the metal blank, slid the drive in. Used the provided SATA cord to connect to the motherboard.  Used the spare plug inside the case for power.  Put two screws in (4 provided) and that was it.  I had to remove the video card to get access to the SATA port on the mb. Closed the case powered it up and I was in business.  Total time 15 minutes.  Would have been less than 5 if I could have left the video card in place. THe other 10 minutes included trying to do it without pulling the video card and finally removing and reinstalling the video card.  The included NERO software installed easily but it was no where to be seen once installed.  I finally found the folder under Program files/x86 program files/NERO.  I could not get it to launch from there so I uninstalled and reinstalled.  This time I chose the folder to install to instead of accepting the default.  Everything worked after that except for the lightscribe part of the software, it would not open.  I uninstalled and reinstalled two more times with the same result. I even went to the NERO site and downloaded a trial version of NERO 9 Essentials, it did the same thing.  I finally went to lightscribe.com and downloaded their software and it works great.  I uninstalled all the NERO program and will use another program for burning files. The problem could be my machine, don't know.  XPS 8100 i7, Win 7 Pro, 64 bit.

$review_text.: I had seen this reviewed on a photography blog which I trust


 The price put me off and I just held it on my Wish List for 6 months until the price dropped a bit

 Still expensive, but you get what you pay for.There's a definite difference from cheaper polarizer filter I had been using in terms of the light loss


 F-stop or so better
 I haven't smeared my fingers all over it to test the claim that it is resistant to dirt and finger-prints, but I am sometimes a klutz changing filters - especially thin filters like this with a rotating part - and so far it has stayed clean and finger-print free
 I have DEFINITELY not tested how resistant it is to being stepped on, banged against things, etc
and I hope I don't have to.So far:  Good polarizing properties; better than normal polarizer at allowing light through; seems to stay clean well; easy for me to put on and remove; thin profile and light-weight; smooth, easy action.

$review_text.: I bought my screen protector at a local Best Buy after receiving my 4th Gen iPod Touch


I got home and followed the instructions down to a tee

Took me almost 30 minutes to get it on clean and aligned properly, but it's definitely worth it for a lifetime of screen protection! Some tips for those who are weary about putting these on themselves:Turn your device off! This is a wet application, so any excess moisture can get into your open ports

Be VERY liberal with the application solution


Clean your hands thoroughly before putting the protector on


Spray your hands and fingertips liberally with the application solution before you try to put it on or you WILL get fingerprints on the adhesive side of the film

Also spray the film itself generously on both sides

Not so much that it's dripping off the film, but also enough that the whole thing is covered, so if you make a mistake in placement you can remove it and line it back up no problem
If you make a mistake putting the film on the screen, spray your hands and fingers with the solution again
Once you get it on and aligned to your liking, use the squeegee with a good amount of force to minimize bubbles and imperfections

The best technique I've found is to just start in the middle and push the squeegee to the SIDES of the iPod (horizontally)
It will create some lines on the film, but if you leave the device alone for 24 hours they will disappear (cure)


Soak up any excess fluid with a lint free cloth after the film is aligned to your content


This is a wet application so any imperfections will go away once the film dries
Don't cry if you got it on and it looks crooked
The film will conform to the shape of the screen when it dries.If you're afraid of doing this yourself, let Geek Squad install it at your local Best Buy


They've installed the protectors on my past iPod Touch's and they always do an amazing, professional job

You won't even know it's there until you drop it screen down and everything is still intact and scratch free ;)

Overall, these things have definitely saved me many headaches and they DO work like advertised
I think the main reason people give these such bad reviews is because they don't have the patience or know-how to "install" them properly
A first timer will take about 30-40 minutes to get it on properly, where as an experienced person or a professional can do them in as little as 5 minutes
So don't be strayed away because of all the 1-star reviews

Have patience, get it done properly, and these protectors will keep your screen nice and pretty for a LONG time.

$REVIEW.: Sandisk Management has not been responding to request to fix this Drive.Probably the worst Technical Support for an Electronic Device I have ever expierenced and I spend over $300,000on Computers & Components per year


I am glad I am only sitting on 5 of these Drives.If you have any sense, buy another Drive.IF YOU WANT A DRIVE THAT IS DEFECTIVE IN THE BOX, BUY IT!!!!!!Useless until promised new Firmware is released to fix TRIM.According to Sandisk Forums they promised it's release weeks ago, but nothing is available.I also have Transcend & Corsair sanforce Drives that new firmware has been released that fixes TRIM.This Drive is equipped with the Sandforce 2281 Controller that is know to have a defective Firmware Version 5.0.1
which has broken TRIM

Please Google sanforce 5.0.1 broken TRIM you can read all about it
There are tons about it and more every day as Manufacturers scramble to release new Firmware now that the word is out that they were selling defective Drives!!My best guess is Sandisk like everyone else who uses sandforce controllers(Intel is the exception) utilize the sandforce produced firmware as base code & develop from it and put a finish Sandisk Firmware Version Release on it

This Drive has Firmware called R201 which has been confirmed to have broken TRIM problem.Google Sandisk Broken TRIM you can read all about it.This also explains the poor benchmarks in AS SSD, CrystalDiskMark Benchmarks I have experienced on my older Sandisk Extreme Dives


They are dismal

I have run that benchmark with my Samsung & Plextor drives that do not have sandforce controllers & achieved almost maximum marks
I also have a sanforce Corsair GT 240GB with the new 5.0.3 firmware


I did a secure erase reinstalled OS and now it is also getting high marks in AS SSD & CrystalDiskMark which were horrible before the Flash


Why does every other non sanforce drive blow this thing away in every other benchmark test like AS SSD, CrystalDiskMark?When checking your Drive just because Windows shows the TRIM as enabled does not mean it is working!!!!

I have tried cowboy studio and other 3rd party low priced ones ... I thought this product was cheaply (plastic) made but those other ones are far worse. I like that you can replace the battery easily and turn it on and off unlike some of those other cheap ones. I took one star off because of the cheap design and make but if you are not a wedding photographer or pro, then this is a way to go. I like the locking mechanism on the wire.

$review_text.: For at least 2 years now, I've been looking for exactly this product--no frills, no dongles, just wireless music over Bluetooth.  And it has finally arrived.  I've been tired of stringing cables across my room everytime I want to connect my laptop to my stereo.  Now, I can lay back in my bed and play music wirelessly.  I can do the same from my phone.I have heard some people have difficulties with some versions of Windows and A2DP Bluetooth devices.  I run Windows 7 and everything worked out of the box.  But that may be because of my computer's built-in drivers.  In any case, I'm a happy camper.  Setup took about 2 minutes, following the directions.  It didn't pair with my phone the first time I pressed the button on my phone, so I pressed it again, and presto!I haven't really taxed the system to see if it will clip at high volume or anything, but so far, for regular listening the sound is crystal clear.I would give this product 6 stars if only it provided a way for me to send it back to my past self 2 years ago, to save me all the searching for a product like this.  I'm surprised there isn't more demand for products like this, that finally realize the dream of eliminating wires, the entire reason Bluetooth was created (no, it wasn't invented so you can walk around with your earpiece in :p).

Also, I've had problems with the keyboard not responding to keystrokes. I log off and back on and the problem goes away. The touch is just not what I was expecting. So, sorry, but I don't recommend it.

$review_text.: I bought this camera to replace an Olympus 850SW.  I was never happy with the image quality of the Olympus.  Visible noise at even base ISO.  The D10 puts that sad little camera to shame.  Clean images at ISO 80-200, usable at 400, and even salvageable (for the most part) at 800/1600.  The colors are clear and saturated, and the automatic metering is quite amazing.  It manages to correctly expose some scenes that are quite challenging, especially for such a small sensor.  The image quality is very impressive.My main use for this camera is canyoneering.  In canyon environments the camera is exposed to every kind of grit and water.  A shockproof/waterproof camera is essential.  I love this camera for this purpose!  It handles the water and the harsh environment very well.It's not up to the standards of a non-waterproof compact at the same price.  This is to be expected, as a non-waterproof would last 10 seconds in the places I take my D10.Cons:- A tiny bit bulky.  I found a case from Mountainsmith that fits it well enough.  A small price to pay for the better non-folded optics.- 35mm at the wide end is a bit restrictive.  I shoot vertical shots and stitch them together to go wider- 105mm at the tele end is just a tad short- No Av/Tv/M modes- 720p video would have been nice, but not essentialPros- Very fast startup time.  I love how I can grab it, turn it on, and take a picture within 1 second.- Fast operation time.  Everything the camera does feels very snappy- Smart auto mode.  I find I just use the auto mode, as it does a pretty remarkable job.  I only switch to P mode when I want to do something special.- Waterproof to 10m and shockproof.  Essential for wet/challenging environments- Face detect timer:  I love this feature, you can set up a group shot and then get into place.  When it sees another face, it will take a few pictures.- F2.8 lens gets faster shutter times so flash isn't always needed.If you canyoneer or kayak, you should probably buy this camera.EDIT:Not that anyone would consider this camera any more, but I thought I'd add to my review anyway.  The camera works well but is not very hardy when it comes to water.  I lost one to water getting behind the lens (Canon replaced it), and I lost the other to electronics failure due to water seepage.  I have a Panasonic Lumix now and have not had any of these issues.

$REVIEW.: This camera is exactly fits my bill for size and perfomance. The optics are superb (though not up to my 1940 Leica :). The colors are very good and there are a remarkable number of settting to chose from (and learn.) I've used Nikon and Cannon equivalents the Panasonic more than holds its own by comparison. I've even been able to show my 88 yr. old mother how to operate it - the only problem being getting it back!It's not a small, thin camera but, it is far more portable than an SLR and a bargin at the price.

$review_text.: Bought this due to the hype of SSDs, was not disappointed.With all of my standard drivers and startup programs, I boot in roughly 20 seconds, and everything is ready to go, not the typical 5-20 minute wait for the PC to stop dicking around. However, buy this if you know how to setup a bootloader, or if someone else can setup an SSD for you. I ended up reinstalling Windows 8 Pro onto this SSD due to my technological deficiency, and it works just fantastically.Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to speed up their PC. A 250GB ssd is worth more than those extra 16-24 gb of ram, or that new cpu+mobo, or the GPU. Bought this instead. Good quality, great read-write, fast bootup, Dota2 and Kerbal Space Program work much faster, definitely worth the cash.Buy it!

$REVIEW.: The Galaxy 2 is a nice 7" ICS Tab for a great price!  The memory slot, 2 cameras, full Android 4.0 ICS, Bluetooth, and GPS are well worth the extra $50 compared to the Kindle Fire.  This Tab does a great job serving its purpose of watching Netflix/YouTube/Amazon Prime videos, reading, email, and casual/quick Web browsing. Price was #1 when choosing this Tab, sure there are better/faster Tabs but I really didn't want to spend much more than $200.  BTW -  No problems connecting this Tab to my rooted Moto Photon 4g using Wifi Tethering.  Much nicer to watch videos/movies anywhere on the crisp 7" screen compared to my Photon screen.

$review_text.: I bought my set for $39.74 total about 3.5 months ago from a company called &#34;STEVE KAESER PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHTING & ACC &#34;, not &#34;cowboystudio&#34; or any other company currently selling it. My experience was positive: It arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, with nothing broken. Most importantly it works the way that it's supposed to work. The lights are very bright and my pictures come out great. It's easy to set up and adjust. As far as being bribed- I didn't receive any offer of a discount in exchange for a good review, although I'm almost certain that whichever company was doing that was asking for positive feedback for themselves and not the actual product review. Whatever the case with that, it was in poor taste.Although I love my set, I can't recommend buying it from &#34;cowboystudio&#34; because I did not deal with them and they may have different practices. In addition, their price is higher by almost $20 ($57.48 at the moment). Unfortunately &#34;Steve Kaeser&#34; doesn't seem to be selling it anymore.

$review_text.: Have owned this little radio a few years


The tuning failed to work well within several weeks
It is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weather...even 50's...it loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible

And yes, the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others
Reception of FM and Am are pretty good

There is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station


So, if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics aren't a bother this might be an acceptable choice...but radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical parts...it's a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choice.

$REVIEW.: The bag is ok for your modern-day digital camcorder (Panasonic GS300), but it is a "Very Tight" fit should you wish to also add a small digital camera like a Canon 520. The best fit is to lay the camera on the bottom, place the padded divider over it and then lay the camcorder on top. The zipper slightly pulls the top & bottom together with this configuration. Go elsewhere if you need a bag to hold both a camcorder & camera; otherwise, it's a good product with nice features. BTW, the bag is amply padded.

$REVIEW.: I tried this card on three computers with the same result in all three cases
 Various drivers were installed on all three PCs


 The drivers seem to install OK and Windows reported the card as working in all cases

 But when I tried to actually use the card, NOTHING WORKED  AT ALL

 Both USB 3.0 and eSATA devices were tried in all three PCs
 The various device LEDs came on and blinked, but Windows never recognized any of the devices at all in any of the machines

 The card also needs to protrude out of the PC somewhat in order to fully insert the device cable plugs, COMPLETELY HIDDEN is VERY BAD

 And when you pull out the device cable plugs, the card comes out of the PC along with the cables still attached

 If there were any kind of lower rating available, such as minus 5, this product would get it.

$review_text.: Turns out, traditional "on the head" headphones give me headaches (including one that was over $150--drat). I looked for something else. I go nuts with earbuds' tangling cords.I'm certainly not a music connoisseur, but the sound on this headset is fine with me. The whole setup is feather-weight; I forget it's around my neck. The whole thing is like a delicate flower; treat it gingerly. No cords. Two devices means I can use my iPod for listening to music so as not to drain my iPhone 4S's battery.Everything about this headset is elegant and well-designed. What a great design this is.UPDATE 2 Dec 2012I still love this gizmo (*****). It's the first "headphone" that doesn't clamp my skull. No more headaches. Works beautifully. Highly recommend.UPDATE 4 Dec 2012I forgot. The instructions are really tiny (3-inches x 3.5-inches). Itty-bitty, teeny-weeny. Ugh! Not good! The typography is very nearly illegible. LG: Why are you trying to make your purchasers blind?QUESTION 28 March 2013I still like this headset--a lot. However, I have a new application for it, not for iOS but for Macintosh. I don't know where else to ask this question, so I'll ask it here: is this headset compatible with Dragon Dictate 3 for Mac? It seems that Dragon Dictate would a natural application for this headset, but do they talk to each other? If not now, maybe someday.

I owned the 70-200 f2.8 and sold it after using this lens for a little while.  This one is definitely sharper and about a pound lighter.There have been many detailed reviews of the canon 70-200 f4.

$REVIEW.: I have the SanDisk ImageMate connected to an iMac (July 2011) via USB2.0


 I mainly use it to transfer video content from CF cards used in my Canon XF105 for archiving and processing in Final Cut Pro X


 The reader does a great job and I'm very happy with it.Previously, I could only achieve good transfer speeds (reading from CF & SD media is my main need) when I directly connected my camera via it's USB 2.0 interface


 Transfers with other card readers were significantly slower, with transfer durations as much as 2 or 3 times longer!  With this card reader, the transfer rate (reading from the media) is not noticeably different versus direct camera connection.Using Black Magic I achieved the following performance:Test conditions:-- USB2.0 (iMac doesn't have USB3.0)-- 32GB SanDisk Extreme CF card (this CF Card rated at 60MB/s)-- 2GB testTest result (see uploaded picture):-- Write 23.3 MB/s-- Read 31.0 MB/sFor me the read is far more important, as that's the process I normally need and I'm very happy with this rate.Note 1: Why USB2.0 tests?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Why buy the USB3.0 device when my Mac's only equipped with USB2.0? I have USB3.0 on my PC, which is used more for photos but I've done no bench mark there yet

 If there's interest I can test from there also


 Also forward planning for when I introduce USB3.0 to my video workflow.NOTE 2: Regarding the Stand criticism...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Using the stand design as a reason to rate the product down is very strange to me
 I actually feel the design is very good and provides desirable flexibility with NO downside.The reader stands in an appealing manner when not in use, reducing the desktop footprint of the reader
 By gently holding the reader when inserting or removing a card it is also extremely stable AND I can't remember any card reader that I've used which didn't need to be held UNLESS it was an integrated unit
 Should the stand not suit your use, thanks to it's smart design it can be quickly removed allowing the reader to be used in a similar manner to the majority of other products available.With this you have choice, I choose to use the stand

 See photos of the reader on my desk and how I hold it to insert the card too.---------------------------------Conclusion:~~~~~~~~After trying different card readers from cheap to more expensive, this is by far the best
 It's most important characteristic for me is it's "transfer rate" and in this area it performs better than any other I've tried.Thanks for reading!

$REVIEW.: I'm using this to mount my 23" Asus monitor on the wall my desk faces. The construction of the mount is simple and tough. And as others have pointed out the installation is pretty strait forward, they give you plenty of screws to mount your unit. And the results are damn good, this is VERY thin.Too thin though? I had a very hard time trying to mount my monitor because of the tabs at the bottom of the back were hitting my power cable. The plugs on my monitor were strait out the back and this didn't help either. I got a different power cord, trimmed the plastic, and bent down the metal tabs to make the fit. I hope I don't have to remove the monitor any time soon because it was a snug fit.Over all, it is a great value but I wish the design had a bit more thought to it.

$review_text.: I purchased the E-P3 for $379 about the time the E-P5 was announced. Not because the E-P5 isn't a better camera, but because the price for what was the premium Pen in the line is amazingly low for what it offers. It offers fast AF, a nice touch screen, availability of a nice range of lenses, a much larger sensor than point and shoot cameras, great JPG engine, in-body IS, hot shoe and accessory port, good dual dial control interface, decent add on grip, and great IQ up to ISO1600 for the kind of money that doesn't make the wallet or wife/husband shreak in horror. What it doesn't offer is 1/8000 shutter max shutter speed, newest Sony sensor, 5-axis IS, or focus peaking. Of course you can get those feature now on the E-P5 for $700 more than the cost of this camera. But for what it is, this camera takes great pictures and video and offers step up features for a diminutive price. Currently, along with the GX1 is the best value around for a mirrorless sans electronic viewfinder. It would make a great first &#34;serious&#34; camera and is a great side kick for a larger DSLR system. It's a great time to be photographing!

$REVIEW.: I've had experience with Altec Lansing speakers before, so I decided to give these a shot.  I found them for less than $20 on Black Friday so it was a no-brainer!  The first two sets both had one of the subwoofer legs broken off (poor handling from the factory I guess).  Fortunately the store was local so I just took them back until I found a perfect set.  Once I set them up, I was truly blown away by the sound quality!  The highs are clear and crisp, the mids are noticeable but not overly present, and the lows from the sub are very deep and tight even as you turn up the volume.  For a $20 speaker system, these things are unbeatable.  For a $50+ speaker system, I would like to see more controls.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's annoying that the power button is on the back of the subwoofer.  It's also bothersome that there's not bass control (only a "tone" control).  I also wish they would give a lot more wire length between the two speakers...I wound up having to extend them by another 3 feet in order to set the speakers on opposite sides of my desk.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend these speakers!  Lacking a few controls and short cable lengths keep it from getting 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: My family just redid our family room and it was time to throw out our old CRT TV...My parents don't know anything about tech so they asked me what would be a good TV to buy. I chose this one. I'm happy with it. :DI got a small nettop with this TV with the intent of using it as a HTPC to stream video from our other HTPC in the basement and surf the web. The picture looks nice! :D I fired up a 1080p rip of The Dark Knight with all the lights off and the picture was nice and crisp. One thing I noticed is picture looks unnaturally smooth. I honestly don't know if its a good thing. I haven't bothered looking into it, but I want to believe its the motion plus. According to the other review, its something you can just turn off, so no foul. :)I love the ultra thin bezel. Other TVs say they are like 37" when the actual screen size is only 32", obviously just an attempt to cut down on production costs. With this TV, there's none of that. :DThe sound quality is good. Its enough to play any movie at a good volume without distortion in a smaller room. I had XBMC going and I was playing some of my heavy electro, it sounds great, except the fact that the sound lacks the strong bass. But how can I complain? Its a TV. Not a sound system.As far as the other review pointing out the edge lit "weakness" I have to stand about a foot away from the TV to see a very small amount of light bleeding. I couldn't even notice it sitting on the couch cruising the web. :)This TV is great. I love it. I have no complaints. :D--Things that might save you some headaches--You need to turn the sharpness WAAAAAAAAAY down. Yea the other review has it at like 10, thats where mine is too.For people plugging in a computer into this TV, don't freak out when the picture over scans the desktop and it gets cut off all around the edges. You need to press menu, go to picture -> picture adjustment, then change the "picture size" from 16:9 to "fit screen". This is not the only TV I've had to change this setting on, but it really bothers me that manufactures don't have that set as default. Because people will resort to changing the desktop resolution to something lower, than complain about how the picture looks fuzzy. (Sorry mini rant) :DWe all mounted our TV. The wall mount kit that we bought didn't have the right length screws for this TV. You need an 8x25mm screw. Had to run to the hardware store to grab some. :( Make sure you have some washers on hand to avoid torquing into the back of the TV. :)

$REVIEW.: I bought this because I decided it was time for a widescreen monitor.  So far I haven't found anything wrong with it.  The colors are fantastic, although I'll admit I use it for basic office work and Internet browsing.  I use Windows 7 and it works great with that.  I like being able to see a number of pages at a time.  And of course it's nice to see as much as possible of a website.I won't go into techie stuff since I'm just a regular user (although I've had many monitors for various reasons since the 80s), but this is doing very well for me so far.  It's a great size, too.  It's big, but no sot much so that it takes over my desk.  I also like the ability to adjust it.  I don't mess with that feature much, but it's nice to know it's there.So if you want to upgrade to a decent-quality widescreen monitor, consider this.  And you can't beat the price on Amazon, as usual.

$REVIEW.: I bought this system for the compact form factor and good sound. At home, the sound is adequate but not great. The size is good. And for the first 5 months, the performance was okay. I read many reviews about problems with this system crashing and counted myself lucky that I didn't get one of those 'lemons.'Well, think again. In the last 4 weeks, the system has begun to crash repeatedly. Many times, I can't get eject my DVD without restarting >10 times. Many times, I hear the DVD spinning even when the system is supposed to be off. Some people say they can't play 1/5 DVDs. Well, it's more like 80% of my DVDs!  I put them in my other system and they play flawlessly. This system has ruined my perception of Bose - poor quality with horrible support (they refuse to fix this fatal problem). I will never buy from them again - and I would never recommend this system to anyone.  Believe the bad reviews - don't waste your money.
$SUMMARY.: Horrible system - don't make the same mistake we all did!

$REVIEW.: The ICF-38 is a decent AM/FM portable radio that's very easy to operate. The controls include an on/off switch, an AM/FM switch, separate tuning and volume wheels, and a high/low tone switch. There's also a fold-up handle and a 24" whip antenna that swivels in all directions. The tone of the radio is good, though somewhat thin, in spite of the two-position tone switch. The reception of both AM and FM is excellent - considerably better than most portable radios in this price range. Tuning the radio is helped by a tiny red tuning eye that lights up when a station frequency has been located. The ICF-38 can be powered either by a self-contained power cord or 4 AA batteries. Battery consumption is minimal, in part, since, when it's off, it's truly off. Digital radios, due to their clocks and other features, are somewhat on, even when they're turned "off."One criticism. In modifying this radio, Sony should have taken care of the one consistent complaint that users made about the previous ICF-36: the headphone output is mono, which means it plays out of only one side of a set of headphones. The same is still true for this newer model.The Sony ICF-38 is a fine, sturdy, and practical radio - rather old-fashioned in some ways. It's fairly small and light weight, and the speaker produces decent audio quality. It would make an excellent radio to carry around the house or yard or out to the park. Its extreme simplicity of design and function makes it a refreshing change from the overly sophisticated digital multi-purpose radios that are now the norm. The lack of a lighted display window and digital clock - which some people would find disappointing - means that the batteries will last all the longer. Yes, such simplicity is good, and allows you to spend all your time enjoying music, news, and talk radio, rather than thumbing through a multi-cultural manual, trying to figure out how on earth to program a ridiculously complicated piece of technology. For its price and overall capability, the ICF-38 is an excellent radio. I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: I did not download, nor use, the WD software that came with this drive.  WD has a good reputation, and I suspect the SW provided would be worth using.  But this drive was purchased for one function.This drive was recognized by the USB3 port on my desktop loaded with Windows 7 64 Bit.  I bought this drive primarily to run periodic SYSTEM IMAGEs as a back-up to the software and files loaded on the internal Hard Drive.  Unlike my other 1 TB WD external drive (not a My Passport version), it runs off the USB Power and does not require a separate power supply.  Yeah!Windows 7 recognized the drive immediately and loaded the drivers.  Works like a champ.  And the USB 3.0 high speed transfer rate makes System Image backups lightning quick (compared to my other USB 2.0 external drives).I got the RED version because it was priced lower than the silver/black siblings on Amazon.  Worth every cent spent.PS: I also used this drive on my HP Laptop as well using an USB 2.0 port for a back-up of my System Image (WIN 7).  It ran using the USB 2 power without an issue, although the data transfer rate was considerably slower as expected.

$REVIEW.: Bought one of these from the listed seller: &#34;Mission Bargain Hacker Electronics Warehouse&#34; and they got the item to me in socal FAST and in like new condition

Whoever opened this to extract the original HDD did a top-notch job, wish I could've done as well putting my new drive in it.Literally looked like there'd never been a drive in it
Popped a 1TB 7200RPM Seagate SATA HDD in it, works like a charm

Haven't benchmarked it or anything though

Since it has a metal shield inside that you actually mount the HDD to, and then that slides into the plastic case, it's compatible with anything that has standard 3.5&#34; screw pattern.The drive I used was a half-height drive; was originally going to swap my 3TB WD green that's currently residing in a USB 2.0 WD-branded enclosure into this, but the slimmer Seagate drive wouldn't stay secure with just the lil rubber things in the WD enclosure
If you need an inexpensive USB 3.0 enclosure for a SATA HDD, this is a great deal.One minute negative
Unless you've disassembled this exact enclosure before, you'll probably need to find a youtube video showing you where to pop it open at

Since this is a retail, end-product-type enclosure, it's not setup for easy access like a dedicated external enclosure would be
However, because of that, it's sturdier, better constructed, and looks better for what you pay, when you do finally get it apart and the new drive in it.

$review_text.: The unit suits my purpose. I disassembled the unit by removing the front grating and taking out the speaker.  It is (as expected) a low cost 4 ohm 2.5W driver.  The spec of 2.5 watts per channel probably comes from the speakers ratings.  The USB power connector means the unit gets 5v x 500ma = 2.5watts (as much as matters.)  This means that you REALLY only have 1.25 watts per channel available, with some peaks available thanks to internal capacitors.  This is a limitation of USB.The enclosure appears to be some sort of wood/paper product, and feels solidly built in my opinion, especially at this price point.  The audio sorely lacks mids, and has weak lows.  It's not made for thumping power though.Overall: i use this as a sound option for a computing setup that must run on solar/batteries.  It works quite well really, but make sure you have realistic expectations.  its 20 dollars of pulp, plastic, metal, and electronics.  Don't expect too much and it will be very suitable.

$review_text.: Let me start by saying I returned this camera already.  The main reason was because the wife wanted to go back to something smaller aka a subcompact camera.  I had to agree with her there after a few days of using the camera.Second, she did not like the recharge time between flash pictures.  I didn't time it, but it seemed like at least 5 or 6 seconds.  I guess that's fairly typical of cameras with 2 AA batteries, but I could be wrong.The subcompact we had before (Canon SD600) seemed alot better in this regard.  It used a proprietary lithium rechargeable battery though.My beef with the camera was the video wasn't as good as our previous SD600 camera.  And I guess the specs don't lie because they state 20 fps for 640x480 video instead of 30 fps with most other Canon digital cameras.  The IS seemed like it made the video more stable, but it also made panning with the camera more choppy.  It wasn't a huge beef as I don't take alot of video with a digital camera, but it was annoying they made the video worse.I also thought the construction was a bit cheap with the shell of the camera being plastic instead of metal.  The zoom lever seemed a bit cheap too.Now the good.  I like the dial on the camera.  It lets you quickly select a shooting mode.  Very handy.  On a subcompact you have to select modes through the menus at least on the old Canon we had.  The pictures seem fairly nice.  I wouldn't say they were better than our previous camera, but certainly I didn't notice they were that much worse either.  The fact it uses AA batteries is convenient because AA batteries are everywhere and  the access to the batteries, memory card and ports are easier to work with.  (It's not as tiny as on a subcompact.)  And this camera has lots of manual settings.ULtimately though the camera wasn't as sleek and small as the subcompact we had before.  It didn't take as nice of video and it seemed slower in between pictures specifically flash pictures.he only advantage to this one over a ~$200 CAnon subcompact would seem to be the convenience of AA batteries and a slightly greater zoom although perhaps some would find a larger camera easier to hold.

$review_text.: This Verso "Profile" cover *looks* very neat and professional on the outside. However, it's what's on the inside that counts.PROS:1) This case has a strong elastic that holds the case closed.2) It's very slim.CONS:1) This case holds the Kindle Fire HD in place with elastic tabs on each corner. This interior elastic is thin and is of a much poorer quality than the outer elastic. After less than a week of use, my Kindle was very loose inside the cover.2) The case has only has two viewing positions for hands-free use, IF the elastic is tight.3) I don't know if this is a "con" or not, but my case has a very strong odor. Even after a week in my garage, it retained this odor.As much as I like the look and the slim build of this case, I'm not using it anymore.  My main concern is the loose interior elastic doesn't protect my Kindle Fire HD, when it's open -- in hands-free position or even in reading position.

I did have to cough up $30 for the software to backup instantly however.Only issues I ran into were the initial backup took way too long to complete (and I was only doing 340 GB of material). Also a few files of mine were corrupt and this completely ruined my initial backup. I had to basically start over. Instead of just skipping that file it tried repeatedly to back it up. Lastly you have to unplug the drive from your computer when you restart which is a minor pain.Like I said after the initial set up it works great and is well worth it. Quiet and easy to manage.

I'm a music teacher that uses my GH4 to record orchestra, band, and chamber music rehearsals, private lessons, and student auditions for festivals and schools.  The quality of the video is excellent, and the sound is "good enough" for my purposes.  Even the still photos turn out quite good, and thankfully there's a flash built in!  Now, the low-light performance isn't very good, but...what on earth do most of us want to film in low-light anyhow?As for the battery issue: I highly recommend buying the $20 package that gives you a great portable charger (better than the original) and two Wasabi Power 3.7V 1000mAh batteries.  I've got no problem now making it through long rehearsals, and swapping batteries is very quick and simple.I have a 16GB class 10 SDHC card in the slot.  At HD-SHQ 720, it's good enough for just over three hours, which matches up nicely with the battery life.  At full resolution it stores two hours...and my poor five year old first-gen MacBook actually has trouble playing it back. :P  In any case it's a huge improvement over the mini DV camera I had previously!I'm still amazed that Sanyo is able to deliver such an excellent product at this price point.

$review_text.: These were the first subs I ever owned so when I bought these I was considered a noob.I wanted some subs that were enclosed in glass so the sub would not get destroyed in my trunck. These were the best ones I found in my price range.ProsLights - I wired them so they only turn on when the trunk is open.They look sick in the dark. :DEasy to install - just used 12 gage wire did not need any conecters.( to any one that does not know to attach to the amp just strip the end of the wire and push down on the terminal and put the wire through the hole and let go.)Encloser - looked very profesional.Lots of power - I can here them in my basement of my house at under 1/2 power.ConsI could not find an amp.( I used a Kenwood kac-7204)Kenwood KAC-7204 1000-Watt Max Power Stereo Bridgeable Amplifier with Variable LPF/HPFThat's all I got hope it helps

$review_text.: Keyboard touch feedback is very bad, has mushy feeling to it, often it's not clear whether it key went down enough to register key press, which is especially problematic when typing passwords. Also, over time keys acquired the habit of getting stuck slightly every now and then - not enough to prevent key press, but enough to be noticeable and annoying. Combine that with mushy feel that was there to begin with and you get pretty unusable keyboard.

$review_text.: The earpieces are comfortable and stay put, and the audio fidelity is fine.  My only issue with these headphones is the short cord.  Yes, there is an extension cord, but that makes the cord as ridiculously long as the cords on all my other headphones.  By contrast, this cord is too short to reach the audio outlet on many of the cardio machines in the gym I attend.If you stay close to your audio source, or don't care about this feature, they are excellent and a great value.

I am a bit skeptical now anybody really need something formed into an antenna when they can use any piece of metal wire. Having said that, the antenna looks cute and it is compact. Ten bucks cost is probably a good reason to get one, as a piece of cable will probably cost you about the same.

$REVIEW.: Addendum:The replacement worked well and working with customer service was pleasant


Definitely a good buy with excellent customer satisfaction if something goes wrong.Original:I know there will always be a dud in every product.I just hate it when it has to happen to me.It charged my phone once and after that the on button wouldn't turn on anymore unless I plug it in to charge


I charged it  fully before I used it and the LED turned red to indicate it was charging and it shut off after it finished about 3 hours later

I turned it on and charged my phone from 50% to 100% without any problems with the LED turning green and flashing after I connected phone.The following day, I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't, I thought that the battery discharged overnight which was odd since I haven't used it since.I plugged it in to charge but the LED remained green unlike the previous night when it was red when charging
The LED remained on green after I unplugged it and turns itself off after a few seconds.If I plug it in a device  before it shuts off then it will charge the device


Long story short:1

It doesn't charge anymore and LED doesn't light up red like it's supposed to when charging2
I have to plug it to an outlet or laptop first to turn it on to be able to use it which defeats the purpose of a mobile chargerBack to Amazon it goes and I'm not waiting for it to completely discharge to see if it'll work again.Maybe I'll try to buy it sometime again since I really liked it.Just my bad luck I guess.Otherwise it's really nice, compact, and good build quality.

$REVIEW.: It does what it supposed to, it protects your kindle

The good of this thing is that because of magnets it will put your kindle to sleep when you close it, preserving battery life which is nice

It has the stylus holder which is also nice

I keep a pen in there because I don't use a stylus but it's nice to have a pen on hand when you take your kindle places


The folding of the cover to make a stand is a bit flimsy
My kindle falls very often but if you get it just right, don't wiggle the table it should stay

Also, the positioning of the charging port on the kindle in relation to the cutout on the cover is a bit off

So sometimes the cable is not in all the way because it's caught on the cover, so be sure it's plugged in


If there was just a bit more clearance this probably wouldn't be an issue.

$REVIEW.: Have owned this TV since May and it is an amazingly super picture except for one flaw. There is some sort of color shifting that sometimes occurs. It seems to annoy the heck out of some people. It doesn't bother me as it doesn't happen that often. People should know that Sony was told about this problem in May of 2009 and to this date refuse to acknowledge that there's a problem. That does not speak well for them.The main issue I have with this TV is the sound. Sometimes there is a very annoying loud "pop" when changing channels from a HD image to a SD image. Not good. Again, Sony's response was non-existant as they have ignored fixing it even with two firmware updates. I guess these issues cannot be corrected or they would have.Aside from those issues the picture is stunning. I've not seen a better sharp clear picture on any TV. It's like the picture jumps out of the screen into your living room. So, should you buy it? Yes, but be prepared to return the TV if you cannot live with the occasional color flash or sound pop.

 I went with these figuring that even if they turned out to be crap there was little loss and I could just buy new more expensive cables for like $[...]
 I needed and bought two for those of you who've noticed my plural usage, AND I'M SO GLAD I DID!!  I've had no problems with these cables in the slightest and they look fantastic

 An HDMI cable is an HDMI cable

 As far as your TV is concerned the signal is either there or not!  I've had not problems with interference so I'm assuming they are shielded, or if they're not it's not an issue


 They probably are, because the amount of cables behind my TV is insane


 I have 2 surround sound systems set up, 1 analog, 1 digital with a DVD player, and a computer tower
 The cables are great!  Don't waste your money on expensive cables!

With a adjustment slider, I would expect the other side to not be affected but this is not the case. Adjusting the volume on either side will cause the other side to fluctuate.

I am pleased with the purchase and based on my experience, the adapter works just fine.There are an awful lot of negative, one-star reviews, though. I am a little puzzled by a couple of them saying the product is light and feels cheap -- I find the adapter about as heavy as the original Sony part.I noticed that a big majority of the 1-star reviewers are "one-review wonders". There are a couple of those in the 5-star camp as well. I tend to be suspicious of people who write just one review. There are a lot of shills out there trying to either build their products up or tear competitors down.Hmmm. All I can say is that it's working well for me.

$REVIEW.: I bought this filter, and it was fine for three months, but then while out shooting it came apart in my hand, meaning the half of the filter that you rotate separated from the half that screws to your lens.  The C-clip that holds the two halves together went flying, but I managed to find it.  Unfortunately, it ended my shooting day, because the C-clip is coated with a thin oil that splattered all over my lens, and was impossible to remove without a strong cleaner.When I got home, I managed to snap the two halves back together, and managed to clean my lens, but the actual filter is almost impossible to clean, because when you wipe it, your cloth will touch the edge of the filter and pick up more oil, so you end up fouling the glass again.I've contacted the seller to see about a replacement.  The filter works well, but could use a bit better QC.

$REVIEW.: For the price paid, this is a great deal
The CAT 5 wire itself is ok and you get 300 feet included so it's a fair  amount of wire, at least for our small office


I'm impressed with the quality of the crimping tool that came within the package
I was expecting some cheap thing that would break if you put too much pressure crimping the plug ends
This is a good quality crimping tool that should sell for $15-20 by itself - so I consider that a real bonus


Just be sure to add more RJ45 Plugs as 10 that comes with doesn't go far - i.e


makes 5 cables providing you do screw up


The Belkin 50 pack is a good deal

Then, if you've never done this before, watch youtube video showing how it's done and be sure the wire colors match on both ends and ends are cut straight and pushed all the way in BEFORE crimping
Once you know how it's very easy

Like anything it's the first one that the hardest

$review_text.: Overall, I like this GPS, but I find it to be much more reliable for navigating in the USA or Canada, than in Europe (at least in France)
 I spent a month with this unit in France, driving rental cars, and have only returned to the USA 2 days ago, so my impressions are very fresh.I would recommend using this in France only if you have a general idea of where you are going, and have studied your route on a map beforehand


 Although in many cases the unit functioned just fine, in many other cases totally ridiculous and nonsensical directions were given

 To list just a few of the unreliable directions I received, they included (1) being directed to literally drive around in circles in small towns with narrow roads and one way streets; (2) being instructed to get on the Autoroute (on which there are expensive tolls) for short trips where the autoroute would save no time whatsoever and might even be a longer drive both in time and distance; continuing to be directed towards the autoroute even after ignoring earlier prompts and being so far along using regular, non-toll roads ("route nationale") that going backwards to the autoroute would be idiotic; (3) told to exit off roundabouts (traffic circles; "rond-points") onto the wrong road even though the right road was clearly marked with signs
 These are but a few examples, and each of these things happened so many times in so many places that it was clearly not a few isolated errors


 In addition to using the unit on mainland France, I used it for a week on the Island of Corsica (part of France) and found it to be almost useless there.I'm not saying that the unit is worse than not having a GPS; it was genuinely useful quite a few times


 I would simply not rely on it completely and I would pay attention to road signs and follow common sense, ignoring the unit's voice prompts whenever that seems reasonable (and that happens a lot).Driving in France can be a challenge for drivers not used to their road system and signage

 I am quite familiar with both and therefore found this unit's flaws to be only a minor annoyance

 If I was not familiar with French driving, I'm not sure how useful this unit would have been.

$REVIEW.: I've had this Harmony One since March 2011. It took several (4 or 5) sessions of going back into the programming interface to get the sequences as we needed them, and several months of actual use to understand how to best sequence the events to fit the way we use the equipment. These sequences are called "Activities" in Logi-speak.Now, it's almost funny, the ease with which we can switch from a small TV with DVD to the Flat Panel, 7.1 and Satellite in the bedroom then to CD in 7-channel stereo, as the right things turn off, the receiver switches input paths, the DVD changes or turns off. What's especially funny about it is how deceptively simple it looks, but in reality it took quite a bit of configuring (some may say, "hassle") and tweaking to get things look this "easy".Programming the remote is done through a mini-USB to your computer, then using Logitech portal software on your local machine (sort of like a browser for the remote) through the internet to Logitech. I think our remote's profiles reside "up there" on Logitech's servers.About the only complaint I have at this point is that there are some controls available for some components in the remote that do not actually exist in some of the equipment itself... (The Fujitsu plasma has controls for "yellow" and "red" in the Harmony that mean nothing in the Fujitsu monitor's menu.)Try as we might, we couldn't figure out how to tweak the programming to eliminate some of these useless options or add some others which were not part of the preconfigured menu available online at Logitech. There is the limitation: you can add or remove features so long as they are on the menu. But I do remember being able to reassign actions to certain menu items.For all I know, it might be possible to create a feature, (say, teletext, for example) then teach the remote the code to associate with that feature using your gear's original remote, but it's been awhile since I was fiddling with the remote programming and frankly, kind of got tired of messing with it. The programming menu is not completely flexible. But it is pretty good.I can indeed control 9 different pieces of gear with this one remote, but the real magic is in creating the sequences (Activities) so the controller makes those transitions "easily".Certainly if this one broke or blew up I would order another that very day.UPDATE June, 2013:Still running! Haven't had any malfunctions, the battery is still charging and lasting as long as it did when new (as far as I can tell anyhow), no broken screen and all buttons work fine.I see there is now a newer model of this- one thing I'd wish they'd do with these is make a physical touch screen lockout button so you couldn't accidentally change activities because of brushing against the remote- don't know if that's been implimented... but very glad I bought it, though expensive, it's still a great asset over wrangling 5 or 6 remotes.

$REVIEW.: I use this cable to connect a Kindle Fire HD to the TV for video streaming. Although I've had it for a short time, the cable appears of good quality and does what it's supposed to do very well. Its length is perfect for the Kindle to rest on the entertainment center while connected to the TV. The full price seems a bit steep for a cable; the sale price of under nine dollars is just right for me. Since that was an Amazon Marketplace transaction, Mediabridge Products followed up via (an automated) email about how to contact support if needed, complete with a phone number and support hours. I've had no reason to call them but it's nice to have the information on hand. My order was delivered within 3 days (Amazon Prime eligible at the time), and I could not be happier with the product and service.

$review_text.: These cables really work nicely. I've had them about 2 weeks now, and my Ipod has never sounded better through my home stereo. I think the cost was nominal for Monster cables (I was expecting to pay alot more) and the length of the cable stretches across my family room with ease. Nice purchase. Very satisfied with these cables.

$review_text.: Have been using for about 6 months. Plays fine on smooth roads but a moderate road bump (PA Turnpike) makes it stop and start the dvd over from the beginning. This has happened many, many times. Also, the "lock" button on the side is right next to the power button- very easy for young fingers to hit the wrong button and render the remote useless, leading to a lot of frustration from the front seat, trying to talk them through why it's not working right.

$review_text.: I went to Best Buy with the idea, that I'd just pick up a standard wireless keyboard. My desk had been a tangle of wires and in spite of using theseVelcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long, Black, 100 Ties per Pack (91140). I already had been using a wireless Logitech mouse,Logitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Mac (910-003040)and a wireless Logitech headset,Logitech Wireless Headset h800 for PC, Tablets and Smartphones (981-000337), so why not complete the trifecta with a wireless keyboard?At Best Buy, I tried various keyboards they had on display and it so happened that this which I'm now review had the best feel. I could type fast with fewer mistakes and it was quiet relative to others which tended to have the loud, resonate "clack clack" sound. I bet that has something with the shorter travel distance on each press. Traditional keyboards going back the past two decades have the big deep keys which make you press a farther distance.But here's what made me stand there for a long time contemplating. The light powered aspect of this unit was a bonus that I had reservations about. You see, I work in a dimly lighted home office. Not pitch black. But "silent running" dim, like what you see in a submarine in battlestations mode.Still, not having another device to hassle with batteries on was a plus.Fortunately, when set the thing up, I found that all I had to do was position an LED keyboard lamp I useGoal Zero 14101 Luna USB LED Stick Lightand the Solar App that accompanies this keyboard showed that it was 100% adequate for keeping my keyboard charged.I've had this for four days and I'm very happy with it. I can type faster on than any keyboard I've used in the past (including the curved ergonomic types from Microsoft) and, without wires to deal with, I can place the keyboard on my lap and sit back in my chair typing. I'm glad I stumbled across this. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it has transformed my overall physical comfort as I work in my home office. With a wireless keyboard, you no longer have to lean forward.And it's solid and fast. What contributes to the solid feel of it is that it's probably one of the thinnest wireless keyboards around because it doesn't need to house your typically double-A batteries.The one thing I don't like: After remove the protective stick-ons, I've found it scratches very easily.

$REVIEW.: This is a great little portable stand.  It stores flat and takes up very little space.  The points of contact with the iPad (and I assume other tablets unless they are shaped funny) are rubberized, as are the "feet" to prevent slipping.  Highly recommended.As others have pointed out, the legs do not lock.  This is rarely a problem for me.  But if you want to shift the stand (as in, push it further away from you), you have to be careful or the legs will collapse.  This is much less of a problem when the stand is in its horizontal position. But if locking legs would sacrifice the handy size and weight of this stand, I can do without--but that's just me.  I'll reserve my 5-star rating for the clever designer who designs a way to lock the legs without adding size/weight.Another minor annoyance, common to all portable stands (or at least most), is that when the iPad is in "landscape" you cannot simply push the front button without knocking the iPad out of place.

$review_text.: I typically give 4 stars to good items that work as expected for the price. Everything about this works except that charger that came with it. It wont charge and feels loose in the port. It did charge one time, and after that it seems to have broken. We tried plugging it into the USB on our PC and it just reads as a mass storage device and will not charge that way. Luckily, I have a phone charger that puts out the right voltage with slightly less mA than required to charge it, so we share that. She charges it overnight, and I charge my phone during the day if needed. If it werent for that, we would have had to return it and wait - not a good thing for a Christmas gift. So we'll make do with what we have.Other than that, it works fine. Its fast enough to stream video, and she can do most of her casual games on it. She Skypes with it too, which is a big plus.Her younger nieces also have the same tablet and theirs seem to function normally, so it may have been a handling issue. As it stands, Im docking a star for the charging problem.

$review_text.: I recently ordered these speakers to replace an old pair or creatives I was using solely for computer/music use. While I probably wouldn't recommend these as surround speakers for a TV or game console(well maybe a game console), these work very well as computer speakers. These have a nice, ergonomic design and surprisingly good SQ for speakers so light.Sound quality is very good. Highs suffer a bit from the lack of a tweeter but the truth is the mid-woofer does a decent job reproducing highs. Not really a complaint if you plan to use as computer speakers. What I was really impressed with, however, was the subwoofer. For a 7 inch driver(and a ported enclosure) the sub produces very accurate bass, and with 130 watts running power it can get quite loud too. These would be more than suffice for throwing a house party as well as casual listening. I demo'd several types of music with these(dubstep, house, trance, classic rock, metalcore, death metal, jazz, alternative) and they performed well with all types. With any sort of instrumental tracks(ie rock, jazz ect) you will miss out on a bit of the high frequency action such as crash symbols, but this is a minor issue to me and I found the frequency response on these speakers to be more than adequate for the price range.Overall very nice speakers for the price point. They reproduce music very well and the subwoofer pounds for such a small driver. Highs suffer a bit from the lack of a tweeter, but, as I stated above, most wont notice unless you have owned extremely high end speakers your whole life. The one complaint I have is with the chord lengths and overall setup; Logitech could have included a little flexibility with how you can set this system up(all RCA chords are connected to speakers) but not too serious. If you need to place the sub more than 6 feet away from the speakers I would probably consider something that allows more length(and hookup options) but at this price point you will be hard pressed to find something better. Many state the 2300's are better but I completely disagree. Yes it has more bass, but the rest of the frequency range suffers greatly. Keep that in mind when comparing the two.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent Speakers for the price range!

$review_text.: I've had my 24-105L IS for about two months and have shot everything from jewelry and landscapes to portraits and a wedding reception  with it.  It has replaced my 24-70L and 28-135 IS as the lens I use for both "serious" work and walkaround duty with my full-frame DSLR. The extra focal length and IS make it more versatile than the 24-70L, and the two lenses run equal with sharpness and color response.  The IS works, and to me, more than compensates for the the 24-70L's speed.  The 24-105L has the 28-135 IS beat for sharpness and color response.  Some post-processing is sometimes called for to realize the lens's full potential, but it captures a wonderful amount of detail.  It's also much more manageable in size and weight than the 24-70L.  This is a great lens.

I put off buying a Roku device because I bought this and it including all the major streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, HuLu, and Pandora. I have used all except HuLu and I am very happy with this product. The only negative is that it can be slow once you first launch one of the internet based services, but once it is connected all is good. I am glad I did not spend extra money on a Roku, because there is no need for it if you have this.

Please note that before install you must jot down your hard drive serialnumber and call western digital in order to get your warranty on the device, there number is 1800-275-4932*****Side note******Sometimes the HD connector that connects the hard drive to the motherboard needs to be replaced.If your drive does not show up, take it to the apple store and get the HD connector replaced

$REVIEW.: The intended functions of the Pogoplug are very specific and raise the existential question: "Is this really the best way?" Personally, I think not
The two main marketing claims are:  1
 You can access the files from your main/home PC anywhere through an online interface;  2


 Centralized backup capability for all devices.The access service is free - if you supply your own external hard drive adequate for the data

 If you don't, the last time I looked Pogoplug had a cloud service charging $4.95 a month
Which is sort of pricey

 These days there are lots of means in the "cloud" to do similar things

You can keep a bodacious amount of documents and photos in Dropbox for free


 If you have an amount of music or video files that one might consider objectively indicative of OCD, the Amazon Cloud will accommodate just about as much as you care to put in it for considerably less than Pogoplug


And if you are backing up everything to an external hard drive anyway, those puppies are now so light and compact it begs the question of why you would need an online service to access the files.As far as the centralized backup capability, the main selling point seems to be the ability to park both PC and Mac-based files


But going back to the availability of cloud-based services that also accommodate multiple formats, it's not really that big a deal, unless there is a strong feeling that Pogoplug has the best, most convenient, easiest to use backup service

Peruse the reviews, I don't think you will find that to be the consensus

If you are backing up your PC/Mac data to hard drives, the fact that the backup is continuous and automatic is a common software feature


If you are using a cloud-based storage, Pogoplug will be more expensive than most folks need (since most people can find a free cloud for the limited data they have).Is a cloud-based service even the best option for you? Not if you are schlepping around a lot of music and movies you might want to see/hear in places where Internet service will be dicey and the cloud will be too cloudy
For example, an iPod with over 80 GB capacity (me, I gotta have 160 GB) allows you to hear your music during most of your flight, all of your time at an airport (without paying those snarky Internet access fees charged at most airports) and anyplace else where you are not securely enough ensconced in the grid to get reliable service.

I originally had the Seagate go flex HD media player and after my intial joy of having a device play all my files, the poorly designed media box just failed on so many levels I ended up taking it back and giving the WD a spin.The reason I didn't try it first over the Seagate was simple, the Seagate listed that it played ISO files, the  WD didn't. However, it DOES and it does so very well. Also the Seagate lists it can connect via WiFi, the WD doesn't, but it does and when you consider all the positives this is a must buy for any media hound.

$review_text.: I got my Internet Pro keyboard to go with my Celeron-based system running Windows '95

My previous keyboard was also a &quot;multimedia&quot; keyboard--a rebranded unit made by Chicony.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase
The construction is solid, the typing feel is very good, and it's quiet


I cannot put my Windows 95 system to sleep with the sleep key, although my previous keyboard allowed me to
I tested the new keyboard with a system running Win '98 and it goes to sleep when the sleep key is pressed.The IntelliKey Pro software is pretty good, especially the multimedia features

It worked flawlessly
I would like more control over user-defined keys (only three or four are programmable, depending on how you count), but this is a gripe I would levy against every custom keyboard software I've seen.The only caution I would give a potential buyer relates to the USB: This is not a keyboard that'll work on a &quot;legacy-free&quot; computer


It is a PS/2 keyboard with a USB hub, &lt;not&gt; a USB keyboard with a USB hub


Although my Windows 95 OSR 2.5 software states &quot;USB support&quot; on the CD label, the keyboard does not function with USB under Windows 95


This is not the fault of the keyboard and the software requirements on the keyboard box clearly state that Windows 98 is required for USB support
By the way, I was using a USB mouse for testing


The keyboard itself uses the PS/2 port and has an extra plug (a USB pigtail) for its built-in hub.USB suppoort under Windows 98 seemed to work OK, although I did not have time to check this out fully
I understand there are a few glitches when using this keyboard with a USB mouse that happen when waking from sleep mode.Overall, a good keyboard choice

Have reasonable expectations of USB and you'll be very satisfied.

$REVIEW.: I think the camera is an amazing buy for the money. I was able to unpack the contents & begin shooting good pictures IMMEDIATELY, using the fully automatic settings & the included partially charged battery.  You will however, need to supply an SD Card as this is not included, not even a small one.The menu was a LITTLE confusing at first, but I quickly got the gist of things and am taking good pictures with the camera.  Having used the full-auto settings and just dabbling with the advanced settings, I'm very pleased with the purchase and I think anyone who is either new to DSLR cameras or who doesn't want to spend over $1000 for a 'pro' or 'prosumer' DSLR will also be very happy with it right out of the box... or ANY of the T series cameras for that matter.If you're going to be shooting in RAW (or like I do in RAW+L) I recommend getting AT LEAST a 16GB card, if not a 32GB card.  The included battery is a champ.  It lasts a good long time & charges quickly.  I was going to get a 2nd battery, but I don't think it's necessary at this time as it lasts for several hundred shots.  The manual says it takes 2 hrs to charge a fully depleted battery, but the math doesn't work out that way.  The included charger is portable & charges the included 860mAh Li-Ion battey at a 580mAh rate, so a full charge should be about 1.5hrs.  I'll have to time it when I need a full charge & have the spare time to check it every 10 mins or so beyond the 1hr mark.Only a few negatives:* When using the fully automatic settings indoors the white balance is just a little off, but this is fairly common w/all brands in the entry-level range.  It can easily be corrected in photoshop, or by manually choosing one of the white balance lighting scenarios (incandescent bulb, fluorescent, or sun) depending on your situation.  My outdoor shots look great on full auto settings.* Having not used an SLR type camera in a NUMBER of years (I've never owned a DSLR), I found that the manual it comes with is not very thorough, and neither is the larger PDF manual on the included CD.  However; it's not Canon's job to teach you photography and therefore I think the manual is just adequate.  The only real trouble I had was trying to figure out how to attach the included eyepiece cover when shooting on a tripod w/studio lighting using auto exposure settings... it's not explained anywhere.  You need to slide off the cover that is there already (the eye cushion) and slide on the cover... duh!  Cripes O Mighty!  They explain how to attach the camera strap (like you really need to read that...), but not the eyepiece cover?!  Those experienced with SLR photography don't need any more, those totally new are covered by both the instuctions & the quick-start guide; but, those in-between won't find the info they're looking for here... get this book:Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))* There is no memory card included.  Even a tiny one would be appreciated for the completely new user to start shooting right away when buying the 'kit' version.  It may be the 1st D-SLR for the majority of it's purchasers, but it's probably not anyone's 1st digital camera in general.. so you probably have one of these lying around already.* A textured grip would be nice, but like the exclusion of a memory card, this is helping to keep the price down on this puppy.In summary:Is it a good camera for the $$:  Yes, 4/5*Is it a good camera in general:  Yes, 4/5 (auto white balance could be better, textured grip would be nice)Is the 'kit' worthwhile:  Yes, 4/5 (including even a tiny SD Card would be nice for the camera newbie)Good instructions:  Barely, 3/5Would I buy it again: YES(1)Recommend to a friend:  YES(1)Overall rating:  4/5* Revised due to recent price drop on T4i, see 4/6/2013 update at the bottom(1) If you can't afford the T4i**-- Update - 6/1/2012 --**Took it to Jones Beach last weekend, for the Memorial Day airshow.  After walking around to find some other Canon users, I learned how to use some of the manual settings in order to get shots of the fast-moving airplanes & jets flying around.  I didn't need help in so much as how to change the settings on the camera... but more what settings I would need to be using.Anyway... I got some GREAT shots!  The only issue I had was my telephoto lens didn't have IS, so I had a very fast shutter speed manually entered to make up for any hand shaking.  The result is that while the jet shots look great, I have stationary propellers on the older aircraft.  That's not the fault of the camera, but of my inexpensive EF 75-300mm non-IS lens.  Now if only someone can teach me how to use photoshop effectively :)Here are just a couple of shots from that airshow:  [...]**-- UPDATE 4/6/2013 --**OK, so I've had this camera for nearly 2 years now, and I'm still very happy with it.  However; the T4i has come down quite a bit in price due to the announcement that it's being replaced by the T5i.  Excellent timing for those of you looking to purchase a DSLR!!  If you can spend a little more, I'd recommend the T4i over the T3 by a wide margin.  Otherwise, T3 is still the way to go.Here's why:1. It's got the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor (Every other Rebel has DIGIC 4) - This is quite an improvement, especially with white balance.2. More ISO options - in combo w/the new DIGIC 5, this is a pretty big deal3. It's faster...  can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously - That's a big deal if you shoot sports/action/aviation.4. You get 18MP - That's fairly significant.5. In-camera HDR Combines multiple exposures - You probably will want this feature, even if it doesn't interest you right now.6. That little 'i' lets you use a wireless remote shutter release - may be significant, depends on what YOU need.7. Slightly larger LCD (3" vs 2.7") that flips out - significant.8. Touch screen - Mostly Bells & Whistles here, but reviews state it's very functional & intuitive.To sum this all up, with the T4i you'd gain: better images/video, high ISO performance, touchscreen, less shutter lag, and a few other things. This camera offers many new technologies and additions from Canon that aren't seen on any other camera in their line up (including much pricier cameras like the 60D). If you're wondering about the upcoming T5i... it's the T4i with a new body sculpt, real-time preview of Creative Filters in Live View mode, and a redesigned new mode dial that turns 360 degrees... that's IT!!  Same image quality & Features as the discontinued T4i!! By the way, the T4i (and upcoming T5i) outperform the much pricier 60D in terms of image quality (seriously, it does... 60D is getting long in the tooth now). The 60D's advantage is that it is weather sealed and has controls laid out more like a pro body (it has a rear dial just like the 7D, 5D, 1D bodies.) It was a clear upgrade over anything in the Rebel line until the T4i was introduced.Regards,Bill

$review_text.: Defender AL101The Defender AL101 system is composed of up to 3 transmitter/sensors, and 1 receiver unit. The transmitter/sensors are water resistant units that are affixed to a wall/post using a clip with 3 self-tapping drywall screws. The water resistant units really just depend on some rubber seals/o-rings, I would not recommend put it in a place that might see a lot of rain or moisture, the manufacturer recommends placing it under an awning or cover.The range is advertised at 15 ft for low sensitivity and 30 ft for high sensitivity. The sensor cone is 30 degrees, and I found that its sensitivity was dependent on how fast the object moved. I creeped an object slowly across the sensor's field of view and it didn't trip it until it got right in the center of its path.Once tripped, the receiver will sound an audible alarm which is nothing more than a series of beeps from the receiver. The volume adjustment is very unlinear. At the lowest setting, nothing comes out of the speaker. Just a tiny bit more, and the volume is at a comfortable level. A little more and it starts to get ear piercing.Here are my gripes. The receiver is nothing more than a small box with a big power button in the center, and it just beeps when one of the sensors is tripped. You don't know which "zone" until you find the receiver and look at it. There is no shut-off timer or programmability to provide you with automated activation of sensors at certain times. If I put the sensor in the front of the house, it will go off when I walk or drive around my property. I'd prefer to activate it when I go to sleep since no one I know will be walking around the outside of the property. So with this current receiver, I have to remember to turn it on or off.The sensors rely on four AA batteries and is advertised to have a 6 month operating life with an average of 10 alarm trips a day. You can swap these alkaline batteries for NiMH but that means recharging them every few months. The receiver has a 9V AC adapter option or takes four AA batteries.As a full-time home security device, the Defender falls just a bit short with the lack of programmability. It might work well as a garage sensor to see if anyone is leaving/entering your garage or perhaps as a rudimentary sensor to tell if you're coming too close to the wall when parking it in a garage.The range between the sensor and receiver is fairly long, which is a good thing but I'd prefer some programmability to turn them off or on at preset times.Pros: Very simple, easy to useCons: Very simple deviceOverall: 3/5 stars

$REVIEW.: I have a problem with headphones.  See, I like to listen to my iPod in bed, and I tend to fall asleep with my headphones in. As a result, I often wake up to sound coming out of only one side, and a set of headphones that don't work anymore. So for the most part, I buy cheap headphones - if they last longer than a year, I'm happy, and if they don't, I'm not out much money.Up until now, I didn't know what I was missing.  $15 headphones did the job, and didn't make me cry when I broke them.  NOW, with these Moshi headphones, I know what I've been missing with my cheapos.  Clear high end, great bass -- clear sound all the way around.  I can't compare these to really expensive headphones, but compared to what I normally get, these are outstanding.I'm keeping the cheapos around for bed, though.  I don't want these broken!!

$REVIEW.: My choice was paying off government-bonded student loans, buying this television, or paying for my uninsured mom's dialysis treatment.  Making easy choices like that are the reason I went to college in the first place!  None of my frat-buddies are paying off their loans, either.  And even-though my dead-beat mom co-signed mine, the banks can't chase her because she's broke from medical bills.  The hospitals can't refuse her, either.  So everybody wins!  Am I right?  This is why it's a 'smart' TV, because if you're smart enough to avoid your other bills, you can buy it!

$review_text.: I like this docking station and media player

 I like the fact that not only can I doc my iPod or iPhone 4 on it, but I can grab an Internet radio station too


 I do not really think of this as an option to look at slide shows and when I plugged in my iPod Nano to view videos I had created, this was not an option

 I promise to test a little more on the video and photo viewing function and update my review accordingly.Pros:- nice looking- durable- decent sound quality (it's not a Bose, but you aren't paying for Bose either)- Internet radio capableCons:- very basic remote control that does very little to get through menus, settings, etc.- touch screen takes some calibration which helps

 If scrolling through pages of songs, albums etc, there are no scroll bars, status indicators and for my songs, I was left swiping through 102 pages to find a song I wanted.- no search capabilityThere are some tweaks that need to be done to the firmware of this unit and some updates to the remote that will allow it to be as versatile as it is truly meant to be


 If this is a first generation, I am sure that the manufacturer can take human factors suggestions into account.I would suggest a more intuitive and responsive touch screen as well as a remote that truly reflects it's functionality


 Example:  There is no way to get to the Internet Radio from the remote


 There is also no way to get deeper into functions (like the picking the "music" selection versus "video") on the iPod
 Simple toggles between icons should be a given ..
and this is lacking.I will keep my eye open for firmware upgrades from the company and hope that they can resolve some simple toggle issue that make the remote only half worth it

 For most things, you have to have the unit at hand to touch and manipulate.The sound for the price is reasonable but I think the product has some growing to do
 Great potential though

 Durable and aesthetically pleasing
 A well made unit.For the meantime, 3 stars but with growth ..

I think it can work it's way up to 5


 It has all the fixings for it!

Fortunately, I went to the Seagate site and looked in the knowledge base, where I learned that these drives ship preformatted as NTFS drives for Windows, which Macs can read but cannot write to. It was a simple matter of using my Mac's Disk Utility to reformat the drive as ExFAT, and it took a surprisingly short amount of time to do it for such a large drive.Now I have an external backup drive that I can use on both our Windows and Mac computers. I am happy with it.

 TheAerb Portable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboardis a great tool for a traveler especially those who use devices with no physical keyboard present that like the feel of real keys.This keyboard/mouse pad combo offer lots of great options for android and PC users


 I tested this unit with my Nexus 7 with great results


 In terms of size, the keyboard is about equal in size to most slide out keyboards on certain smartphones

 Apple, Android, and Windows; all the buttons you need to get the most out of the keyboard are right there
 This keyboard has an internal rechargeable battery and is recharged with the include USB cable.The keyboard/mouse combo really help keep things packed tightly on the go
 The unit is compact and easy to store for travel


 It turns on easy with the slide switch up top and pairs just like any other typical Bluetooth device


 This product features a back-lit keyboard, making it awesome for a dark ride on the train or a dark plane; it's also perfect for overhead presentation when you may have the lights in the conference room off

 I used this keyboard for a presentation I had last week and found it overly useful and much more versatile than a typical slide clicking remote.Overall, theAerb Portable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboardis a good buy considering price and function


 Though made of plastic, the unit is durable and works really great

 It appears there are several varieties available on this product page so you can choose color and design you most like

 For the frequent traveler and presenters, this is a fantastic product and thoroughly recommended.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review

$review_text.: Since I have the Gitzo GT3541XLS Series 3 Long 6X Carbon Fiber 4-Section Systematic Tripod with G-Lock and the reviews for this bag are good I figured it would be a good idea to go with a Gitzo bag as well and was not disappointed.  The material used in the construction of this bag is very heavy duty and rainproof. The internal padding is very firm and thick so you know your expensive tripod/head is going to be well protected.  The only weak point is there is less padding at either end so if you drop your bag on the wrong end, where the ballhead is, then there could be some problems.  Another nifty feature is that the zipper opens from end to end so it's easy to get the tripod in and out of the bag.  One end also has a handle as an alternative to the shoulder strap for several carrying options.  The shoulder strap is also padded for extra comfort.  One detail worth mentioning is that if you use the Gitzo GT3541XL in combination with the ARCA-SWISS Monoball Z1 DP Double Pan with Quick Set Device "Flip-Lock" it is going to be an *exact* fit, basically fits like a glove!  There is no room to spare from end to end and if leaving the legs even slightly extended the tripod will not go back into the bag.Gitzo GC3100 Series 3 Tripod Bag 38.2 x 7.9 - Inch.Edit: I had to update the rating of this bag because as specifically pointed out in the original review, this bag's Achilles' heel are both ends where the padding/protection is inferior to the center.  Ironically, the very next day that the review was written, the Gitzo tripod/Arca-Swiss ballhead combination took a tumble from the truck and landed right on the head.  All in all a very expensive learning experience.

$review_text.: If you are looking for a easy and cheap way to stream TVB content, this device will work for you
Although it will take some time to find the app on the web that you will need to load on the device
Once you have it setup, you will be able to see TVB episodes pretty much a few days behind the actual release of the show


The best part is that because the shows are queued, you can watch them when you want to like a DVR


So far, we have had about one year of service, and no cutouts

You will need a high speed internet line though, with a recommended 6MB of download, and a good wifi signal through the area you are placing the receiver
You will need to purchase a device such as "Cisco-Linksys WET610N Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapter" if you want to connect it through wifi

As others have said though, the navigation on the device can take about 10 seconds to change each time, but it is well worth the savings that you will see.

$review_text.: Love this finder.  The gradual change in screens from shallow to deep is really neat.  Often on my Eagle it would lose the bottom at this point and I would have to pull the power cord out and reinsert it to get back in business.  Also I can go top speed (27 mph in my boat) and never lose the bottom signal.

It goes on easy and I hope the elastic can stand the test of time. Looking forward to letting you all know how it holds up because you do have to take it on and off to put the flash in your camera bag. So lets see how good it holds up.

$REVIEW.: The Sony SA-W2500 is an excellent value for the money


One of it's best features is it's control panel

It has variable controls for both volume and cross over frequency, an on/off switch, auto standby switch, phase switch, line in, and L&R; speaker in and out
I connected mine to my Sony STR-D915 receiver via it's "B" speaker out as my receiver does not have a line out sub-woofer port.I listen to mostly classical, big band, and 50's era rock and roll


When playing music in a 5.1 Pro-Logic configuration it has a tendancy to be a bit "BOOMY", but with both a volume and cross over control that's easy to adjust

And different CD's require different settings, my version of the 1812 overature sounds great at a fairly high volume and cross over setting but other CD's "BOOM" at that level.The auto standby feature sometimes turns it off mid-track if thier is no low base detected for a minute or two, and it's also a bit slow to come back on.All things considered, I like my SA-W2500 well enough to buy two more as birthday presents, one for my son and one for a friend of mine.DonS.2/11/11

I did have a problem with my keyboard not working

It only worked if I plugged the keyboard into the pass through usb ports on the kvm

My mouse did work in the kvm's mouse port


I fixed the keyboard by plugging it back into the keyboard port on the kvm and then ...1
Disable `mouse emulation' in the KVM (invoke Hotkey Setting Mode by pressing and holding CTRL, then pressing and releasing F12, then releasing CRTL) then press the `m' key.2


Disable `keyboard emulation' in the KVM (invoke Hotkey Setting Mode by pressing and holding CTRL, then pressing and releasing F12, then releasing CRTL) then press the `[F10]' key.3
Reset `Keyboard and Mouse' in the KVM (invoke Hotkey Setting Mode by pressing and holding CTRL, then pressing and releasing F12, then releasing CRTL) then press the `[F1]' key.I am using Debian Linux I have not tried my Windows laptop yet.I pulled these key combos from other peoples posts, but this is what worked for me


I knocked a star off for the keyboard issue I ran into at first

I am not using a wireless keyboard or mouse just a standard older Dell usb keyboard and mouse

I am not sure why this would not just work out of the box
I could see having issues if I was using some wireless keyboard and mouse, but my setup has a standard mouse and keyboard


I had to knock off a star for the issue and the terrible instruction manual.FYI..

In order to use the keyboard combos above the keyboard MUST be plugged into the keyboard port on the kvm
It does not work from the pass through usb ports.

$review_text.: I asked my wife what Kindle Fire Cover she wanted for her little gadget and this is the one she picked out. She loves the faux croc style and the shiny red colour. When it arrived she described the thing as both "gorgeous" and "sexy." I never thought of a Kindle Fire cover as sexy, but what do I know? It is stunning to look at and the texture is really interesting. It's sleek and fun to hold. It's very striking and people notice and comment on the design instantly.It's not just nice to look at though. The cover is very sturdy, takes a licking (my wife drops things regularly) and has held up extremely well so far. There's also an inner pouch to hold things, like a credit card and driver's license. I personally prefer theVerso Artist Series Case Cover for Kindle Fire, Cities, Red, but this would definitely be my second favorite. It's tops with my wife though and I'm glad she loves this cover. It's as well made as it is gorgeous and that's what matters most.

$review_text.: Apparently there was some sort of mix up where clear film was labeled as anti-glare and vice versa

I eventually got the correct version but in both case the packaging looked nothing like what is shown in the picture


Some generic screen protector packaging (nothing about the packaging was in any way similar aside from the size) with a small white label on the outside of the cellophane with the text "ionic screen protector" on it

I don't like ordering something online only to have a completely different looking product arrive


With that said, the screen protector fit but they're junk

I have been using screen protectors like this for year so it's not as though I am new to application but the bubbles in this thing are horrible (I would love to see pics from the previous posters who achieved application with no bubbles because I ran through a whole pack and everyone had bubbles just as bad as the one before it


I plan on looking at the iBison (or something like that?) version where it only sticks on the edges
I use the mophie MacBook pro version for my laptop and love it.

$review_text.: Most products I buy in this category try to inflict as much 'buyers remorse' on their customers as possible.  I purchased a netgear router, it was a horrible piece of junk.  I purchased this router to replace it.It has good connectivity, none of my devices have had any issues connecting to it.  My playstation had a terrible time connecting to the netgear router.I has good features, I use some of the more advanced features of routers like static dhcp, port forward, etc.  I found this covered all my needs an then some.  I should take a little time and explore a little more.Also for the brave at heart (not me, at least not now) there is an online community that builds firmware for this device.  That means that you could install custom firmware to make the device do even more advanced things.More importantly if a company opens its device up to custom firmware you know they are confident with their product.  If they were not confident with their product they will not be comfortable with random strangers looking at their dirty laundry.Top notch product.

$review_text.: GREAT low-cost camera .. not an Amazon buy (from an egg-cellent CA company :  .. Bit over $100 ..free: shipping, 2GB SD card and soft case. I've owned it a bit over 6 months. I'm an experienced photographer, but never owned a digital camera before.Perfect? No, for $450-800 get a better one ;) Others in $100 range may be competitive.. I can't say. It compares very favorably to ones my kids have owned that cost much more. This camera was released ~2 yrs ago.Strong Points:1. It works fine as a "point and shoot" in most normal situations.. so you don't HAVE to fiddle with a lot of techy details (BUT it has extensive "manual" capabilities and many MODES such as backlight etc)2. Superb resolution (approximately 2x HD).. Should easily do an 8x10 photo. Some claim it is "poor" in some situations.. this is a misapplication.. usually in low light where they expect the "anti-shake" to function as a tripod.. sorry but cameras don't work like that.3. It is EXTREMELY compact.. cigarette pack size and under 5 oz weight. It seems to be well built too.. I haven't babied it. I'm sure water and sand would do it in though4. Also does decent video (up to 640x480 resolution), and will work perfectly well in an "average" lighted room.. good for casual filming and "youtube" etc.5. It has 5x OPTICAL zoom (to 10x digital zoom) .. this is excellent for a unit that doesn't have a "snout type" camera lens that sticks out. Optical beats digital a lot. (Zoom appoximates a 35mm with 36-180mm)6. The LCD seems decently sized and bright to me.. and I don't have very good eyes.. :) It cannot be "reversed" to see yourself while taking your own pic.7. Works very well as a "copy camera" mounted on a lighted stand to copy documents or family albums, etc.. it has a very nice MACRO focus ability and a "text" exposure mode. It should be great for making shots for ebay etc too.8. It has EXTENSIVE manual over-ride and settings options.. In order to use these well you MUST be familiar with the camera and its use (from practice and the manual.. which contrary to others I find competent and pretty thorough .. it isn't a tutorial though)9. It comes with a cord to attach to a VCR (or computer card) and actually makes an ok video camera, though not portable in this mode.. and the viewfinder doesn't power up when you have an external device attached.This is a "makeshift" mode and I'd not suggest it for normal use unless you get the "ac adapter" for it (IMO bit expensive for a $100 camera) It WILL NOT work on USB power.10. I had no problems transfering pics from the camera to my pc. It can be done by either using the included USB cable or by taking the SD card out and plugging it into a reader on your pc. I've done both and had no problems. It "just happened"..I didn't have to do anything to make it work11. It makes decent "action shots" too in decent lighting (auto racing etc) with shutter speeds up to 1/1000 sec and down to 4 sec. It doesn't have a "bulb" setting that I am aware of.12. It has many "best of" scenrios ..1 flash, 1 not: you pick best.. several shots in a row, save last 3: .. "fast shot" sequences.. etc.. I'm sure something to suit your fancy is here13. The non-extending lens make this both higher in reliability and more sleek.. but also gives it the higher f-stop restrictions.It does have some negatives (not really "failings" .. just things that are worthy of note)1. The lens is in the spot where your left hand normally goes and it takes awareness to keep your finger off the lens since it doesn't "stick out".. you would see this onscreen unless you're shooting "blind" like over your head.. I found it pretty easy to adjust.2. This is NOT a "see in the dark" camera.. I say this not because it suffers in low light (it has up to 1600 ASA which is VERY respectable, but the f3.8 lens is the issue). Low light suggests tripods and timed exposures and people don't typically do that with a "point and shoot".. I have used it on a tripod and it works well. I have taken acceptable shots by candlelight if the subject is near the candle.. such as a birthday cake. It is an f3.8 lens.. expensive cameras will be f2.8 or even lower.IF lower light conditions are IMPORTANT to you, I'd suggestGE-E1235 12MP Digital Camera with 3X Optical Zoom (Black)or the slightly olderGE E1050TW-BK 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Black). They're almost double the price and suffer the "innie/outtie snout lens" which I don't much like, but much better for lowlight with lenses around f2.4.3. The software suite that it comes with (for using on your pc) is only ok.. to do any real custom work you will need to buy software, which you likely have anyways if you are doing this kind of work. For color balance, cropping, making slide shows, etc its fine. Picassa is a decent free option.4. The battery is ok, but if you're going to use it for extended video you better get a second one so you can switch out if you need to. I've never had it stop on me, but I am aware of its limits.. In still mode it shouldn't be a problem. It recharges rather quickly.. 2 hours?.. I've not timed it. Careful shopping will yield an equivalent battery or better (ie:2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A) for a very reasonably price.5. You can put a TON of stuff on even a small SD card.. but the memory it comes with would probably not make most people happy for anything other than around the home where you can dump shots to your pc now and then. SD cards are CHEAP now.. buy one no matter what camera you get!6. There is no way at all to manually focus this unit.. It is true that a wide angle lens makes this less obvious. No matter how good it's auto-focus is even with the "depress button pre-focus", many times it just doesn't cut it.. especially if shooting through glass or using the macro capability, etc. Many shots if examined closely just don't have that "razor sharp" focus I love. I have no idea how it determines focus... it may be sound or some digital process of "edges"Another "observation".. neither bad nor good.. it took me a bit of study to figure out how to use the "screen menus" to see and sort and change your pics in the camera, but my daughter picked it up and immediately worked it in detail..I'm guessing its pretty standard for digital cameras.. as I said its my first.My only two real criticisms of this unit are the high f-stop rating (the higher the "f" rating on a lens, the less light it lets in making for poorer "low light" performance) and no ability to manually focus it.In summary.. FOR AVERAGE TO BETTER LIGHTING conditions and MANY 'point and shoot' applications, you can't do better. Plus, its such a feeling of FREEDOM to not have to fool with film and developers!! Excercise that freedom.. USE IT! PLAY WITH IT!! LEARN! :) It is capable, inexpensive, and flexible. It isn't a $600 camera for $100 but its a keeper. Buy it.

$REVIEW.: This is a very small, cool-looking, and well-built portable hard drive. It is probably the smallest external hard drive that I&#8217;ve come across. In terms of performance, though, it lacks nothing compared to many of its much bigger alternatives. Here are some of my impressions.**** Software ****I have mixed feelings about the included software. In general I don&#8217;t use any of the software that comes with the hard drives that I buy. I prefer to use a variety of software suits that I&#8217;ve come to know and trust over the years. However, for the sake of this review I decided to give the Seagate&#8217;s Backup Plus a try. The results have, at best been mixed.The two features that I really liked, and was able to use both on my Windows PC as well as on my Mac, are the mobile backup and the social media backup. The latter in particular came in really handy. Over the years I&#8217;ve posted tons of pictures on Facebook, and even though I have all of them locally saved, they are not easily accessible, especially in the form of online albums in which I had organized them. Logging into my Facebook account was really straightforward, and after about an hour or so all of my pics were backed up locally, each in a folder corresponding to its Facebook album.The mobile backup was also pretty good. I was able to install the Seagate iOS app without any issues, it was easy to find my network and recognize the hard rive on it, and before I knew it all of my photos and videos were backed up. I don&#8217;t have too much of a need for this feature, since I regularly sync all of my iPhone files anyways, as well as upload the photos and videos to Picasa when I connect it to my computer. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s nice to know that I now have another option for that backup.When it comes to computer backup the software performed great on my Windows machine. However, it doesn&#8217;t seem to have the option for Mac backup (or at least I didn&#8217;t see one). Furthermore, the hard drive would not even allow you to transfer the files to it natively from your Mac without installing a piece of included software. Since I was primarily intending to use this hard drive to backup my Mac computer, this was a major annoyance. In the end I had to reformat the whole hard drive and use the Time Machine for Mac backup.Another annoyance about the included software is that it requires a detailed registration process. I am getting increasingly weary of all sorts of companies acquiring my personal info. In some cases this might be necessary, but I don&#8217;t see any need for it with software that comes bundled with the hardware that you already bought.**** Design and Build ****As already mentioned, this is the smallest external hard drive that I&#8217;ve come across. It&#8217;s as small as a 2.5&#8221; could possibly be. The metallic enclosure looks very well built and extremely durable. This looks and feels like a very high quality, reliable product.**** Performance ****This is a USB 3.0 connected hard drive, and it really shows. Transferring large, multi-gig files was a breeze. I did not actually bother to time the performance, but it was quite noticeably faster than what I had come to expect from my old legacy 2.0 USB drives. It took a while for it to backup all of my files (several hundred GB worth) from my old Mac, but that probably had to do more with its aging hardware than the intrinsic limitations of either this hard drive or the USB 3 connection.**** Conclusion ****This is an extremely well built and high performance small external hard drive. The software is worthwhile if you are a Windows user, but for those of us with Macs its more or less irrelevant. Nonetheless, I&#8217;ve been very happy with it thus far.

$REVIEW.: I am using this sleeve to protect a new 15.6" HP laptop I got a couple of weeks ago.  The laptop is mostly going to be used at home, not moved around much for work or traveling... that will be exceedingly rare, so I think the facts that it is "just" a thin neoprene sleeve and it is too big height wise for the computer is OK.  The intent for me was to have something simple, pretty, and effective to keep it together with another item, a Logitech lapdeskLogitech Portable Lapdesk N315, and, protected from pets, spills, etc. when not in use.  It actually is pretty snug width wise and now the height issue doesn't matter because the Logitech lapdesk is very thin and fits in the sleeve with the laptop no problem.  It just makes the sleeve fit more snugly, which is an improvement over just having the laptop in the sleeve.

$review_text.: I purchased this for my MS Surface 2 and it fits perfectly fine
 The case, overall, is adorable!  I love the design very much


 The bonus accessories are of average quality, but a nice addition to the sleeve itself
 The inside of the sleeve is a faux fur-type of lining, which is nice since I know it won't scratch my screen

The sleeve isn't bulky or anything, so that's nice, and it's pretty lightweight, so it won't get heavy to carry in my handbag or anything.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the smell on the inside of the sleeve is terrible!  It is a heavy chemical smell that is very overwhelming

 I left the case open and put a toilet paper roll inside to prop it open to air it out and it still smells, after almost two weeks, though not as strongly
 I put a couple fabric softener sheets inside to help and it still didn't go away completely, so I purchased an Arm & Hammer fridge and freezer odor eliminator thing to put in it for a few days to, hopefully, absorb the bad odor


 As it is now, even though it isn't nearly as bad as when I first got it, I do not want to put my Surface inside

 Once the smell is gone, I will use it all the time.

I was actually surprised at the quality. She wanted a video camera and we were looking to buy one that wasn't a cheap piece of garbage, but also didn't break the bank. We got more than we bargained for. Sometimes WE take it when our larger model is too much to carry! If you're looking for a compact, quality video camera that is inexpensive and takes great video, this one is for you.

$review_text.: When I upgraded my computer to the Core i7, which requires DDR3 RAMs I had to upgrade the memories too alone with a new compatible motherboard. I end up choosing this PC3-10666 1333MHz DDR3 Memory Kit. I've ordered the first set and then two weeks later, I've decided the computer may perform better with double the memory. I went ahead and ordered a second set which was $16 cheaper. It's relatively inexpensive considering having a total of 16 GB. These relatively cool running memory sticks works extremely well with my new system. In conjunction with my new processor. DDR2 and DDR3 has the same dimension slot with 240 pins but aren't compatible with each other and therefore purposely made with a different position blocking cut-out to prevent insertion on the non-compatible system. DDR3 has a lower voltage requirements then DDR2 and therefore consume less electricity. These memory modules requires only 1 1/2 volts to operate.I have no problems with both sets and are extremely happy with these memory sticks. I highly recommend this product to anyone.

They don't have noise reduction but the earpieces do a great job of keeping outside noises to a minimum and therefore acting like a noise reduction feature. They exhibit great bass ability and the mids and highs are extremely clear. You'll hear details that you were never able to hear before when watching movies.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item, as well at two additional units, for my house and am very satisfied with them.  I have two units in the lower level and two upstairs and they all work very well.  You may have some interferance if the units are too close to other electrical components, but you don't have to move them very far away to eliminate it.  For example, the unit next to my computer was also very close to my computer light.  I only had to move it a couple of feet away from the lamp and all interference stopped. The two units with the most distance separation are about 100 feet apart and on separate levels of the house with plenty of walls and flooring between them.  They still work perfectly well with each other.  Overall this has been a good purchase decision.

$review_text.: One of the few times I did not read all the customer reviews like I usually do. The device I received was locked. Apparently if the model number has a '-R' at the end, instead of a '-NA', it is locked. As a locked unit, you can not configure it via the web interface, unless you use the internal network port. Even then, there is an admin password that is not known. And because there is an admin password, that is unknown, this device can not be configured from the phone interface either. Alas, I did a complete factory reset, but the admin password was still in place. And even after the reset, the phone interface did not work, as it kept asking for the admin password.I contacted the seller who said &#34;we are very sorry for this inconvenience, we can not help you with this since we dont have the code for this&#34;.What ever that meant, however, he did offer to refund my money and let me keep the device, but I have no need for a brick.

$review_text.: I bought this MB recently. Shipping time & packaging was great but the MB is a nightmare. After insalling it it recognized most of my componenets with no problem except 1 of my graphics cards. I am running 2 identicle graphics cards but the system was only showing 1 of them. Turns out 1 of the PCIE slots is not working. Both my cards are good as they both work ok in the working PCIE slot that is funtional. The bad one has a red light light on it on the MB by that slot.Also after running a few minutes or after any attempts to update windows on a clean install or most any other system drivers I kept getting the wonderful BSOD. I have contacted Amazon to return it & they are fully refunding me for the board because they don't have any more. So I now have to reorder from someone else at a higher price. I am not a happy camper on either case at hand. I have another board on order & will update after I recieve that board if its shipped & recieved with no problems. Was really looking forward to runing my new system with this board & my new AMD 8350 CPU. I just hope this board hasn't messed up or damamged any of my other components. Amazon has been accomodating however in my major disappointment as to refunding me for the purchase. Kudos for that.*****************************************************Update to my previous review above.  3/1/14I have received my new board I ordered not a replacement from Amazon or Asus since Amazon accepted my defective board back with a full refund. My new board had me sweating bullets after the installation as the system at first booted up fine. Then after running a short time started running unstable. Periodic crashes, freezes, etc. All the components seemed to be fine at the time. As all are brand new with the exception of my Graphics cards. They are not even a yr old yet but still the only thing not brand new to my build. The more I ran the system the more unstable it seemed to get & I was ripping my hair out trying to figure out what was wrong. Started running system tests on everything I could think of & as it turned out it was bad Ram sticks I had purchased causing the problems. I had just bought brand new GSKILL ram for my new system build so had no idea the ram was or would be defective but it was. After running windows memory tests on full test sequence not just the basic test it determined the ram was defective. I removed the new ram & installed some older slower Corsair Ram I had in my previous build & my system issues stopped completely. I have returned my GSKILL ram to the manufacturer & have gotten replacement sticks to put in my system. With the good ram my system is completely stable atm running flawlessly. Here is my new system build info:MSI Computer Corp. ATX Mid Tower Chassis with USB3.0 x1 Front/USB2.0 x2 Front/3.5-Inch Drive Bay x6/5.25-Inch Drive Bay x3, Black (Raptor); PC Power and Cooling Silencer Mk II 950W High Performance 80PLUS Silver SLI CrossFire ready Power Supply compatible with Intel Sandy Bridge Core i3 i5; Dual ASUS GeForce GTX 550 Ti 1GB192-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support Video Card ENGTX550 TI DC TOP/DI/1GD5 run in SLI, The CPU AMD FX-8350 FX-Series Eight-Core Processor Edition, Black AM3+ FD8350FRHKBOX with a Cooler Master Seidon 120M Liquid CPU Water Cooling System with Copper Heatsink and 120mm Radiator - 1 Fan, all installed on this ASUS SABERTOOTH 990FX R2.0 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard run with G.SKILL Sniper Gaming Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin SDRAM DDR3 1866 PC3 14900 Desktop Memory F3-1866C10D-16GSR, a Samsung Electronics 840 Pro Series 2.5-Inch 256 GB SATA 6GB/s Solid State Drive MZ-7PD256BW as my main drive; & for storage a WD- Black 1.5 TB HDD; & a Segate 500GB HDD; LG DVD burner, & LG Blu-Ray Burner on a 27" HD Sansung monitor & Bose Companion II speaker system. I have not had a chance to install my new replacement G-Skill ram yet but hopefully I have a good working set of ram now. So far I am happy with the new Motherboard & its performance. At this time due to RL situations I haven't had much time to work with my new system since the MB replacement but I'm looking forward to many yrs of great performance, gaming & computing. If any issues arise with this motherboard I will update my post to inform everyone interested. This seems to be a great board when you can find & get a good woring one. As we all know with all electronics there are going to be some bad ones that get out with the good product line so there are going to be defects in the stores from time to time. That is inevitable. Its just a matter of the companies QC practices & how stringent they are with the practices they have implimented. Reviews are hard to base a judgement on too as you never know the knowledge lvl of the user / reviewer but I will say even though I'm not a professional certified technitian I have been building & working on computers for over 20 yrs & feel I am pretty knowledgable & proficient. I do build, & repair my own systems & have done so for family & friends for the same amount of time. I try to be honest & bias in my reviews & base them on actual product descriptions & quality not on my frustration with a instance or emotional dealings with a person or company unless it pertains to the product & issue resolutions if an issue of problems or defects arise.

$review_text.: I&#8217;ve been looking for a new backpack for the past couple of months and when I had the opportunity to try the FIVE STAR ERGO SIDEKICK BACKPACK I decided to examine it
 This backpack is designed so that you can transport a laptop if you would like


Currently, I don&#8217;t have a laptop computer

However, I have used this backpack to carry around a portable DVD player and it did a good job at protecting it
The shoulders feel soft and provide a great deal of comfort even when transporting a portable DVD player, some DVDs, several books, notebooks, pens, a banana, a sandwich, and a water bottle


I can&#8217;t vouch for the long term durability of the backpack as I&#8217;ve only had it a couple of weeks
However, it seems to be made from relatively durable materials and has held up well during the excursions I have used it so far

I also really like the colors: the backpack is mostly black, but is highlighted by a bright color of blue on the sides and down the middle
Overall, so far, I have found FIVE STAR ERGO SIDEKICK BACKPACK to be a lightweight, but durable backpack that has met my immediate needs.

$review_text.: The HDR-CX550V is a useful improvement with a significantly wider angle lens than the previous 500/520 version from 2009. It is as if you put a 0.7x wide adaptor on the lens of the earlier version, which is a very welcome feature.  The zoom is now 10x instead of 12x, but for indoor use I had little use for the long end of the zoom. (However, people shooting wildlife may want a tele-adaptor.)If you record outdoors with the sun in or near the frame edge, and you are at full-wide or within 5% of the zoom range of full wide, you may observe a surprisingly bright, sharp "blue dot" (search YouTube for examples) which is unlike the typical and expected circular or iris-shaped lens flares I've seen in 12 years of serious amateur photo/video, and 4 years of professional video and photography work. Some users cannot reproduce the phenomenon. Individual users may or may not find this a concern; check the examples online to see if it bothers you.  I would expect the appropriate sized lens hood to prevent the problem if the sun or light is far enough out of the frame, although a hood cannot help if the sun is in-frame.

$REVIEW.: JBL On Beat Loudspeaker Dock worked well for both my iPad 2 and iPhone. Just make sure it's plugged in all the way. When I first inserted my iPhone, I saw that it started charging so I thought it was plugged in. Then I saw you have to push an "ON" button to get the speakers to work (not necessary to charge your device). But the remote and speakers still didn't work. I read the instruction manual again, and in the troubleshooting area it said to make sure the device was inserted properly. I pushed down and rattled my iPhone and the speakers started blaring - startling me and scaring my dog! Finally figured it out. Once the iPhone was properly attached, the speakers and remote worked fine. The remote is handy for adjusting volume, switching to the next song, pausing, and more. The speaker is powerful and doubles nicely as a stand and battery charger.  The stand also swivels horizontally for watching movies.

$review_text.: UPDATED 2-STAR REVIEW:Everything I wrote about ART Tube MP (below) is true. Unfortunately, they haven't stood the test of time. The two I bought have both fallen prey to overheating-related solid-state component failure whereas the Behringer Ultragain MIC-100 units I've been using much longer in another location are still going strong. The Behringers, for a little more money, have a bit larger cases and power supplies...apparently allowing them to run cooler and longer. I've now replaced the deceased ART Tube MPs with additional Behringer Ultragain MIC-100s. I'm sorry if I misled anyone into making a suboptimal purchase!ORIGINAL 5-STAR REVIEW:If one desires an easy way to experience the audio advantages of vacuum tubes in the playback chain without the associated cost and heat disadvantages of too many tubes, one can place a vacuum tube buffer stage between one's digital program source (especially streaming audio, MP3, or lossless audio files) and one's preamplifier. The "gold standard" for doing so in an affordable manner is the Musical Fidelity Tube Buffer. Unfortunately, this product is very hard to come by. What to do?If one purchases two ART Tube MP preamplifiers...each costing little more than the replacement cost of the vacuum tube it contains...and four 1/4" male phono to female RCA connectors, one can create a budget tube buffer stage. The trick to making it sound good is to adjust it so it doesn't add volume to the final output. Unity gain. One can effectively approximate the "no add" setting by ear.Why bother? The strident "grain" associated with computer audio files is smoothed. Voices seem to come forward in the mix. And, for whatever electrical and psycho-acoustical reasons, the final sound seems just a bit more natural.I use two ART Tube MPs as a buffer stage between a Behringer U-Control UCA-202 DAC and a Behringer Eurorack UB-502 mixer to provide state-of-the-art amplification for my Vic Firth isolation headphones. The resulting sound is absolutely top-drawer and completely belies the bargain price I paid for these components.Enjoy.

$REVIEW.: My antenna came completely assembled and packed well in a triangle box.  The picture is condensed but the description of size is accurate.  Mine was ever-so-slightly bent above the base which makes for a not-exactly-perpendicular stance on the truck.Reception is as good as a quarter-wave with the same ground plane.  Ultra clear dx.  I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an adequate ground plane although I mounted my smack dead center of the roof using a permanent NMO.  People definitely know I'm a ham.If you're trying to be discrete, get a quarter wave in solid black.  The criminals in my area are too stupid to know what a ham is anyhow.

$review_text.: First a caveat: I like a more clean sound without an immense amount of bass. I am a big fan of Bose and Sennheiser because they reproduce music more accurately to my ears. Check my review of myBose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system.I lost mySennheiser  CX300-B In-Ear Stereo Headphoneabout a year ago and have been suffering along with the earbuds that came with mySanDisk Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)and other buds I had laying around. I've had my eye on a pair ofThinksound Rain 9mm High Definition Passive Noise Isolating Wooden Headphone (Black/Chocolate)but thought I'd try some cheaper alternatives. With electronics, I've often found that Amazon reviews can help me save some money and get a decent product.First I tried a pair ofSkullcandy INK'd Earbuds S2INCZ-033 (Black/Black). I really liked the sound isolation of my old Sennheiser's. The SkullCandy's are about the least in-canal buds I thought I could stand. Overall, I thought they were very good when I listened to prog-rock and jazz. But then I downloaded theTron: Legacy Reconfiguredto my Amazon Cloud Player (oddly, I can't insert a product link for that!). My laptop has a crappy sound card that lacks the ability to adjust the tone of audio in the card. Neither Amazon Cloud Player nor Google Chrome provided a way to adjust the tone. The result was a bass sensation that I just couldn't stand.The positive:So I ordered these Sony ear buds to try out. I was a little concerned because they are labelled "Heavy Bass" but my concerns were unfounded. The buds fit differently than any other I've tried. They have a bump that enters the canal slightly but the rest of the bud is cradled in my ear. The advantages are that these buds can feature separate drivers, creating a more spatial feel to the music and they allow in more outside sound. For listening in my office, they are absolutely perfect. They don't apply any pressure to my ear canal and produce excellent sound quality.The negative:It's very possible that some people will have ears that these just don't work in. Of course, some people can't handle the ones that go into the ear canal. These also don't produce an overwhelming bass experience, which I know some people dig.Overall, for me these are the perfect earbuds for listening to my Amazon Cloud Drive collection at my desk.

$review_text.: After reading the mixed reviews of this product, I decided to take a chance because it is relatively inexpensive.  More over, I was tired of my Nuvi 760 falling off my windshield while driving and wanted a better solution.  Well, this is it.  I set it up on the middle of three vents on my dash and put the arms on either side of the vent control.  I do a lot of driving for my job which includes a lot of highway and city driving.  It hasn't fallen off my Altima vents and only moves if I push it directly.  I have taken some hard and fast turns, driven over potholes, and done as much as I can to get the unit to release, but it hasn't yet(I will update the review if it does). I love that it keeps the unit below my dashboard, is inconspicuous, and most importantly, it doesn't drop the GPS on the floor while driving.  I will be buying a second one for my wife's car, so we don't have to worry about messing with the setup.I read a review that said the unit shakes a lot.  Well, you are attaching a hard plastic component to a hard point of your car, so if your car shakes a lot, expect that the unit will too.  I don't see this as a product flaw of this unit, but more of an expected outcome of a shaky car.  It does not shake too much in my car.(Update 11/2012)-  Still works great and have had no issues at all.  The best GPS car solution I have seen.

$REVIEW.: One reviewer wrote that this was a thin poorly made cable - it isn't.  It's a very sturdy cable, it works just fine and at this price it's a no brainer.Works great with my iPad 1, my iPod Touch and my iPhone 4S.  The extra reach is awesome.I read that some folks have had some problems with this cable and I think I might be able to help.  I found it didn't work with one of my chargers so I tried a different one and after a little experimentation I found that it works fine with most but not all chargers.  Just match it with the right charger and you'll love it.

$REVIEW.: Rio does not advertize this product as a sport mp3 player


 Anybody that jogs or bikes with a hard disk based player is just asking for trouble


 What this unit is though is a fantastic substitute for your home audio cd player

 Even more than a substitute, 20 gigs will hold just about anyones music collection
 Sound reproduction is fantastic, especially with FLAC codec(which takes up more room than mp3/wma.)
It is portable though to the car, the backyard or camping, just don't throw it off a cliff and expect it to recover

 The screen is big and the menu system is by far the easiest I have used


 The ripping/encoding software is easy to use and makes it's own  data base that sorts and stores your music, but you may have to read the E-Manual included on the CD Rom.

 Well, I turned to Amazon and found this USB DVD

$REVIEW.: I just read a 2-star review written by someone who claims this sling isn't for a woman.  Well, it is for THIS woman!  I tried every sling out there and this was the only one that crossed in the right places up front.  I don't use the waist strap, just to speed up swinging it around and getting the camera out.  And that process, by the way, is fast.  I photograph animals, mainly, some wild, some wild-n-crazy domestic, so time is of the essence.  This sling has become one piece of equipment I just couldn't do without.  I actually store my camera and most frequently used lenses in it all the time, so that I can just grab it and go.At first I was worried about whether my Sony A580 and its 70-300G lens would fit.  That was kind of important, and according to the measurements given, it looked doubtful.  The lens is pretty big, and the camera is large for a mid-grade DSLR.  Well, the combo does fit, even with the lens attached.  Or, I can put the lens by itself in the side pocket, which is very tall and has an elastic strap for a little more security when you open it.  Another tall pocket on the opposite side of the case is good to stuff the waist strap into if you don't use it.There is also a small pocket that would be great for filters.  I use it for two extra batteries.  There's a big flat pocket in front, under the tripod flap.I do have a good sized Ape case for the rest of my gear, but never take that out.  I decide which lenses I'll need ahead of time, and since the sling can hold one large and two small along with the camera, that's what goes with me.  This thing is so perfect for me that I've thought about buying another one in case they stop making them.
$SUMMARY.: It's a WINNER!! Yes, even for a female!

$review_text.: Creative has really knocked it out of the park with this device. I really take my sound seriously and after purchasing theCreative Sound Blaster X-Fi HD USB Audio System with THX SB1240, I was very curious about this device, but I was very happy with what I discovered. The SoundBlaster AXX 200 (pronounced axe) is a high-tech Swiss-Army style portable speaker that does everything right for the price. If you don't read any further, buy this portable speaker now.First and foremost: The speakers in this device sound great. And yes, they are loud. That's your primary interest in this, right? It should be. Regardless of all the additional functions of a portable speaker, it needs to sound great.The internal speakers on the AXX 200 push a good amount of air for their size; I was surprised that when I put my hand behind the speaker and felt the air movement when I turned up the volume. No other portable speakers in this category that I've reviewed do this. There should be a big check next to engineering and design quality box for this model. Fit and finish is nice and build quality is very solid. This doesn't feel cheap like some other portable speaker systems.The clarity in audio playback is excellent. Sound is rich, but the frequencies are separated, adding to depth and spaciousness of the sound being produced by these speakers. Engineers have a hard time obtaining stereo separation to produce a "big" sound when you have two small speakers positioned closely together. Creative handles this by offsetting the speakers to produce a larger sound.Geek Alert: Don't forget there's the dedicated SB AXX1 CPU (next gen) that does all the heavy-lifting when it comes to audio processing. And man, does it do a great job!This is what separates Creative from others in the portable speaker market. As opposed to the standard "battery + speaker combo" you see in so many other companies' designs,  Creative actually performs some pretty sophisticated audio processing (using their own chip) to ensure the best possible sound and playback of your music. Kudos to Creative for this.I mean think about it, That's pretty cool to think your portable speaker has a built in AUDIO CPU dedicated to making whatever you play though it, sound great. I tested the AXX 200 with some 128k MP3 files and with SBX engaged, it did a great job making them sound really good. 320k MP3 files sounded amazing.In summary: This is the only portable stereo speaker system that supports a wide variety of inputs and controls AND includes a dedicated audio processing chip. Amazing, clear (and loud) sound with many useful additional functions included. Five out of five stars.For the Audio Geeks:aptX / AAC support for the highest quality audio streamingDedicated SB AXX1 multicore chipset with mobile device support (woot!)For the Road Warriors:15 hour battery lifeQuad-microphone and noise cancellation for conference calls like a bossSkype and VOIP friendlyKaraoke function for those lonely nights in the hotelFor Smartphone Users:Compatible with Windows Phone 8, Apple and Android smartphonesSupport for NFC one-tap connectSupport for two Bluetooth profilesSpeaker will act as a portable charging station for your phone (and other devices too)Dedicated Android and Apple smartphone appsAlso see my latest review on theNEW!

$REVIEW.: I gave only 4 stars because it doesn't accomodate iPad mini's that have an invisible shield. It just barely doesn't fit with it. Of course, it's possible I just got one that was warped.I really like the near limitless number of positions, and yet I feel they could have made the thresholds (for standing it at an angle) better. Other than that, I'm satisfied.EDIT: After 1.5 years, the only things that have worn are the rubber corners where the iPad mini sits into it, and the rubber lines that cover the screen and also keeps the iPad secure when leaning it up horizontally. The rubber lines don't stick out quite as much, so it's difficult to get the iPad to stay up horizontally.  Other than that, this case has held up nicely. If it breaks, I'll get another just like it.

The shipping was free  included in the purchase , but I was surprised that the delivery folks actually carried the carton into the house, unpacked it, and set it in place at no extra charger to me, and with no prompting from me.The set has an added feature that I find valuable: I am using a Mac Mini with an Elgato EyeTV, which acts as my DVR; The EyeTV has a common "fault" that it s audio level is lower than the device it is feeding; In this case, the Mac Mini.  The TV set has a MENU SELECTABLE auto-audio leveler, which absolves this small issue.  (It is nice to be able to use the Mini as intended; A computer, when it's video and audio is delivered to this TV set.  -I use the VGA adapter to connect the video to the Samsung TV set.  The Mac Mini is at the TV set, and is controlled by a mouse and a mini-keyboard, both via Bluetooth, and made by Apple.  -SWEET PACKAGE!)  The Mac Mini uses the standard WPA-protected Wi-Fi to connect to my LAN.The Samsung TV is easy to set up and to run.  I have discovered no flaws.  I just returned from a big-box store that sells this unit as well as a LOT of other large HDTV sets; I still like the image that the Samsung LED units deliver.  The Samsung LCD-LED sets are very good, but the rear-projection set that I got is a LOT SMOOTHER.  Therefore, the rear-projection LED unit has the best picture, in my opinion.Would I buy again?

I hope that the makers take this into consideration for their next project.I am satisfied with the battery power which easily lasts me a whole day of use. You can tell that the makers invested a good chunk of their budget on the overall quality of this product. Great zipper, great hook, great material.

$REVIEW.: This was my first HDTV purchase, and in fact my first television purchase ever, so I comparison shopped for months before finally settling on this model in Feb '11.  As someone who knows very little about electronics and technical specs, I wanted to get the best quality for my money without paying for a lot of extras I will never use.  I also didn't want to spend a lot of money for something I only use occasionally.  I did want something up-to-date, with streaming capabilities as that's my primary source of entertainment.This TV has suited those needs perfectly.  It was delivered exactly within the scheduled delivery window and brought inside to my second floor apartment.  The deliveryman did tell me that they are generally required to take the TV out of the box and turn it on to demonstrate that it works but that he couldn't because it was so cold outside that the tv had to warm up for an hour or two before I could plug it in.  I was a little nervous to hear that but he left, I waited several hours, then took out the TV and plugged it in.  Worked perfectly, and I managed to set up the whole thing by myself in about an hour, including screwing in the base, connecting cable, DVD player, Netflix.  I am NOT someone who is good at that sort of thing, but I am impatient and wanted to try it out right away and it really was very easy.  The manual is clear and straightforward and I had no problem finding what I needed to know.I did buy the separate wi-fi adapter for about $39 and it was very easy to plug in and get connected to my wireless network.  I mostly watch Netflix movies etc, though it would have been very nice to also be able to access Hulu Plus without buying additional electronics in the future.  This is probably the only negative for me overall.As someone who is not electronically savvy, I actually had no idea how big this screen was going to be.  I thought my old TV (a Sony non-flatscreen) was about 30" and that I'd just be going a bit bigger.  My significant other kept telling me that it had to be at least 42", anything smaller would be REALLY small.  Well, I might've known better! When I saw the size of the box, my jaw dropped a little.  I'm not a huge TV person and I live in a cozy Boston apartment, so a reasonable-sized TV is perfect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this screen size and have since been very pleased with it.  I would NEVER have chosen this size if I had a better sense of how big it would actually be, but it's totally worth the price and I'm very happy with it. If you have a lot of space or a really large family room etc, perhaps this TV would be on the small side but if you are only sitting 10-20 feet away from it, the picture is great.So if you're like me and don't really know TVs, get a tape measure and pull it out to 42" and hold it on a diagonal.  Really.  Maybe even add 2-3 inches to take the edges into account.Appearance. I do like the look of it.  This LG wasn't at the top of my list in terms of aesthetics alone and I'm very picky about decorating, especially when it comes to such a large object.  However, it's fairly unobtrusive and looks... well, like a simple black TV.  This is fine with me.  I do have it on the stand but hope to hang it on the wall at some point and will update accordingly.Finally, we did move about a month ago, and it was a MASSIVE move.  I simply wrapped a blanket around the tv (after removing the base) and transported it in the back of an SUV.  I'm sure it sustained a few bumps here and there but it looks and works like new, not a scratch anywhere (which is far more than I can say for some other furniture).  Could I have been a LOT more careful?  Yes, especially since I still had the box, but it seemed more efficient to fill it with other stuff and just carry the TV.  But the TV held up beautifully and I think it's about as durable as a flat screen TV is going to get.Very very happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: This remote works really well if you use Windows.  I purchased it to use with Linux in a MythTV environment, and had less success there.  This sensor registers itself as a HID device, as opposed to a IR sensor.  This makes the OS think it's a mouse with a lot of buttons.  While it is possible to get Linux to work like this, there are other choices which are better for just a little bit more money.Overall, I like the size of the sensor, and if I was using this on a Windows machine, it would have worked perfectly.

$REVIEW.: Oddly enough, I purchased this headphone splitter for my office, not strictly for personal use


The product packaging was nice


After a couple of days, I have no complaints
Some other reviews commented on the fluctuation in volume when devices are added/removed

While I have not noticed a substantial change in volume, this may depend on the impedance of the devices.Here are some initial uses for the headphone splitter.1


I work better listening to my mp3 player, such as an iPhone

While I wore my headphones, I could not hear the alerts from my laptop
I tried plugging the iPhone output into the mic input of my laptop


That did not work so well for me
This splitter allows me to comfortably listen to my iPhone and laptop at the same time.2


While I listen to a monotone conference call or webinar, I can listen to "background music" to improve my focus on the dialogue or presenter


(This might not work for others.)3
Frequent plugging/unplugging my headphones to my iPhone and laptop had me concerned that eventually one of these jacks might break
With a splitter, that physical wear-and-tear risk is diminished

Replacing a broken splitter is far cheaper than fixing an iPhone or laptop.This package also came with an extra approx 2 foot male-to-male cable in matching lime green color

Looks nice!

$REVIEW.: I want to and should be able to love this trackball: right size, right feel (though the scroll ring feels coarse and cheap), right usability, excellent tactility, great software.But the deal-breaker on this trackball is its utterly lacking durability. I am on my 4th replacement from Kensington in a year now. In all cases, clockwise scroll ring rotation and primary button clicks became erratic. Kensington dutifully sent a replacement unit every time while under warranty, but now that warranty period is over and I again have a barely-usable device. Note that I'm not a gamer, nor have I subjected this device to any other "hard" usage.Kensington charges too much for something that is clearly not meant to last. I am now looking to Logitech and lesser-known "ergonomic specialist" brands for my trackball needs.

$review_text.: I am another K3 owner that purchased the K4 based mainly on the weight and reduced size. I have always enjoyed reading my K3 naked, enjoying the feel and weight without a cover, only storing it covered. With the K4 I noted an almost flimsy feel and was constantly catching the backs of the page turning buttons with my fingers, sometimes substantially. Because I am Very careful with my stuff, I became concerned the buttons would be damaged. I don't know if mine is defective, having a poor fit or not, but considered options to address it.Checking out the SportGrip Skin Case, by covering the back, catching the buttons would be eliminated. It works perfectly! It is tight fitting, but stretches for removal, I no longer fear scratches when setting it down on hard surfaces or even damp ones and it's now impossible to catch the backs of the page turners! All control buttons are well marked and allow full function, probably extending their wear and tear. I have improved grip, so less tension is needed for long-term reading (increased weight addressed later).  Overall, it seems to offer a sturdier feel and obvious additional protection.However, because of the extra thickness of the silicon, the Kindle is no longer the lightweight reader I was looking for. Maybe it's my imagination, but it seems almost as heavy as the K3 and I find myself setting it onto my lap or something to give my fingers a break. Setting it down is safer now, so if the SportGrip were half the thickness, or less, maybe the middle ground of weight VS protection could be found. I doubt perfect protection if dropped from a substantial height can be afforded unless placed in a "case", which is how I store mine. A thick version as one model, a really thin version as another option might work out better. The decals don't sound like they could offer that back or dust protection the SportGrip provides.All in all, I don't regret purchasing this cover and will keep options open for the future!

$review_text.: In the nearly three years I've had my Canon 7D, I've used a set of 133x  and 266x cards.  No matter how carefully I measured, I could not find a bit of speed difference between the two.  But Canon (and many other high-end cameras) have another way of getting to a card--UDMA.  And boy, does it make a difference.There are four variables that control the number of shots you can take over a given interval: the size of the image, the speed of the camera's mechanism, the size of the camera's internal buffer and the speed of the card.  The 7D--especially with its new V2 software--covers the first three of those.  No matter the speed of the card, this particular camera can take 24-25 RAW images in a 3 second window.  After that, we wait until those images are transferred to the card.  This is where UDMA makes a difference.  I measured a 266x card against this Lexar and the results were surprising.  I was able to extend that initial 3 second burst by another half-second (2-4 more images).  But the image offload was where the difference really showed up.  Once I'd filled the camera's internal buffer, I timed how long it took to move those images to card.  In the case of my old card, it took 26 seconds.  The Lexar took only about six and a half.If you shoot slow-moving things, a vanilla card is fine.  Go for capacity. But if you shoot sports or some sorts of wildlife (try hummingbirds) the speed difference is crucial.  I've occasionally shot short-track speed skating, shooting a burst of images as the skaters zip by and then hoping the camera will offload by the time they come around again.  Often that means I can shoot only every other lap.  Not so with this Lexar.  It's ready to go again nearly as soon as you've composed the shot.The only downside is that you'll need more cards and more editing time.  It takes no time at all to fill this up if you're shooting action.  You'll have more images to choose from--both good and bad. But for action shots, it's great to have the option.

$review_text.: I just sold my Nexus 7 via the Amazon marketplace. It felt naked to me without the carousel and the Amazon content I can pin there. I prefer the Fire's method of navigation having gotten accustomed to the original Fire for over a year. I did not like how the Nexus renders the color white...kind of greyish looking to me.$199 got me an amazing media powerhouse with an ocean of free content (book, video, music). The tablet is more comfortable to hold than the original Fire (more balanced when holding it) and I like the extra width. I can do some work too: email, twitter, Interactive Brokers App for trading, Skype, etc. Light work but I would not use a tablet to handle the heavy workload. I use a laptop for that.About the ads...Amazon has learned that customers prefer to buy the ad version of the e-ink Kindle at a cheaper price. The non advertising version did not sell that much. You get a cheaper price as a benefit. If you don't like it just opt out for $15. At a minimum, redeem the $5 MP3 coupon. The cost of opting out drops to $10. If you are a bit more patient, the cost of opting out will converge towards negative values. I also like the bottom recommendation carousel when you hold the Fire in portrait mode. It is a great way to find relevant content in that ocean.Update 9/18: I used the Send to Kindle app on the Chrome browser on my laptop to send a webpage to my Fire. I could not believe it when I saw the text to speech play button within the document. I am now listening to that webpage on my HD. WOW!Just got a $5 offer to spend in the video store.

$REVIEW.: I'm glad I finally sprung for one of these while it was on sale. I have all my major components (TV, receiver, Mac Mini, etc.) all plugged in there, and it's satisfying to see the voltage indicator on the display.But, oh, that display! It is far too bright. Do these designers not have other components to compare their own product to? My Pioneer A/V Receiver, for example, has the perfect level of brightness on the display. Granted, I may have set it there myself when I first set it up, but that's kind of my point. The Panamax has one setting: Night Light.And yet there are three settings for these two front lights I will *never* use. The lamps are like the ones I used to use in a rack-mounted setup for live sound engineering back in college. That was super-helpful because we could see the equalizer, signal processing gear, etc., and make adjustments during a show without adding more light to the venue. And while the Panamax version of these lights give you three relatively unobtrusive brightness settings (unlike the blue voltage display), they are totally useless. How many people are going to have this up above a large stack of equipment they would otherwise not be able to see very well?My Panamax unit is about a foot off the floor. The lights illuminate... my floor (and my TiVo, which has nothing on it to read but illuminated circles, and an HD-DVD player, which--as you can imagine--sees very little use). My point being that display and lighting features are just not that well thought out. Drop the extra lights, dim or allow me do adjust the blue LED, and leave it at that.Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with it. I've charged my iPhone 5 from the front USB port. I don't see a need to plug anything in to the front outlet, but if I need to temporarily plug in another device, or maybe an extra charger if a friend/family member is visiting (after all, all my other outlets are used up!), then I see the utility there.

Out of all of them the magic mouse is my favorite.The surface of the mouse lets you do some basic gestures such as scrolling up/down/left/right, as well as swiping to change workspaces or to go forward/backward in your web browser.The magic mouse has the best surface tracking that I've seen in a mouse to date.  Previous mice I've used on my wood textured desk at work get lost and the cursor jumps all over the place.  With my magic mouse I never have that issue.I've liked this mouse so much that I picked up an additional magic mouse to work with my MacBook Air at work.  I frequently flip the little switch on the bottom of the mouse to turn it on/off and slip it into either my pocket or my laptop bag as I haul it around.

$review_text.: The quality and feel of the mouse has taken a hit

No marking on which way the battery goes and the off/on switch is very small so care needs to be given when turning it off or on, slight pull with a finger nail


The USB stick is huge rather than a dong it's full size so care needs to be given if another USB port is being used at the same time

Overall it works, it is a cheaper mouse as far as models go but it shows it's cheap.Worked 24 hours or less

Installed stick, Windows found it and it worked fine for a couple three hours, turned it off and the next day it was dead

Changed battery four time and reset mouse still nothing so I contacted Amazon for a return and sent it back that day

Ordered new one moving up slightly and will wait a few days before reviewing.Packed well and arrived quickly, just quit working.

$REVIEW.: Difference between Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Speed Ratings (performance) for SD/SDHC/SDXC cardsWhat is the difference between Speed Class and Speed Ratings for SDTM/SDHCTM cards?The speed rating measures maximum transfer speed for reading and writing images to and from a memory card, expressed as megabytes per second. However, video doesn't need as big a data pipe because the video format is a smaller "fixed stream" that uses only a portion of the data pipe.Unlike card write speeds that measure maximum performance, class ratings measure the minimum sustained speed required for recording an even rate of video onto the card. The class rating number corresponds to the transfer rate measured in megabytes per second. Class 2 cards are designed for a minimum sustained transfer rate of 2 megabytes per second (MB/s)1, while Class 10 cards are designed for a minimum sustained transfer rate of 10MB/s2.What does this difference mean for me?Rated Speed (e.g. 15MB/s, 30MB/s, etc.) is maximum speed of the card and also what you would expect to approximately see in typical usage of writing or reading files on the card. This measurement is pertinent to still photography, especially for taking pictures with high resolution and/or saving in RAW format where the files created are very large. The faster the card, the faster it can save the file and be ready to take another picture. You can really notice speed differences with high-megapixel DSLR cameras when using multi-shot burst mode.Still digital images shot on high-megapixel cameras should utilize fast data throughput (a large data pipe), higher speed cards for improved performance. Higher speed cards can also improve how fast you can transfer the files to and from the card and your computer.Speed Class is a minimum speed based on a worst case scenario test. The Speed Class is important for video mode or camcorders, where the device is actually saving a steady stream of data. The resolution and format of the video determines the amount of steady stream data. This translates to a minimum speed you need to guarantee that the video captured on the cards is recorded at an even, sustained rate with no dropped frames (which would result in lost data and choppy playback).Compared to high-megapixel photography, video doesn't need as big a data pipe because the video format is a smaller "fixed stream" that uses only a portion of the data pipe. But you do need a minimum guaranteed speed for the SDHC card that satisfies the requirement of the data stream. Your camera's specifications should state the minimum SDHC Class Rating required.Using a card without the proper class rating on a more advanced camera, such as a high-definition (HD) camcorder or Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera with HD video record settings is likely to result in an error message indicating that video can only be recorded at a lower definition setting.The current SDHC specification defines Class 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 as follows:Class  Minimum Speed2  --  2MB/s4  --  4MB/s6  --  6MB/s8  --  8MB/s10  --  10MB/sUHS Speed Class was introduced in 2009 by the SD Association and is designed for SDHC and SDXC memory cards. UHS utilizes a new data bus that will not work in non-UHS host devices. If you use a UHS memory card in a non-UHS host, it will default to the standard data bus and use the "Speed Class" rating instead of the "UHS Speed Class" rating. UHS memory cards have a full higher potential of recording real time broadcasts, capturing large-size HD videos and extremely high quality professional HD.UHS Class  Minimum SpeedI  10MB/s1 1 megabyte (MB) = 1 million bytes2 Based on SanDisk internal testing; performance may vary depending upon host device.THIS INFORMATION IS COURTESY OF SanDisk

$review_text.: I have this mounted to my center vents on my 2012 Ford Fusion.  Its been there for the last year with no real problems.  It holds up well and attaches to my home-made modified phone holsters via the garmin ball mount.  The slight shifting during driving has left a little dusty buildup, but I am guessing that is becuase the vent louvers are made of metal and wear on the clips a bit more?  Easy to remove and attach (best done with two hands) this mount has held up well for the last 13 months.

$review_text.: These earphones come in a variety of colors, turn up the bass in the sound - great for listening to songs with a beat
I do miss the crystal clarity and faithful reproduction of some of the higher end ($75+) earphones, but these are very good for their price point

I also have the Moshi Dulcia in pinkMoshi Dulcia In-Ear Headphones for Kindle Fire HD, Pinkthat I absolutely love, especially as they're flat wired and pink and small and one of the few earphones that don't give me an ear burn
These Mythro buds are nice too just not as comfortable in my smaller ear canals as the Dulcia


The Dulcia earbuds also have a more faithful sound reproduction and the bass is not as turned up as in these Mythro buds.These earbuds also have a pause/play/take call button and mic, which makes them really convenient
They fall out more easily than the narrowly shaped Dulcia earphones, and you really can't use them while running

However, they fall out less than the Apple Earphones that never stay put in my ears and make my ears burn in 10 minutes of wearing them.I like these over the Sony/Phillips earbuds in this price range
I do like some Logitech Ultimate Ears 500 earbudsLogitech Ultimate Ears 500 Noise-Isolating Earphones - Dark Silverthat are just a little bit more expensive than these earbuds but have higher fidelity in my opinion
However, they don't have a mic but I really like the flat non-tangle cords with the cool graphic.These did not come with a case which was a little bit disappointing as I don't like to just throw earbuds in my bag, but the attached velcro strap does help keep them tangle free.Overall, fun earphones for rap/pop songs with a beat

Not so great for classical music or opera
Good earphones for the price.


$SUMMARY.: Heavy on bass, highs are good not great


Overall a good value for price.

$REVIEW.: Pros: Lots of cords, real silicon cases, and a cool necklace.Cons: The oem charger cord for the zune has circuitry in it to wear it will not put to much power into the zune. However these cords evidently do not. The wall charger puts to much power in and the zune screen freezes up to touch and it becomes quite hot after a few minutes. I don't know about you, but I don't want my zune burnt up. I have not tested the other cords and I do not want to. Also, the oem charger does not have buttons that you have to press to have it realese and, you heve to unplug your headphones to press them(this is very annoying if you are charging your zune while listening to music. Lastly, I didn't use the case protectors because I got a speck zune case (out of stock at time of review.)Other thoughts: If this product works for you then great, but if it doesen't, well, you have been warned.

$REVIEW.: First off, these units are just like the Adorama units that sell for more, including the power pack.  But at 600WS with a power pack these units are a steal for the price.  I already have a Flashpoint 620M and 320M unit and this unit rounds out the power and introduces my first battery pack.Recycle time at full power seems just above 3 seconds, but not accurately timed.  At the lowest power I was able to shoot at the lower continous speed of my D300, and the strobe seemed to keep up.  Power levels and color seemed pretty consistant from informal testing.If the unit is anywhere as reliable as my Flashpoints, then it will be more than adequate for me as an enthusiast photographer.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to replace a Verizon-provided Westell. The Westell was working fine but I was willing to see if this one would be faster, and I wanted a backup in case the one I had died (without waiting for Verizon to send a replacement).THere are 3 setup choices (my wording):1) totally automatic2) you select your provider3) completely manualWhile I was comfortable with doing a manual setup, I was curious to see how easy it would be using option 2. I had to know that my Verzion service was PPPOE, but other than that it did indeed need no information except the user and password.I looked at the options (firewall, NAT, pass-through, etc) but didn't set any of them as I use this with a router and have everything configured in the router.Interestingly, it is running faster than the Westell's I've used (and I've had several). I've run some tests and while they're not controlled, I'm seeing about 8%.Physically, it's very small and is clearly more fragile than other DSL modems I've had, using thinner plastic. It wouldn't put up with much abuse, but then there's no reason it should be subjected to it.Important point: The ethernet cable they provide is a cross-over, and you need that on setup when connectiong the modem directly to your computer. If using a router, you'll then not use that cable again. Most people setting up modems with routers know this, but there's virtually no documentation for this thing and the on-disc manual is weak.

Running at less than 50% of its 250 watt rating, this PSU runs cool and quiet. The fan is whisper quiet and I don't experience the high-pitched noise reported by other reviewers. Note that you have to use a jumper wire between pins 16 and 17 of the motherboard connector to turn-on this PSU when it is not connected to a computer. Only time will tell how long this PSU lasts for me, but I expect at least a few years of reliable service running intermittently at lower power levels. This little PSU is a great value for the money.

$review_text.: I've had this camera for a couple months now and simply love it.  I was a bit skeptical as I'm a long time DSLR user.  Initially, I had concerns about the picture quality of the camera as well as wondering if it was too small to use comfortably.  I'm finding both concerns unfounded.Regarding picture quality: yes my Pentax k-5 takes better photos, particularly when I have to shoot at iso 1600 and above.  But there are times when having a greater depth of field is nice (and with a smaller sensor, that is the default situation).  So if I'm taking pics of a party where light is low, if I'm shooting at 1.9 w/ a aps-c sensor, there's a good chance that if the picture has more than one person in it, one person will be out of focus if the other person is.  But with the Pentax Q, the chances that both will be in focus is quite a bit better.  So for example, if I shoot with the k-5 @ f2 w/ a 50mm equiv (33mm), at 5 feet I will have a dof of about .5 feet.  Whereas with the Q, @ f2 with a 50mm equivalent (8.5mm like the standard prime lens), I'll have a dof of about 5.5 feet!  With this kind of dof, I can keep my shutter speed high and reduce the chances of motion blur while keeping everyone in focus.  I've even put the camera in manual focus, knowing people from 3 feet to about 9 feet away from me will be in focus, so it's easier to shoot from the hip and great natural candids w/out waiting for the AF to lock.Another aspect that the Q adds to my system is the great macro options it gives me.  Since the crop ratio is about 5.5, my 105 2.8 macro sigma becomes about a 575mm f2.8 macro!  And with the extra depth of field a small sensor gives me, you can get some pretty cool shots using a Q mount adaptor.  Of course the tele options are enhanced too... I put a m42 300 f4 lens on the camera to see what shooting the moon would be like... the full moon almost filled the frame!!!I'm not going to stop using my DSLR, but the Pentax Q is a joy to use.  It's well built, its small enough to fit in my pocket, and it adds options to my system that are pretty amazing.  I've been very pleased with the picture quality I can get with it... it's just a fun camera to use.

$REVIEW.: This is a very speedy computer and a more than capable desktop replacement system

The Radeon HD3400 video comes with a dedicated 256mb of memory and handles multiple concurrent Adobe apps with aplomb

It comes with wireless-N which is a treat in this price range


It also comes with an HDMI-out port for excellent display (and DVD playback) on an HD monitor/TV


The VGA-out renders only average display on a digital LCD monitor; I did not have an analog CRT to judge display on that.The built in display is a 16:9 aspect ratio


It's a gloss screen and the clarity is stunning...excellent for image editing, etc


Contrast is very good
Lateral (side-to-side) readability is fantastic, but vertical readability is poor; you'll have to adjust the screen tilt just right to get top-quality viewing.Surprisingly, even though this is a Sony product, this machine includes an SD card slot in addition to their ubiquitous memory stick slot
Also included are the aforementioned HDMI and VGA outputs; 3 USB ports; mini 1394 (firewire) port; modem, and ethernet
There is a built-in webcam and microphone and headphone jacks

There is a thin strip of AV controls above the keyboard, which control Windows Media Center playback and the Dolby sound.The system is solidly built, like most Sony products, but without the questionable UI/design choices used on so many of their camera and car stereos.The only thing I can really fault this system for is the plethora of crapware that comes preinstalled


I spent over an hour uninstalling junk software and trialware before I even used this system

An additional power supply is around $80, which is rather pricey

The computer (w/o power supply) is around 6 lbs., so it's not lightweight, which isn't too surprising considering it packs a 16.4" screen.This computer does not come with any documentation besides the setup "poster." No documentation is available for this PC on the Sony website (as of 8/4/08) other than a marketing spec sheet.Addendum (03/22/09): After about 4 months of use, the keyboard developed serious problems


It initially manifested as the shift key not working in conjunction w/ certain keys (i.e., no CAPS) and eventually proceeded to some keys not working at all


Sony was perfectly willing to repair it for free, provided I was willing to give up my computer for a few weeks, which was not a realistic option for me


Unable to find any technical specs on this computer (even on the Sony site) or any replacement parts, I opted for just using a cordless keyboard, which worked just fine

Eventually I was able to find a replacement keyboard from a reseller in Hong Kong and repaired the computer myself


The replacement keyboard ribbon cable was much sturdier than the original and it was easy to replace
The $50 I spent on a new keyboard was preferable to being w/o a computer for a prolonged period of time.

They said it is the underground wiring in my complex, and they would fix it sometime in the future.

$REVIEW.: I bought this one for gym use. First tried an RCA Lyra RD1072, but had to return that one because the sound was terrible.  This unit sounds *much* better than the Lyra.The other reviews cover features/size. I'll just add my particulars...*first time I connected to my PC, the unit locked-up and I had to pull the battery out to get it to reset. Since other reviews mentioned doing the firmware upgrade to fix some problems, I did that (easy) and haven't had a problem since.*I think the supplied phones sound fine and the EQ capability allows you to shape the sound to what you want.*Some reviews comment on the large earbuds and how they hurt their ears. Huh? I don't know how something that basically rests in your ear and is not forced in could hurt. Maybe it is a volume issue ;) They are plenty comfortable for me.*For running or working out, the case is fine and you have the options of clipping onto your belt/waistband, armstrap, or, it is small enough to slip in a pocketConsidering I only paid $10 more for this than the Lyra model I got, and this has the radio feature, folder recognition, custom EQ, etc. this is just a superior buy.  The Lyra had an expansion slot for memory, but this is not a must for a unit to take to the gym - the built-in 512Meg on the N200 is more than enough for that purpose. Plus, the Lyra didn't recognize folders which makes it very painful to move through lots of songs to get to one you want.

I use them in external flash for photography and they last aaaa llooot longer then any battery that I've ever used (excluding non-rechargeable Duracell), used them for over 8 months too ..

charged at least once a week, they still seem to go strong (though I rarely fully drain them, that's usually good to keep the battery in shape).Used Energizer as well ..


but they didn't seem to last as long (granted only used one kind and tried a few Duracells before settling on these).Also, I don't use Duracell charger, it's some crappy no name charger that came with some other crappy no name batteries I started with, but they don't last long enough in photo flashes, so I retired them.I'm not going to talk about benefits of rechargeable, if you haven't gotten on board with using rechargeable, get over it, single use batteries are so 1990s ...

$review_text.: Kodak, after Canon, is my favorite brand of camera, due to the sturdiness of the casing and the wonderful way they have in-camera programs which other cameras require you to do on the computer. You can edit videos on the camera, clipping out frames from video, and so on. If they just added extremely high speed video, I'd be ecstatic, because I love to shoot lightning storms and then clip out the best individual frames as stills. 30 frames per second is pretty slow when it comes to lightning.But enough about me. Like all Kodaks, this is sturdy, with excellent in-camera editing features such as panorama, video editing, touching up photos, and a variety of 'scenes', which is Kodak speak for different settings for different photo ops. It is absurdly, delightfully small---smaller than my blackberry. It's smaller than a deck of cards.  It's somewhat basic in comparison to my z1485, which is basically a tiny almost-SLR. But if you want a camera to grab as you're dashing out the door, this is it.A word on Kodaks: I went to Iraq and I wound up killing two cameras, or rather the heat did, along with the rough and tumble conditions. I think the heat is what fried them, literally, because on some days, it was 100+ by 9AM---in the shade. By noon it was unspeakable.  A friend gave me a floor model, used, from a store, and that camera got kicked around, subjected to the conditions that had killed the other two cameras, the heat, the dust, and the abuse, and though by the end of the tour I had to keep the battery compartment shut with a rubber band, it still worked just fine. When I got home I upgraded to another Kodak. I gave the old one---still equipped with the rubber band----to a soldier friend, who in turn took it to Iraq with her. It came back with her in fine shape but finally back home, it gave up the ghost, yet was in good enough shape to be sold for parts on Ebay. Its successor---the much beloved V505---went to friends when I upgraded from that one, and that too performed admirably till it got fried in an electrical incident. Every Kodak I've had---and I have three now---- are tough, small, and versatile. I'm very fond of them, and all they need to do now is to make a camera that has night vision and shoots at FPS1000.  That's all I ask. Until then, I've got these in my bag when I go out the door.

$REVIEW.: Having a wireless network at home, I purchased this hoping to pull in signals while away from home

 With my Mac's airport card, I saw 5 networks


 With the Alfa, using the larger +9db antenna, I now see 13 networks
 More importantly, my d/l speeds have improved from 20kB/s to over 500kB/s


 And no, I am not pulling your leg


 It works

 One word of advice, you will need to move the antenna around the room to pull in the strongest signal


 Mine is approx at 90% signal strength

 As I am using a Mac, the mini CD was a waste
 I followed the youtube instructions on how to navigate Terminal and set up the L chipset


 Don't worry

 I am not computer savvy and I was able to do it

 Just take your time and follow the instructions

 Good product


 Only complaint is for the money, they should have included a mounting device
 Even velcro would have been appreciated


 All in all, it works

 Buy it.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this drive for about a month and am very satisfied with it
 I don't use the backup software, preferring to simply copy over my files to this drive
 As my 60 GB drive on my laptop is nearly maxed out, I am using this drive to maintain my lesser used directories (such as my photos and old client files from more than 4 years ago)

 Works great, doesn't take up much room in my shoulder bag and it is allowing me to squeeze another year or two out of my 4 year-old laptop before buying a new one
 I love it.

$review_text.: If you want an alternative to Windows PCs, tired of malware, viruses, etc.  this Apple is for you.  OSx is based on Linux so viruses and malware are rare.  The operating system OSx (Mountain Lion) is intuitive and most windows users woud not have any trouble transitioning from a windows PC to Apple's OSx.  Many applications are included on the PC, such as itunes, email, web broswer, basic word processors, email.  However is you need more, free opensource applications are available, such as LibreOffice, Thunderbird, GnuCash (Accounting), skype, chrome, picasa and thousands or other applications both free and not free.  The PC is very compact, but supports two monitors, has both USB 2 and 3 jacks, both wired and wireless network connections.  It is reasonably priced, comes with a keyboard and mouse but no monitor.  It supports hdmi (primary), dvi and vga monitors.  Your best bet woud be a monitor which support hdmi.  I own a company that supports libraries, schools and construction companies.  I encourage them all to consider the Apple over Windows 8 PCs.  None that have installed the apple have regretted it.  I highly recommend this PC or the iMac desktop.

$REVIEW.: The cameras are slightly blurry and there is no way to focus them.The night vision claims to work out to 30 feet

However, this is not true outside.I tested the night vision inside, and it seemed to work pretty well.However, after mounting the cameras high on the sides of the house, the cameras see nothing but black at night
The images are 100% black and no shapes are visible.Note: We live in the country, and there are no "city" lights to help with night vision.The plastic thumb screws break off easily, and then you have to use needle nose pliers to tighten the screws in place to mount the camera arm.The DVR only allows one camera to be in D1 recording mode.It only allows one camera in HD2 mode, too.Bottom line..


This system is generally bad all around and I will likely be returning it soon.UPDATE 08/12/2012:After returning this system, I purchased a Swann security system


The Swann is a much better system and I highly recommend it over the Zmodo
The Swann system is better in every detail from cameras, to the DVR.

$REVIEW.: I had my Kindle just a few days and knew that I needed a cover.  I poured over the various options and decided on the Marware Eco-Vue Leather Folio.  Overall this product has been better than I expected and I am pleased with the purchase.The exterior of the cover is really soft with a padded feel but it doesn't feel delicate or as if it would tear easily.  I think it will hold up to a lot of use.  I opted for the red version and the color is very nice and rich - not cheap looking.  The elastic band on the outside will help keep the cover closed when you are not reading. This is ideal for anyone who plans on sliding the Kindle into a purse, briefcase, or luggage. The elastic band will also hold the cover in place when it is completely opened and folded back.The interior is a suede-type finish in a medium gray color - again the color is nice.  My Kindle fit nicely into the designated sleeve and feels secure.  All the necessary buttons and ports are exposed and easily accessible.When the front cover is folded back you have access to an elastic "handle" or slot to hold your Kindle.  I have found this to be very useful and a great feature that many other covers do not have.  When using the elastic handle I don't have as many worries about the device slipping from my hands. It is comfortable and the fit is tight enough to be secure without feeling too tight or restrictive.There is also an interior pocket on the inside of the front cover.  I was rather disappointed in this feature.  It was something I was looking forward to using but the pocket is open-ended and does not have a way to secure your items that are inside.  It is possible that items that are stored there could slip out.  This pocket is actually little more than slit.This is my first Kindle cover purchase but I feel like I did well with my choice.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.

I was encouraged at the last minute to go with the IS version and was thankful the other evening while shooting a sports event at dusk.

$REVIEW.: I like the color and style (embossed patened pleather) of this case, but not much else
The case is firm, not flexible and not padded


I really don't like to holes at the bottom, because I like to carry a back up battery with my camera


I guess the holes are there for you to help nudge your camera out of the case due to the cases tighness and lack of flexibility

I have a different Caselogic case that I like very much
It zips shut fully, has a soft strap, is made out of neoprene, and has an enclosed firm shield embedded onto one side that I put my LCD screen against to keep it protected

I have 2 other camera cases which both cost about the same as this one and I like both of those much better


They are more secure, easy to manage, and padded

I won't be using this one for anything.

$review_text.: There are three US versions of the Asus 1005HA:- Best Buy offers the 1005HA-B for $299 (plus tax). It features the N270 (1.6GHz 533FSB) cpu, glossy display, 3-Cell 23Wh Li-ion Battery (4 hrs), and a 1.3MP webcam. Excluded are the Bluetooth module, 10GB online Eee storage, and netbook sleeve. This is obviously the "Basic" model. I was able to demo this unit at Best Buy on June 27th, and IMO you are giving up quite a bit for the ~$60 savings over the 'P' model. Not to mention that as of now Asus will not sell you a spare 3 or 6-cell Li-Ion battery.- The 1005HA-V is in the middle of the bunch and the only one with a matte display. Those that frequently work outdoors or despise reflections will appreciate the matted display. It also features a N270 cpu, 6-cell 48Wh Li-ion Battery (8.5 hrs), 0.3MP webcam (according to Amazon specs, but it may in fact be 1.3MP), no Bluetooth, and absent again is the netbook sleeve.- So in a nutshell (or would that be seashell?) the 1005HA-P offers the faster N280 cpu, glossy display, 1.3MP webcam, 6-Cell 63Wh Li-ion Battery with a whopping 10.5 hrs run time, Bluetooth v2.1, and a black netbook sleeve. Realistic battery numbers are between 8.5-9hrs. of battery life if you're using wifi & doing email/word processing/YouTube/web surfing.The glossy LED display offers excellent color and contrast when used indoors. I was also pleasantly surprised with the excellent horizontal viewing angles. Keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying. I've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible. In fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my Dell D600.All three units come with the Digital Array Mic which consists of two powerful microphones. Ambient background noises are eliminated, as well as reduced echoes for clearer voice recording. What's more, with only direct sound (within 60) recorded, you'll obtain better voice capture. I've tested the mic with Skype, and it's loud and clear once you fine tune using the Realtek HD Audio manager. All models also include a WiFi 802.11 b/g/n adapter and 160GB 5400RPM hard drive. My 1005HA-P contains a Hitachi HTS543216L9SA00 hard drive and Atheros AR9285 wifi card. Atheros chipsets are known for excellent range and are typically less prone to connection drops. I'd like to point out that the AR9285 is only capable of 150Mbps.All three variations of the 1005HA ship with 1GB DDR2 800MHz memory. The good news is that you can remove the memory door on the bottom of the chassis and swap it out for a 2GB DDR2 200-pin SODIMM in under 2 minutes. Anytime you install new memory I'd recommend running a Prime95 "Blend" torture test for 12-24 hrs to make sure your system is stable. The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements. In Super Performance mode CPU-Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169.9MHz which translates into roughly 1.7GHz. One way to quickly change modes is to press Fn + spacebar.One word of advice is to be really careful about which anti-malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks. Whatever you elect to install I would highly recommend you benchmark the performance both before and after. In regards to free anti-viruses that run light I would tip my hat to Antivir (nag screen can be disabled by searching Google) and Panda Cloud. For pay versions Norton 2010 & NOD32 should be considered.One minor annoyance is that the display will not tilt back as far as some people may like. The glossy chassis is also a fingerprint magnet. A few other things I'd like to point out is that you must push the micro-sized right angle end of the ac adapter until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge. In addition the ac adapter does get quite hot while it is actively charging the battery, which Asus clearly mentions in the user manual, so one should not be alarmed over the heat output. The final quirk is that the hard drive is split into two 80GB (before formatting) partitions. Fortunately this can be resolved by using Easeus Partition Master Home which is a free utility.Overall I am extremely satisfied with the 1005HA-P, and it is arguably the finest 10" netbook on the market. Keep in mind that if you want a White or Pink shell you'll be limited to the 'B' or 'V' models. Asus has already released the two aforementioned colors in Europe & Asia, so hopefully by the end of 2009 we'll get them as an option on the 'P' model. Be sure to check out the Amazon community forum for this product located towards the bottom of this page if you require additional enlightenment. You'll find a lot of tips, tricks, and general FAQ's.

$REVIEW.: This K360 is a fine keyboard that combines form and function into one eminently attractive AND completely useable wireless device.Wireless devices have been a technological God-send. The increased portability and user mobility they provide helps free me from the formerly endless tangle of wires coming and going out of every available orifice (port) in my computers.Logitech makes many wireless mice and keyboards. They introduced the "Unifying" receiver a few years back which, once inserted into any USB port in a desktop, laptop or tablet allows for multiple devices to operate wirelessly drawing their signals from one single dongle.Having used their products for the past several years, I was delighted to discover the new K360 keyboard. It has several advantages over earlier versions that are worth mentioning.The K360 is a "Micro" device, about 70% the size and weight of a full-size traditional keyboard. Measuring an easy to use but convenient and highly portable 15" X 6.5" X1.6" and weighing in at 1.6 lbs, the K360 sports the Chiclet style keys (like most modern laptops) that require a light touch but move sufficiently (and have some light responsive sound) so as to allow for good response feedback to the fingers even as it demands only light keystrokes. It is both highly responsive and pleasantly easy on the fingers and hands.Also, the Chiclet key design leaves adequate spacing between the keys so as to reduce the likelihood of hitting the wrong keys... One of the major problems with any keyboard of reduced size. This is a blessing to any typist/word-processor with larger-than-child fingers, especially for an aging one like myself! I replaced my one of my former favorites, the Logitech K340 with this keyboard. The K340 has the more traditional keys which are miniature versions of the push-keys on a standard, wired keyboard.The K360, unlike the earlier wireless keyboard from Logitech which were all simple black gloss, sports five attractive design options including this pure white style so clearly reminiscent of Apple products. Beyond cosmetics and feel, the board is nicely designed and highly functional. The Hotkeys work perfectly and provide one stroke access to many basic computer functions; Forward, Back and Play/Pause buttons on top provide easy navigation of videos and volume mute and control buttons are easily visible and fully functional as well.The K360 also includes folding 'legs' on the underside of the top of the board, allowing for adjusting the angle of the keys to facilitate greater comfort of wrist angle in typing. As is the case with all/most wireless keyboards, there is no wrist rest at all. The battery life is rated at about three years of two-hour-a-day use.Other than the lack of a wrist rest, I found only one design oversight in the K360. It is not critical but is worth mentioning. Although the On/Off switch is in an rather obvious and visible place on the top right of the keyboard, there is no On/Off light to indicate whether or not the keyboard is turned on. This was a common feature on earlier Logitech keyboards that has been dropped from this one for reasons known only to the manufacturer.Notwithstanding that singular (minor) issue, the K360 is a fully functional, easy to install and attractive wireless keyboard; One that will not disappoint. It is a lovely example of what is possible when form and function join in near-perfect harmony.

 The system comes in a fold open, white cardboard box with an instruction manual, 3.5MM Aux cable and USB charging cable.The speaker unit itself has a small handle to help you carry it around a room or outdoors
 The 3Watt x 2 speakers put out a very robust sound for such a small device
 I enjoy playing music with this in my workshop since there are no power or audio cables needed when using Bluetooth mode.Playing MusicTo play music with the BOOMAX, simply hold down the phone button for 3 seconds and either turn on a Bluetooth device or plug in the supplied analog audio cable to a music player.RechargingFrom a complete battery drain, my BOOMAX took 2 hours 35 minutes to recharge using the USB 3.0 power port on my Acer Aspire V5 netbook

 The speaker system took over 10 hours to fully drain the battery inside
 As always, please make sure you recharge the battery after fully discharging it or you run the risk of reducing its full charge capacity.ConclusionWith multiple connection and charging options, the Mipow BOOMAX BTS1000 is a good choice for anyone looking for room filling sound from a small portable speakerbox.

Finally it arrived and I installed the necessary drivers, plugged in the card, and... Nothing.No troubleshooting I tried had worked. I verified that the slot worked by plugging in my younger brother's GT 610, and it worked fine. The card works too as it was fully functional in my brother's computer. Yet when I plugged it in myself, nothing I tried worked. Disabling the integrated graphics, using DVI instead of VGA, underclocking my processor just to ensure enough power went to the card, nothing.Wouldn't recommend this card as there is no guarantee that it'll work. Guess I'll just have to stick with my integrated graphics.

$REVIEW.: The price of the latest cards are always quite high, so I opted for a decent one that supports directx 10 that didn't hurt my wallet too bad

After installing in a Vista system, the Windows experience rating for gaming graphics is 5.4It came with drivers dated July 2008 and I downloaded the lastest ones from EVGA's website that are dated November 2008
Its a good sign that the drivers are updated because I once bought a video card that never had a driver update.This card will give the same frame rates as the GeForce 8600 GT, but at a slightly cooler temperature

Playing Crysis on 1400 x 900 with all settings high except sound
I averaged 60 FPS with no AA

Still playable with 2X AA.So its basically an update to the 8600 GT
So maybe buy whichever has the lowest price or best rebate at the time

I picked this one because it had a rebate in December.

$REVIEW.: This a sweet little pack ( not as wide since it's a laptop pack) but has more pockets then Indiana Jones could use. The best part in my opinion is the media pocket custom fit with a built-in cord and headphone jack for those who enjoy little music while they travel, that's neat and something that I wish more backpacks in general would offer, even regular packs, fumbling with cords is never fun.I wish the bottom was padded better, you don't want to put it down hard if your laptop is inside but other than that it's wonderful, sleek and very useful, a little heavy if you carry it in your hand but very comfortable when worn.

$review_text.: Amazon has now changed the product name and deleted "with software update"
I received an "iTouch with software update" on Aug 1st and found that it did not have the 2.0 software update


I was annoyed because I expected to save $10 by not having to buy the update from Apple
Amazon customer service told me to return it and they sent a new one

The new one also does not have the 2.0 software update but Amazon's misleading product description has now been revised.Its still annoying to buy a new product with a widely publicized new software update, and find that you have to pay Apple an additional fee ($[...]) to get what you expected


The primary new feature in 2.0 provides for access to the iPhone/iTouch apps store for purchasing new apps

This is nice but it does not justify a fee for upgrade
The iTunes update that is required for iTouch is free so why not iTouch 2.0 software too? If any other company shipped a product without current software they would rightly be blasted by the media


At the very least Apple (or Amazon) should include a $[...] rebate coupon to cover the upgrade.Otherwise the iTouch is an excellent, although somewhat overpriced product, with the excellent user interfaces and integration with iTunes that we expect from Apple

One complaint is that text can be too small for older people


It is possible to zoom text in mail and browser modes but it should be easily available in all modes.One star off for lack of current software, one star off for high price and text readability.

It's the perfect solution to the annoying task of wrapping the Macbook cable
I do wish the clip for attaching the AC plug was more sturdy and efficient; it wants to curl into itself rather than snap onto the cord as it should


If the manufacturer is reading, this would be a great improvement


Thanks.

$review_text.: I've used Klipsch speakers before, among others such as Bose, and thought their quality was very good.  This Klipsch GiG portable wireless system definitely has its uses but, in my opinion, the price point is a bit high.  The unit feels solid, the build quality is very good although the functionality leaves something to be desired.  There's no reason a few minor buttons couldn't be added around the major volume controller, which would make more sense instead of having to press the volume knob once, twice, or thrice for various functions.  I didn't have any issues pairing the unit with my iPhone 5 and really appreciate the ability to not only play music but also serve as a speaker for phone calls.  Although the sound quality is good I wouldn't call it great.  You won't have trouble entertaining a dozen or so people in a room, but the size of the unit definitely limits its power and clarity.  Overall, this is a perfect product for someone who travels or needs a portable speaker system, if the price point was a bit lower and the functionality improved, I'd easily give this speaker five stars.

$review_text.: I installed this in my car by myself so that I could be sure it was done right. It looks really nice in the car and allows me to play songs from my ipod. The CD player also works. The problem is that the factory radio had better reception than this one. Yes, the stations still come in and they sound good when they do, but I've noticed when there are a lot of tall buildings around or other interfering environmental factors, there's a lot more static. I wouldn't say I regret my choice, but you might want to research something else.

$review_text.: This viewfinder extender does what it's supposed to do very well. It lets the shooter see the LED screen even in bright sunlight and magnifies the view enough to check focus on the screen. It seems to be ruggedly built and, contrary to some other reviews, the interior is even flocked to eliminate internal glare like the models costing 10 times as much. The only downgrade is the lack of diopter adjustment. The tripod socket attachment aligns perfectly for my 60D as long as I don't use the battery pack. A quick sew job with a few cents worth of material will let me attach the viewfinder with the battery pack installed. If you aren't made of money and aren't interested in showing your status with overprice gear, buy this one and save a couple of hundred dollars for some other gear &#8211; or to pay some of the higher &#34;affordable&#34; health care costs.

$REVIEW.: I got this a few days ago and went on a hike locally specifically to try it out.pros: It does what it says it will do, you can screw it into a ball-head tripod, level it, and then attach a camera.  It has click stops that hold the camera every 30 degrees or so.  This seems to match exactly the angles assumed in my camera's panorama mode (this mode shows the left edge of the prior photo to allow matching). If you carefully reach under the camera to turn the dial (and not the camera) you will get exactly the right angles.cons: The first day I had it, I was trying to see why the motion was so stiff, and it came apart.  This was not all bad since I was able to put a touch of grease in the innards to that it moved much easier and then reassemble it with thread locker.  It is made from plastic, so I think that a SLR might begin to tax it.  The bottom is open with plastic webs for strength, and it does not match the head of my tripod very well.  The rings on the bubble level are painted on some ridges in the plastic cover.  After a short (1/2 mi) walk in my fanny pack, there was noticeable wear and they are starting to disappear.  Without an additional bracket, it can hold a camera only in landscape mode.  (and I'm not sure about the coverage in portrait mode.)Other thoughts:  My hiking tripod is only a foot or so tall (to save weight), and so finding areas with large angle coverage w/o things blocking the view is difficult.  The first solution is to try and put the tripod on something like a table, and hope that it is not in the shot.  The second solution - a larger tripod - also brings a pan and tilt head, at which point I would not need this device.So I would recommend this if you are starting out shooting panoramas and want a aid to get the coverage right.  Or you are getting tired of panoramas that won't stitch together due to rolling the camera or going up and down in tilt.  It will handle this application and it is cheap enough that you can replace it when you decide what you need.  If you are serious, or using a SLR, you might want something a bit stronger and more durable.

$review_text.: I bought these for a long drive we were anticipating with my 2 year old son. We normally just give him a movie on a cell phone to watch but it gets frustrating to have your cell phone stolen everytime you get in  a car. We've had this player for a few months and it works just fine. Not the greatest quality picture but it's more than satisfactory for the price we paid. Given the audience it's for its more than sufficient.I haven't had the screen problems that everyone else talks about and my son loves to kick his screen when he wants the movie changed. Over the next few months I'll see how the quality holds up but so far I have to say it's awesome.The only complaint I have is that the power cords are a bit too short. If you have a large SUV you will have to be very mindful of which side you put the primary screen on and making sure it's close enough to the socket. That's the only reason it loses a star. Also, a cheap $.50 apapter to plug in a standard wall socket would've been nice.I would recommend to anyone to buy as long as you keep in mind what you are paying. This isn't a high def package nor is it priced like one.

$REVIEW.: This is a nicely made enclosure, providing both esata (with power) and USB 3.0 (bus powered) connections.  The locking mechanism on the top works well, and the ejection device tied to that top cover is a nice feature.. when it work correctly..There are some major flaws in this unit.  First, and most critical if you are using any SATA III devices, the unit does not support SATA III speeds across the USB 3.0 bus. This became evident when comparing this Anker product with its sister product:Anker%C2%AE Converter Adapter Cable includedWhen utilizing Western Digital 7200 RPM Scorpio Black 2.5 inch drive, both Anker devices worked well, with the Adapter Cable marginally faster, returning read/write benchmarks (both random and sequential) perhaps 5% better than the Anker enclosure chip set.Where the real failure comes into play, is something like a Samsung EVO Pro SSD.  In that case, the Converter Cable, powered solely by the USB 3.0 bus on a Macbook Pro Retina (Early 2013 model 15.4") provided true SATA III speeds across the USB 3.0 bus.  I can confirm what others giving 1 star have reported..  The SSD speeds are more reflective of SATA II speeds, which are half of SATA III speeds.  In addition, an SSD is too thin for the ejecting mechanism to work, but given the lack of SATA III support, I would not be using the new technology SSDs in this device.So, for a 7200 mechanical drive is works well, is built nicely, but again fails to deliver what the simple cable connection offering does with a high speed SATA III SSD..  If you are part MacGyver, and have an older spare inexpensive 2.5" aluminum enclosure, you can make a nice enclosure for an SSD and then attach the cable connector to the SSD from the outside...The other upside to the Cable connector is that it comes with a power supply with a 12V connection.  The cable connector would then work (I've tested it) with something like a Western Digital 10000 RPM Velociraptor, which really delivers good performance across the USB 3.0 port and the Anker Cable.Hope this helps folks with some of the decision process.UPDATE January 10, 2014 : First, let me say the Anker support staff is exemplary. They REALLY want to help you as a customer. Anker was using the ASMedia chipset in this unit and changed to the NS1066 chipset. Anker supplied me with an older ASMedia based unit to try, but alas, it is still throttled at SATA II speeds.  My thought here is that since the enclosure supports both a SATA II connection as well as a USB 3.0 connection, they're using SATA II as the common denominator instead of providing SATA III / 6G and full USB 3.0 speed.  However, my review of their USB3.0 Cable Connector kit (which can run on Bus power or 12V with the included power supply) is an excellent offering, can be integrated (with a little imagination) into a strong portable offering for SSDs and power hungry 2.5" drives like the WD 10K RPM Velociraptor.  I remain very pleased with that offering.  Again my thanks to the Anker customer support team.. they're really top top shelf, and it is my understanding, Anker is going to update the description on the enclosure to be more accurate regarding throughput speeds..
$SUMMARY.: Good Enclosure but a Large BUT...

$REVIEW.: This is a great POV camera.  I use it to take video primarily while road cycling and mountain biking and it works great for that.  The sleek form factor and rotating lens mean that it can be mounted virtually anywhere and is barely noticeable.  In addition to the camera, I purchased aContour 2755 Flex Strap Mount for Contour Camerasso the mounting possibilities really are endless.  No matter what mount I use, I have gotten very good video from this camera on the 720p/60fps setting.  Even in low light conditions, I have gotten remarkably good video.  It does start to get a little grainy though as it gets darker.Downloading the videos to your computer is easy with the free software provided by Contour, Contour Storyteller. The only feature I find lacking from the software is video editing.  I haven't found any way to edit videos with the exception of adding GPS data, which is a feature I really enjoy.For those with certain smartphones, there is a way to change the video settings on the go without a computer.  I purchased an adapter to connect the USB cable of the camera to my phoneSamsung SM-ET-R205UBEGSTD USB MicroUSB Connector for Galaxy Phones - Retail Packaging - Black.  Once it is connected, it is as simple as editing a text file, then disconnecting the camera and pressing the status button.  Once you know how to do this, it is about a 30 second process.  An added feature of this is you can also preview your video on your phone while the camera is connected.
