$review_text.: A few months ago, when my wife and I bought prepaid cremation services, the sales representative gave us a folder for recording personal information, wills, several types of checklists, contact information, finances, and other things that would be essential for the surviving spouse when one of us dies or is incapacitated, or for our designated contact if we died together. It's not pleasant to think about these things, but failure to record this kind of information would place an undue hardship on survivors, so it needs to be done and updated when changes occur.That's essentially the purpose of The Everything Binder, but the binder is far more comprehensive than the folder we received. The binder includes the obvious things, of course, such as medical history, insurance policies, investment accounts, real estate, debts, estate planning, and funeral arrangements, but it also covers some things that many people might overlook, like log-in information for personal devices and online accounts, obituary, and even directives about pets. I know from personal experience that having this information readily available when loved ones pass away is far less stressful on the survivors.The real highlight of the binder is the included CD. On the CD is a single PDF file (22MB) that's open for recording the same information that the printed binder holds. Since the file can be written to, it's very easy to revise the information, and if desired, the file can be emailed to other parties who you want to have it. The file can also be printed for ready reference.I haven't seen any other similar product on the market that's as comprehensive and flexible as The Everything Binder. It's an ideal way to record and update personal information for your own reference and to help others handle your affairs in case of your death or incapacitation.A review copy of the binder was provided by the author.

$REVIEW.: When a lot of Christians today hear the word "Puritan" is seems to be an automatic turn-off.  Synonyms like ancient, strict, straight-laced, long-winded, and more are used to summarize these great saints.  Joel Beeke and a team of authors have taken some of the great Reformers and Puritans and examined their prayer life.  When I read the Reformation chapter of John Calvin, I knew this book was a winner, but the Puritan Thomas Boston's chapter put this book over the top.  There are other great books on Prayer (Matthew Henry's book on Prayer methods, for example) but this book is unmatched in getting the reader to examine three hearts-(1) the heart of the Reformer/Puritan and his desire to commune with God is a most intimate way; (2) the heart of the reader of this book which examines (with some great questions) why my own prayer life suffers or excels in some main areas, and (3) the heart of God and His absolute delight to join with His Adopted Children (See Boston's chapter on adoptive prayer) and have such a rich and intimate dialogue full of openness and reverence in prayer.  I put this book on my "Must Read Again" shelf.

$REVIEW.: So - in this book there is no romance, so if that's what you are looking for then move on


 On the other hand there is a lot of sex


 The premise is a bit lame, but when a son comes home to see his dying father, he falls for his very very young step mother (a virgin no less)
 The son is apparantly so large that even prostitutes won't engage in sex with him, but this very small woman can handle him and more
 Of course our heroine becomes endagered by her association to her stepson and he comes in and saves the day


 We expect these plot devices, but it was really only a way to make him somewhat honorable
 I like books with strong male characters, but this man isn't even likeable
 It's fun to read as long as you don't get too invested.

$review_text.: Mallory's best friend talks her into coming to Hawaii to spend the summer.  Mallory has a plan to enjoy herself.  No complications, no boys, just hanging out at the beach and enjoying paradise.  But that gets blown out of the water the first day as Mallory gets off the plane and runs into Evan Ashford.  And boy oh boy do the sparks fly between Mallory and Evan.Sigh.  I wanted to like this one.  I really did.  I will say that I like some drama between the main characters.  But the constant breaking up, get back together, break up, get back together, makes it SO hard to read a book and actually enjoy it.  And it happened so many times in this book. Even when you really feel like two characters belong together.  Plus, I have to say that I'm not one of those who really goes for the story rolling over into book two, especially if it could have been tied up in book one.  I really felt like book one was a complete book at least until I got to the end and read the preview for book two.I liked the premise of the book.  Running into the guy that you are meant to be with, I just think in there something was missing.

$REVIEW.: Since I've been reading romance novels and gay romance novels I've never really read an actual love story
I kept waiting for something to happen to the relationship like it always does in some many novels
True the story was long but there again I wasnt use to reading a plain and simple love story one that dealt with life, love, and martial issues

Althought it wasn't the ending I'm typically use to I still found myself hoping it could have been different
But like the writer said this story is just the beginning
I hope Kindle write a story about Robert and how he had to cope with is resolve
Thanks again for another great story Kindle.

$REVIEW.: This book reflects the title 2 Good, once I begin reading this book I did not want to put it down.Madisyn O'Riely is a down to earth, hard working administrative assistant at Brandt, Anderson and Mallory Advertising and Aidan Coles, wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys.Adian is at the top of his career that is a good to honesty good guy, which love his privacy and tried to stay clear of the media.  Aidan dream was to always give back to the community that has been good to him and for Aidan he has the perfect opportunity to create an organization to open "The Mature Alliance" which is an organization to teach adults to read and help them get their high school diploma.  The organization need volunteer.Madisyn attend this party with her friend Keshia, who is so stuck on herself and only think about what a man can do or buy her. Keshia is looking for what she thinks will make her happy a rich man where she doesn't have to work and shop until she drops.  Keshia is the type of friend you keep close because she can't be trusted. She and Madisyn has been friend since junior high but soon Madisyn realize that Keshia was never her friend.  Madisyn is a size 14 who is confident and secure in her body.Once Aidan and Madisyn meet they both are smitten with each other but what Aidan like about Madisyn is the fact that she is not falling all over him she see him as a man not a football player who could do something for her but what she can do for him or at least the organization.I love this book because they start off as friend but end up falling in love with each other, of course with any relationship there are outside forces.  Keshia and Darnell but in the end love prevail.............Not only doAidan become Madisyn protector but Madisyn become Aidan saver they each help each other and this book will have you laughing and crying but you will not want to put this book down once you began reading.SmoochesLouise

$review_text.: As a teacher, this is exactly the kind of book I want my students to read. It is well written, engaging and insightful. The story is of a young brave who leaves his tribe in anger to find his own way in the wilderness. After months of wandering he returns with a far deeper understanding of what is truly important. The lessons learned along the way are lessons that many of today's youth desperately need to hear but told in a way that sounds more like sage advice than preaching. It is a message that has been highly effective as the Anasazi Foundation has been remarkably successful in helping troubled youth. I'm just hoping that by using this in the classroom, I can use it as prevention instead of a cure.

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  This one was another example of the benefits of having a Kindle - the ability to find quality, enjoyable writing that would be unavailable without e-books.  This novel offers an entertaining, though violent, story about people chasing a winning lottery ticket.  We've all read about lives ruined by winning the big money but who imagined how many lives can be affected, and even ruined, in the pursuit of the winning ticket?  There's actually some light humor intertwined with the violence (good and bad family dynamics, for example) and a nice twist to the tale near the end.  All-in-all entertaining and highly recommended!BTW, I was surprised at the number of poor reviews but on reading them I found that the reviewers had more complaints about profanity and (perceived) racism than the actual writing itself.  In my opinion the profanity was limited and the author provided realistic dialog and characters for the scenarios presented. My suggestion: read the plot description and check out the sample text provided and if the style is not for you then skip the book.  One reviewer panned the book after admittedly reading only "a few pages".  That isn't fair to the author or to those who rely on other readers' reviews of actual content to help them select new books.

He lets points  stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those  already in agreement.

$review_text.: This is a very good what to do with pasta book. Except for a recipe for a butter sage gnocchi (which is delicious) the book relies on premade pasta bought from the store. Pasta revolution would make an excellent companion book with Making Artisan Pasta: How to Make a World of Handmade Noodles, Stuffed Pasta, Dumplings, and More if you wanted fresh past, the cooking times would have to be adjusted.Pasta Revolution is from America's Test Kitchen. ATK rigorously tests recipes, finding the best ones to help us, at home, succeed. Many previous ATK cookbooks were lacking in pictures, the recipes would meander from page to page, I'm happy to say The Pasta Revolution is laid out differently, with many pictures of how the dish should look, and recipes fitting happily on one page so I don't have to flip around while trying to cook.When one says pasta, many people think Italian. and there are wonderful recipes in here for lasagna. ragu, spaghetti, etc. However, Asian recipes and culture are also heavy users of noodles, and I was thrilled to find many Eastern influenced recipes: Udon Noodles, hot and sour ramen, steamed Chinese dumplings, just to name a few.There are recipes here for the vegetarian also: Spinach lasagna, spaghetti with quickest tomato sauce, Soba noodles with roasted eggplant and sesame, just to name a few.

$review_text.: I just received this book and have only read a few chapters.  While I think there are ideas that have merit, the examples presented (that I have read to this point) are completely unrealistic.As one specific example, see Case History:  McKesson on page 31  -- MCK was bought at $93 on 9/25/98, has dropped to $70.56 one month later.  Here is an exact quote of Elias's strategy of selling covered calls to recover some of the loss:  "The investor sold five contracts (500 shares) January 1999 $85 strike call for $2.82 a share for total proceeds of $1410."  Sounds lovely!  But look at those numbers carefully:  he supposedly sold a call that was 20.5% out-of-the-money for $2.82 per share.  Never going to happen!If you're not convinced, let's run a quick check, using yesterday's (3/12/2013) actual stock and option prices.  MCK closed at $109.85.  So I open up my online trading account and look at calls pricing.  I'm looking for a 3-month forward call - the timing used in the example was January 99 calls bought in late October (one month after 9/25/98).  MCK does not have June calls, so we'll look at May and August calls (2 and 5 months forward, respectively), and see if they could possibly bracket this scenario.  We want a representative strike price, so we will come as close as possible to $85/$70.56 X $109.85, which would be $132.33 - this is the same percentage above the then-current current price of $70.56 as those January 99 $85 calls.  And what do we find?I find no May 13 call offered for a strike price as high as $132.  The highest strike price offered is $125, for which the bid is $.05 and the ask is $.15 - with no open interest.  Theoretically, I could write an order ticket for a $130 call, but if no one is willing to pay $.15 for a $125 call, they're certainly not going to be interested in a $130 call that is even further out-of-the-money.  The nearest we could come to Dr. Elias's $2.82 price would be an at-the-money $110 call, which is bid/ask $3.40/$3.60.  For the August 13 call, there is a $130 strike price call, with bid/ask of $.20/.35 - still a far, fry cry from $2.82.  You can check the numbers with your own broker.And this is not an isolated poor example.  In the next paragraph, the investor supposedly later sold a second round of calls, also 3-month forward, $90 strike with the current price at $85, and received $8.31 per share - for calls almost 6% out-of-the-money!  If you and I could do that today, we could retire tomorrow.  As I look this morning, a near-6% OTM call ($115) is $1.30/$1.40 bid/ask (2-month forward) and $2.80/$3.00 (5-month forward).I will continue to read, and plan to post a follow-up review, but I was so thunder-struck by these supposed real-life examples that I thought I should send up a flare right away.Also, a general comment - to the extent that I have read so far, I could sum up the entire content of Dr. Elias's book in a few words:  "Sell covered calls when the stock is falling, sell puts before you buy the stock (or when it is rising if you already own it), as a means of generating income from stocks that you own or want to buy - and here are 1,000 "real-life examples" of how I did it.  There also seem to be regular contradictions between selling calls (puts) when the stock is falling (rising) vs. when it is rising (falling) - examples are presented of both - but maybe I'll get clarification as I continue to read - and all criticism aside, I do intend to keep reading, because skeptical as I am about his examples, I do think some of the strategies presented could work under the right circumstances - just not to the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel extent that Dr. Elias claims.

All members of the community has to follow the rules of the founder of the mennonite religion, but Nomi cannot accept that. All through the book there is a feeling of Nomi not knowing herself, that she does many things against the religious rules.The story is full of 'weird' characters, but they are never describes as weird, it seems like 'weird' characters in the small town are pretty normal.The kindness part does materialize itself after giving the book's ending a few thoughts, and I strongly recommend this book. It is a very interesting story.

$REVIEW.: Marty Green is a vibrant young man who's life is forever changed when he has a stroke

While recovering at the hospital he meets Dr

Dakota Holden, who offers him a job at his ranch

Left in wheelchair and facing moving back home where he'd be under the thumb of his extremely over protective mother, he accepts the offer, gladly!From the first time Marty and Quinn meet, the attraction is evident and little is done to avoid it

But Marty is an emotional wreck
He has isolated himself and his sexuality from everyone, but he feels more at peace and at home on the ranch than he's ever felt before
When their families and circumstance threaten to dictate their lives, how can Marty and Quinn get past those boundries to build a life together.Once again Grey shines in his ability to convey emotions as we watch Marty struggle with his physical therapy in an attempt to walk again, hide his homosexuality from his family, and ultimately fall in love with Quinn


When Marty's father learns the truth and yanks him away from the ranch, and Quinn, will Marty resign himself to his overbearing family? Or will he fight to be with the man he loves?This was my favorite book of this series thus far

The individual struggles of each character was flawlessly executed, as well as the determination to just love each other
Marty is very young, confused and inexperienced

Quinn is more worldly and wise and he teaches Marty how to accept himself and be who he is, and most important, how to love
I laughed, I cried and at one point I thought my heart would break for these young men
And the sensuality and passion that was shown during the sex was amazing! Quinn is so tender and patient with Marty at times, but then other times they would set the sheets on fire.I definitely recommend this book, this series and anything written by Andrew Grey


He is the Nicholas Sparks of  the M/M genre with his ability to write any range of emotion, and have the reader actually feel them.*i received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: What I really like about this book, is that the authors do a wonderful job showing you how the super successful people had their starting points as well. They started with a dream, and then took action to follow though--to make their dream--their reality.All too often we forget this simple truth.One of the greatest psychological discoveries of the twenty century was NLP. Anthony Robbins did a great job promoting its practical application for the masses. The essence of NLP is that if someone could do something, you could copy him and achieve the same results.But beliefs need to start somewhere. That's where this awesome book comes in. it shows you in clear terms how other went from zero to stardom. Reading stories from the super successful will help you gain a strong belief in yourself. It will spark a flame of empowerment - that says "I too can be great!" Which reminds me of a great quote from Mark Twain that is very apropos:"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great."Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works

$REVIEW.: *****Such a pretty, pretty book, and SO much fun as well. I needed some creative inspiration, and this wonderful book provided it--it was a great kick in the butt! It is a beautiful book filled with the work of the fourteen artists interviewed. Packed with information, ideas, and stories that caused me to reflect on how I work and how different or the same I am from the various artists--this book was a lovely adventure.It is a book about how to befriend time when it comes to being creative. It's an opportunity to see how other artists view, manage, and befriend time, how they prioritize, weed out, organize, play, and get unstuck. The enormous variety in the ways each artist works helped me to identify what was and wasn't for me. And to get new ideas on other ways I might approach my work in order to have more time and be able to be more creative.My favorite chapter was on mental space. It was enormously validating for the way I think and work and for my preoccupation with creative endeavors and my living in my imagination.Even if you have a lot of art books already, you won't regret this purchase.Highly recommended.*****

$REVIEW.: First I want to say overall I liked the characters and story. The pace was good and the passion evident. I especially liked the many characters that entered, even briefly and I could easily see a series there. I liked the constant bitching of her co-workers. Some might think it a bit panto in it's basic nature but the conflict was entertaining.However, there is a 'but'. Although the author explained the made up words such as 'Shick' the constant use of these non-words was annoying to say the least. I wont go on but there are other examples. I was putting this minor irritation aside until Domenico (the hero) proposed in the staff toilets and although it wasn't his first proposal, it was the one she said 'yes' to (not very romantic).I need to stress - don't give up on this one. I was close to doing just that in the first chapter and a half but this just gets better. The mix between first person and third person was initially off putting but if you can overlook this the story won't disappoint. I am generally not one to dismiss a good story over grammar and spelling errors but I do acknowledge that it hinders some readers.The last quarter is good and clearly setting up the council pacs for future books. It is rare that I don't see a twist in a story coming before the end but I applaud the build up to the unfolding plot.I wish their story had been completed in this novel and not to be continued. There is enough content to write a series about other characters. I got this free but I would happily pay up to 4$ for it.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the premise quite a bit about someone who could fully remember past lives.  I thought Brashares researched the topic and had an interesting take on it and I would welcome reading the sequel and hope there is one.  Where the novel fell short was definitely the beginning.  It was a little slow to start and I wondered whether I was reading a teen novel about a boy and girl in High School.  Once Brashares got going with the back and forth between Daniel's past lives and Lucy's current ones, I began to get into it.  I admit, I had more of an interest in Daniel's, simply because they took place in a time and location I wasn't as familiar.  I liked the ending and because I have a huge place in my heart for New Orleans, I'm hoping the story continues there.  Worth the read, but mostly if you are interested in the concept of reincarnation.

$review_text.: It is the twenty-fourth century and human society has reached a new level. Everyone speaks Earth Common and countries do not really exist anymore. Everyone has their own Artificial Intelligence that can look like anything from a balloon with a face to an animal, but which can never look like a human.This world refuses to forget its history and so there are places called History Camps all over the place where people reenact and live like those from the past. The History Camps help children to learn valuable lessons...especially those known as "hard cases" who cause undue mischief and who do not appreciate what they have around them.Three such hard cases are thrown together at a History Camp that emulates Verona, Italy in the fourteenth century. Hansum, Shamira, and Lincoln are given new identities and roles in this pre-Renaissance society. With the help of a holographic genie, however, they still aim to cause mischief and ruin the History Camp Elders' plans. But their mischief attracts a History-Camp-Elder-turned-time-traveler from the future who sends the three teens to the actual fourteenth century Verona. It turns out that History Camp is a far cry from the real thing.The teens begin introducing future technology into fourteenth century Verona with the help of Pan, the genie, and their antics may change everything. They may even change the future.I had a hard time getting into this story at first. It may have taken me about one hundred or one hundred and fifty pages before I started connecting with the characters. Maybe it was the very different twenty-fourth century world that kept me disconnected for so long, but I think the characters played a part in that as well. Maybe it was because of how spoiled they were at the beginning and how they were so unwilling to learn. I am not sure. But as I kept reading, I started to connect with the characters slowly, but surely, and the story steadily became more interesting.I enjoyed the differences between the twenty-fourth century, the fake fourteenth century, and the real fourteenth century. All three "worlds" were unique and gave Hansum, Shamira, and Lincoln different things to think about.The main character is Hansum who looks like how his name sounds. The reader learns quite a lot about him, but the story is told from different third-person points-of-view so the reader gets to know all of the characters. He, Shamira, and Lincoln become like family throughout their ordeal and they also become close to the medieval family they lodge with. Hansum and his new Master's daughter, especially, become close, giving Hansum an extra incentive to make things work in this century.The Master is a lens maker who makes "discs for the eyes". Hansum and Lincoln are his apprentices and Shamira is the house girl. With Pan's help and Shamira's artistic eye, however, they all become almost expert in lens making and even introduce the telescope ahead of time. Over one hundred years ahead of time. Introducing technology into the past can be tricky business and it really changes the lives of the teens.I ended up enjoying this book. I was disappointed that it was slow for me to get into, but I am sure that is just personal preference rather than any fault of the author or story. There is a lot of adventure in the book as well as a bit of romance and things heat up in both areas towards the end and really peaked my interest. The Lens and the Looker is the first in the History Camp Verona Trilogy and I do look forward to reading the next installment.Read this review in its original format at The Musings of ALMYBNENR: [...]

$review_text.: I had high hopes when I read the synopsis of 2:32 A.M.  I have never read a book about genies, except for Arabian Nights, so I was expecting something fresh and new, but I was sadly disappointed.  This story is fresh and new, but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The writing style is terrible, it is written as though a high school student wrote it and didn't proof read it before turning it in, I am a teacher and have experience with this.  The plot concept is interesting and fresh, but the book was very difficult for me to get through as I want to pull out my red pen and make corrections every couple pages, which could be problematic since it is an ebook.The story jumps around a lot, time passes very quickly, it is a bit disconcerting.  There is almost no development of the characters, except for Cat, but even then what we learn is mostly superficial.  All of the other characters are static, even her brother, Hayden, and her boyfriend, Todd.  Her female friends are even worse.  They are all terrible examples of females, though quite stereotypical when it comes to high school cheerleaders, though they are not cheerleaders, more like football groupies.Sex is a big part of this book, do I have sex with this guy that I have a superficial relationship with or not?  Will he stay with me after, even when he goes away to college on a full scholarship as the most sought after quarterback?  Lord, help me; I want to slap Cat in the face most of the time.  She is so super annoying; I can't seem to figure out what makes her so special.Then Cat goes to summer camp and completely forgets about Todd once she meets the blond guy from her dreams, Rolf.  I am so confused by this change in her personality, it isn't like she is torn, she just seems like she has multiple personalities.  Then all of a sudden she is all about Rolf- but wants to keep Todd in the background, in case things don't work with Rolf.I could go on and on about this book, but I will actually get annoyed if I do and I don't want to ruin my day complaining about a book that had so much potential, but fell so short of the mark that it is unbelievable.If you want to give this book a try, please do, but it isn't a great book for teenagers since Cat makes having sex seem like something someone just does and doesn't even get mad at Todd when he tries to coerce her into having sex with him before he goes away to school.  As an adult, this book was so annoying, I stated a few reasons above, and I will not be reading any more books in this trilogy.I received this book as an ARC.  I do not get paid to review books; I do so in order to assist you in recognizing books that you might enjoy and also to assist parents and teachers in recommending appropriate books for your kids to read.Please read more of my reviews on my blog: sarahereads(dot)wordpress(dot)com

$review_text.: I won this book in the Member Giveaway through Library Thing.  The title really threw me, but I thought I'd give it a try.  Boy, I'm glad I did!  The author, Luana Reach Torres, did a wonderful job at describing what it may be like to be confused about sexuality. As the story unfolds, Katie,  a young teenage girl, thinks she is in love with a beautiful girl at school.  She struggles with the possibility of being gay and blames it on God. Her father is a pastor, which makes it even more difficult. After running away and becoming homeless, she finally finds her way back to God.  But you'll have to read the book to find out which path she takes.  This book is very well written, and with short chapters, it is a fast read.

$review_text.: Thorough survey of arguments in favor of survivalThis covers all the important arguments for survival of consciousness after death. D'Souza is also familiar with Ian Stevenson and the arguments in favor of reincarnation and he summarizes them neatly. This evenhandedness with the evidence was a bit surprising. Other Christian authors I have read commenting on the subject have been hostile, biased and haven't even bothered to read the arguments in favor of the belief system.  In the end, he isn't convinced that it is true (and neither am I), but he is fair in his treatment of the subject.I found some sections more interesting than others. I particularly liked the philosophical chapter dealing with Kant and Schopenhauer. But other chapters repeat a few arguments already familiar to those who have read "What's so great about Christianity".Overall, I know of no better introduction to the area of survival.

$REVIEW.: The Rock Star by Rick Soper is a very competent and intricately plotted novel. Perhaps at times too intricately, at least for my taste. It is obviously the first part of a series as a multitude of characters is introduced and their fates followed as they interact, cross paths and oftentimes antagonize each other.Thanks to Soper's clear-cut style of writing, i haven't experienced any confusion, but there were times where the sheer number of different characters and each chapter shifting focus from one to another took away from my sense of enjoyment and immersion in the book. Some plot lines were more intriguing for me than others, and the wait to get to the next 'installment' was a bit frustrating, making me impatient and at times wishing to commit the grave sin of skipping parts of the text. Thanks to some tight plotting i remained innocent of that sin, as the action would have otherwise been difficult to follow.I found the novel to be enjoyable, interesting and quite a competent piece, yet didn't experience the sense of pull to rush to the end, which i would have liked to. I do have to stress that this is in all probability due more to my reading preferences than to any failings the novel might have - because it really doesn't.

$review_text.: This book is as convoluted as its author. It maintains a flow of semi-stream-of-consciousness from start to finish, and what emerges are the memoirs of a man whose love of seafaring and considerable self-deprecation ("self-loathing" is a little too strong a term) has brought him to a sea voyage to Tahiti with a pick-up crew and his four children in violation of a court order. Hayden's story is it's own animal, going from the coasts of Massachusetts and Maine, to the forests of Yugoslavia, to courtrooms and congressional chambers and movie sets and finally to the high seas and South Pacific islands with a strain of fatalism and regret throughout. It should make for a downer of a read; instead, I found myself staying up and turning the pages to see what happened next. A great book.

I loved all of the characters and how the author presented realistic reactions with the situations that they were presented with.  I found that the love story between the two primary characters developed naturally over time and was not just based on sex, which did come later and was very romantic but, again, was not rushed or over done.  If this book is to your liking, I also highly recommend 'The Alpha Promise'.

$REVIEW.: DIRTY LITTLE ANGELS  by  Christopher TusaIn the beginning of this story, Mama has a miscarriage and big brother Cyrus (age 20) explains to Little Sis, Hailey (16), that "it's like a ball  of meat squirming in Mama's stomach."  The reviewer begins to wonder if this is a little angel.  There are references throughout the story, tombstone statuary, and Cyrus and Hailey themselves, that make one wonder just who the little angels are.  The answer is, there are dirty little angels throughout this tale.Cyrus is the really bad boy we love.  He cares for his sister Hailey, tries to guide her down righteous paths, protect her from dangers, emotional hurts, even physical harm.  The other side of Cyrus involves Hailey in his illegal, immoral and risky escapades.  He takes it lightly when it involves drinking, smoking dope and attending little out-of-the way gatherings with illegal and illicit activities.  Cyrus has served time in prison, has a parole officer.  Good boy/bad boy Cyrus tries to make amends with the world, tries to do loving acts for Mama, tries to deal with Daddy.  Sometimes it just doesn't work.Hailey Trosclair is 16, smart, feisty, and steadfast. She loves her family and is loyal to Daddy, brother Cyrus, Mama, and school friend Meridian.  Loyal except when she is pissed off, hurt, abandoned or betrayed.  Mr. Tusa brings teenage angst to the forefront clearly and vividly.  The reader suffers along with the 16-year old Haley and empathizes.Yet as Hailey is revealed through the author's words, we begin to worry about her sanity: "cockroaches in my head"; "the world around me had become fuzzy and scattered";  "my thoughts were growing little feet and tiptoeing out of my head;" and later, "like my skull was cracked open and light was pouring from my head."  His phrasing is skillful, and vibrant, almost skin tingling.In other phrasing the writer also has the ability to capture language and paint a canvas of beauty, humor and wretchedness:"I stared out the car window, stars blinking through black walls of pine, the silver breeze crawling through my hair."He had a full head of black hair.

$review_text.: I consider this book by Victor Stenger to be the best book that summarizes and expands on the arguments of the New Atheists (NA's) between the years 2004-2009. There is no other book like it. Any serious attempt by future writers to summarize the movement and/or criticize it must deal with this one written by one of the NA's themselves.If someone had been hiding in a cave during these years and knew nothing about the NA's this would be the only book needed to understand it. The NA's mainly critique religion from a scientific perspective since they think science has a great deal to say about it. And they don't give religion much respect since: "Faith is always foolish and leads to many of the evils of society" (p, 15). The NA's thinking is best depicted by Stenger's often repeated phrase, that "absence of evidence is evidence of absence when the evidence should be there and is not" (p. 58).According to Stenger the NA's "preach a more militant, in-your-face kind of atheism that has not been seen before, except with the abrasive and unpopular Madalyn Murray O'Hair" (p. 25). Summing up the books written by Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, his own book, and Christopher Hitchens he concludes: "The atheist argues that empirical science and reason are the most reliable tools we have to determine truths about the world. The reason we trust reason and science, and have no trust whatsoever in religious arguments, is that science and reason work in understanding the world and making it a better place for humanity while religious argument leads universally to dismal failure and untold suffering" (p. 41).In my opinion this book is even better that his previous one, "God: The Failed Hypothesis." Of course, he is never better than when discussing science in chapters 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. When it comes to the design argument for God's existence Stenger writes: "Any Christian, Jew, or Muslim who accepts evolution, as do most scientists of these faiths, must be confronted with the fact that, according to the conventional interpretation, the human species is an accident" (p. 99).In this book the author answers such questions as: Can science study the supernatural?; Is science based on faith?; Can we trust our minds?; Do science and religion conflict?; Can science disprove God's existence?; Is any God consistent with science?; and, Do we need religion for morality? He also deals with questions like where the laws of the universe came from, the nature of the mind, and whether there is a soul. He even provides the reader with a scenario for the origin of the universe.Stenger takes a good hard look at the so-called atheist atrocities and the Christian atrocities too. For Christians who argue that suffering can be redemptive he writes: "What was the redemptive value of the Crusades or the Black Plague or the Holocaust? What is the redemptive value of one child dying of leukemia or millions of children starving to death? The redemptive value would have to be enormous to justify the huge amount of suffering involved in those events" (p. 141).Stenger seems to be aware of all of the important recent books coming from both atheists and Christians during this time period and he responds to all of the major criticisms of the NA's. There are at least a couple of notable exceptions, though. He didn't know about my book published in 2008. [*sigh*] But he's told me it will be mentioned in a reprint and in a second edition when that happens. [*Hurrah*] And he didn't mention David Eller's two books, "Natural Atheism" (2004) and "Atheism Advanced" (2007).This book is a great summary of the debate during these years and it further expands and argues on behalf of atheism. Highly recommended. If you're interested in the New Atheist movement then this is essential reading.------------I'm the author of "Why I Became an Atheist," and the edited book, "The Christian Delusion."

The book presents John's human and spiritual transformation in a religious culture that had many in a bondage of pride and laws.

$review_text.: One of the joys of the kindle era is that speculative fiction such as Vin Of Venus can be published. Not the kind of work a publisher would have looked at prior to it and what a loss that would have been.Two fantastically different genres dance together deliciously in this fusion of crime and science fiction plotlines. One of the most carefully and slickly edited e-books I have read in a while. The narrative flows wonderfully like hot butter from a pan. Intrigue follows intrigue and we slowly explores Vin's fantasies or are they, as he believes, memories?The critical reviewer could no doubt pick holes in it but I had far too much fun reading it. A good old fashioned action/sci-fi yarn with a twist. If like me you miss the likes of Farmer and Niven but also like your crime fiction then this one is for you. More please gentlemen!

$REVIEW.: By the Kindle cover design with two clearly separate photos pretending to be one image, supposed to fool us into thinking the old house is next to a lighthouse like the ones in this story, this Kindle book is obviously an amateur produced piece of work.  Yet the story itself reads like a professional piece, similar in style to the old style simple British style books or a city couple moving to a new town/isolated house in the country to discover all is not as it seems.  Although to my knowledge the author isn't British.  But the book does read that way, sort of reminds me of mild supernatural experience novels by authors such as Bernard Taylor.Thomas and Joanna move to their new purchase which is an old house next to a lighthouse.  It's a fixer upperer but the young couple look forward to the hard work.  On the first morning Thomas is having trouble getting the water pump to work so goes next door to the lighthouse.  While he's there an old woman suddenly appears who informs Joanna that the house is called Heather Farm and she used to live there. However Joanna seems to be the only person who ever sees this woman and the other visitors to Heather Farm.

$REVIEW.: The promise in the title of this (paranormal romance?) book, See You in Hell is pretty much kept in the book. Here is the rest of my review:Language: 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, ascending order of superiority.Typos, editing oversights: present, 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, ascending order of culpability.Characters: Reasonably developed for the most part. Author&#8217;s near-obsession with the protagonist almost throws other characters out of the spotlight&#8212;the key word is almost. I did find it difficult to accept that the object of the protagonist&#8217;s affections could be so weak, given that he has such a ferocious image.Story: Great. Gripping enough to make you want to read the promised sequel.Where that leaves me: I will read the promised sequel, which has actually been recently released as I write this review.Where that leaves you: With my recommendation&#8212;go ahead, read the book and the sequel. I found the one worth it, and about the other, I have hopes. I will let you know soon if they were met or belied.

$review_text.: Liberal vegan meets corporate carnivore

What could possibly go wrong?Never sleep with the boss


Ever
Thomas Stone has one cardinal rule and he broke it unintentionally when the man he slept with his first night in town just happens to be his new boss


His life is screwed up enough and the last thing he needs is another complication, which is exactly what Phil would be if he allows his one-night stand to develop into something more
But he can't seem to keep his hands off the man

What's a guy to do?Philip Sorrells is thrilled to discover that the new bartender his manager hired for his restaurant The Happy Onion is the hot little blonde he slept with and can't forget


Thom is Phil's dream come true, from his angelic face to his fiery temper
For the first time, Phil hears the siren song of monogamy and he's tempted to follow it


But Thom, who had a very bad experience with his previous boss, decides that his personal health and welfare are too important to risk even for the hottest sex he has ever had and he tells Phil that as long as he remains in his employ it's hands off

Then the original job for which he had been hired is back in play and romance is in the air once again
But things don't run smoothly for our two lovers - Phil is a nature-loving tree hugger and Thom sits on the other side of the fence as a corporate climber


These differences in ideology raise their ugly heads time and again and threaten their fragile bond
Thom and Phil find that their new relationship may not be able to sustain the pressures of everyday life.Hunky 6 ft Phil and small, gorgeous, blonde Thom have an unlikely sexual relationship as Thom is the Dom in bed and out of it and Phil can't get enough of his `little' man, whom he lovingly calls "Bubbles" for reasons you can read about in the book


What I really love about this couple is that no matter how mad they are they always look out for each other
The sex was truly exceptional and enlightening
 I don't want to spoil some of the surprises in the book, but I would like to know where the author conducted her research and did she use live subjects

The sex was hot as a poker just out of the fire, smooth as butter and when you mix in the emotion emanating from Thom and Phil you get an incendiary, combustible explosion.The dialogue in The Happy Onion is sparkling, fresh and incredibly funny and the characters of Thom and Phil are so real and three dimensional you wouldn't be surprised to meet them in the local vegan store or neighbourhood bar


The twists and turns of the plot kept me engaged until the end and the villains were very well drawn and realistic
Ally Blue is a truly gifted writer

The Happy Onion rocks!

This book made me cry and laugh.  My heart went out to Cooper.  Great romantic story with wonderfully written love scenes, humor and a little suspense.The only thing is my version on Kindle was missing text.  Throughout the entire book there were unfinished sentences and entire paragraphs missing when I would turn to the next page.  It was so frustrating and disappointing.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the whole series.  At times different forms call for my attention and the additional selection is definitely appreciated.  The variety is quite good.  They range from simpler to complex, with open spaces which leave room for my own variations.  The author's designs seem to create a sacred space in which the individual's own light can shine, even if all they want to do is simply "color" a bit.  I would expect this flexibility to make them accessible to people with widely varying skills: children, many disabled persons, the elderly, the imaginative and the gifted artist, as well and most of us who are somewhere in between.  Yet they are undemanding so that no one need miss out on the calm center and its healing.

How it all ties together. Debbie does a wonderful job of keeping the story moving and solving all the mysteries without missing a beat.

$REVIEW.: When I am in the mood for a sweet, hot erotic romance that has a strong alpha hero and that special woman in his life, I reach for a story written by Anne Rainey. The first tale in Ms. Rainey's "Cape May" series, "What She Wants" is about a hard working young widow who has etched out a living by turning her home into a bed and breakfast following the sudden death of her husband 2 years earlier. While Summer Chase keeps very busy seeing to the day to day running of her little establishment she hasn't been involved with a man since she lost her husband and is lonely. Then sexy as hell Gage Knight arrives for a one week stay at her B&B; and sparks fly.Once Gage does a little gentle prodding and learns that the lovely Summer isn't involved with anyone he wastes no time and asks her out. This is a short story and their relationship blossoms into intense intimacy quickly. It is also a Samhain "Red Hot" contemporary romance, and is sexually explicit. Ms. Rainey writes sizzling love scenes, and while her heroes do tend to be dominate alpha males she always adds just the right amount of tenderness and kindness making them that much more appealing.Gage has no intention of staying in Cape May, New Jersey, or settling down. He has a lucrative private investigation business in Ohio, he therefore has some decisions to make when he develops strong feelings for Summer. And, Summer knows Gage will be leaving after his one week vacation and she resolves herself to the fact she will have to say goodbye. Summer struggles with guilt over their hot and heavy affair and for developing feelings for Gage in such a short span of time. She feels this sullies her husband's memory.I loved the setting of "What She Wants", Summer's B&B; overlooks the ocean, it is very picturesque, Ms. Rainey writes with a sensuous descriptive prose that makes Gage and Summer's story all the more special. If you enjoy a hot erotic, contemporary short story, you may like to give "What She Wants", a try.

$review_text.: Rescue Heat is an enjoyable Australian romance set in the north of Queensland. Dr Brigid Adair is a doctor with the Cairns helicopter rescue service, a job she loves for the unique professional challenges it presents every day. When Matt Roberts, an ex US Army medic, joins the crew, Brigid is suddenly faced with a very personal challenge - denying her attraction to her new wealthy, sexy and handsome partner.Rescue Heat starts strongly as Brigid is lowered to treat an ill diver on a deep sea platform and I enjoyed learning a little about the varied role of rescue helicopter teams who deal with urgent life and death situations every day, from searches at sea to assisting with major car accidents. It seemed a shame though that the author didn't really take advantage of the dangers inherent in her protagonists professions to inject more action into the story. I was hoping for a little more edge that would exploit the unique setting and the potential for drama.I really liked the way in which Brigid is portrayed as a confident and competent woman and doctor, she is a strong and likeable character. Matt is the more vulnerable of the two protagonists, still hurt by his ex girlfriend's recent betrayal and adjusting to civilian life after years serving in war zones. Hamilton develops the chemistry between the pair nicely and the intimate scenes are (ok, I am never sure exactly how to describe these scenes) arousing(?), well written anyway.Rescue Heat is a pleasant, quick read that should satisfy fans of contemporary romance set in an exotic locale.

I'm a little fascinated by Sean, in case you couldn't tell :) It picks up right where AR12 left off, and we're able to see how things progressed and who was after them. The story has Sean going back and forth between showing his affection for Avery and pushing her away. I just can't figure out if he's bipolar or afraid to show how he really feels. It's probably a little bit of both.We saw some old familiar faces, both ones that were good, and ones that had me wanting to scream at my screen! I hope the next Proposition and Trystan's story come soon, I don't think I can take the suspense!AR13 had all the feels - joy, despair, betrayal, shock - and I can't wait to read AR14! I need to know what happens next, and I need reassurance that putting all my faith in Sean isn't the wrong decision! Ahhh! H.M. Ward - how can you do this to me?!?

But I can say that I found this book to be highly motivational (made a couch potato like me want to jump up and grab a foil right now -- fortunately for some poor maitre since I lack all depth perception, I restrained myself), and a strong proponent of some notions I'm pretty fond of: Self-discipline; initiative; perserverance; doing things the right way, not the easy way; facing your fears; standing up for what you believe in, even when -- ESPECIALLY when what you believe in is unpopular or 'old-fashioned' or 'unrealistic.' It's about substance and style, means and ends, and at its most basic, it's about the moral choices we face every day. I'm a financial analyst, not a fencer, and I got a lot more out of this book than a whole week in the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People seminar.

The book is well designed, the explanations are clear, the photos very nice.Negative: I found the designs somewhat repetitive. How many shrugs and shawls do you really need? There are a few good ideas in here, the rest is 'filler' IMHO.But anyways, I got the design I wanted so I am happy.
$SUMMARY.: It's ok

$REVIEW.: I love this book. I read it from cover to cover and enjoyed both the descriptions and the variety of recipes. There is something for very taste and there is pretty much a variation for every recipe so if you don't like something you may like the variation instead. As for hard to find ingredients, I completely disagree. Hemp seeds and custard powder are both available in my local chain supermarket and in the book Carla gives suggestions for substitutions for custard powder that is completely accessible. As for kid approved, I don't know any kids that won't eat sweet tasty baked goods or fruit, it seems like sometimes all my kid wants to eat is fruit, especilly mangoes! There are definitely goodies that would be more suited to a grown-up palate but Vegan bake sales are pretty much a standard for fundraising so there is definitely a place for them in this book. Kids aren't the only ones who like treats. I love that there are so many recipes packed into this book and variations on pretty much every one so I will have lots of new goodies to try out. I especially love the beginning section where the author covers how to adapt cakes into cupcakes or muffins into mini muffins or tea loaves. So helpful!  I also appreciated the tips for preparing for a bake sale including a note on allergies. Love this book!

$review_text.: What a tragic and sad way for a story to start. Oh my heart went out to Max. To lose your father, step mother and step sister all at once, in such a horrible way. So very heartbreaking. But Max seems to take it in stride or does he?A dead senator, his wife and step daughter gone in a blink of an eye. Max, the remaining son is left to try and pick up the pieces and prove the FBI's findings of murder-suicide false. He believes his family has been framed. He turns to his teacher and long time family friend Kensington who in turn contacts Jack Russell (yep that man who walked naked through the park in The Compass). And so the adventure begins.The hunt is on to find out why his family was killed and frame. Missing letters may hold the clue, what was in them, does a possible sole survivor from a long ago war hold the key? One really angry FBI agent, who I personally think either is holding a grudge or has a secret. An American with an attitude, an Englishmen who likes it clean and by the book and a college student bent on clearing his fathers name. Can they find the WWII Corporal, can they put the pieces together? Can Max clear his family's name?The Phoenix Reich is just the starter to Max's Adventures but wow what a start like a BANG from the 4th of July Fireworks this book is out of the gates and running - sit back and enjoy this ride because if the rest of Max's adventures are like this book we are in for one amazing roller coaster of a ride - sure to beat anything at Busch Gardens.

Just, wow! This story is an example of why I love this author's work so much

She knows how to pull you in and keep you on tenterhooks until the very end of the story.I started reading this in bed when I woke up and I didn't want to put it down to sort out the kids for the school run
Luckily it was a short story and I managed the read it all in the space of an hour or so.I totally fell in love with Blake and know exactly why Paige fell for him
He is controlled, compassionate, loyal and always wanting to please others


I don't know too many men who'd still be as good-natured after what his wife did.And don't get me started on his wife

I believe in the sanctity of marriage but any woman who behaves the way she did deserves what's coming to her

And boy, did she get it
When Blake blew his top, it was of volcanic proportions and I loved him even more.Seriously if you love erotic short stories, then you have to read this one
This is a keeper! I love, love, love it!

There are so many, we-killed-Earth-and-had-to-find-a-new-planet stories, that after awhile they all seem the same.I couldn't put Tankborn down. Stayed up late into the night reading, and immediately ordered the sequel upon finishing Tankborn.Kayla is tankborn, a genetically engineered 'human'. Taking a nod from India, Sandler creates a caste system where tankborns are the bottom rung. They are raised by assigned nurturers, and at the age of 15 are given their assignments. The job that they will do for the rest of their lives.Kayla is assigned to Zul Manel, a member of one of the true-born families. She quickly becomes friends with Zul's grandson, who is part of a movement to overthrow the current government.This is a fabulous story, well worth your time and money.

$REVIEW.: This is the second time I'm reading Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha in a new translation by Sherab Chodzin Kohn. The first is translated by Hilder Rosner. I believe the translator is a practicing Buddhist. Inevitably, his version is tinged with a stronger Buddhist flavour than the original translation. Nonetheless, the lyricism of the prose is retained, and I find it no less poetic.Siddharta's intellectual pride makes him reject all teachings, including the Buddha's, to seek his own path. That path leads him to samsara, to material greed and desires of the flesh. And when he thinks he has found the one true path at the river, his former lover brings him a son, and he has to go through the pain of severing that final manifestation of ego all over again. All these, Hesse concludes, are part of the lessons that the seeker has to experience in order to find the  truth - a truth that is beyond words, beyond the duality that hides behind words.This time round, I'm also more profoundly affected by the different characters in the book, and the human bonds that tie them to Siddhartha. Each of them stands for a human condition, and yet Hesse, with great economy of skill, is able to make them fully fleshed-out characters.Govinda, in particular, strikes me as a most moving character. He's not too bright, this Govinda, but he's earnest, loyal, and sincere. The two times that he meets Siddhartha along the river are the most touching episodes in the book.  It's telling that Siddhartha reveals the summation of his long spiritual search to Govinda in the final chapter. Two old men, once the closest of friends, sit beside a river under the setting sun, discussing the ultimate truth of life. It is the calmest of images, but the questions asked and the answers given vibrate with cosmic significance.Read Siddhartha for an immensely poetic rendition of the spiritual search into the true meaning of life.

$review_text.: ...you're going to love Reed Coleman's Moe Praeger series.  Perhaps more than any other contemporary author, Coleman's believes as did Faulkner that "The past is never dead.  It isn't even past."Praeger once again in this fourth in the acclaimed series gets involved with the case of an old friend that tosses up more confusion than a House of Mirrors.  In this case, the death of an old friend and how this ties back to a long forgotten murder case on Coney Island in the 1970's.Coleman is at a disadvantage here in that he has to follow his excellent The James Deans, which really raised the performance bar.  I enjoyed this book almost as much , but the repetition of some of the Praeger family tensions for a fourth time is getting old.  Coleman needs to find some new things to push Praeger forward.As usual, the sense of place is well drawn and his characters (mostly) deserve our sympathy.  However, the series is getting a bit long in the tooth.

$review_text.: As a person who has read Garda: Welcome to the Realm, I was eager and anxious to get started on this book.Let me start off by saying I intended to pace myself with this book, knowing full and well how easily I get wrapped in this authors prose, and successfully adhered to that pace for one night. The second time I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down. I literally stayed up until 3:30 in the morning to finish it.The way Mrs. Eaton writes sucks you in. She uses her knowledge of the force without being too technical. Its like a character itself. Woven seamlessly into the plot and not so technical a reader not in the force gets lost. This is one of the biggest things I love about this author's ability to write.The story centers around Detective Liveon who, while doing her duty, guards a deep, dark secret. Shying away from the attention saving the Hollywood heart throb brought, she attempts to return to her life and the way it was until she's forced to protect him again. One of my favorite parts was a cameo by the author and previous book. That was a clever little detail that also gives a little bit more of the author and makes the story even more believable.The romance is intense, heated, and well placed.Though there was some predictability, there were also unexpected surprises that had me gasping, laughing, or staring at my book with my mouth agape.Really that's all I can say about it because I don't want to give anything too vital away. If you are curious about this book, get it. Believe me, you'll love every minute of it.*I was given a copy of the book for an honest review. My review will also be found on my site and Amazon.

$review_text.: If you have read any of my reviews you will see I am not fan of serialized fiction. Why? Because to me for the most part you pay a few bucks and only get so many pages. I read a lot. I've read nearly 50 books for the year so far so I am very adamant I get a bang for my buck so to speak. My sentiment is why not wait until there is more to publish and sell it as a collection. If you go through my reviews you will find me admonishing an author for doing so, and I also take no issue for calling out what I think is ridiculous. I also take issue with reviewers who basically summarize the book description with a few personal sentiments thrown in, hopefully if you pair my review with the book description you can decide if you would like to read this book. When I saw the first two episodes on Kindle for free and episode ten offered for free as well I figured well why not give it a try. Those authors are smart and sneaky ***turds. They knew that 99.9% of those who read the first two would be hooked. The first two novellas should be more than enough to develop a definite opinion. Needless to say I was instantly hooked.Length wise they are novellas and I am guessing if your considering buying season two you already read season one right? If not let me describe season one which is a post- apocalypse serial that is a hybrid of nods to pop culture (think to the Goonies nods in season one) and the blending of post apocalyptic fiction. Think The Stand meets Swan Song, meets the movie Pulse, meets The Shining meets the rapture meets the movie Slither. The premise is that in the middle of the night almost everyone disappeared and those who were left behind discover that there are monsters/aliens/ghosts and they are being hunted. Told from the point of view of many of the survivors, this is what would be considered in television as an ensemble cast. Many survivors also discover not everyone disappeared. As a few of the survivors make the horrifying discovery of bodies stacked like cordwood. This is one mystery that has yet to be explained. Some of the survivors are now "enhanced" and have abilities that should make survival easier. At least you would think. We discover at the end of season one that we were wrong in our thinking of what actually happened to those who went missing.Season two begins months after season one lets start with the bad. My main complaint is the grammar; however unlike some reviewers I do not dock points for grammar because self published books are bound to have errors. What's that point of docking stars if even with the errors you still enjoyed the book? Plus I'm cheap and self published books usually cost less so hey they skipped having a good editor to pass on the savings I'm not going to lament over it.  My second complaint is what happened to Teegan in season one there were a few chapters from her perspective? Besides that I feel that plotline had been neglected. It seemed as if she and her baby would be important in the future. Yet she is barely mentioned in season two. I just felt like there were too many loose threads and seeing there will be a season three I just have to let that go. I figure the authors will address them when the time is right. I also think there were some deaths that were just unnecessary, as there was no build up that indicated why these characters should die and why we the readers should be ok with it. If your looking for everything to be tied up in a shiny package with a nice little bow, your going to be disappointed. Remember Luis well Ryan is in the same boat right now and I would like to know how it's possible they lasted that long. Hint. Hint. I know you read these Sean. By the way where is Desmond? How could you do that to him? What about Charlie and Callie? Like I said loose threads, you have to try to let them go. It is not easy though.Let's move onto the good season two does answer some of the questions we all have been asking. While some issues like who is behind this are not directly answered it is hinted at. We do figure out where everyone went in October. Ed offers some answers to his plot as well when he teams up with Brent which I really liked because I think Brent needs to be with someone like Ed. Brent is to attached to the past and over emotional at times, for him to survive he needs to pick up a few moves from Ed. With Ed and Brent we get answers but were also left with more questions. We also get some more insight as to who Will is and at the end Wills story line is just one big brilliant, frustrating, confusing total cluster****.  Borico and Luca's storylines have also taken a most unexpected turn. John's storyline also leaves more questions than answers but the resolution was fitting. Just be prepared to finish this book thinking WTF. Fair warning though you will also be very pi**ed off. It is obvious to me that the writers have read enough apocalyptic fiction to know what works. It is also interesting how masterful and insightful they write the characters we should be weary of and how quickly someone can turn from a main character like Mary in season one to a supporting cast member in season two. There are a lot of characters in this book and it seems putting their story on the back burner is a very smart way to keep us interested. You know the saying too much of a good thing. The writers have taken that sentiment to heart it seems. My point, buy the book.

Tabby, Lex, & Vive are remarkable and very strong women

I loved getting to know Tabby in this book
She definitely wasn't handed good luck as a child, but with the support of her friends and her determination she overcomes everything


She becomes a very successful business woman and proves she can take care of herself

She's also a very loving and caring person who doesn't receive as much as she gives

Not until she meets the wonderful and charming Warner
He is very very passionate and goes after what he wants with everything in him

He is a successful businessman as well, so he has that power vibe that just radiates off of him

I loved reading there story

They both deserved happiness and love, I was so glad they found it in each-other


I was so ecstatic that Warner never gave up on Tabby, he kept knocking down her walls till she caved and gave in.This book was definitely a lot steamier than other books I've read, but it was still a great story
It all mixed well together.*ARC received from publisher

When Gabby moves out and moves in with Will she begins to have feelings for him but Will doesn't do relationships.As time goes on Will becomes jealous as Gabby starts going on dates with his colleague from the fire station.But it takes Will time to realise he is in love with Gabby that he had A Will to Change and follow his heart.I won't give much more away on this brilliant book because it is worth a read.I loved Cry for Hope and I certainly do love A Will To Change the are both worth a read from a brilliant author Beth Rinyu.

$review_text.: I decided to read Full Measures after several bloggers had recommended it to me - I'm really glad I made the time! From the very beginning Full Measures is really sad, we are instantly introduced to the potential tragedy of war


December 'Ember' Howard's Dad is killed working as a US army doctor.The heartache of the Howard's loss is so convincing and well written I was engrossed in Ember's story and wasn't surprised to find Rebecca Yarros is an army wife


For a lot of the book Ember is on autopilot and is left with the responsibility of caring for her mother and younger siblings

There's one scene in particular involving a mishap with a birthday cake which was particularly devastating and showed how Ember always puts the needs of others before her own.Ember's little brother Gus's hockey coach turns out to be the swoon-tastic Josh

Josh happened to be Ember's high school obsession
He's a wonderful character, who helps bring Ember back, helping her find her way after losing her dad.I worked out Josh's big secret fairly early on but was still surprised out how things played out

I really wanted Ember to see sense and work out what was best for her, but I guess she needed to discover things for herself


I do think Josh should have explained things to her earlier but I understood his reasoning; he is genuinely trying to do what's best for Ember.Don't get me started on Riley and her Uni friends (I use the word 'friends' lightly because they were horrible), he really was a terrible boyfriend.The secondary characters, mainly, her little brother Gus, sister April and Josh's best friend Jagger were great
I'd like to see Jagger or April get their own books (Jagger in particular) as I think there is definite more story to be told there.I would have liked to see Josh and Ember have more time together without the drama and see them develop further as a couple, but I was happy with the ending.4 Stars in my Sky!

$review_text.: This story revolves around a young, determined mayor who's tasked with tracking down a local drug trafficker.  Mayor Jason Boggs gathers together a team of both do-gooders and ne'er-do-wells, including a straight-laced lawyer (with a knack for magick), a bouncer/bounty-hunter, a priest, and a thief, in order to achieve his ends.  With references to the internet and the mayor, himself, playing video games in the opening chapter, you can't help but wonder if this book was inspired by a popular video game, itself, like Diablo or even World of Warcraft.  For some reason, reading this brings to mind Don Quixote, minus the more flowery prose, of course.  This is a very earnest tale, written by someone who clearly loves Indianapolis, and it's a very interesting setting for such a quirky take on the band of brothers trope.Strangely enough, this book also reminds me a bit of the TNT series Leverage, which revolves around a ragtag group of white hats and black (or at the very least, charcoal grey) hats banding together to do the right thing.I do have to agree, though, with other reviewers who mentioned that the formatting of the book is very poor and distracting.  I'm sure what happened to the formatting, but having the book reformatted could only stand to help.  The way the book is, now, you can't even tell where the chapter you're reading leaves off and the next one starts, until you're right on top of it, so to speak.  Also, I found it a little odd that the writer would try to tackle subject matter such as this -- drug trafficking and such -- and feel the need to censor expletives from the character's dialogue.  One would think that adults would be reading this, so I'm a little confused by the entirely unnecessary 'bleeping'.

Also wasn't to keen on how the epilogue ended, could have being a little more romance to it.Hope the next book won't take to long in coming vey much looking forward to Vaughan and Henrietta's story.

$review_text.: (first read in 2008)For anyone new to Rough Rider&#8217;s series LHR was the first book.  The root of the series is about 4 McKay brothers and their families. Their children are who the books are about along with plenty of background on the 4 families. The McKay&#8217;s made their living as ranchers and most of their children went on to also become ranchers but some also were rodeo stars and others in various jobs from construction to law enforcement.The series evolves over a lot of world building (even though this word is typically used with science fiction I feel it pertinent here).  Sometimes the first book in a series can be overloaded with backstories and characters as you are introduced to it. LHR really didn&#8217;t really do that. It was the books that preceded it that got to the heart of the Mckay family and all the things you come to love about the series with each book. LHR was a look at life on the road for Colby McKay who was a bull rider and calf roper. Colby traveled the circuit with Trevor and Edgard and the three of them in between shows were never short on women. When they run into Channing Kinkaid on the road and she wants to join them on the road and agrees to be their personal buckle bunny things start changing in the relationships between all of them.I didn&#8217;t really like Colby through most of this book. Its funny in every book after this one I did but in this one he was a bit too arrogant and he needed to be brought down a peg or two.This wasn&#8217;t the first book I read in the series when I started. I happened to find this author right after she released the second book in the series and I loved that book so then came back and read the first one. If your just starting out on this series don&#8217;t base an opinion off the first book cause every book after this one rocked and you&#8217;ll come to love all the McKay&#8217;s and their family drama.

As someone who blanches at the very mention of the technical side of computers, I wasn't at all sure what to expect from this book

But the author has managed to turn what I would have assumed to be a very dry subject, into a fascinating read that includes the background of the programming industry and an overview of the field for anyone considering a career move in this direction.

$REVIEW.: Let me just start by saying that I love all things Sarah M. Eden.  She is such an amazing writer.  She is so talented, and has such a way with words.  Her books grab you from the moment you open them.  This one is no different.I have been dying for this book to come out, and then when I got it, I didn't get to it fast enough.  My daughter stole it first.  I had to listen to her &#34;hmms, and haaa's&#34; the whole time, and it about killed me.  When I finally got my hands on the book I couldn't put it down.  I had to find out where Katie's life was headed.The discrimination going on in these books is just mind blowing to me.  Why?  I just do not like discrimination of any kind.  It's hard to read, and hard to even think that it is possible.  Katie is the sweetest girl on the planet.  In this book she is even more fabulous.Katie does all she can for the Irish friends she has come to know and love.  In a time of difficulty she does what no one else would consider.  She decides to work for the store keeper who keeps raising the prices for the Irish.  He is such a mean man, and I didn't like him in the first book, and I don't like him in this book either.There are so many great characters in these books.  I love them all.  Tavish has such a funny personality.  He always knows how to make every one smile.  Joseph is such an amazing guy.  Great dad.  I love him.  He is the glue that holds the town together.  He is so considerate, caring, loving, and stern.  That doesn't seem like it would be a good characteristic, but it is.  He and Tavish love Katie.  It is torturous to read.  I love them both.  LOVE THEM!  It was so hard to decide who I wanted her to be with.  I am done with the book, and I am still trying to decide if she is with who I want her to be with.I cannot even tell you about this book too much because anything I say will give the ending away.  If you like the first book in the series, you will love this one.  It is such a fantastic love story.Eden does a great job of putting you &#34;in&#34; the book.  I read the book in an Irish accent...In my head it is a fantastic Irish accent :).  I don't think you can help but do an Irish accent.  The writing is that amazing.Pick this series up if you haven't yet.  You won't regret it.

$review_text.: I found this book to be interesting and easy to read, but yet containing loads of useful information. It is a fascinating view of how to start analysing portrait photographs taken by other photographers, and how to start planning my own portraits. Knowing and understanding the why's and how's of posing my subject, as well as what to look out for with lighting using window light or natural light is going to be what starts making the difference between all those "Facebook photos", and portraits I would be proud to put in a frame. For me, the descriptions of what to look for and how to identify the shadows on the face were particularly useful, and now I find myself secretly analysing shadows and light whenever I look at people's faces.

$review_text.: Yours Affectionately, Jane Austen is a beautiful love story, romantic and poignant, laced with tenderness and tinges of sadness.  This novel takes up where The Man Who Loved Jane Austen ends.  It continues the lives of Eliza Knight, Fitz Darcy and Jane Austen. Although I would recommend reading The Man Who Loved Jane Austen first, it is not absolutely necessary as the author gives enough background without being redundant to make Yours Affectionately, Jane Austen, a stand-alone story.Eliza and Fitz have each feared getting close in a relationship, but are inexplicably drawn to one another. Because of these strange new feelings they want things to be right. They continue to see each other but are taking their relationship at a slower pace. In the meantime, an event is about to take place in 1813 England, an event that could change everything for Fitz and Eliza.In this tale, the time traveler is Robert Simmons, Edward Austen's stableman. With Jane's help, Simmons goes through the portal to the strange new world of machines and electronics in present day England. He is in search of Mr. Darcy who made a lasting impression on the young man by his kindness and fair treatment of him. He appears at the estate from where Darcy had disappeared in the previous book. The owners are friends of Fitz Darcy and take Simmons in, giving him a job working with their horses.When Darcy gets a package from his friends at Windsong Manor in Hampshire, with contents that can only mean one thing, he soon departs with Eliza for England. The questions raised, the answers sought and the story that unfurls is filled with intrigue and romance.The bond between Jane Austen and Fitz Darcy is ever present. That chance meeting has affected their lives in ways that neither could have imagined. Ms. O'Rourke spins this tale in a way that makes that meeting seem plausible and true. In my mind Fitz became the `real Mr. Darcy', the man that loved Jane Austen and was loved by her...but how does this effect Eliza? What is her chance of being loved by Jane Austen's Darcy? The road to these answers will keep the reader enchanted.At times going from Pemberley Farms to Windsong Manor to Chawton Cottage was a difficult switch although I knew each change was necessary to the story. With reluctance to leave one setting I read on in eager anticipation of the next visit there while totally immersed in the new setting.Yours Affectionately, Jane Austen is a touching and lovely fantasy. I truly loved reading a fictional story with Jane Austen as one of the main characters. I would like to think that she did know of the love and romance that she was able to capture in words and depict so memorably to readers for two hundred years. The tinges of sadness that I felt were for Jane herself and for what might have been.  I will not be forgetting this book any time soon as I was profoundly moved.5 out of 5 starsPG for no explicit sexMore Agreeably Engaged

$REVIEW.: This is a great novella, allowing us a peek into the psyche of the tormented, hate-filled character known as 'Murder-troll' in the novel that began the exciting 'Blemished' trilogy. We are given details of how Maggie became so beaten down by the hard knocks of life that she was unable to forgive or overcome, thus evolving into the bitter, spiteful person we see portrayed in Sarah Dalton's two full-length novels. It is interesting to see what motivates and provokes her to commit the evil things that seem to bring her such delight as Margaret Murgatroyd. In the end of this story we catch a chilling glimpse of her upcoming role in the third book of the trilogy yet to come. I, for one, am on the edge of my seat as I wait.

I want to discover the stories for myself.No synopsis can do Tiptree's stories justice. Her writing is hard as diamond, sharp as glass shards. Her stories leave you gasping, shocked, devastated with their bleak truth. Her stories are truer than reality because she so well understood the heart and mind of the human beast.Her stories are cogent, concise, terse and loaded with jargon. That's her way of dropping you into the maelstrom. Don't shy away from the challenge. Dive into this collection.

$review_text.: This is a thought-provoking short sci-fi story copyrighted in 1956 which contains an original rather clever idea about the human mind and about enjoying life on earth. A being from another planet, named Kcid, came to earth to help his fellow beings decide whether to settle earth, inhabit the bodies of earthlings, and live here. He is the second such being to come. The first seemed to enjoy life on earth so much he did not communicate his findings to his planet.Kcid finds that the earthlings are very backward and their science insufficiently developed. Some of their behaviors strike him as strange, especially their sexual desires. He also finds that they are different from beings in any planet; they have two minds, a conscious and a subconscious. The latter causes humans to do things that they would not want to do if they only used their conscious mind. Kcid finds that the subconscious leads to bizarre acts and what humans call insanity. He reports back that he wants to spend a vacation on earth.

Throughout the book I was astounded at the authors ability to relate the developmental deficits of the teenager's to the vacuous educational system that was a symptom of their failing society.  It was a fascinating contrast to the healthy development of the society on the planet Meridian.  I concluded the author was British within the first chapter due to slightly different use of language but he could quite easily been American.  To my horror, this could be the future of our children.

$REVIEW.: This is a thoroughly practical and readable book


The author gives a very useful and detailed explanation of how to effectively use this indicator - Bollinger Band

The author make the book simple, that one has to find a trading style to suit oneself, and is not overly proscriptive

The ideas are well laid out and easy to verify and equally applicable to stocks and commodities

In short, this book is excellent, and I hope it will take it's place on the traders sellers list.

$review_text.: This is an interesting murder mystery that touches upon several themes, including religion, truth, and community. It would have earned a 4 or 5 star rating though with the following edits:* no grammatical errors (&#34;passed&#34; vs &#34;past&#34;, really?)* less focus on the detective's alcoholism (took up too much unnecessary page time)* more focus on the female lead's perspective (the story materializes because of her father, you think she would have more of a presence)Overall it's an entertaining read that kept me excited but it may not be up to par for people who frequently read murder mysteries. I'm confident the author could go farther if the above points were addressed and s/he fleshed out certain themes or situations in more detail.
$review_summary.: Good story idea but needs a better editor

$REVIEW.: I'm a big fan of WWII thrillers, which is the primary reason I was attracted to this novel. Overall, it was a fun read and enjoyable. The plot was good, the characters had depth, and there were a ton of details about the life and times of the 1940s. In some cases the details seemed forced, as though the author was making use of all of his research. The ending was a little over the top and fairly predictable, but it tied everything together nicely. Overall, it's worth a read if you like historic fiction.This book was not perfect, however. There were several things that were distracting that diminished from the overall enjoyment of the book. Please note, I'm not a stickler for grammar. The only time it bothers me is when I need to go back and read a sentence or section more than once to determine the author's meaning. There were multiple instances of this found in this book. There were also multiple typos (misspellings, incorrect words, and an instance where the author typed "tell told" next to each other. I'm sure the latter was a correction that wasn't removed).There was another instance in which the reader is introduced to a minor character by name, the character has an interaction with one of the major characters, then we are told "the pastor did xyz." A couple paragraphs later, the minor character revealed to the other major character that he was a pastor. In other words, the reader as told something before it was revealed to the character. I had to flip back a few pages to see if I had missed something. I hadn't; the writing was just out of order.In my opinion, this book would have benefited greatly from a professional editor. As it is, I gave the 4-star rating based on the entertainment factor, and not on the mechanics of the writing. Overall, I would recommend this to fans of the era or genre.

Some were posed strategically so that no genitals or buns could have been seen. Others featured nice, firm bare asses and others featured full frontal nudity. All of the men were hairy, hot and hung. These men had the balls to bare their balls. Woof!

$review_text.: In the Shadow of Greatness is an excellent collection of first-hand narratives about their time as junior officers in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. Society's portrayal of modern veterans of the War on Terror seems to fall into two categories: soporific hero worship and victimization. Neither of these two stereotypes are accurate in telling the civilian public what it was really like.There are a wide variety of perspectives from men and women in all the major warfare communities in this book: the dull reality of war punctuated by moments of sheer terror, the frustration that serving as a Marine Corps or Naval officer is not as "great" as the recruiting videos made it out to be, and the stinging feeling of self-doubt. While it is difficult as a junior officer to recognize your sacrifice and contributions as you are getting yelled at by your executive officer on day 112 of an underway, the reflection provided in these stories tells a great and compelling series of tales in hindsight.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming a military officer or Americans who are interested in learning more about what a day in the life of the military is like. While I was an Officer Candidate School guy, I too received a commission as a Naval Officer in 2002 and was very proud to have served with this men and women and done my part. 5 stars!

 This Kindle Book is a short, sweet, down to earth starting point for newbies to the trade
 This little book contains useful lists of when things are in season, something that has been lost to many with the mass shipping of perishables from around the world


 Keeping in mind when items are actually &#34;in season&#34; and not produced using costly methods and expensive shipping that adds greatly to the price making it possible to take advantage of the real &#34;in season&#34; items when their prices are at the lowest
 The book also points you in the direction of other resources and techniques to investigate further.

$review_text.: I first learned about the Gospel of Barnabas in Kenya, from Muslim sources who proposed that this was the name of the original Gospel that "came down upon Jesus."  I bought my own copy in 2001 in Larnaca, Cyprus, where I found it in a used book store

 I kept it on my shelf until I read it in November 2007.This English version was translated from the Italian manuscript in the Imperial Library at Vienna


 This is the medieval apocryphal gospel claimed by Muslim to be the original Gospel [injil], which they say Christians changed into the four variations now included in the New Testament.Jesus Denies MessiahshipThe portrait of Jesus here has Jesus denying he is the Messiah, but announcing that Mohammad will come as the messenger of God, and will be the Messiah for all nations
 Mohammad is actually mentioned by name.This book tells the alternative story of God rescuing Jesus when the soldiers come to arrest him in the Garden, and as punishment, God turns Judas' features into those of Jesus, so he is arrested instead
 The trial the canonical gospels record with Jesus, then is told with some variation, from the perspective of the puzzled Judas trying to convince the priests, Herod and Pilate that he is Judas, not Jesus.Thus it is Judas who is crucified in Jesus' place


 This book portrays the primary concern of Jesus as opposition to idolatry, both literal and spiritual
 Thus the crime of the Pharisees is idolatry of the heart

 Their hypocrisy is their condemnation.New RoleThe role of Barnabas is changed in this gospel, but his origin is the same as in Luke's writing, being described as a Jew from Cyprus
 In the writing of Luke (Acts of the Apostles), Barnabas is a Jew from Cyprus who is in Jerusalem for the Passover and believes in Jesus
 He is indeed later called an apostle, as are several other new converts or Jewish believers who were not among the original twelve.In the Gospel of Barnabas, Barnabas is one of the 12 original disciples, and the author writes in the guise of Barnabas

 The story does not explain why a Jew from Cyprus is in Palestine in a situation in which Jesus would choose him as one of his original followers

 (Note also, incidentally, in the canonical Gospels the original twelve followers are never called Apostles until after Jesus has resurrected, and they are sent out

 The word in Greek simply means messenger or missionary.)Trinity is Paul's FaultOne purpose the author gives for writing this Gospel is that Paul has erred by changing Jesus into a Divine figure

 He charges likewise that Paul has created the doctrine of the Trinity, which created three gods, leading all the followers of Paul into a new idolatry.I was surprised to find this apparently mis-informed author blaming Paul for the doctrine of the Trinity, since Paul does not focus on that
 He does refer to Jesus as the resurrected Messiah, and as the continuing ruler of God's spiritual Kingdom

 And Paul refers to the dynamic figure of the Holy Sprit


 He uses this term interchangeably with the risen Christ.For instance, Luke's phrase that Jesus would baptize his followers with the Holy Spirit is expressed in Paul's statement that we are baptized into Christ by the Holy Spirit

 (In the book of Acts, various terms are interchangeable with the term Holy Spirit, which became dominant in history and theology
 Luke uses the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord and several others.)Parables and StoriesThe Gospel of Barnabas has some Gnostic tendencies, though it sticks close to the canonical gospel stories
 It changes some teachings or events in ways to make its point that idolatry is at the root of all sin


 This author also has a broad range of parables and events, many of which are virtually word-for-word with the canonicals


 But some are changed, and many additional ones are added.In general The Gospel of Barnabas stays faithful to the teachings of Jesus except where New Testament Gospel writers have expressions of the Messiahship of Jesus, or other aspects that might be used to support the doctrine of the Trinity

 There is not as much emphasis, however, on social justice and there is an extreme development of a vindictive punishment.Vengeful TortureThis hammer-and-anvil character of God's punishment and torture of unbelievers is not found in the New Testament and certainly not in the canonical gospels
 In the Gospel of Barnabas, God invites the righteous to come and watch the tortures of those who did evil to them


 What is detailed is not just the administration of justice, but vengeful, torturous kinds of creative pain.Mohammad is given the place of honor in observing the profound horrors of God's multiplied wrath
 Though the punishment is said to be in line with the type and degree of evil the sinners committed in their life, the punishment is multiplied many times over, so the sinners suffer manifold torture and punishment.Mohammad Advocates MercyThe portrayals here are similar to those medieval visions of horror expressed by Dante Alighieri in the Divine Comedy, as Dante portrayed his view of the 9 levels of hell


 Dante expresses gleeful joy at the punishment of rival families and those he feels treated him or his family badly in life
 The punishment in the hells of the Gospel of Barnabas is so great and horrid, that even Mohammad is driven to cry out for mercy for the punished sinners.Mild GnosticismThe gnosticism of the Gospel of Barnabas is not "full-blown" as in the Gnostic gospels like the Gospel of Judas

 The latter presents the full Gnostic two-level realities in both the visible and the hidden groups among Jesus' disciples

 The Gospel of Barnabas references a dualistic spiritual reality, and has the ascetic streak found in many Gnostic and orthodox writings, as well as the express desire to release the soul from the body.This expresses a western cultural focus found in one stream of Greek philosophy


 This came to dominate popular European theology and is still prominent today in what is referred to as "evangelical" expressions of Christianity, and in Western popular culture in general.Shift from Jewish WorldviewThis shifts the focus from the strong Jewish background in New Testament emphasis on the resurrection of the body
 This was the concern that arose among the early mixed Greek and Jewish synagogue of Christians in Thessalonica and led to the first Christian writings we know of, form the pen of Saul/Paul of Tarsus, Jewish Christian missionary to the Nations

$REVIEW.: Lew Bracker has produced an amazing book about a simple, pure friendship of a kind most people have only a few times in a lifetime.  Jimmy And Me touches the heart with the aspiring actor getting the feel of a real and large family  in California while he was hitting the big time.  Lew and his family kept Jimmy grounded.  I wish everyone could have had a family like the Brackers in their lives.  Pictures in your head will linger for years, imagining Jimmy poolside or sitting on his sportscar at night, looking down on Hollywood, roaring through the canyons and befriending chefs, waiters, busboy, dishwashers at the Villa.  He was so solitary, and yet he trusted Lew Bracker and benefitted from the time spent with him.  Jimmy  didn't let his incipient fame change him as much as it would have had he not befriended Lew.

$review_text.: Being that I am mildly obsessed with Ireland, love pubs, and cherish live music there was no way this novel wouldn&#8217;t resonate with me. That being said, you never knows exactly what kind of world you&#8217;re about to enter when cracking open the spine of a new novel (and never having read anything from the author before either.)Let me tell you, my intuition and good feelings upon reading the back cover copy did not let me down. Rhythm of My Heart is an endearing romantic tale infused with the Irish culture, language, landscapes, and heart. Plus so much more:Eilis Kennedy has spent the majority of her adult life focused on her career &#8211; discovering new talent for Eireann Records of Dublin. While scouting out blues guitarist, Keiran Vaughan, Eilis has a thrilling and somewhat alarming instant attraction to the handsome and rogue guitar player. She isn&#8217;t the only one who feels it - Keiran is equally drawn to her. So much so that they feel an intense visceral connection to one another.It wouldn&#8217;t be a romance novel without a little drama, and kissing of course, and Rhythm of My Heart doesn&#8217;t disappoint. We find out quickly that Eilis is a little untrusting of men and relationships, and for what she&#8217;s been through, no one would blame her. Her character is well written and believable. Kieran is a gorgeous hunky Irishman  - who happens to play guitar - but also has a history that makes you see him as a real person. He&#8217;s not perfect, but he also has sweetness and charm that any maiden in her right mind would swoon over &#8211; I also can&#8217;t leave out his stormy blue eyes and dark hair.My favorite part of the novel is when an unexpected change in plans places Kieran and Eilis alone together in a traditional Irish country cottage. The excitement, emotion, and the drama during their stay was fabulously written and fun to read.  Overall the plot moves along at a nice pace and kept me happily turning pages. There is some suspense and action, particularly at the end of the novel, involving Eilis&#8217;s boss  that had me reading well into the wee hours of the night.Rhythm of My Heart is an engaging romance that is well written with memorable characters. The dialogue flowed effortlessly and the settings couldn&#8217;t have been more realistic. If you would like to read an entertaining romance full of music and love in an Irish setting, then I highly recommend this novel.

$review_text.: What a wonderful book!  As a history teacher, this is particulalry useful.  Well researched and organized, this is the one book that you will want to answer the bassic military questions of the American Revolution.  It can be read from cover to cover or simply used as a reference work.  There are maps for every battle, campaign maps, details of the battle, casualty figures, weather, and even what is left of the battlefield today. Reading it made me anxious to get back home to South Carolina to go and see battlefields that I spent most of my life near and never bothered to see.  I am particulalry pleased with the section at the end of each battle that relates the battle to overall strategy and explains how this battle affected the war.  The only problems were that the battle maps were a bit simple at times and there were a few historical inaccuracies (the Boston Tea Party was a protest against the high price of tea).

$REVIEW.: ***PB provided by author in exchange for an honest review***Lemme say first off. This is an AMAZING debut by MK Harkins. There are some people in this world who would scoff at the idea that Love can smack a person in the face. I am not one of these people. I know. I've lived it. And we've been together almost 10 years.Mattie get's smacked upside the head by Love for Jeremy. It's intense. It's crazy. It's deep & all-consuming. Then it all comes crashing down. But are things REALLY as they seem??Mattie sets off to makes some changes in her life. She wants to disappear from everyone. Her best friend. The love of her life. As she goes on this journey she makes new friends, she meets a new guy. Cade is mysterious, charming, makes her laugh. They become instant friends with amazing chemistry. The chemistry still rivals that of Jeremy, but she is trying.Still shattered from the betrayals in her past, she tries to work through them. As soon as she thinks she has managed to put the past behind her, disaster strikes all over again. Is she strong enough to handle it?Intentional is an emotional rollercoaster. And IS NOT a cliffy. Ms. Harkins does an exceptional job at portraying the 'Love-at-first-sight' emotions with Mattie and Jeremy. Then again with the 'friendship-blooms-to-love' emotions with Mattie and Cade. I was expecting some of the things that happened in this book, but DEFINITELY not all of them. It surprised me!!Jeremy, Cade, Jeremy, Cade.... Which one will she choose? I know at the end of this book you'll be saying what I said "why can't she just have both?"

"Bold leopard cubs rest from practicing roars. They snuggle together' all tired, tangled paws."  In the past I've actually skipped the two pages when reading it to my son.  Unfortunately he's now old enough to notice me skipping them, and makes me go back.  No matter how many times I've tried to make it sound right as it is written I can't.

While I can understand the reason why Joy was so unhappy I believe that if she took the time to look deeper at her friend Jasmine she would have realized the type of person she really was before she started blaming her father for all of her frustration

Yes her father did wrong by leaving her mother for Jasmine but we have to remember that there are two sides to every story
We must remember not to judge before we understand all the facts.

$review_text.: This was a good book
From the description, I thought it would be darker than what it was

Violet was a great main character

Even though she overlooked the things her husband did to her, she stayed strong when most woman would have literally freaked out or went crazy
The only draw back was how quickly Violet and Drifter fell in love
They did not know anything about each other

Maybe if the book was a little bit longer the author would have had time to explore that more
This was a good, quick read overall.

$review_text.: (I read this book a couple of months ago, but want to review it now for my new blog, but I will definitely be reading it over and over again later!)WOW! I totally loved everything about this book! It was truly amazing. Edenbrooke completely drew me in from the beginning, with its details and flowing writing. Marianne was an interesting and very relatable character who just wants to escape her boring world. I must say that she did a fantastic job of doing that!Edennrooke is one of my favorite settings, and between the descriptions and character interactions I completely got lost in it.Philip was very sweet, witty, smart, charming, and totally swoon worthy. The conversations between him and Marianne were funny and witty. Every time they were together, I just wanted to smile (and at times say awww).[book:Edenbrooke|12820360]I have never read a book like this, where as soon as I finished it I wanted to read it all over again from the beginning! This is a must read for everyone, because if you don't read this book, you are missing out on the read of your life!I could go on and on about this book, but I really think you should read it yourself, so I refuse to give any spoilers!

$review_text.: I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.The title of this book does not truly do the book justice. This is a story of a whirling engagement overwhelmed with a bit of a bridezilla, a snotty sister in law, and some gut wrenching friend issues. And oh the tragedy of the perfect dress!Yvonne and Simon begin the book proposing to each other, which was a very sweet cute moment&#8230;and then Yvonne goes a little crazy with the wedding, and the money, all while trying to juggle a heavy load and a sour manager at work. This is only the beginning of all she faces in her story. I won&#8217;t give anything away, but all that she faces she still seems a little caught up in making the wedding a perfect day.I enjoyed this story; I struggled with wanting to hurt a few people during it, and could not imagine being faced with some of the problems that arise!  It truly seems like the two come up against every imaginable odd. But can true love conquer all?I will not lie, Rachel was a very hard character to like! But as in life there is so much more to why a person does the things they do when you realize the reasons behind it all.This is truly a story of growth and change, and love and complex relationships. It was well written and easy to read.This book will take you on a true roller coaster from one page to the next!

They take the approach of looking better often starts with feeling better about yourself.  Yes, there are diet tips and exercises in it, but there's also talk about grooming - hair, makeup, waxing, pedicures - things that make all women feel beautiful.  She also goes into self image and why that's so critical as well.  I found it to be a great book.

$review_text.: I loved this story! It is truly unlike anything else out there right now


The author, Thomas Amo, has woven history with present day paranormal mystery in a superb thrill ride that keeps you guessing right up till the end and then beyond.The story follows Inspector Thomas James from his first romance at age 14 through a series of bizarre murders that seem to be copy cats of some of the most notorious murders committed through history
At every turn in the case things seem to go from strange to beyond believable and just when the characters are questioning their sanity it gets worse!This was an amazing, intense read that kept me wanting more and wondering where everything was going


There were points in the plot that were obvious, and at the same time those obvious plot points lead to something I totally didn't see coming.An Apple For Zo was a refreshingly interesting and totally different story than anything I have read in a long time

If you're looking for something new to break up the monotony of paranormal books that are all variations of the same thing then An Apple For Zo is the book for you


I promise you, when you finish and put this book down you have a bazillion new questions going through your head while you wait, not so patiently, for the next book to come out!And that's always a good thing!

$SUMMARY.: Wow - Refreshingly different, strange, and engrossing all at once!

$review_text.: Courtney is a high school senior who is coming out of a freaky, mentally abusive relationship. Her ex is a cheater and a control freak, but, my God, it is so hard to pull away from someone like that. I know... I&#8217;VE BEEN THERE! She is trying to regain her self-respect, her strength, and her life. And, then, along comes Jaxon Vaughn&#8230; yummy, sexy Jaxon Vaughn. He&#8217;s a bit of a puzzle, and I (metaphorically) want to do him. (OK, metaphorically and literally...) He&#8217;s sweet but complicated, easily frustrated and suspicious, but deep and warm. He looks out for Courtney, gives her what she needs, even when that means pulling himself away.With both Jaxon and Courtney, I was often back and forth between &#8216;Nooooooo! Don&#8217;t do that!&#8217; to &#8216;OMFG, yes! Do that!!!&#8217; Courtney will make you crazy at times, but, holy smokes, considering everything she went through, I can relate! I think it is real and accurate for her age! I loved the humor in Kendra, the &#8216;big brother&#8217; in Reed. And the end... Holy effing hell!I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who likes a hot and angsty young/new adult novel!

$review_text.: I have read so many MC books, some being better than others, but this one blew me away!!!! One word: Crash....Oh. My. God....He is the sexiest, sweetest (I would never say that to his face though!), badass, alpha biker that I've ever had the pleasure of swooning over (with the exception of Deuce from the Undeniable series by Ms. Sheehan!). That's the thing about MC books. In my opinion, Madeline Sheehan is the queen of all things biker....well, Madeline might want to ask Nicole James to be her VP the next time church comes around!In the first book, Outlaw, the focus is on Cole and his now wife, Angel....Cole is the VP of Evil Dead MC and Crash's best friend. In this book, Cole gets a call from a frantic old acquaintance, Shannon. We meet Shannon in Outlaw, as she is one of several girls saved by Evil Dead after being kidnapped. Shannon is wealthy, drop dead gorgeous, and so desperate for her life that she begs Cole to help her out. Shannon's boyfriend is a wealthy business mogul and a threatening, arrogant piece of crap.....hmmmm....what to do with Shannon????Cole and the boys reluctantly help her and Crash volunteers to keep her safe at his loft...this is where the story of Crash and Shannon begins. Crashs' world and Shannon's are polar opposites and how Crash brings this spoiled and entitled woman down some notches into the real world is funny, endearing, bossy and beautiful...they were truly made for each other...As Shannon's stay, out of necessity, becomes longer and longer, a relationshipship, whether they realize it or not, starts to unfold. Crash is the one who keeps her sane, his strength and reassurance blew me away and made me melt...The thing about this story and why I loved it so much was all the little bits and pieces, the stories within this story, that made each page flow flawlessly into the next...from the antics and banter of the other MC brothers, Wolf, Green, Red Dog and Mack (I'm sure I missed a few) to Coles little daughter, Melissa, who is the apple of Crashs' eye, I felt like I was actually living amongst their lives. I love reading about the lifestyle of MC's.....their brotherhood, their code in which they live, no one gets left behind, and the way anyone will pay with their own life if one of them is crossed...I can't rave enough about this book. Nicole James knocked it right outta the park!!!! It's a MUST READ!!!! You won't be disappointed...I know that I'll be dreaming of Crash for a long time...

$review_text.: Philip Kearney, a San Francisco district attorney, applied for a long shot job as a prosecutor for the UN Mission in Kosovo on the advice of a friend. Despite no language skills, no international law experience, and little international travel experience. He gets the job (perhaps because no one else wanted it), and finds himself in Pristina investigating and prosecuting big cases in white slavery, genocide, and war crimes.The most interesting parts of his story are his comparisons of the US (and British) legal system, based on common law, to the various systems in place in the former Yugoslavia. Not only is he unfamiliar with the local law, but there's a question about what the local law even is. The country has fallen apart and the UN protectorate status is sometimes violently disputed. Despite these obstacles, he's a quick learner and not shy about putting his skills questioning and cross-examining gang leaders to good use.Sadly, the mish-mash of international law and local jurisdiction ultimately conspire to undo his convictions, but he definitely leaves Pristina a better place than he found it, and no matter the outcome I found his story quite the page turner.

$REVIEW.: I LOVE Jamie Begley's books.  Tainted is a sequel to Teased and leads into Shades Fall that I am ANXIOUSLY waiting for.  I must tell you that if you like a book with LOTS OF STEAM Ms. Begley delivers.  I Highly recommend Tainted but read Teased first.  If you want the FULL story read the Last Riders series.  It is one of the best MC series I have read.  It's not as gritty as A.C. Bextor or Madelyn Shehan but they are definitely full of Alpha males and lots of steam!  The characters are well developed and play full roles in each of the series.  I love it when a series has an HEA for each book, moves along to others in the group but brings the previous couple back in.  Ms. Begley's series does that.  This series has great plots and some twists you want see coming. You will not be disappointed with any of her books!!

$review_text.: It strikes me as slightly ironic that I got this book, about getting free stuff, as a freebie. And maybe that just demonstrates that I'm not quite in the target demographic: I've been looking for freebies for about as long as I can remember, and since I started blogging (in 2008), I've had PR companies approaching me to offer their products.So there was a lot of this book that I skimmed over, particularly in the introductory chapters, as it wasn't news to me that brands will give gifts and samples in exchange for exposure. On the other hand, I found plenty of useful and eminently practical information in these pages. I've never been to a trade show, I don't use my blog to badge myself as a journalist for press tickets, and actually, it's rare that I approach a company directly to ask for something. Essex gave plenty of examples of little ways that I could up my game, and make more of the presence I've already built.This is a concise, helpful guide which I'd recommend as a great starting point for anyone new to the freebie scene - but may be worth a look even if you already know your way around PR agencies and marketing departments. Especially if you can get this book for free!

It was like she was tired of writing the series. So sad as other two in series were sooo good! Good thing was only .99  or would have asked for money back. So sad.

$REVIEW.: WARNING - Some spoilers from episodes 1-2-3Have I said that I'm in love with this series? If I haven't, I'm saying it right now! I love this series! In the first episode Kelly Green brought us a story with really lovely characters, a different story..


a fresh story about a girl that doesn't know anything about her life, she doesn't remember anything, and she is in the body of someone else...The second episode continues with the same style
Abby in the body of another girl, where she needs to resolve something
And maybe if you haven't read the books yet, you're thinking that the story is kind of repetitive..
and I'm telling you..
No, it's not

It's awesome


In every book Abby not only needs to help those people and discover the mystery around them, but she also needs to discover her life, who is she? Who is her mother, her dad? What is her story?The last episode was literally heartbreaking at the end
I wanted to read more, to know a little bit more about Abby's life, but time was over, and she needed to move forward

Top of the Class starts with a big change and a big challenge for Abby, and I must say that the cover is very revealing! Ha! Abby is now a boy and the needs to behave like one..


and you need to add a big mystery that needs to be resolved before time is over, or Abby will be stuck forever in the body of a boy that is going to jail.Like the first two books, there is a lot of suspense, and nothing is what it seems


Secrets and lots of secrets and Abby is running against time

Will she make it? Again, I think I said it before, I really like her character, she is so smart, so intelligent..

but at the same time, sweet..

strong..
And Will, even though he just appears at the beginning and at the ending of the book, I really like his character, and I would love to know a little bit more about him.Top of the class is the third episode of this series, and it's as amazing as the first two books

Now I can't wait to read the next one!If you haven't read those books yet, I highly recommend you to do it
They are short books with a lot of mystery, secrets, fun, high schools..


and romance? Maybe? Who knows?

$review_text.: Creative Cupcakes is doing really well and now it has an offer from a businessman to buy it. The three friends who run it Andi, Kim and Rachel aren't sure they want to sell it because it is their heart and soul. However they each have new things happening in their lives and aren't sure where their future lays. Andi may be moving, Rachel's wedding is coming up and Kim doesn't know where her love life is going. Now when Andi has decided to have a Christmas party for foster kids and get the town involve. What should be a great things soon turns bad when a Grinch steals all the presents and destroys Rachel's wedding. They are all feeling the holiday blues and don't know what to do. If they shold stay and toough things out or sale the shop and go their own ways.I fell in love with this series from the first book. All the characters are so wonderful you can't help but feel you really know them. This book continues the three womens story as they are at a turning point in there lives. They aren't sure what they want to do and where their lives are going. They love the town and their shop but have things they want in life or think they want. I adore these ladies and each time I read a story with them I want more even when it wraps up so nicely. I have to say I didn't know who the Grinch in this story was to the end. I thought I knew but was proved wrong. Oh and be prepared to want some yummy cupcakes as I do everytime I read these stories. I liked the ending of this one the best as it really warmed my heart. I would tell anyone to read this as it has romance, intrigue and characters and a place you never want to leave.

I recommend buying this book in person.I first saw this particular book at my son's speech therapist's office. She used it with my son and he absolutely loved it. All the poppin dots worked during their session.Maybe the reason why others had trouble with the dots not working is because it got damaged during shipping?

$REVIEW.: Drowning is an incredibly powerful story of strength, trust and love
Rachel Firasek does an amazing job making the reader feel Alice's pain and Seth's determination to show Alice that it's ok to love and more importantly, to trust.Alice, by all outward appearances, seems the strong, take no prisoners type but it's a mask
She herself, is held prisoner by a sadistic father, her own feeling that she is not worthy and an overwhelming need to protect her sister from the evil's their father bestows on her


Her love of cliff diving led to a horrible accident that left her sister, Molly, blind, a fact Molly's mother never lets her live down
And when she moves in to help Molly, she never expected to fall for the guy across the hall.Seth struggles with his own issues of living up to expectations and being there for his younger brother when their father checked out after losing his wife

The dynamics of the James family are turned upside down from her death and Seth does what every "good son" does, steps up
The fact that his father tried buying their love fuels his need for independence and helps him in his own discovery of what love truly means.Alice and Seth together are explosive

Alice's habit of pushing people away only makes Seth want her more


She is a mystery to him
Determined to find her secret and heal her wounds, he sticks by her side through everything
He proves to her over and over again that no matter what she does, he will be there

Now, if only she will see this, if only she will open her heart to him and let him in

Will Alice finally be free? Can she finally let go of the guilt from her sister's accident? Will Seth be the one to tear down the wall? One of my all time favorite stories and Alice and Seth certainly hold a special place in this reader's heart.

Unfortunately, by the time you are finished with the book, you realize that unless you are among the top one percent of wealth in America, you are playing in a game that is TOTALLY RIGGED! Bernie Maddoff is small potatoes in the face of the heads of the U.S. Treasury, Goldman, Travelers, Lehman, Fannie Mae, Clinton, Reagan, and more. They have robbed us blind and made us pay for the privilege of victim recovery. The battle in America is not between the Republicans and the Democrats. It is between the super wealthy, greedy upper executives and the rest of us. While we battle it out at the polls, they steal EVERYTHING.This book is a must read for every citizen who aspires to be informed.

$review_text.: I want to start by saying I'm reviewing the series as a whole, not just Balancer. I plan to copy paste (with a few changes) to Jaunten as well.I'd like to start with the good things. The world building was excellent and the pacing was solid enough, until the end.That said, I ended up not feeling very positive about the story or characters as a whole.The bad guys were pure evil (not to mention incredibly stupid), and the good guys were saints. There was no real conflict, as Garth (and the other protagonists) were completely and utterly more powerful than their foes. It was four books of "hide and go seek" where there were only a couple of scenes of minor drama. The political leaders were so impossibly nice that was almost sickening. Two kings of neighboring countries were practically best friends and completely selfless, without even the tiniest concern for their own personal power. In fact, every "good" character had no negative qualities. Even Kartal (the "obnoxious one") was perfectly fine, and only seemed even moderately negative in contrast to the sugary goodness of everyone else. The nauseating protagonists, the nameless, yet unrelatably evil, antagonists, and the completely overpowering strength of the protagonists that made any attempt by the antagonists to foil them seem pitiful removed any potential drama or connection to the characters. There was no climax in the entire series, just one easy victory after the other.Finally, the entire last 30% of the book is taken over by wedding plans. Seriously, that's the epic conclusion? Picking out colors and seating assignments?I really wanted to like this series, which is probably why the disappointment was that much more palpable after I completed it.I'm not sure who wrote all the 5 star reviews, and if they read the same series I did, but as a work of fiction I was incredibly disappointed by the plot, characters, and conclusion. It is clear that the writer has a talent for world building and pacing, but shows a lack of ability to create a dramatic plot that engages the reader and develop characters in such a way that they are relatable. I hope in the writer's next attempt that her style matures, as I want to see more of the world of the Advent Mage Cycle, just with real characters and an actual plot.

$review_text.: Ben Stevens is a fascinating writer whose previous book `A Gaijin's Guide To Japan: An Alternative Look At Japanese Life, History And Culture' has gained considerable attention.  But the joy of this new novel BIG SOUND TEMPLE is the style Stevens has elected to use in relating the story: he has created `Japlish' (or `Engrish') and it is a charming marriage of Japanese and English that makes this story sing.Very briefly, Hiro is a young lad who in the opening chapter of the book loses his father and attends the cremation and rituals surrounding that event. He is the one to replace his father as the caretaker of a Buddhist temple.  Yes, there are events in the novel, including a typhoon and its effect on the temple, but primarily this story is a simple coming of age of a young Japanese boy and how he learns to speak English from a very well-drawn character - a heavy, fragrant American woman named Wendy who calls everyone `Honey' - his involvement with a woman named Sakura, and his encounter with the Japanese underground.  All of this is related with the most ingratiating dialogue Hiro uses, his own manner of speaking English that is best illustrated by an excerpt: ` Hiro think he lucky man to go out with the beautiful woman call Sakura. But Sakura also little mental. Also Hiro soon start have much trouble with the gangster man call Bad Boy. Because Bad Boy like Sakura very much.'Ben Stevens is also a musician as well as a writer and perhaps that is one reason his book sings so well!  What may seem like a gimmick rapidly becomes a writing style that will engage every sensitive reader and likely encourage reading the entire book at one sitting. Grady Harp, August 12

$REVIEW.: Who doesn't enjoy a book you can cozy up with in bed and try to solve the mystery alongside the characters? I know I sure do, though I don't get to read many of them. So I was eager to give Died in the Wool a try. A librarian whose competitors for funds from the city are turning up dead--what's not to like?In Died in the Wool, Monah Trenary suddenly finds her quiet life as the town librarian thrown into upheaval when she discovered a dead body in the bathroom. Fingers naturally point her way. Unwilling to let anyone use her as a scapegoat, Monah--along with her faithful sidekick and fellow amateur sleuth, Casey--begin investigating.And just so happens that Monah's boyfriend, Mike, is a detective. With these three on the case...bad guys better get out of the way! It was lots of fun to follow both Monah and Mike as they investigate into the murder in their own way. Their romance was sweet, and I felt for Monah when she became a suspect and had to be questioned by Mike. How awful to think the guy your dating thinks you're capable of murder!Elizabeth Ludwig and Janelle Mowery have crafted together another intriguing, twisting mystery in the second installment to the Massachusetts Mayhem Mysteries series. Fans of this series will be thrilled to see previous characters make an appearance, as well as discover new ones. With this lovely cast of characters and a complex plot, Died in the Wool is sure to keep you guessing the entire time.I reviewed this book for the authors. It was not required that I give a positive review, but solely to express my own thoughts and opinions of this book, which I have done.

$REVIEW.: As another reviewer stated, look closely at the overviews of these books as several books have more than one title.Initially, I was so excited to think that Mrs


Mallory was back, but on some of the "newest" books, I realized that these were actually earlier books.It seems that this fact should be clearly stated in under the title!  These books develop in sequence, and I have always wished that each book's place in any series would be marked with not only publication date, but also the words, (for example), #3 in Mrs

Mallory series

It would be such a time saver for customers!The Mallory series has always seemed pleasant to me
 There is something about the writing that is so engaging to read

Not all cozies are created equal, and this author has a knack for getting the reader "into" the stream of events
 It was a bit disconcerting in the early books as to how Mrs
Mallory babied her grown son!  There were times that I was amazed that he could attend class and find his way home without Mummy


 But perhaps that is simply a trait that rankles with me...men CAN do laundry!  It has been observed in rare instances!  But it's easy to get past that characteristic as the overall book series is well done
 The relationship that Sheila has with her "best friend" Rosemary is so nice, also
In the entire series, th author captures perfectly the joy of having a true close friend who is, through the years, an extension of your own family

And Rosemary's Mother is certainly a force to be reckoned with in a humorous way throughout the books


 I even attempted a Sponge Cake because of Sheila Mallory


Attempted.As with any series, some books are better than others, but I was never tempted to stop reading the series


 She captures the English life and people so perfectly; I'd like to know her.Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a good series, and who likes to watch the characters evolve, to try this set
Reading from the beginning book is the way to go...I went through them all until I could get an ordered list for myself


Come on, Amazon, please do this job FOR us when you show any series.

$REVIEW.: Even removing the cosmic and the supernatural, Anthony J. Rapino still finds a way to make his horror feel really weird.Three crooks, each one more deranged than the next, gear up for their next home invasion job. The nature of their crime seems pretty cut-and-dry in the beginning, but as they carry on it becomes clear that their motives and their methods are much more bizarre. And tying in with the story's title, the three have proclivities that threaten to derail their plans, and it's only through &#34;loose enforced rules&#34; that keep them focused on the job at hand.There isn't really anyone to root for, feeling very noir-ish in that aspect, and tripping into psycho noir thanks to the female of the trio, Sunshine. Holy. ****. That near-feral hellcat is the tempest of the trio and it becomes pretty clear early on that if any of the three are going to ruin their best laid plans, it's her.Rapino offers up one sick interlude with an ending that might even be considered romantic ... if it wasn't for all the bloodshed.

I will say I was very surprised at the spice in this book

Not to over the top that it belongs in the books I usually read (lol) but it was definitely hot at times

I loved every character in this book


The relationship between Jeremy and Aura was so sweet and I was sooo hoping they wouldn't let anything come between them and the unconditional love they had for each other

$review_text.: This book was given to me as a gift!!SO This review is a little (ok a lot) late due to me moving, not having internet, then being out of town, still trying to get settled into our new home yadda yadda yadda.... It has been hectic and who would have thought that it would take me this long to get this review out... Definitely not me and I feel like a failure as a blogger because this review wasn't posted weeks ago!!I have had it sitting on my laptop for over two weeks just waiting for life to slow down so I could post it and now it finally has!!So here it goes....When I first started Changing Forever I was a bit hesitant to really love it because the dual character point of view seemed kind of like the same person was &#34;talking&#34; and there were times I had to look back and remember which head I was inside; Drake or Emery's...But besides that, this story really pulled me in. With the angst, the banter between the two main characters and then how everything unfolded at the end, I was seriously hooked. Plus, this one was a lot steamier than Lisa's previous novel. I was in a constant stage of sexual tension because the main characters were in a constant state of sexual frustration!!This was probably one of the few times that I actually loved the story more than the characters themselves. Don't get me wrong, I liked Emery and Drake but I didn't love them! They frustrated me more than any two characters I have ever read... and then some!! It was a constant state of push and pull between these two and most of the time it was a push straight over the edge of a cliff!!I wanted to scream at Drake for his constant hard-headedness and then I wanted Emery to just stop being so damn difficult and stubborn... It was too much!!It was all very angsty and rip your hair out frustrating... BUT the ending is what made it all come together for me and gave me so many feels!!! I was swooning and cheering these people on, plus, I was glad they were working out their issues!! PLUS, PLUS, PLUS the epilogue was so sweet and fantastic!!!Overall, I give this book a 4 &#34;I wanted to rip my hair out and Drakes clothes off&#34; stars!!!

$REVIEW.: In Lovesey's 10th Inspector Peter Diamond mystery, Diamond investigates a headless skeleton found on Bath's Lansdown Hill during a reenactment of a 1643 battle between the Roundheads and the Cavaliers.  Soon afterward, a university professor who took part in the reenactment is found murdered nearby.  Diamond comes to believe the cases are interrelated, even though the skeleton is 20 years old.Diamond's investigation takes him to historical sites in Bath, to the area's horseracing scene and to London's seamy world of eastern European sex workers who came to England after the breakup of the Soviet Union.We don't see much of Peter Diamond's personal life in this particular entrant in the series.  It's more of a straightforward police procedural.  I thought it was interesting, but not a standout.  Still, a medium-grade Lovesey is well above average for most mysteries.

$review_text.: With the beautiful pictures of a coffee-table book, this volume combines the detailed information of a serious history.  Since I am going to fill the rest of this review with a complaint, I need to state at the outset that for someone who knows nothing more about tea than how to drink it, as I did before I read it, it is an excellent introduction to the topic.  The authors clearly love their subject and there is absolutely nothing wrong with their use of their personal experiences to inform their account.  The basics--what kind of plant the tea tree actually is, how it grows, and what happens to the leaf from when it is picked to when it creates the beverage in your cup; why oolongs and senchas and pu-erhs and darjeelings are all as different from one another as they are; what the tea customs and brewing methods are in in the various tea drinking countries--all this is covered in decent fullness.  I appreciate, too, that countries like Korea and Vietnam, whose tea customs and products are usually overlooked in discussions of that beverage, are not ignored.Yet sometimes the precision and profusion of information on many topics seems, where others are concerned, to mask the same quality that plagues most books of this sort--vagueness and generality.For example, the description of gyokuro and matcha tells us that the bushes are shaded during the last few weeks of their growth; this reduced chlorophyll and, hence, astringency.  Later on we are told something similar about Fujian white tea.  Yet dried gyokuro leaves are very dark green and the liquor is a clear emerald.  Dried white tea leaves are indeed white and the liquor is a pale brown.  What accounts for this huge difference?  We are not told.Characteristically, however, we are given two long paragraphs describing the curtains which Japanese tea farmers use to shade those bushes whose leaves are destined for matcha or gyokuro.  They are called kanareisha, and are divided into tana and jikagise.  We then get a very detailed description of the two and of the way they are raised above the tea plants.  All of this is interesting and I do not for one minute begrudge its presence in this book.  After all, someone who is not interested in the topic can easily skip the paragraphs, and for the rest of us, they give the feeling--which is this book's strong point--that we ourselves are touring tea plantations and seeing everything the authors see.My complaint, then, is that in contrast to the wealth of detailed information on this sort of peripheral point, the book becomes shockingly casual and cursory on other topics of genuine importance to people who are actually drinking the tea.  Everyone who is serious about tea will sooner or later become interested in the water question.  What water is best for tea?  After emphasising that tap water is not ideal and stating in general terms that the quality of the water is important with, of course, the obligatory quote from Lu Yu, the authors write:""So this is our rule of thumb: if we won't drink a particular water, we won't brew tea in it.  conversely, not all great drinking waters are good tea-brewing waters.  We love Evian for drinking, but we wouldn't brew tea with it, as it is too soft.  Most tea brews best in moderate to soft water.  A few teas (such as tippy Yunnan blacks or full-bodied oolongs) brew well in moderate to slightly hard water with a bit of mineral content.  For dependable results when we taste tea professionally, we suse water from one of the natural springs in Maine; it consistently has the qualities that we prefer in our tea-brewing water.  Toese springs are relatively nearby our teashop, so the water is fresh.  This water is similar to the tap water that our local clientele accesses, but we also regularly taste tea with local tap water, to stay in touch with its flavor."There follows the recommendation that the reader experiment with different waters to determine which one he likes best.Now, even assuming that the information here is accurate, it is far too general to be helpful.  Which waters are hard, and which soft, and what is the precise hardness factor recommended for tea?  The authors, having raised the question, do not answer it.  However, a little bit of research reveals that Evian is the hardest of the popular mineral waters, harder than Volvic or Fiji and far harder than Voss or most of the others.  To say that Evian is too soft makes no sense, and indeed most of the tea authorities I know say precisely the opposite--Evian is too hard.  I suspect this is simply a mis-print and that the authors intended to say "too hard" here too, but who knows?  The whole topic is covered far too superficially to be of any help.  And they don't even address the question of PH balance.  Google "tea water" and you will find that the internet contains a world of contradictory advice, vagueness, and statements of dubious accuracy.  The authors of this book were the ideal candidates to clear up the mystery.  Again, I do not begrudge the wealth of detail on things like the jikagise curtains the Japanese gyokuro farmers use to shade their plants--but it contrasts strangely with the limited information on something like the water that each one of us puts in our tea.But if this book leaves one wanting more, that is only because all of the information of which it is a repository has given the reader the knowledge of how much more there is to know.

After a fiction bomb goes wrong, various characters from Shatner's career come to life and terrorize him and the fans at ShatnerCon, or report on it, as is the case for Rescue 911 Shatner. This is a crazy ride with just about every incarnation of Shatner involved and, don't worry Jeff, I think Shatner would get a kick out of it.

$REVIEW.: While participating in the book tour for "MIRANDA'S MATE", Snarky Mom received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review
 I had an enjoyable evening reading it, in between filling my wine glass

Miranda's Mate (The Company Store, Book 1) is written by Ann Gimpel, and is 140 pages long

 Like I said - an evening read


 I'm assuming since this is subtitled "The Company Store, Book 1&#8243;, that DUH - there will be more


 However, I'm not sure I was really left at the end of the book dying to know what is in the future for other characters (well, except maybe Lars - he was the only one we really got a sense of).Miranda is secretly in lust with her boss, Garen, who is unwilling to pursue her since he is not only the head of "The Company Store", but the head of the lycaen community

 His wolf, however, could care less


 When Miranda is sent to assassinate the head of a human trafficking ring and barely escapes, he can't help but rush to her
 He inducts her into the "Mile High Club" but let's her off the hook when she says it was a mistake.You would have thought my glass(es) of wine would have mellowed me out a bit, but as I read this, I just kept thinking, "Huh?!"  First of all, the blurb about the book says that Miranda is a virgin
 Well, she talks about having had sex, and when she & Garen basically jump each other while in the plane NOTHING is said about virginity
 I wonder if the author originally had that in the plans and then changed her mind, but the publisher never changed the blurb?  I have to admit - this is the very FIRST book I have EVER read about shifters where the shifters were unable to detect each other
 (An "Eastern European" agent said that they were trained to detect shifters, but the Americans hadn't trained their people to do that


 Huh?  An animal's sense of smell can't pick up on another animal?)  I just found that part...
weird

 Then, to top it off - here is the head of the were community..
and he has to be reminded by someone else what the particulars are about mating

 Wow

 No wonder the American's don't know how to recognize other shifters - Garen doesn't seem to be completely on the ball!Points for the hot man on the cover
 Points off for the fact that it takes forever to figure out WHAT the hot man on the cover is holding in his hand

 (Or maybe that is just me.)Points for trying to highlight the scourge of human trafficking

 Points off for perpetuating some stereotypes.Points for a shifter romantic suspense novella that is a basic read


 Points off for the $3.99 price for just 140 pages.Well, check out "MIRANDA'S MATE" & see what YOU think
 Maybe I had unreasonable expectations...?(Originally posted on SnarkyMomReads)

$REVIEW.: The first book I read by Gemma Burgess, The Dating Detox, had me laughing until the end. I was looking forward to her second novel, A Girl Like You, and was hoping for more of the edgy chick lit, anti-romance story. And I was not disappointed. A Girl Like You opens up with a prelude, something that I know is often advised against, but completely works for this story. Why does Abigail have a black eye and is bawling on the floor of her shower- in Hong Kong? Who is the man that comes to save her? The prelude stuck with my while I read the story, and I commend Burgess on opening with a bang. As the story moves along, Abigail is newly single, coming out of a long term relationship, and in desperate need of dating advice. At 27, she is just now going to embark on her first first date. New flatmate Robert, the friend of her sister's fianc&eacute;e, is just the guy to help her. Robert teaches Abby how to date like a bastardette, going on several casual dates and thoroughly enjoying her newfound freedom. The supporting cast around Abigail is going through their own troubles, and their stories coincide perfectly with Abigail's dilemmas.I thought A Girl Like You deserves five big stars. Burgess writes with humor, wit, crass, and honesty about surviving singledom. I laughed my way throughout the chapters, yet connected with all the characters, not just Abigail. I didn't find anything about the story real clich&eacute; either, which I thought was fantastic. I hate when I start a book knowing exactly what the characters are going to think, feel, and how they will act. This novel is chick lit, but very modern, very open, and very real. I think a lot of readers will be able to connect with the characters, if not Abigail's then one of her friends. There is something for everybody with this story, and I highly encourage everyone to get a copy. A Girl Like You is my first favorite read of 2011!

I loved how Sander constantly displayed his love and devotion to Chey and surprised her throughout the book with various forms of affection, even down to bringing Chey's best friend Wynn to move in with him so Chey would have her best friend and family with her, forever. So touching.I am looking forward to the next book in the series, which I have been told is Mattias' story. I can't hep but wonder if maybe he will find true love within Wynn..?

$review_text.: INITIAL THOUGHTSApproaching reading this book I was unsure whether I would really enjoy it or not. I'm not totally sure what my expectations were, I don't read a lot of "lighter" "chick-lit" so I kind of either love them or hate them.MY REVIEWI received a free e-copy of this book from the Author via Oops I Read It Again Book Tours in exchange for my honest review and posting on this date as part of the blog tour.The cover is quite hunting in that you see the heart drawn on the window and the red background with the condensation dripping down the window almost mimicking blood. I really like the style of the font of the Authors name and the book title. It has a calligraphy feel to it.Would the cover make me pick the book up (if it was in paperback) from a bookstore shelf? Yes, it is bright enough to catch my attention and the heart and dripping condensation leave you wanting to know who drew the heart and what it represents.So now to the book, at the outset it seems the book is going to be a straight forward tale of three girls going to see their favourite band at a local venue, then things turn a little more sinister.Becca loves more "out there" bands than her friend Maddy, though her other friend Carli also has the same taste in music. How can I describe the girls relationship? Becca and Carli are BFF's and Maddy though a friend is kind of the "third wheel". This shows in the section of the book where they go shopping nd Maddy sort of turns her nose up at the "Emo shop" that sells band tee's etc. the shop that Becca already spends much of her money in! where she treat herself to the other band she loves t-shirt, a Depressed Michael band tee.As Becca begins to see similarities between the bands lead singer and the lead singer of a band her mother loved years ago. Is it possible that Nightmare could actually be the same guy, the Brian Hawkins her mum still raves about?So Becca, Carli and Maddy are going to see their favourite band, though the band is more like an obsession to Becca. The band is called Mutilated Hearts and consists of lead singer Nightmare, his younger brother Banshee, Corpse, Vertebrae (bassist) and Ink (drummer). The bassist Vertebrae has just left the band so the girls will get to check out the new bassist as it will be his first official concert with the rest of the band the night the girls go to see them.The band members certainly seem to live up to their gory names, with Ink literally being covered in tattoo's, and Corpse is quite plainly and simply obsessed about zombies and the dead!The girls go to the mall to buy some new clothes for the gig. Becca bumps into an attractive guy who ends up telling her his name is Sketch and that he is playing with his band at the venue the girls are going to. So Becca and sketch part ways with Becca kind of promising to look for him at the venue. I mean yeah his band may not be Mutilated Hearts but if they are on the same bill they must be decent.So Becca is getting ready at home when her mum has a "talk" with her. It's a mother daughter heart to heart where Dawn tells her daughter not to get carried away as she did years ago "making out" and "giving her heart" to the lead singer of Death Of Darkness, Brian Hawkins. Dawn gave her heart to Brian, who then had to fly to his next gig and his plane crashed and all aboard dies in the horrific fire that followed the crash. Of course Dawn (Becca's mum never ever truly got over the loss of her first love). though whilst talking and reminiscing with Becca admits if the crash had not happened she would not have married Becca's father and Becca possibly would never have been born.So the girls go to the concert and guess who the new bassist for Mutilated Heart's is . . . . .I really don't want to say a great deal more about the story. Lets just say that two of the girls, Becca and Carli end up living the fan girl dream to begin with until things take shady turn. It seems that Becca and her mum Dawn may have similarities but so do the bands they love, Death Of Darkness and Mutilated Hearts too.So did I enjoy the book? I really, truly loved this book. Becca and Carli live a little of the fan girl dream of really meeting their favourite band . . .Would I recommend the book? I highly recommend this YA Chick Lit/FeelGreat book.Would I read a Book Two (if available)? I was thrilled to see that there is in fact going to be a book two, and it's on my "Want To Read"list now!Would I read other books by this Author? I will be taking a close look at any titles by this Author.

$REVIEW.: The first time I saw the title SoulPrint: discovering your divine destiny I was immediately drawn to it. Unfortunately, it is a claim that Batterson was unable to fulfill. He describes the soulprint as finding "what we were originally designed and ultimately destined to do." (p. 16) But, he asks us to dig into self-discovery with the equivalent of a child's sand pail and shovel from the dollar store when we live in a world that offers sophisticated tools, survey's, inventories and tests that can help us discover and discern who God has called and created us to be. He alludes to the Johari Window on p. 116 but he makes no attempt to explain it or point us in a direction that will help us use this tool to discover our Soulprint. There isn't even a suggestion that we try to discover our spiritual gifts.What the book offers is a study of some of the watershed events in the life of King David: killing Goliath, holding on to and displaying Goliath's armor, cutting off the corner of Saul's robe, being filled with the Spirit and dancing in the streets, adultery with Bathsheba, and expressing gratitude for God's faithfulness. These events are intended to help the reader see how David became the person God designed and destined him to be. For me, personally, it was too much of a stretch to see how this was supposed to help me find my soulprint.There are bright spots in the book. He does a good job of making the point that God has something special he wants us to do and we need to search for that. His Illustrative material is excellent and he makes a number of good points about the life of David that we can all use. The chapter "The Crags of the Wild Goats" was excellent and my copy of the book contained an excerpt from Primal, another book by Batterson, that was perhaps the best piece of writing in the entire book.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

$REVIEW.: Third daughter is very much a fluffy bunny kind of book: cute and innocuous but ultimately perhaps a bit lacking in spirit. The fantasy pseudo Indian culture is fun, though, and there's a reason beyond the Indian influence to refer to this series as a bollywood steampunk: it really does feel like an authentic bollywood movie script (extravagant settings, over the top emotions, chaste kisses, HEA.....only missing the jaunty musical numbers).Plot: Aniri, princess and third daughter of the queen of a prosperous land, finds herself beset by a terrible choice just days before her 18th birthday: help secure peace by marrying the prince of a barbarian bordering country, or follow her heart and marry the courtier (oddly called courtesan in the book) who has captured her heart. The stakes are high: the young 'barbarian' prince is said to have developed a steamship technology to ride the aether - a vehicle that could be used as a terrifying weapon of war against her country. But as spunky Aniri comes to know the prince, she will soon learn that things aren't always as they seem.This is very suitable for a YA audience: it is an undemanding read that is both exuberant (emotions run high) yet oddly subdued. Indeed, very little happens for over half the book as Aniri both laments her fate but also moons over her 'lover' back at her mother's court. By the end of the book, the action picks up and Aniri is able to prove that she isn't just a pampered princess but can show pluck when needed. But I honestly had a hard time really getting into her rather shallow character. Sadly, most of the characters were very thin and none very well or deeply defined. The love interests ending up being paper thin and it was difficult to really get an impression of their personalities or motivations.It was hard to take the book seriously and I think that's the point - as with a big bollywood musical, where people break out into song and dance in the middle of the ramdonest of locations, so too does one need to turn off the brain and just enjoy this book for silly mindless fun.  Certainly there's nothing wrong with that and the steampunk genre lends itself nicely to bollywood silliness.This is a book I would have loved to see as a movie. Corsets and sarees, love triumphing, and swashbuckling adventure - all in an exotic setting.  It's the perfect twinkie confection for a lazy afternoon read.Reviewed from an ARC.

$REVIEW.: Why didn't anybody tell me about this series?  Seriously.  This was a really good paranormal romance.  And it would have been undoubtedly even better if I had read the three books that came before it.Katie is a cougar shapeshifter who has been in love with Jordan all of her life.  But her pack-leader always treated her like the little girl she was when they first met.  She left the pride 10 years ago, to help hunt shifters who had become infected with a virus that mutated them into beastly werewolves.  Katie, herself, was hit by the virus, but for women, the result is an inability to shift.Jordan always knew about Katie's girlhood crush on him. It was part of the reason he let her go all those years ago... to see if the feelings would stand up over time and the distance.  He thought there was plenty of time to see what would happen between them. He never counted on being infected with the werewolf gene himself.  Now he has only days to get his affairs in order before he descends into madness.  Part of that means getting Katie back to the safety of the keep.Of course, once Katie and Jordan are back in each other's orbit, there is no denying they are supposed to be together. The sexual tension is off the charts.  The two of them want each other so much, but Jordan considers himself too damaged for Katie now.  Sex could be dangerous and mating is completely out of the question.  Katie wants Jordan any way she can have him. And what if mating could help him?  So they're in this tug of war, but at the center is real love --and a whole lotta lust.  Once we do get to the sex, it's really, really good. Primal and hot at times, gentle and loving in others.  Everything I wanted.There's much more to the story. A werewolf targeting Katie.  A war among supernatural species.  A wealth of secondary characters, some carrying over stories from previous books, while others are laying foundations for books to come.  It's rich and fast paced.  My only issue was that it was a lot to take in as a new reader, especially the history of the war and the virus.  But I did get a good grip on it over time and it was worth the effort. If anything, it makes me want to go read the series backlist. I will definitely be reading the future books. I hope Katie's feisty friend Maggie gets her story next!
$SUMMARY.: Makes me want to read the backlist!

$review_text.: Gioia Clementine has arrived at a shifter&#8217;s resort/camp believing it is her last hope to stop the isolation that her son has been quickly placing himself in. With her mate and the father of her son dead, Gioia has come hoping that the resort&#8217;s owner can find a way to break through the wall her son has raised. But when she learns just how he wants to do it, Gioia is unsure she wants to bring in a playboy.Soren Snow is an internationally renowned musician and a playboy by choice. He is also a polar bear shifter. When Soren receives a call from his brother about a troubled boy he is working with who idolizes him, Soren can&#8217;t say no to coming to the isolated resort in Northern Ontario, even if the great outdoors is definitely not his thing. Imagine his surprise at his shifter&#8217;s self instant reaction to the boy&#8217;s mother. Mating is the last thing on Soren&#8217;s to do list.Gioia is surprised by the real man that Soren is and how he gives so much to her son. She would even give a second chance to a playboy for the smiles he brings out of her son. As the days go by, Gioia finds herself drawn more and more to Soren with an intense attraction. Just as a break through comes in both her son&#8217;s acceptance of his past and the passion that has flamed between Gioia and Soren &#8211; a new arrival to the resort blows everything up. When the smoke clears will Gioia and Soren have a clear chance to achieve the future that awaits them? And will her son be able to accept the relationship between his idol and his mother?A desperate mother and a playboy musician join to help a troubled boy with the result being a true love that will encompass all three of them. Gioia and Soren find that love in Predator&#8217;s Serenade. I would have never guessed that Soren would drop everything and return to the fishing camp/resort in the great outdoors. And yet he instantly stepped up once he met Gioia and her son. Gioia wasn&#8217;t really looking for a new relationship when she arrived at the fishing camp/resort but once she met Soren passion was immediate. I watched as Soren quickly grew from being a playboy without a care into a man who wanted the responsibility of having a mate and her son. When the surprise person came in to their relationship, I thought that would be the worse hurdle they would have to overcome but I was wrong. The worse threat was different entirely. I loved when Soren gave Gioia her greatest joy and how he did it. What a way to proclaim your love. Predator&#8217;s Serenade combines passion with suspense with twists of humor and a young boy&#8217;s trust.This book was reviewed by Jo for Joyfully Reviewed (JR), and was provided by the publisher/author at no cost to JR for the purpose of being reviewed.

$REVIEW.: I really did like this book, it does have a wealth of information which can be APPLIED to more modern techniques, and generally just gets you thinking in different directions as a book like this should.  But given todays climate and the fact that every state has improved security tremendously around IDs and ID cards and even birth certificates, unless you want to try your hand with a laminated Maine ID and or birth certificate printed on improper paper (and probably end up in jail), this may not be the best resource to follow word for word any longer.  I didnt like the fact that he barely delved into the new world of teslin and pvc credit card hologramed high quality state IDs (if at all actually) as I feel that you would have to in a book of this nature today, but overall there are some worth while "ideas" in this book that have helped me get a bit better in the real world.  Id recommend, but with a bit of caution depending on what your planning on doing, or not doing (*wink*).

$REVIEW.: "The Biggest Loser Cookbook" has become a hit at our house.  We tend to focus on the snack foods, easy meals and breakfasts, so we don't have much to say about the dinners.  We found the following:  (1) The recipes are simple and quick, using food items we can easily buy; (2) The snacks and meals are filling, even though they are much lighter in calories; and (3) The recipes have flavor.  All of the recipes are easily adaptable:  After reading the snacks section, our daughter-in-law began cutting up bananas and mixing them in lowfat yogurt for the grandkids.  They love it and it is good for them.  Buy it!

$review_text.: Looking at the cover for Breaking The Reins you would be forgiven for thinking that you were going to get a nice sweet story that involves a girl with a love of horses. And to some extent, you do get that. But this story completely blindsided me with it's depth. I was so thoroughly unprepared for the gamut of emotions that this story covered. There were such moments of sweetness, but there were also such moments of heartbreak and terror.From the outside Hannah Taylor appears to have it all. Wealth, social status and Eric, her loving boyfriend... But Hannah doesn't really care too much for the trappings of the well to do society her family are a part of. She would much prefer to be helping her Grandma on her ranch or riding her beloved horse. But then tragedy strikes and her Grandma and horse are killed in a fire and the ranch is left to Hannah. As if dealing with her loss wasn't enough, then Animal Control bring Hannah, Argus, an abused horse to care for. Throw into the mix the hot new polo player Leonardo Fernandes who treats her just how a woman should be treated. Their attraction to each other is sizzling but Eric is not about to let Hannah go and he is willing to do whatever it takes to show her that.Domestic violence is an all too common occurrence in our society and Juliana Haygert described perfectly the fear that it's victims live with. She created a character in Eric who was charming, good looking and an incredibly well respected member of the community. It was hard not to be swept away by his charms. But very slowly Hannah began to see glimpses of a man that she doesn't know. His jealousy was always something that made Hannah feel incredibly loved but when Leo entered the picture Eric's jealousy reached a whole new level.Hannah was such a strong character who was beaten down by the man she loved. How do you reconcile your feelings for the man you knew with the man he has become? There were scenes in this book that were so heartbreaking. As Eric's true colours were revealed it was hard to imagine how he managed to maintain the facade for so long. He was truly crazy!! Hannah will need to gather every bit of strength she has to survive what Eric inflicts upon her.I loved Leo!! He was supportive and respectful. He was so loving and caring. All the traits that a woman looks for in a partner. Someone who is your equal and who listens when you speak and cares about what you have to say. But Leo's life hasn't been everything it appears to be. He has secrets. Dark, messy secrets. How is Hannah going to deal with what Leo has been keeping from her?And then there is Argus. Boy what a wonderful part of the story this horse was. So incredibly broken. So badly mistreated by a previous owner, he is wary of everyone and everything. With everything going on in Hannah's life, Argus proves how incredibly sensitive and intuitive animals are.This is the first book that I have had the pleasure of reading from Juliana Haygert and I can guarantee that it definitely will not be the last. If you are after a New Adult book that goes much deeper and darker than a lot that you will read, then Breaking the Reins is the book for you. Although not incredibly fast paced it is really well written and will have you turning the pages to find out what exactly will happen next.4.5/5 Intense Stars.This book was gifted to me for an honest review.

$review_text.: I read many online reviews before downloading this book.  Both sides of the political spectrum seemed to hate it, arguing that it is over simplistic and just plain wrong-headed or biased.  Frankly, that's exactly why I found myself curled up non-stop reading the entire book in one sitting.  It is NOT politically correct, sure.  But Clifton's observations merit serious consideration.  To anger the right wing, he argues that with GDP driving jobs, and with &#34;good&#34; jobs driving the economy, significant cuts in the federal budget will be counterproductive, both in the short and longer term.  A smaller government cuts off vital support to the many services and supports that a growing economy needs (pre-K through higher education, basic scientific research, safe streets, etc.).  To aggravate the left wing, he makes a good case that &#34;taxing the rich&#34; simply cannot generate enough revenue to even come close to making up for fiscal shortfalls, so entitlement programs must inevitably be dialed down.  Then, his take on healthcare will offend just about anyone who is not at an ideal body weight, doesn't exercise, eschews preventive medical exams, and wants to claw out every last day of life in an expensive terminal illness.  Well, as a medical industry executive for the past 30 years, my first reaction was to challenge his claim that healthcare costs are nothing but a drag on jobs growth (after all, what's wrong with an industry that employs 1/5 of all American workers . . . many in what he defines as &#34;good&#34; jobs . . . in every single town and city in the country, improves health, and for the most part cannot be outsourced to China).  Yet, in the end, I'm forced to agree with his points, even on healthcare.  None of what I said in the parenthetical above mitigates the fact that taxpayers can no longer afford to shoulder the costs of replacing the knees and hips of 90 year olds, and obesity absolutely IS the number one health problem in our country, which needs immediate and aggressive intervention.  Please read the book . . . but first put down your political biases , , , and just think about the significant likelihood that Mr. Clifton is doing something that our politicians simply cannot afford to do in the current electoral environment . . . he's telling it like it really is, whether any of us like it or not!

$REVIEW.: Not impressed with the book.The dialogue is stilted and sounds like the kind of conversation you might expect from two robots. Most people don't say "cannot" "am not," etc. Also, if you're going to write dialogue that children (especially young girls) are supposedly speaking, maybe have some experience with how kids speak before you start. Kids don't say "yes" and use full, formal English. They use contractions like they're going out of style.The villain really just needed a Snidely Whiplash mustache to twirl. This is a very good example of "show, don't tell" being completely ignored by an author. We get it, he's evil. But again, don't tell us how naughty the guy is. Show us by having him do things.A lack of good dialogue and interesting characters makes this book boring and nearly unreadable.To sum up, if you love robotic dialogue and characters you don't give two craps about, I would highly recommend this book. If you prefer interesting, diverse characters, you may want to skip this.

$review_text.: Kari and her mother move to New York City for a new prestigious position, after leaving her small Wisconsin town and memories of her father's accident there behind.  For a teenaged protagonist, Kari was easy to relate to and care for: her sad past and her eagerness to find the new life, opportunities and possible love interests for her mother were endearing.  As with many things, nothing is ever quite what it seems, and that also relates to the wonderful opportunities: scholarship to a prestigious high school, the beautiful people and the ease with which they seem to incorporate a major metropolis into their lives without great distress.As Kari starts to feel seeds of unease, the questions start to arrive in a fast and furious manner: although the answers are far less apparent.  Just what is the ToT and just how much influence it has on this world, and on the live of the people who work for them is a slow-developing reveal, mixed in this smoothly paced story that demands you read on.I will be the first to admit that Kari is often far more mature in her approach, speech, thinking and behavior than one would expect, or want to see in a high school teen. However, when you take into account her life experience and her only child status, it did fit her well, even as it may be problematic for some readers. Aside from that and my wishing that there was more of an explanation and solidity built to give more substance to the characters of the Embodied, I did enjoy this read.  I think that many YA fans would appreciate this story, and be ready to read the second book in the trilogy when it comes available.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$REVIEW.: Please don't hear me making light of such a devastating disease.  But in C L Scholey's world the lead character is consumed by worry over her diagnosis just a year before the earth began to be destroyed by tsunami, meteor storms, and all manner of destruction.  She is rescued by the Castians, a race of long lived aliens who haven't had females (due to a guerilla war maneuver by their enemies, the Tonans) in 400 years.  while they don't have any experience with women, they have well developed friendships and all male families (not homosexual).  Anyway, because of her illness she seems to have no value to their society.It was a heart wrenching tale that was well written.  At one point I thought I could smell the ashe of the volcanic activity.  I would say more, but I think I have given enough of the story away.This is a positive review of the literature presented.  I feel compelled to say this, for 100 pages I paid nearly $5, I don't normally do that, and I had to think long and hard before I bought the first book. This is not a positive statement as to the price, while it was a great product, it wasn't enough for the price.

$review_text.: So I must say I enjoyed this book

 It needs a lot of editing and can be a little confusing when the dialogue includes all the characters in the book


 Even with all that this book has some serious drama and some funny as hell drama


 And I know drama because I read a lot of urban fiction, so when I say this book got drama you got to believe me
 I gave it 5 stars because I enjoyed the story

 It was not the best written book and even parts of it was predictable, but I enjoyed the hell out of it.So bring on the next book in this series...

$REVIEW.: I like this book a lot, it is a brief synopsis of the overall idea of each of the major openings. Like a previous reviewer noted, it is strictly for beginners and will not teach you an opening. It will, however, give you the basic plan behind the opening and can be the starting point for study (after which you will want to get a dedicated opening book, most likely).If you look at it as The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings 'lite', you will not be far off. My only major complaint with this book is coverage of the Caro-Kann compared to some other openings. It's basically nonexistant, and you are left feeling a little short changed. The coverage of the Sicilian, on the other hand, is quite good (for a book of this type) mentioning both c3 and several forms of the open (the author is a dragon expert!).After you read this book, I think the ideas behind the chess openings should be your next book, for a little more detail, then probably choose one or two opening specific books -- the new 'Starting out' series by everyman would probably be a good choice for a novice player. As always, MCO (or NCO -- don't want to start a holy war) will be useful as reference material.In summary, this book is very good, but is only the first step; you will not find everything you need in this book, only a very broad overview.

$review_text.: I'm with You is seriously one of the best books I have read. Glenna Maynard has written a book that touches the very depths of your heart, reaches into places that you didn't know existed and is truly amazing. The story of Bella Rose and Cutter Dawson is unlike anything I have read before, and will pull you in instantly.Bella Rose has suffered a tremendous heartache. She is a hopelessly broken soul that is trying to find her place in the world. Bella is at the end of her rope, but she is pulled back from the edge by another who is just as broken as she is, Cutter Dawson.Bella tries to fight this pull between herself and Cutter. She makes a deal with him. A deal that she isn't so sure that she will be able to keep at first, but as she gets sucked into the magnetism that is Cutter, it becomes impossible to not want to keep up her end of the deal.There is so much I want to say about Bella and Cutter. They are both amazing characters. I felt every heartache and happy emotion that these two felt. My heart broke for Bella and Cutter. The pain that they both had to endure was gut wrenching. You will need tissues for this one. Like I said, they are both broken and tortured souls looking for light in a world of darkness, but they are also incredibly strong even if they didn't know it.The story of I'm with You is so different from the other books that Glenna has written. There were so many elements that I can go on and on about, but I can't without giving away too many spoilers. Bella is amazing. Cutter is HOT. Brianna is awesome, and Hurley is freaking hilarious.Another note, I literally gasped out loud at one point while reading. Glenna totally through a huge plot twist in, that knocked me off my rocker. She is a phenomenal author, and I can't say enough about I'm with You. Absolutely amazing doesn't even begin to describe it!

He had left behind a classical career finding fame beyond his wildest dream with the group. Everyone seemed be finding a "soulmate", but not Julian. When invited to go out with his bandmates he would always decline because he would be the only one alone.Then before they go on their latest tour, Julian meets Morgan Chandler, an out of work music teacher who is looking for a job. Morgan accepts a job as a roadie. He has no other choices coming in at the moment...and this will bring him closer to Julian.Morgan has always loved Julian's music when he had a classical career,and also found himself falling in love with man behind the music. It is instant chemistry when the two meet. They decide to keep their relationship a secret because they don't know what type of reaction they would get from the others.This leads to a lot of sneaking around and a lot of heartache for the both of them. But there is also a plot twist that adds a little extra to love story blooming between Julian and Morgan.

$REVIEW.: Wolfsbane is book three in the discarded heroes series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series - Nightshade, but I somehow missed the second book - Digitalis. Thankfully, these books can stand alone although they are better when read in order so readers can know the back story on the members of the team.Danielle Roark escapes from a brutal Venezuelan general only to find herself facing charges of espionage. Canyon "Midas" Metcalfe is constantly running from haunting memories of a past mission gone bad. Can they get over their past or will their past destroy them?Ronie is a gifted writer who makes her characters and stories come to life. Her characters are believable and far from perfect. The Christians in the stories make mistakes, and there are consequences for those mistakes. They do their best to live their lives in a manner that is pleasing to the Lord, but they fall short as do all Christians in one way or another.Wolfsbane is a high-energy, fast-paced story filled with stories of overcoming life's hurdles, forgiveness, and love.  It's characters are filled with raw emotion that pours out on the pages of the book.  I highly recommend adding this book to your reading list.Disclosure: I received a digital copy of this book from Barbour Publishing through NetGalley to help facilitate the writing of a frank and honest review.

$review_text.: Chandra was still a teenager when she met Malik. She had goals and dreams that she wanted to accomplish before meeting him.  Malik was much older than Chandra and she was ok with the fact that he was older because he accepted her just how she was and encouraged her goals and deams.  They traveled, talked and got to know each other in a way Chandra felt she never know any other man.  When Malik asked her to marry him she was thrilled and despite her family not being happy for her she accepted the proposal.  Shortly after the honeymoon The man Chandra once knew was gone and Malik had changed into a controlling, abusive husband.  He dictated what she wore, how she wore it and where she went.  Everything she did or planned to do had to be run past him.  Chandra is convinced that the reason Malik acts this way is her fault and she plans to always make her marriage work by any means.  Will Chandra be able to face reality that her once happy relationship isn't going back or will she did trying to get Malik to realize there love?Author Catchet has done it again. This book will have you with tons of emotion.  It was like you felt bad for Chandra but then you think she is stupid because your like why are you sticking around, run for your life.  I was shaking my head at her yelling at Malik. Malik is a piece of work! He will make you so angry! The things he did to his wife would make anyone upset.  This book opens your eyes some people may look like they gave if all together and inside they are hurting due to various reasons.  I don't want to give anything away from the book but I will say its a must read and if you have been a victim of domestic violence it may be hard for you to read.  Can't wait for part 2!

Using the city of Pittsburgh the way James Lee Burke uses the Bayous of Louisiana, Palumbo frames an engaging story on parallel tracks that keeps you guessing and anxious.  The intelligent complexity of the plot keeps the pages turning and the surprises coming.  Others have detailed the plot so I will just say that this is one terrific read.

$REVIEW.: Three different women, three different stories, all interwoven, all showing the trials of planning an Amish wedding.  Priscilla King wonders if all the set backs and bad luck are God's way of telling her not to wed.  Naomi Fisher is tired of playing matchmaker for everyone else, while she remains alone.  Rose Bender struggles with allowing friendship to grow into love.  Will these women find their own happiness in the end?Sometimes, you just need to read a nice sweet love story.  Or three.  This book make me happy.  Just plain happy.  Not a lot of books do that, and while this book was not high literature, it did elicit a specific feeling, so in and of that, it is successful.  I really enjoyed the way the book was three stories, with all the characters making appearances in the various stories.  It made for nice short reading sections, with the added benefit of continuity.  My only critique is that I might have changed the order of the three a bit, since we hear hints of Priscilla's troubles long before we actually read her story.  However, I think with some of the action seeming to take place simultaneously, the order is kind of irrelevant.I really enjoyed the three main female characters, but I have to say Naomi's story was the one I enjoyed the most.  Having married later than many of my peers, I felt that was the one to which I most related.  Each story was written by a different author, and I think each had their own unique voice, but never strayed from the main concept of the book.Fans of Amish fiction will enjoy this three-in-one book, as will anyone in need of a nice sweet romance.

$REVIEW.: I've had Jason Alba and Jesse Street's new e-book I'm on Facebook - Now What?? for a few weeks
 I'd planned on reviewing it sooner, but I found it to be incredibly slow reading.Why?Because every few pages, something they wrote had me going back to my Facebook account and adding, subtracting or adjusting something.Jason and Jesse have created a very clear, concise guide to the many ways you can enhance your professional life with Facebook

 There are plenty of screen shots and examples to illustrate their points


 One of my favorite features is that each chapter ends with a little "To Do" list that helps readers apply what they just learned.As you would imagine, the book is structured to take a novice from start to finish


 So if you're already a seasoned Facebook user, you can skip the first chapter or two
 The meatiest part of the book are the center chapters but they are nicely bookended with the intro to Facebook on the front and the etiquette and glossary on the back.

$REVIEW.: Part I  (free on Amazon)The kindle does not upload reviews; I wish I remember what I wrote, as a reader I was blown away with the first part I of the Anastasia- The Dregg Chronicles, it was a sweet treat, delicious to the end. Fast paced and suspenseful, from page one to the conclusion.Anastasia was a sweet young woman until tragedy almost destroys her life. Now the aftermath is a path of light and darkness. What will be her choices, good or bad, it will be a difficult journey to deal with, of the unfair experience she suffers through.I read this and above is the second nighttime snack part II of the series, it is a horror, fairytale and adventure all wrapped in a small package. I was hook from the first book and read the second and of course now craving more.

$REVIEW.: As one who is seldom at a loss for words, I am finding it very difficult to absorb the contents of this book and write about the effect it has had on me
This cruel, naked, poignant, impossible story of the Lost Boys journey through hell sounds more like a Hollywood screenplay than the recollections of real little boys


Were it a Hollywood script, no studio would buy it because the story is too horrific and grotesque to be believable.Unfortunately for the book's subjects it was all too true
Fortunately for us, they have chosen to share their memories with us so that we may begin to grasp the severity and horror of their journey


They've done the world a great service in doing so

I can only hope that the sharing in some ways helps their healing.This book is all at once gripping, repulsive and mesmerizing

I often found the content beyond my comprehension

For little boys to be ripped from their families to wander aimlessly, ill and starving, dodging bullets, encountering wild beasts who would have gladly eaten them for dinner, and to be at the mercy of the desert sun--often without water-- is a fate one would not wish on an animal
 I imagine few of us have spent even mere moments of our lives knowing the terror that was these boys reality for years.I must admit I was unaware of the extent of the Sudanese holocaust, and for that I am ashamed

I know this book has raised awareness and for that I thank the author, Judy Bernstein, for recognizing the need to tell this story and for the hard work of getting it done.To Benson, Alephonsion and Benjamin, I hope you are still able to love and trust in a world where it would be completely understandable if you were not

There are good people among us and I'm thankful your journey brought you to Judy and to San Diego
I hope you are finding some measure of happiness here.I wish you long life and peace.

$review_text.: This book had an interesting start to say the least, and once I started it, I couldn't seem to put it down.  While the job that Jack had, being a crime scene cleaner, was... gruesome at best it was great that there wasn't a lot of focus on that in this book.  Yes they do talk about a crime scene, but Z.A. didn't go overboard with the details.  The story more focused upon the relationship that was forming between Jack and Ryan.While Jack's character was well developed, I felt like Ryan's could have been more filled out, in my opinion.  You learn a lot about Jack, but not that much about Ryan during the course of the book.  You know he has a good heart and he is a sucker for the helpless, but besides that there really isn't a lot you learn.The secondary characters were well written and it does leave more up for grabs in future books.  I think that Z.A. wrote this keeping in mind that they wanted to do the series.  But it wasn't done in a way that there were a bunch of unanswered questions you were left wondering about.  It just leaves you wanting for more.I would recommend this book to friends of mine who are looking for a good read and don't mind spending such an amount of money on a first book in the series.

$review_text.: I need to regroup my thoughts for this book, I mean five stars is just isn't enough, seriously is that good. I've always enjoyed reading, some might say obsession I think it's healthy addiction. That been said, I take refuge in new worlds, characters and situations books offer me, and Locked has touched every emotion a human can have. Wonder, anger, love, sadness, complete utter heartbreak, amazement, illusion, humor and the list goes on. I was drawn to this book because I would be getting reacquainted with one of my favorite (I'm sure am not the only one) characters, Sherlock Holmes. Who doesn't find it extremely sexy an intelligent (genius he would say) , sarcastic, and infuriating man? Obviously the &#34; holy mother of balls&#34; shockingly attractive, helps add up to the hot factor. Nonetheless he is not your typical swoon-drooling male, but so much more. There is so much I would love to say about Sherlock, but my next favorite character needs the spotlight, Irene Adler. She is such a brave and strong woman, the things she's gone through although to the outside has made her an outcast in reality has just toughened her up, she's very smart, off the charts loyal and a good person at heart. Although there isn't much emphasis on her looks, you can tell right away she's beautiful.Like I said, I find it difficult expressing all my feelings and thoughts this book has inspired, the plot is surprising and a page turner, the dialog between the characters is entertaining and endearing, and the love that they share is like I've said before completely utterly heartbreaking, I've never cried so much for a book, the tears just kept flowing with me not even noticing, and now a think I have a love/hate admiration for Eva Morgan, creating such a wonderful story and making me wait who knows when until the next book is out, and the ending? Oh God, I was overjoyed and totally pissed  at the same time, and again, just makes waiting for the next book in the series so much worse. Read the book, future readers, the wait, the laughter and the tears are completely worth it. Eva Morgan is writer to watch out for, excellent author. And in the meantime, I will be re watching every Sherlock Holmes, movie, series and most probably reading this wonderful book again.
$SUMMARY.: I fell in love with a new series!

$review_text.: The setting of censorship during the apartheid era in South Africa, and relationships between the races during and after apartheid is the overallcontext for the book.  But the real story is about the relationship between parents and children, between siblings, between the individual and the state, between our obligations to our principles and to the families we create, and between adults who are life partners.  How much do you really know?  How much do you share?  How much of what you tell about your life story is how things really happened?  And it isn't so much about the fallability of memory as it is about how we create entire worlds to explain what we think is going on with those around us -- and some of what we think know is true/accurate, and some of what we think we know isn't at all what is going on.  There are puzzles within puzzles within puzzles in this book, and it is one of those novels that you want to immediately turn back to page one and start all over again.  Also one of those books where you turn the final page and then say "Wait a minute, but what about . . . . . what am I suspose to think/assume/conclude about X and Y and Z?"  An absolutely astounding book.

$REVIEW.: I was immediately intrigued by the title of this book. I've read a fair amount about Blessed Pope John Paul II and I've read and studied even more that was written by him. Both what I've read about and by him have always served to bring me closer to the Lord and grow in appreciation of the love and mercy offered to us by God, Jesus Christ, and the Blessed Mother. He and Blessed Mother Teresa are two of the people I've always enjoyed reading about and learning from, regardless of what aspect of their lives a certain book or article covered.The Secret Life of John Paul IIis a powerfully moving account of how the holiness, sanctity, compassion, and warmth of this man touched many even when he was "off the record." You will see how John Paul II's prayerful spirit, love of nature, sportsmanship, and friendliness pervade the moments he spent during his secret getaways to mountains in Italy to enjoy two past times from his youth: hiking and skiing.Learn how mountain guide Lino Zani and his family formed a lifelong friendship with John Paul II. During his "clandestine trip" to go skiing, the pope was deeply moved by the family's hospitality and very interested in the history of the Adamello area where they live. While visiting there, the man referred as the "Fatima pope" had a surprising revelation that relates to the third secret of Fatima.I highly recommendThe Secret Life of John Paul IIto people who are interested in the outdoors, faith, John Paul II, Fatima, and those who enjoy learning about history and nature.

$REVIEW.: This is a great devotional for a group of friends that want to get together to study God's Word or just for a bunch of women who want to get together to know one another better while learning to trust God as well. The basis of this book is trust, obviously. We don't have to understand God in order to trust Him. In this culture we want to be in control. And so learning to trust God in the context in which we live in is sometimes difficult. So take this 12 week journey and learn to trust better, not to mention, some of these principles can even be applied to earthly relationships as well. Get together with a group of girls and dig in, this book is easy to do that with!

$REVIEW.: The RevealingBy: Suzanne Woods FisherAlways kinda sad when its the last book of a series. What wonderful strong characters. Suzanne never disappoints with getting you to fall in love with the characters.  This is a series so it is important to read them in order so you can follow the characters.  The Letters, The Calling and last The revealing.  Stories of love, mystery and forgiveness.  This one also is a book you won't want to put down once you start reading it.  I think I love the spiritual of Suzanne's books. I love the romance  but it is done in a very tasteful way. Naomi King stands out in the series as the one with insight.  She seems to know a lot about the people. Naomi is in love with prisoner Toby but word has it someone else has his baby. Can this be true Toby has bee n with a Englischer?  Is this girl really carrying his baby? Great book you will love the story. Looking forward to seeing if any of the characters in this series will be carried over to another.I was given this book yo give my own honest review by Revell.

I found that the Alpha males accepted their bond wayyyy to easily and fell in love with each other too fast


I didn't feel that their relationship was real

What saved it and help me give it 2 stars was the fact that the plot had its merit and it was interesting
I just feel it needed a bit more developing.

$REVIEW.: The primary purpose of this book seems to be to stimulate interest and to teach laymen what actions need to be taken to lead us to global environmental stability.  Dr. Peter Doherty has an encyclopedic knowledge of immunology and epidemiology, specifically viruses, and an equally encyclopedic knowledge of the specific birds he portrays as the &#8216;early warning systems&#8217; for humanity.The book is pedantic at times.  Dr. Doherty is a brilliant scientist, renowned in his field, and it was kind of thoughtful that he took the time away from scholarly and peer reviewed articles to explain the problems to us in pretty plain English.Some parts of this book are more interesting, some just awesome.  Birds are like the servants of our planet.  Some clean cities by eating the food waste on the streets; eagles and vultures eat soft tissues of dead creatures.  Birds pollinate and carry seeds.  They bring nutrients.  They sing.  They play.  They preen.Probably the only annoying thing about this book is the way each chapter ends, in a rousing call to action.  There are ways we can help record and help add to the knowledge about birds in the world, to become citizen scientists.  We owe it to our feathered friends and we owe it to our planet.-Gertrude

$review_text.: When I started Oracle of Philadelphia, and found the angel hierarchy at the beginning, I didn't have high hopes. I've never been a huge 'angels vs demons' fan: The angels are always so good they make your teeth hurt and the demons are just as one-dimensional, in the other direction.Apparently, the author shared my apathy. She took the standard mythos surrounding oracles, angels and demons, Biblical events, doomed souls, and created a fascinating story. It's filled with laugh-out-loud moments and scenes that will break your heart.Bedlam's stories alone will keep the pages turning. When he and Carrie (calling herself Khet, at the time) first meet:He sat up straight and faced me. "Okay, so here's my problem. You know how sometimes you start doing something, and it seems like a good idea at the time, but then suddenly there are dead bodies everywhere, and you're not quite sure how that happened?"Which eventually evolves into an explanation of Bedlam's involvement with the golden calf, idolatry, and Moses smashing the first version of the ten commandments. His messing with Rafael's 'tidings of great joy' speech to the shepherds is still a sore spot with the angel. But, after all, he is the angel/demon of chaos.Humor aside, this is, at the heart of it, the story of an 8,000-year-old oracle who meets a soul so pure that she breaks her own rule about getting directly involved. It is told with a number of flashbacks to periods in her history that explain how she met many of the other characters. And how she came to be immortal.The only issue I have with Oracle of Philadelphia is the revelation of Carrie's true name at the end. Not how it was revealed, which was a well-crafted spin on an old, old tale. It was more that, given the truth, there was very little reaction from her friends - good or bad.With that said, this was a great first novel and I can't wait to see where the author takes us next.~*~*~Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary electronic copy of this book from the publisher [...].

$review_text.: As far as descriptions of sights, restaurants tours, history, etc, the information was pretty accurate


 But actually being in Prague and using the book to get around to different sights and restaurants was extremely difficult.Instead of having a chapter on a specific neighborhood with everything in that neighborhood, they have a chapter on neighborhoods, then shopping, then eating, then drinking, then entertainment, etc
 Having to flip to the eating section, then flip back to the neighborhood section, then flip to the map to see where it was located was very time consuming and annoying.Another thing I didn't like was that the writing on the maps was much too small

 I have perfect reading vision and could barely make out the street names and numbers.

$REVIEW.: Wyatt's attempt at bringing something new to the zombie realm was a success. I've recently started my love affair with this whole zombie, apocalyptic, end of days, Walking Dead genre.  By no means am I a seasoned veteran, but I was really happy with this particular story.  The characters, even though there are very few, were believable.  The only criticism that I may have is that it always seemed that the humans had the upper hand.  To be in constant conflict and have not one casualty was hard to swallow.  The three tiered zombies were cool. It brought a human element to the pawns of any zombie story. Looking forward to the second installment.

$review_text.: So I stand by all my previous comments about Cynthia Eden, romantic suspense can be a tricky genre to tackle, too much of one can over-shadow the other, and sometimes it all just gets lost. Not this time, and not ever in this series, each book is as strong as its predecessor and just as enthralling.Noah York and Claire Kramer do feature in the previous books, but Mine To Hold is their story, and theirs alone. We found out a little of Claire's past in Mine To Keep, and Noah has been a part of Trace's world for a while so featured in both Mine To Take & Keep.A lot goes on in this book, (as with the previous), the pace is fast and frenzied, and just when you think you have all your ducks in a row, another one turns up and ruins the whole line up again. I was kept guessing right up until the end, and I loved every moment of it.So Noah York is a self made man, much like Trace Weston, he has his own personal demons, and lives by the &#34;One Night Only&#34; rule. He is a tiger in the bedroom, a total gent out of it, and has women falling over themselves for the chance of one night, that is until he meets Claire Kramer......Noah - &#34;I look at you and my whole body burns. I want you naked. I want you screaming. I want to see pleasure make your eyes flash even brigther&#34;Although polar opposites in some ways Noah and Claire have an awful lot in common. Similar losses, similar pasts and a need to protect those around them. Noah does this by fighting, Claire by running, only she can't seem to run fast enough or hide well enough to evade Noah, and when they unite..... BOOM!&#34;We touch, we kiss, and we ignite.&#34;I can't gush enough about this series, I have highlighted so much of the book, I could post quotes for an hour. I want more, I hope Drake gets his own book and happy ending too.ARC supplied by the author through Netgalley, in exchange to the above honest review.

EZ just can't and won't let it slide!Gordon Kessler has created a collection of endearing realistic characters, while the action and  situations may push the envelope of credulity they never quite do and are well written


This is the second of the  Knight Reports I've read, Knight's Late Train now Knight's Big Easy, I've read them in reverse order

$review_text.: For his rhetorical criticisms to have bite, David Stove focuses on a particular vision of Darwin's own thought and, later in the book, on the less circumspect pronouncements of Richard Dawkins.  In both cases, Stove denies that he has constructed `straw men'.  He wants his criticisms to strike at the core of Darwinian thought, both in its historical form and in the guise of current `Neo-Darwinism'.  While his targets may not be made entirely of straw, they certainly do not seem central - it seems entirely likely that a proponent could reject Stove's characterisation and still feel a `mainstream' Darwinian.In the early essays, Stove makes central to Darwin's thought the claim by the Reverend T.R.Malthus that populations tend to increase to the limits of their food supply.  This idea is said to have been to key to Darwin proposing an explanatory theory - suddenly the change in species evident in the fossil record could be explained in terms of natural variation and Malthus' principle.  Stove then delights in showing that populations are not constrained solely by food supply; he cites Malthus's own revisions to the theory, adding first the `biological' opposition of famine, war, and pestilence, and finally `moral restraint'; and, with rhetorical relish, he states the obvious in that humans do not, as a matter of fact, reproduce as frequently as well they might - and `hunger' is not the only restraint here.  Stove's writing has wit, but it is also repetitive and verges on the condescending.Stove also feels that `genunine' Darwinian thought is committed to a continuous and literal battle between conspecifics.  If blood is not being spilt, then, for Stove, this is evidence that what is `predicted' by Darwinism is false.  With this characterisation of Darwinism in mind, Stove then labours the point that we, along with other animals and plants, are not constantly tearing at each others throats.  Many pages of faintly humorous examples follow.In these essays, Stove has shown that Darwinian thinking, at least when deployed in the ways Stove cites, is a poor explanation of the everyday behaviour of humans, and for that matter most organisms.  But Darwin's theory is one that hopes to explain the evolution of the species, not everyday behaviour.  The fact that its explanatory limits stop well short of everyday behaviour is a point well made, but not that interesting a point - certainly it is not surprising, even by the lights of the theory itself.When it comes to tackling Richard Dawkins, Stove aims his criticism at the imprudent extension of Darwinian explanation to human motivation.  His strategy here is analogous to that mentioned above.  In `The Selfish Gene' Dawkins makes himself a ripe target for such criticism, and the blows surely fall.  Stove pillories Dawkins' use of anthropomorphic language in discussions of genes, along with Dawkins' disingenuous promises to translate such ideas back into the `respectable' language of science; Stove also gives a plausible psychological explanation as to why such interpretations of Neo-Darwinism are popular, drawing analogies with other `puppet theories' of human motivation or `demonologies', positing a perverse inclination to, evidence be damned, regard humans as `fundamentally' selfish, and acknowledging the startling effect the discovery of genes has had on the human psyche in general.  As an addendum, the theory of memes is summarily dispatched, although with less rigorous argument that might be expected - Dawkins' own reservations, contained in a paragraph of The Extended Phenotype, are, ironically, more damning than Stove's invective.Stove's discussion of `inclusive fitness' theory is more telling.  He highlights the explanatory limitations of such a theory by demonstrating that many events it would predict do not in fact occur, often real life presenting the very opposite actuality.Ultimately, the book reads as a warning not to take Darwinian theory as explanatory beyond certain boundaries.  For fossils, and some of the baffling adaptations seen in insects, plants, and animals, the theory offers an explanation where no alternative exists.  As some kind of guide as to how a human life is in fact lead or, worse still, how it should be lead, Darwinian thinking tells us precisely nothing.  In sum, this is Stove's point and, unfortunately, obvious though it be, it seems like it is one that needs making.  Perhaps thanks to its repetitiveness, lack of argumentitve rigour, and its sarcastic tone, the book is an entertaining read - although to actually extract arguments which one can use in one's own discussion is a much more onerous task.

$review_text.: This was  a good read and well worth the price.  There are 3 short stories.1st:For better or worse.  This was my least favorite.  I'd give it 2 stars.  It's about a werewolf who wants to commit suicide.  His girlfriend (or wife?)  shows up to stop him.  I don't like thoughts of suicide with my romance.2nd: Blind Love.  Very sweet.  3 Stars.  An elephant man type who falls for a blind plane crash survivor.  Will she return to his ugliness when she can see again?3rd:  Seducing the Night.  The longest story and my favorite.  5 stars.  A vampire hunters fiance is turned into a vampire.  (Minor inconsistency- If they were waiting for the wedding to have sex, why does she think the baby is his?)  But overall, a great read.  Couldn't put it down once I started.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this book. I give the author credit for putting some new spins on the ubiquitous pillowcase dress (adding appliques) so there's a little something different there than the usual online patterns offer. I thought the bathrobe pattern was particularly appealing. The photography is charming and the instructions are pretty complete.I docked the book a star or two, though, since many of the patterns (skirts, tops) would work only for very thin women. I also thought the book carried a few too many projects that you could really make out of any sort of fabric -- it seemed to miss some of the "special" aspects of vintage pillowcases that could have lent themselves to really unique patterns.The book is probably best suited to beginning sewers.

$review_text.: If I'm honest I would award this book 3 stars, however seeing as Amazon and Goodreads do not give the option of  stars, I've decided to round up my rating.In this book, the Elven Anjasa is now the owner and Madam of the Brothel once owned by Zarach, whom we meet in the previous book.Anjasa is trying to juggle the day to day running of the club and spend time with her Vampire lover. But a mysterious stranger warns her that she is in great danger should she continue such a relationship with the vampire. Anjasa once again must decide who it is she can trust.Once again this book is scorching hot and once again it appears Anjasa has very little morals when it comes to a monogamous relationships, but like the previous book, this is no hearts and flowers love story and as she isn't human I can overlook her promiscuoucity.I had one main concern with this book and that was with the character Luscious. I have no idea what he is, other than describing in detail, his very distinguishable features. There were also a few more characters introduced in this book and also some, who were mentioned in the previous book, featured more in this story.If you are looking for an emotional rollercoaster boy meets girl kind of a story, I would say this book isn't for you, but if you are looking for a Hot, highly sexual fantasy story then I would definitely recommend.

$review_text.: "The Wonga Coup" is a fascinating piece of investigative journalism from Economist journalist Adam Roberts.  Roberts has to synthesize a tale that includes events unfolding in Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Congo, Canary Islands, Mali, Spain and the UK.Roberts gets firsthand contributions from most of the failed coup's frontline participants, the notable exceptions being Simon Mann (still jailed in Zimbabwe) and Nick du Toit (still jailed in EG). Mark Thatcher comes across as a ill-tempered blunderer. Roberts interviews him and Thatcher - true to form - addresses him with some none-too-subtle physical threats (Roberts notes that he's unable to tell whether they're meant to be jokes).I like the tone of Roberts's effort - he expresses a degree of admiration at the gumption and bucaneering spirit of the plotters, while at their same time laying bare their brazen openness (essentially talking openly to just about everyone, sealing their own fate) and, in the case of Mann, venality. He shows us contractual documents drawn up by Mann re. his post-coup financial reward that serve to deny any attempt by the plotters to justify their proposed actions on the basis of their inherent rightness or goodness.
$SUMMARY.: Good effort by Adam Roberts to synthesize a wide-ranging tale

$review_text.: Lonely Planet has truly stepped up their game in guidebooks
They have improved the picture quality (the book is a relatively small format so the pictures are not huge but they are gorgeous), the text is clear and understandable, and they hit the exact sweet spot of cost and enjoyment


The only downside, the book is not perfectly organized; it takes a little time to get used to their particular style

Remember, this is a guide to an entire country, there will be details missing.I miss Italy after reading this book


Lonely Planet has managed to capture the Italian spirit of traveling, the country is a masterpiece so take it in slowly
The book is structured like a good Italian meal, the antipasti (twenty five top experiences), the primo/secondo (the cities/regions), and dolce/caffee (Italian lifestyle)

The top twenty five is amazing, pick two or three and your vacation will be a huge success.There is just enough detail in the city and region descriptions to get a good sense of the area and the highlights, but they leave enough room to discover
The book is light simple enjoyable reading
They bring in history where it makes sense, but leave off the minutiae that can grind a guidebook to a halt.The traveler to Italy should really read the very last section carefully


Eating in Italy is almost a religion, and, as such, there are rituals that most Italians follow


A tourist can ignore the rituals or embrace them, in my experience, Italians don't mind either way

The biggest adjustment is the times to eat a meal

Lunch is usually a bit later in the day, rarely at noon

And dinner is never before seven, and at that hour you will likely be alone in the restaurant - the real action doesn't start until almost nine

There is also a rhythm to the meal; service will be incredibly attentive once the antipasti starts


But the moment dessert or the caffe is ordered, it is now time to relax, enjoy the aftertaste of the meal and your company


Do not expect the check to arrive immediately

In fact, the check will not arrive until closing time, unless you ask
If the waiter loved your table, it is not uncommon for one or two bottles of liquor to arrive at your table, you are free to serve yourself, and there is no charge


It is a way for the owner to say thank you for coming to his restaurant
If you find a bottle at your table, you have completely arrived.A critical thing not mentioned in this guidebook - never never never ever ever order a cappuccino after 11 AM

Never
Oh they will serve you a cappuccino, but you really don't want it

Cappuccino is a morning drink, the milk gives you power for the day you don't need that after 11


The reason you don't want the cappuccino - food safety, most machines do not have refrigeration for the milk in the machine, and it likely hasn't been cleaned since the morning use


Trust me (supported by a professional in food safety); you really don't want that cappuccino.Be particularly aware of the personal safety suggestions in this book for certain cities


When they say, carry your money in a money belt under your clothes, they mean it


The description of motley children approaching you is also important to understand - move away from them immediately, they will rob you blind if you do not


If a city mentions nothing about driving, do not try to rent a car and drive in that city
You should never consider driving in Rome (I drove in Paris for 2 years and can drive l'Etoile almost with my eyes closed, and I park the car in Rome)
The advice is generally very good and accurate.I love how Lonely Planet works both ends of the spectrum with their itineraries

There is typically a list of the traveler that wants to move around a lot, wants to shop, and see the maximum number of monuments
The other list is a slower paced, more off the beaten path, less expensive option
They both have their place and are very well represented here.Italy is a gorgeous country

In many ways it is what France was for food and traveling thirty years ago
I've found that if I try a little bit of Italian, smile, and say thank you, I have always been rewarded with good service and an enjoyable experience

It's also not hard to understand Italian; the stereotype of talking with their hands is pretty accurate.This is well near the perfect guidebook for Italy


It gave me the desire to return.

$REVIEW.: This is the first BDSM book that was authentic and gave an unapologetic view into the world of BDSM that I have had the pleasure of reading.  Abby makes no apologies for who she is and what turns her on.  Her desire to please both her deep seated need and those placed in authority over her is beautiful.  While some may see her as being merely tested through out the book I was able to witness her soaring high through the freedom she found in her submission.  This is a love story not for the faint of heart.  This is a love story that is beyond the realm of comprehension.  Real love is not something that fits into a box, passionate love is hardly ever conventional, unfailing love doesn't have to fit a mold, true love knows no restraint can effectively hold it back, even against the most experienced Dom.  Awesome story!!  I look forward to more from Lewis and Abby, as well as Al Daltrey.

She must have it and makes many sacrifices to buy it. Turns out the doll is haunted by the spirit of a 16th century woman named Nanju, who imposes her needs on Kendra. Hiro, the man who sells her the doll, helps Kendra deal with the demanding ghost while struggling with his own dark past. Will the couple resolve their problems and appease the restless spirit  from the past? You'll have to read the book to find out.This book, which is set in modern time California, but bounces back to 16th century Korea in certain sections is an interesting read for its Asian culture atmosphere, but other than that, there is nothing really groundbreaking or unique about this ghost story. A possessed doll and ghost demanding closure are familiar themes. I hoped some new twist or character development would be added to the plot to make it unique, but there wasn't. I guessed the direction of this book about 25% of the way in and it followed that guess to the end. No surprises. It doesn't mean that will be every readers experience. I'm a writer.  I read a lot. I understand plot devices and it's hard for me to come across a novel, movie, idea, etc that surprises me. But when I do, boy do I fall in love!The book was well formatted. I only found a few areas where sentences cut off and continued on another line, two places I believe. I wasn't sure if it was intentional or not. I saw no reason for it. The writing style was interesting, minimalist is the word that comes to mind. After a chapter or so I grew used to it and it no longer drew attention. Location 121 on my kindle was a bit hard to follow, but other than that everything happening was clear. I found around 23 typos, which is not bad. This book isn't released yet so the author may want to consider one more pass before putting it out. This novel was also free of many of the issues I've read in other self-published works, long passages of telling, passive writing. I feel this book is of publishable quality.*Later* I know the author did another pass for typos before releasing the book so the above mentioned may be fixed now.Some small things that irked me that might not bother other readers, the main character, Kendra, came across to me as extremely melodramatic. Every mundane action comes across over dramatized and emotional. Perhaps she felt that way to me because the novel I read before this one was lacking any emotional content and all the emotion in this one came across stronger because of it. I don't know. It just felt overdone at times, not all the time. Also the 16th century parts moved a bit slow for me. The prologue gives away what Nanju does at the beginning so dragging it out for so many chapters seemed unnecessary.  Get rid of the prologue and it might work better to create the suspense I think the novel is aiming for. There was something redundant, especially in the middle of the novel, about the 16th century parts that made me want things to move along faster. I found myself thinking, yeah, yeah, I know this let's get on to the good part, but I am an impatient reader.Even if the above doesn't sound like it, I do recommend giving this book a try when it is released. It's well written and the plot is tight. The author did her research on Korea so if you find the Asian culture interesting like I do, you will enjoy these parts of the book. If you enjoy ghost stories then this is one you should at least get the free sample of and give a try and buy if the beginning intrigues you.
$review_summary.: Great read if you love asian culture and ghosts

$REVIEW.: Nathan Peake is a dashing British naval officer who's called on for a secret mission that on the surface appears to be a mere bit of smuggling, but he turns out to be a pawn in a plot to destabilize the economy of France, now that it's under a potentially unfriendly new government.  However...there's all the turmoil of the Revolution and the Reign of Terror going on...At a glance, the title might have one thinking this is a horror novel, and the cover painting alone would hint that this is one of the countless Patrick O'Brian ripoffs that overpopulated bookshelves for a while (and would have the reading public believing that the Napoleonic wars were primarily naval).  However, this carves out its own niche and balances seagoing action with land-based intrigue.Some of the naval terminology went over my head, but having lately read a few books about the French Revolution and its aftermath, I could see that Hunter did his research.  The book is full of real-life characters, including Robespierre, Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, and even a brief appearance by Marie Grosholtz, aka Madame Tussaud.  And there's lots of action, including naval battles, races through the streets of Paris, and Hunter even throws in a Satanic chapel in the catacombs under Les Invalides.My biggest problem is that the narrative sometimes got choppy, with Peake in the middle of Paris in one scene and suddenly at sea in the British Channel in the next, with little explanation as to what happened in between.  And the setup for a sequel is a bit too obvious; I would have preferred a more self-contained story.Still, it's an enjoyable read, a decent example of the historical swashbuckler, with a few flaws, but forgivable ones.  It doesn't set out to be great art, but is a decent example of good craftsmanship.

$REVIEW.: Lauren Dane's books are dangerous. With the title in mind, imagine tantalisingly sweet, richly decadent, sinfully delicious, and completely addictive. Voila! You have Lauren Dane's novella, Cake .The heroine, Wren, was wonderful. She was the brilliant combination of intelligent, sassy, beautiful, and confident. She oozed sensuality and strength. For Grigor, she was a seductive yet innocent woman, content in her own space, needing nothing from him, except his love. In her he found light.Grigor's description will have you swooning. Sexy, sexy man. With an accent. Body piercings. An extremely talented artist with large, talented, cough, hands. Need I say more? Yes, you will love him. His flaw? He feared vulnerability.There is a no-fuss attitude to Wren that was both refreshing and beguiling. Grigori didn't stand a chance. But, would he accept the gauntlet thrown him?Cake was paced fabulously, and kept me captivated from start to finish. Do not start this book if you have chores to do. Written in third person, your taste buds will be tickled and your mind indulged, as you enjoy both points of view throughout. Supporting characters added just the right amount of frosting. You need extravagant sizzle? Cake is for you.A quick, schmexy and completely enjoyable read. I love Lauren Dane's impressive work, and Cake is now another delight added to my favorites.Thank you NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: This book was a breath of fresh air and was a blast from the past. It brought me back to high school and back to when New Kids On The Block were actually popular... and yes I remember those days!!!There is nothing better than young love, and Layla Warren discovers that in High School. Although there are past family issues with Layla in regards to her mother she is moving on and looking forward to her senior year! When Trip Wilmington, the new kid, ends up sitting behind her in class things are definitely looking brighter for Layla.Layla and Trip fall into a friendship easily. They just fit together and even though Layla is developing feelings for Trip, she is sure he doesn't feel the same way. I loved their playfulness that they shared. None of their friends understood the type of relationship that they had. (In my opinion I really don't think at first they understood the depths of it) It starts with mindless flirting mostly from Trip which of course hooks Layla immediately! I remember what I felt like when a cute guy would flirt with me in High School.... I would just fall over myself. (kind of embarrassing!)Layla was so innocent but absolutely hilarious with her conversations with Trip and I found myself at times laughing at her quick wit!Layla had a group of friends that was considered her crowd. You learn to appreciate them all and their journey through their final year of high school. You experience parties, trips, fights, love, and much more as you follow along with them. You can't help but compare their times to your times in high school. They were such a close group and to have to see them say goodbye and go their separate ways was just heartbreaking. I remember crying after my graduation knowing I was leaving behind so many great friendships.The ending leaves you wanting so much more.... You finally get to know what was written in a note back at the beginning of a book.... WOW! Just blew me away..... I can't even begin to describe how refreshing and relaxing this book was.I think the song that came to mind while I was reading this story was One Direction's - What Makes You Beautiful!

$REVIEW.: Writing Active Setting Book 2 is a great continuation of Mary Buckham's Active Setting Book 1

Both books explain how to not only write the basic facts of your setting, but how to incorporate those facts so that you convey the mood and feel of your novel through the environment you create for your characters

I think it's important for every author to have at least a basic understanding of this concept


Mary Buckham gives great examples from popular authors so that it's easy to see how professional authors accomplish active setting

This is such a helpful book for anyone seriously pursuing a writing career.

$REVIEW.: As I write this review, there are only 16 other reviews so it is easy to read them all.  I was anxious to read a well argued rebuttal to Bugliosi's challenging thesis, but there are none.There are a few negative "reviews" that are worthless as they provide no information about Bugliosi's argument.  I still look forward to an informed critical review of this book.The common theme of the negative reviews is essentially this: if Bush is guilty of murder, then all American presidents who sent soldiers into combat are guilty of murder.  Bush only did what presidents normally do, so why the hysterical leftist ranting by a traitorous Bush-hater?It is odd to read comments like that, as Bugliosi very consciously argues that Bush's behavior is unique.  It is, argues Bugliosi, different than the behavior of any other president.Specifically, Bugliosi charges that Bush:a. Wanted to invade Iraq for reasons that are not altogether clear.b. When 9/11 happened Bush saw an opportunity to accomplish the invasion by conflating the attacks that day with Iraq.c. This conflation was and is a lie.  Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11.d. Bush also invented a bogus scare story about Iraq and its imminent threat to our national security.  Bugliosi includes numerous, and already well-known examples where Bush's intelligence unambiguously pointed away from Iraq posing an imminent threat, while Bush and his subordinates pointedly ignored the evidence in favor of ginning up an excuse to do what they wanted to do anyway.e. It is the act of lying that, for Bugliosi, constitutes overt acts resulting in the criminal deaths of four thousand (and counting) American soldiers.In short, the argument that Bugliosi is wrong because the reasons he adduces for charging Bush with murder could be used to charge any president with murder are factually incorrect.It makes me wonder if his critics here have actually read the book?  I suspect not.  It might be too long and have too few pictures for them anyway.It seems to me that the way to criticize this book is to dispute his version of the facts (e.g. make the case that Bush did not lie, but was innocently wrong) or his version of the law (e.g. even if Bush did lie, his actions do not legally constitute murder).As I say, I await the critic who can adequately take Bugliosi on.  I would love to see the debate.But to dismiss his thesis out of hand on spurious grounds does a disservice - not to Bugliosi, who is already rich and famous - but to ourselves.Bush supporter or not, does it not strike you as odd in the slightest that the clearly stated reasons for invading now have nothing at all to do with the justification for the invasion and the continuing occupation?Does anyone want to know how we came to be in Iraq, at such an enormous cost of life and treasure?Bugliosi's thesis is unique and challenging.  It should open an important debate rather than more hand-waving from the propagandized Limbaugh-level right.

$REVIEW.: I don't know that I've read any short story collection (if that's what you could call this) that I've loved as much as Bonded. I was completely taken aback by the strings connecting the three stories, which is what made them so special. They all take place within the same realm and build off of one another, bringing you in a full circle that is so satisfying and heart-breaking.While wonderful stories on their own, Cinders, Thirds, and Scales are a near perfect collection. The themes of bonding and self-sacrificing love run throughout and make the reading experience all the better for it. I honestly don't know if I can come up with words that work well enough to explain how perfectly done this book is.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoy a good 'future history' novel. I really enjoy a good 'WW III' novel. I really enjoy a good 'apocalytic' novel. I really thought I would like this novel, but I didn't.The problem is that this 'book' is far less of a novel than simply a right-winger's nocturnal emission. If that's who you are (and it's OK if you are) you'll LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book - it has everything: Nukes fly (on other peoples' soil, of course); communists die; the EU croaks; Israel really socks it to its neighbors; Obama gets impeached not once, but twice; Republicans win a super-majority in the House and Senate; and in the end, everything will be OK because we get a real Conservative into the White House....For everyone else, what could have been a good romp of a read is marred by one-sided political diatribe, and the shallow and superficial understanding of the world that is the definition of the Conservative world view. Everyone who's not a Republican is bland and two-dimensional, self-centered or just plain evil. The Republicans have their character flaws, but they're forgivable because they just plain love America, gosh darn it.Adding insult to partisanship, there isn't the slightest indication that the story was ever proof-read, edited, or even run through a spell-checker. The author probably loves America, but he seems to have a grudge against the English language.If Sarah Palin reads this book, she'll probably make this author her Secretary of State.

$REVIEW.: On September 11, 2001, the world as we knew it changed. America was thrown into a tailspin of emotion as we tried to sort out the events that had occurred. It is only natural, then, for citizens to want to find out what happened on that day, why it happened, and what can be done to prevent it from happening again.However, there are always those in a society for whom the truth is not enough. And when some questions, such as "why", can't be answered to their satisfaction, they begin to look for alternate theories to fit their preconcieved notions of reality. 9/11 featured previously unheard-of events, hijackings in which the safety of the passengers or hijackers was a non-issue, civilian planes being used as missiles into buildings, and the very centers of our economic and defense systems being hit. It could not compare to any previous event, and it caused emotional trauma to many Americans, some more so than others. Investigations were launched, and we sat glued to our televisions as reports unfoled in the aftermath of the event, hoping to learn the truth. But though the truth may be learned, it is not always satisfying; this is where conspiracy theories come in.Over the seven and a half years since 9/11, many conspiracy theories have developed, and with the help of the internet, have spread across the world. In "Debunking 9/11 Myths", the authors of Popular Mechanics set out to explain why the theories are wrong. They tackle four areas of myth: the planes, the collapse of the World Trade Center, the attack on the Pentagon, and United 93. Among the issues explained are the prevalence of cell phone calls from the doomed flights; the impact craters left at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, PA; why the WTC towers collapsed (including the collapse of WTC7 several hours later, despite its not being hit by a plane); and the "appearance" of a controlled demolition at the site. To help answer these qustions, the editors of the magazine consulted over 300 experts in everything from demolitions to aeronautics. Some of them, especially those whose field of expertise is in defense, work for the government, but others are independent contractors and academics. And their work is solid.As one of millions of Americans who watched the tragic events of 9/11 unfold on live television, I've wondered what went wrong and have searched for an explanation of events. How could this have happened on US soil? The truth isn't always emotionally satisfying, but this book helps to solidify it.

$review_text.: Wowee!  The Paladin is a ride.  Not only is it a humorous and fun read but it's very original.  This book follows the mission of one Maggie Black, paladin extrodinare, on her quest to stop a devoted husband from lifiting a curse put on his wife that has kept her entrapped for hundreds of years.  Oh - did I mention the wife is a supernatural demon who has the power to destroy the world?  Or that her husband uses witches and shape-shifters to stop Maggie?  And how about the fact that Maggie works for an angel named Larry and owns a sword that's really a demon?  And the fun just starts there.  Wait until you meet the hypocritical town preacher or Silas Cole, the once-thought murderer who is actually the worlds savior?The Paladin is pure entertainment.  Nothing really deep.  My only critiques would be the cover art (not a good representation of the book) and the characters are slightly shallow (but I was so excited to read the next page that it didn't bother me one bit).  Read this book for the pure joy of reading or for a laugh.  It's easily picked up, put down, and picked up again.  If you like fantasy set in the real world, stories featuring a strong female lead, characters that span the range of human personality, even action set to an intriguing background, try The Paladin.

$review_text.: Show Stoppah by Thomas Slater is hard to put down. In the beginning we are introduced to Kimpa and Isis who live in a homeless shelter. Both have been hurt, physically and emotionally, by the men in their lives and they are determined to bring justice to those that hurt them. Kimpa and Isis are determined to get their voices heard and stories told by any means necessary.Show Stoppah sheds a different light on abuse and Slater does a good job at describing what a person goes through while being abused.  Because of the vivid language used, the reader is completely engrossed into hearing Kimpa and Isis' stories. We are able to feel their pain and want them to overcome and claim victory. This book is most definitely a `show stoppah' and I look forward to reading more work by Thomas Slater.This book was provided by the author for review purposes.

$review_text.: Swirling amidst classical music, classic rock, medieval romance, history, historic figures and beautiful clothes is a story of Alice, a girl who meets her first love Quinn. She later marries Dr. Donovan Trist, the son of a wealthy Senator and his family.The story really revolves around Alice reworking her life to 'unbreak' her heart. After leading a tumultuous life with numerous heartbreaking episodes, it becomes Alice's challenge to change herself and the situations of her past life to let love shine through as it had in her teenage years. She is in a simulacrum of Heaven, and is accompanied by many very famous and infamous historical figures who all tender advice on each attempt at change. Most of the scenes are heartwarming, and you will love Alice. She is fantastic, especially after she develops a stiffer backbone. Her development through the story was stellar.The only downside with the book is that we don't get really close to any other characters except for Alice. We know things about the other characters because Alice thinks and talks about them, but, other than Quinn, the Proprietress and Dennis, the other do not do very much. They rarely speak. I think it would have added a lot of depth and texture to the story to know more about Harry, Dennis, Quinn, Donovan and Quinn's parents. Not a huge backstory, just some particular personal details so they are less like window dressing. I took 1 star off for single character, in-depth characterization.It's funny though, as the narrator is Alice, and everything is from her POV, you could actually read this book and not notice the lack of 3D people running around as it is Alice's quest after all.In the story you will be faced with a logic problem based on emotions. I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but just read the book. You will also find first love, triumph, violence, tragedy, happiness, romance, friendship, travel, education, success and life lessons.Bottom Line: Awesome Book! Working for love, what a concept. Some interesting life lessons from the author make it a book you can think about long after reading the last page. Heartwarming tale...

$REVIEW.: I LOVE emotional reads that get under your skin and don't let go.  Seeing people who have gone through horrible things and made it through to find happiness are my kind of inspirational read.  Inez Kelly is one of those writers who makes their readers a part of these emotional journeys and Sweet as Sin delivers in the intensity of that emotional journey.The journey to true happiness is incredibly rocky for these two.  John came from a childhood of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his preacher father and still carries the scars today inside and out.  Through his YA and fantasy writings he uses his characters as a form of therapy.  Showing excerpts of these stories is an unique and intriguing way to show us his inner emotions since it's hard for him to express things out loud.  Unfortunately his writings aren't enough as he still has nightmares and rage and alcohol issues.  When he goes through these episodes he's a different man, a very unlikable one.  He lashes out and says hurtful things and it's hard reading these scenes.  Seeing his daily struggles made me ache for him even as I was despising his actions.  He's a good man deep down and deserves to find a woman who can help him heal.  I love wounded heroes and John is definitely that.  He's also charming and super sexy.  Which is part of the reason why Livvy is drawn to him.Livvy is a very strong and independent woman and just what John needs.  She's not going to let him push her away no matter how hard he tries.  She'll stand by him as he struggles to put the past behind him.  She too had a rough childhood with a cheating father which adds to the rockiness of their relationship.  Both John and Livvy had to grow up before their time and it's this shared emotional past that makes their connection so intense and vital to each of them.The sexual interludes in this story are steamy and nicely spaced throughout the story.  Even when they hit a rocky patch the sex is still intense between them.  The ups and downs between them are realistic and made me feel like I was on that emotional roller coaster with them.  Everything happening between them drew me in and I was rooting for them every step of the way.This story was intense from the very first page and didn't let up until the very end.  These were two scarred souls destined to be together.  Livvy was an immensely likable character who was a pillar of strength for John and is the epitome of what a heroine should be.  John was damaged to his very core and after having countless women knew that Livvy was the one worth changing his ways for.  He knew he needed more in-depth help and found it because of Livvy's love and support.  It takes a strong man to admit that and it made me love him even more than I did at the start of the story.  Inez Kelly has created a story with a memorable couple that pulls at your heartstrings and stays with you long after the final page is turned.  Those looking for a story full of emotional ups and downs need look no further than Sweet as Sin.  Just make sure to have a tissue or two nearby.

$review_text.: I loved the first two books in this trilogy and the same is true for the last in this trilogy!  In the first two books my heart couldn't help but break a little for Whitney.  She always seemed like the odd girl out.  Having sisters of my own and knowing what it's like to be left out made this very real for me.Whitney proved to be just as head strong and verbally creative as her sisters. This book had me laughing out loud just like the first two. This series will definitely be going in my favorites and one that I'll be reading again and again!!!!

$REVIEW.: I will begin by saying that I really liked the first book, The Good Fight. I truly felt that it explored the relationship between a white man and a Native American man in a way that did justice to both cultures.With that said, I was very disappointed with The Fight Within for many different reasons. I felt that the way it began by jumping the reader immediately into grief and then just as suddenly moving along was extremely unrealistic. The fact that when we met Bryce in book one he had just graduated from college and was still a shy, nerdy kid who hadn't grown up a lot yet. To then see him just three years laters as this mature man with ageless wisdom was just not something I could wrap my mind around. Hence, I couldn't relate to Bryce's character in any way shape or form.Paytah could have been an incredible character except, once again, the fantasy land of meeting him and he's a strong opponent to the white man and then two weeks later he's completely embraced his white lover and is saying "I Love You." Didn't hit true for me.I had a problem with the fact that in some ways this book mirrored book one almost exactly. Once again, the white man has come onto the reservation and "saved it". It was tried to be played off by Bryce (and the author) as modesty but that didn't ring true for me either.There was more occurring in the story than what i've addressed here, but these are the main points as to why I was unable to relate to the characters and thus, the story.On a side note this really saddens me. The last few new releases by Andrew Grey I have jumped at as i've been a fan for quite some time. Unfortunately I have been equally disappointed by each of them. It makes me wonder whether the speed with which books are being released has somehow impinged on Mr. Grey's story quality?

$review_text.: I'm a high school teacher, so I'm very familiar with what happens in high school on a daily basis.  The author has been able to capture and describe e the feeling of being in high school extremely well.  While reading I could believe that I was in just about any typical high school in the country.I enjoy reading YA fictions, partially because I'm always looking for something my students will enjoy, and partially because I enjoy them myself, and this book was no exception. It is extremely well written, and it captures the essence and the tumult a typical high school student experiences as things in their world change and shift, not always to their liking.The characters are very well developed and believable.  The storyline flows flawlessly and grabs your attention from the first page.  There is lots of action, and a nice blend of emotional twists and turns, and best of all, you could allow a Middle Grade student to read it, and not worry that the content is inappropriate.You don't have to be a fan of the YA genre to enjoy a well written book, and this is a well written book.  I highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: This is a good primer on the Affordable Care Act.  It goes into sufficient detail to leave the reader with a basic understanding of the law.  The book emphasizes the ACA goes well beyond its headline attracting features like the individual and employer mandate and includes many provisions that will fundamentally change the health care industry.  One of the Act's main objectives the author notes is to tame rising health care costs for all Americans, which, since the 1970's, has outpaced the growth of the economy. The author also points out that the Act is structured to provide incentives and penalties, particularly for hospitals, intended not only to lower costs, but to improve the quality of health care as well.  As one of those intimately involved in passage of the ACA, the author is sometimes defensive about the events surrounding passage, but overall does a very good job of explaining - in neutral terms - the details of the law and how they are intended to effect health care in the United States. For those wishing to learn about the specifics of the law beyond partisan interpretation, this book will fill the bill.

$review_text.: Now we go back to the beginning, after the events of "The Sword of Shannara."  It's been a little over a year since Shea Ohmsford returned home, to the Shady Vale, after battling, and defeating, the Dark Lord, Brona.  In spite of his victory, Shea is in shock, not believing his feat, fantasizing about what might have happened to him on his quest, and his fantasies are all bad.  What if he had been defeated?  What would have happened to him.  Shea would have nightmares about this, not permitting him to enjoy life back in the Vale.Flick decides to visit an old woodswoman who specializes in portions, a recluse who lives in the middle of the woods by herself.  Flick obtains the potion, but then is told by the woodswoman, Audrana Coos, that Shea will soon go on another quest, and warns Flick not to interfere.  Soon after, Flick sneaks the potion to Shea, and then he is cured of his fears and depression.Soon, an old friend and professional thief, Panamon Creel, shows up, requesting Shea to accompany him on a quest, and to bring his elfstones.  Flick is suspicious of him, knowing of his old ways.  Panamon Creel reveals that he is on a quest to steal something...and return it to its rightful owners.  Keltset, the Rock Troll, in the original story, saved the lives of Shea and Flick as they were confronted by Gnomes on the quest to destroy the Dark Lord.  Later, Keltset was tried by his own people for being a traitor and put to death, by being pushed off a cliff.  Before he was pushed, he displayed his medal, the Black Irix, the highest honor to be given to his own people, and as he fell, the medal went with him.The material the medal itself is composed are extremely valuable, and it has been revealed that it has been salvaged by another thief, Kestra Chule, who intends to sell it for his own purposes.  Panamon Creel wants to steal it back from Kestra Chule, a former acquaintance, and return it to Kelset's family.Shea and Panamon then set out to Kestra Chule's fortress to retreive the medal.  Flick then decides to set out and join them, and the three of them journey to the heavily armed fortress.  Flick and Shea wonder how they are going to sneak in, but Panamon reveals that he was invited there, and Kestra plans to have a banquet for them.Here I will stop, but things do happen, there are surprises,  and the end leaves room for a sequel.It's an enjoyable short story, with the fact that one can finally return to the time of the first Shannara novel, reuniting with Shea, his brother Flick, and Panamon, and the elfstones are used.  I don't want to go any further and spoil it for you, so I'll end it with the recommendation that if you are a fan of Terry Brooks, go ahead and spend a dollar on this Kindle Single.  It's worth it, and you'll enjoy the story.

$review_text.: I got up in the middle of the night to make sure my pre-order of "Night's Awakening" downloaded to my Kindle

 I think I squealed just a bit once I saw it officially

 =)I even decided to stay up just a little bit to read it, although I was exhausted from the day before

 I was determined to read Guy's story.Elena is off exploring with her boss, Sloan, who wants to go caving on private land


 Elena knows something is up with her boss because supposedly Sloan has never been in the caves they're exploring, but for some reason she's getting around really easily.Before she knows it, Elena finds herself alone in the cave and injured...until three men come to her rescue...or actually come to find out why she is on their land.The three men who come upon Elena are determined to find out why Elena is in their caves and why her boss felt the need to go searching without permission
 Now they have to interrogate her to find out the truth, but also heal her in the mean time since she's injured.Guy one of the guys who helped Elena is feeling very attracted to her and he should not be

 He is determined to know why she was in the caves and of course try to prove her innocence.My thoughts on "Night's Awakening" was that it captured my attention just like the first one did
 Let's just say, hubby was getting annoyed with me at dinner when we went out to eat and I would not put down my Kindle to eat

 I kept telling him just one more minute I will be finished
 =)I love Guy in this book

I thought Hal stole my heart, but for some reason Guy has become a favorite of mine


 I clicked with him and actually felt sorry when he asked Elena a certain question towards the end of the book
I was about to go through the book and slap Elena silly if she didn't give him a better answer.Elena plays a major role in this book and iI loved the cliff-hanger at the end

 Now I really want to know what is going on with the dragons and who is behind everything
 (won't tell...because I will give it away to any one who wants to read this novella)I loved the chemistry between Guy and Elena...and let's just say they have some steamy scenes together

 (One scene involving water)  =)I'm so glad Donna wrote these books because I love dragon shifters and I can not get enough of the men she wrote in these books

 I really hope I get to read some more of Constantine in the next book (I really want to know more about him)
 Oh and Tristan...can we finally find out who he is and why he is the way he is


 I'm REALLY interested in him.If you love dragon shifters, you'll definitely want to check out the Dark Kings
 =)  The third book releases next month and this gal has already pre-ordered it
 Have you?I recommend this book to paranormal romance readers, dragon shifter lovers, and Donna Grant fans (or readers who have always wanted to read Donna Grant's book)
 You definitely need to read these e-novellas


 You won't regret it one bit.

There are also recipes for kids&#8217; snacks and low cal snacks.The one thing I think that could help the book would be including pictures. But overall, really great ideas for healthy snacks even if you aren&#8217;t on the Paleo Diet.

$REVIEW.: It is an ARMY MANUAL


That should tell you right there, for the average reader, this isn't going to be fun
It starts at page 1 and if you don't follow the instructions from page 1 you CANNOT get to page 40
I had to keep asking myself how to make a certain chemical substance  and then thought - can I just go to the hardware store?There are easier books for camping
I was actually looking for survival tips and where it said incendiaries I figured - fire to cook with if the power went out
NO
That is not what this book is about.Its written in small old manual typewriter font from the 1970s and even though it goes from point a to point b to point c to point d, there are NO side notes for those of us that might have a question about point c.I gave up on page 12 and instead went and got an old boyscout book on how to build shelter in the rain and the book was circa 1970


It had pictures.You've got to be fully committed to the US Army to appreciate this manual.Way out of my league.

$review_text.: 4.5 Stars....It's the wee hours of the morning and for some odd reason I decide to put my thoughts down about this book before I sleep on it


Why, because THE FIRST REAL THING rocks and I did not want to lose this euphoric feeling that  I have with something as mundane as sleep, before I put my thoughts down.Once again it was no hardship to drop everything to read this book when it hit my inbox and read it in one go I did

Literally from the first page I was drawn  into the story, into the blog that Cameron used as his medium to tell this story through


Cameron is a man for hire - he's been at if for a while, he knows his job and he is more than anything else professional about it.One might think it odd that a member of the sex trade decides to blog about his time in the business, giving advice and literally telling his readers about the pitfalls and the sometimes less than graceful adventures of his life


Cameron starts the blog because he has met someone and not just anyone - This one feels real.It starts when out on a call in a swanky joint and with all the signs in place for "a go" he moves in and make the link up with his client

The night goes well, who am I kidding the night rocked and he places his card on the night table and leaves the hotel room with his pay in the envelope he pick up off the bar earlier


Feeling really good about the past few hours he is surprise at the call he picks up on his phone from the man he is actually suppose to be meeting.Surprise and mistakes do not come often to Cameron these days, but he is knocked off balance because not only has he just slept with a stranger - but he has left his card on this unknowns man bedside table - And so the story begins.This lucky man happens to be out of town business man Trevor Barclay , easy on the eyes , manners of a gentleman and exploring a side of his sexuality that he has not had the chance to explore for years

Really lucky for him he meets a wonderful man in the bar and the night was great.How could he resist  following up on his next visit and his next visit after that.Cameron is the one now with the secrets and eventual lies


With wanting to see how far this first real thing will go, he tries to juggle first blush with life, but life has a way of folding in when you least expect it to and Cameron has his fingers literally in too many pies and too many issues to come out without some loses.Where do I begin with describing how much I enjoyed this book, from the moment I read the blurb I knew Ms Grant was aiming for something special and for me she achieved it


I have read the whole "pretty woman " scenario various times and while the blurb might sound like this book goes that route it doesn't.What I likeThe plot -  I rarely read a plot that I am totally pleased with what an author brings to it enough to mention it
But the little edges and the spin on the norm that Ms Grant ties into this plot made a difference and made me really liked it.The characters - I could not like the two main protags more if I tried

Cameron is just great


A boy who had to grow up and learn things the hard way, but ultimately knows the value of true friends and looking after number one.Trevor is just so fresh, so naive in certain ways - but I liked his openness, the fact that he took things at face value and  just wanted happiness.The minimum predictability - I love a book where I am just able to connect with the cast and see where they are either going or coming from and most of that is achieved by minimizing the predictables
There are a few in this but not enough to take away from how great the overall book was.Blog style - The story is told from Cameron's POV and as such I got a very professional person who knows that although he is in the business of selling his best asset, he is also objective enough to tell us the reader about the ups and downs of his life


Probably because I am a blogger I can relate to the fact that he uses a pseudo name in his business and on his blog and also because blogs are more or less faceless entities, he can also tell it as it really is without really anyone second guessing him


 Loved that.Pace - With every book I read by this author her pacing gets better and better

I saw Cameron and Trevor meet, connect and found the time to know each other and not at a break neck speed
I also saw some of the minor subplot move much faster but only because that was where that plotline took it.A story - The business of pimps and their wares is not the easiest to read without actually hating a good majority of the cast,  I thought the authors choice of choosing high-end clientele and setting made a huge difference to my enjoyment

No tardy little alley or back of a  car for these guys..
Cameron made sure I saw his world the plush-ness and the seedy side of the business as well


This was naturally Cameron's story and  while I could say I needed more of Trevor's history - I wont, because Trevor gave it to me through Cameron.Page time - I am a moaner about page time to develop characters and expand on issues and situations, but at 125 pages I thought Ms Grant packed a whole lot of Cameron's life along with enough about Trevor's and their developing relationship to satisfy me - any longer and it would have just gone flat.NigglesI thought how Trevor found out about Cameron was a little stilted and only one of the few predictable moment in the book.


 While I knew Trevor would eventually find out about Cameron's secret life - it just felt too like "here it comes - I was expecting that".Bottom line..I think I have said enough about how much I like this book, right to the last page I had a great time reading this and was pleased that I was left on a most satisfied high..


Definitely a recommended read.

$review_text.: What a fun and thrilling story! It had been a while since I'd read a YA book and I was looking for something in a genre I hadn't read before when I found Seaweed. I thought everything about this book was delightful. The pace was quick, there was a lot of action and undersea adventure. I thought the author did a great job of contrasting Dori's typical teen homelife with the fantasy in the book. The ending is not a cliffhanger (yay!) but does leave plenty of room for a sequel, for which I'll be first in line. :)I would recommend Seaweed to anyone who enjoys YA paranormal/fantasy romance.

$REVIEW.: Just finished this book. It is an important book. It should be read by all who have read The Harbinger. It seems that too many of us read an best selling book or watch the video version and come to conclusions that are unwise. David James goes through The Harbinger and points out numerous flaws in interpretation of Scripture. The main point I am in agreement with is that there are no valid parallels between Israel and the United States. Israel is a nation founded by God. This fact is repeated stressed in the prophets of that nation. It is reinforced by Jesus Himself, Paul and others. Israel is also real estate, given to Israel by God. The United  States was founded by men of the Enlightenment. The real estate of the United States was simply taken for others.

$review_text.: Welcome to the happiest place to die... the first time around. When the rich and powerful seek to gain control of the world they decide they only need a small percentage of it. Coming together in a plan to release a plague that would wipe out the majority of society, their goal was achieved at an unprecedented success rate. The people died euphorically, swarming the streets to happily partake in celebratory orgies and any and everything they could indulge in under the influence of the zombie virus.Things quickly turn from weird to gory as the lustful sick beginning devouring one another until suddenly, they all die. For a short period. The zombies rise and slowly try to kill of the living who are trying to survive in a world not only plagued with the undead, but also the violent, the prejudice, and the cultists taking advantage if the new free world.There's plenty of zombie gore in Euphoria-Z and a very unique take on the zombie virus. The set up is perfect for getting everyone out in the open and exposed for the gruesome end of humanity. People are happy, they're walking by with smiles on their faces and asking their friends to come out and play and very few were hesitant to join the parties in the beginning.The story line follows several survivors, there's no one main character. The reader is given the stories of all the survivors and what they're trying to do to keep things going. With no laws to restrict criminal activity it seems all the crazies and prejudice citizens have come out in full force to take advantage of the weak instead of putting differences aside and helping rebuild. A few details are missing that would help chapters flow more smoothly but we get a good sense of what's going on and what each character feels toward the situation.Euphoria Z is a good apocalyptic, zombie book with plenty of fighting, gore, and rescues. It creates a unique and interesting take on the zombie virus and what would most likely happen in the event of the end of the world.

$review_text.: I have just finished reading this book and when I first started, I was not sure I wanted to continue but it held my interest and the more I read, the more I liked the story.  What was bothering is the fact that it needs more proof reading and error corrections.  Sorry, they just stand out and would have easily been corrected by taking the time to proof read or have it edited.It is a book I would recommend but I also caution you about the errors. Maybe it does not bother some people but as a writer and retired secretary, it bothers me.Congratulations to the author for an inside look at profilers and how they can help with murder investigations.  As I have stated, the story line is interesting and intriguing, character descriptions are good and surely a surprise ending for some.  As a long time fan of Agatha Christie, I had already named the killer but it was an entertaining read.Keep up the good work!!The Ghost of Thorn Hill

$review_text.: The life of a woman-child who could have been any one of us is exactly what Becoming Abigail was. It was eloquent and vivid in its delivery, but at the same time it was at times too disturbing for words too. I found it hard to digest the fact that a girl who had the misfortune of never meeting her mother had to further endure hardships that weren't of her own doing, but all stories aren't romantic cake-walks. In a search for love, appreciation and acceptance Abigail internalizes the pain of the void that seeking leaves by marking herself and as she marked the pain seemingly lessened and the understanding took root. I highly recommend this book which is more a novella than a novel. This kind of story strays far from the cookie cutter norm and I'll probably remember the scenes for the rest of my life. They say when a book affects you like that, the author has done his or her job. Forced to live in the shadow of her mother Abigail tried to mutilate her mother's memory and those around her forcing her to become a woman. This is a story that will never go quietly.

$REVIEW.: Before I get into the review of the actually story, I have to say that the cover of this book is absolutely GORGEOUS! I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it and I just simply adored it. I just knew that I had to read it once I saw it.Okay that was a long synopsis but it does grab you doesn't it? This book was adorable, and I absolutely loved it. I had to stop in the middle of this for a few hours to read another book for a blog tour and it just killed me. I was itching to put my finger on the home button of my Kindle just so I could click Entangled and read it again. The wait was terrible but worth it."I wanna know Maddy Walker. The real one. The one who stole my heart."Maddy Walker is a girl who was raised by her best friend's family. Her mom died in a car crash and her Dad neglected her because of her grief. Maddy's story is definitely a sad and hard one and it makes us long her as a character even more. We end up feeling more for her and getting to know her more. I absolutely loved Maddy. She's pretty much the coolest friend that anyone could want. She's nice, cool, funny, and has a killer voice.Noah is probably one of the coolest guys out there. He has the perfect face/body (Yum!). He has the greatest taste in movies and music, and he's pretty nice for the most part. He also used to be a player, but that's the only negative that I can think of at the time...What? Did you say something? Sorry, I was a bit distracted by that hot guy over there named Noah."The more time I spend with you, the more my mind is cluttered. I'm not used to doing nice things for anyone but all I want to do is make you happy."Noah also has had a tough life. His parents got a divorce because his dad didn't want kids, and the divorce drove his mom to become an alcoholic. Then a tragedy hits that hits him with guilt and pain and forces him to move out to Colorado where he finally meets Maddy Walker."And just so you know," he whispers in my ear, "our first kiss will be an unforgettably, toe-curling, heart-stopping, leave-you-breathless kind of kiss. I promise."The romance in this book was great. It took my breath away at some parts but at the same time it didn't seem far from achievable. This book could definitely give some tips to guys on how to act around their girlfriends. So all you guys...PICK UP THIS BOOK! All you girls should as well!  Honestly, I really enjoyed reading about all the chemistry that was between these two and it was even better that they weren't 17 or 18 year old teens. Maddy and Noah were in their mid-20s, which definitely changes things up a bit. Noah was so sweet in this book...They would be cute babies too! My favorite part in this book would have to be around 70% of the book in which they go to New York. I won't say too much because I don't want to give a lot away but I was so happy at that moment. I am a born and raised New Yorker and I am proud to be. I absolutely love it there since it's such a beautiful, diverse place. This should definitely be a place where everyone should travel to.If I had to find one flaw in this book it would be the length, and honestly that isn't even a flaw. I was sad when it ended but at the same time happy. This book might not even be that long. It could have been a 300 page book for all I know but for some reason it just seemed really long to me, but I definitely enjoyed it.This is a definite must read for everyone. Though this book is meant for people 17 and up due to some language and sexual content. I enjoyed this book none the less.*An ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: One of the things a GPS can't tell you are things such as the topography of an area nor things like the featured trails in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.  This one has just that kind of information, plus so much more.  It actually has a sidebar with a Trail Chart that gives the trail name, location, mileage, blaze, and rating.I have a lot of old worn, well-loved paper maps, but do like the composition of this one.  It's waterproof and tear-resistant and obviously will hold up for a long time.  It would be perfect to take along if you are going camping or hiking.  The features, taken from the National Geographic site are listed below.FEATURES:&#9658;  Waterproof and tear-resistant&#9658;  Clearly marked trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and more&#9658;  Detailed topography and clearly defined, color-coded boundaries of state parks, national recreation areas, wilderness areas, marine sanctuaries and wildlife refuges - Hundreds of points-of-interest, including scenic viewpoints, campgrounds, boat launches and canoe carry downs, swimming areas, fishing access points, and more&#9658;  UTM and Latitude/Longitude grid, as well as selected waypoints and a scale bar for easy and accurate navigation&#9658;  Detailed road network&#9658;  Useful travel information on parks and key trails&#9658;  Important safety information and tips&#9658;  Information about local organizations and land management agenciesWe used to have a nice collection of maps and still have some, but I really like the two recreational ones I have from National Geographic.  It like going back into the past, but with improvements that technology has to offer like the QR code for the Canoe & Kayak Liveries and other areas.
$SUMMARY.: This is an excellent topographical map of the Delaware Water Gap that includes QR codes ...

$review_text.: Out of AvP, Predator, and Aliens omnibus volume 1, AvP is probably the best with Predator a close second. Predator is a lot more consistent than Aliens #1, which is a good book, but has some stupid lazy editing problems.Concrete Jungle 4/5Concrete Jungle is pretty much Predator 2 before Predator 2 went to theatres. It's got a lot of things in it that were used in the movie, though it takes place in New York. Mark Verheiden's whitty writing moves the story along well, and the characters like Det. Schaefer, Rasche, and General Phillips are all interesting and memorable, especially Rasche(sp?) who is basically the designated comic relief. Concrete Jungle is a great Predator comic, very true to the first film, though the ending gets a little too War of the Worlds in scale, and the way it ends is a little anti-climactic. The Predators just leave!Cold War 3/5Cold War is decent. It reduces the amount of time Schaefer's former partner Rasche has, which makes things a little less light hearted than they previously were. This story is more political, and it's about...the Cold War, what else? General Phillips makes a return and ends up being more of a villain than he was the first time, constantly using Schaefer by telling him he'll give him information about his brother Dutch (from the first movie). There is a brief reference to Big Game, which was released before this but appears in Volume 2. And a welcome addition is that of a female lead character, which is somewhat refreshing after the first story.Dark River 4/5Dark River is probably the best of the first three comics in the Schaefer trilogy, but it doesn't have Rasche at all! These are all written by Verheiden, and I'd like to know what he was thinking when he failed to include that character, who really made Cold War half way decent. Without him, it would've sucked. Dark River has a rather interesting plot. A man claiming to be one of the helicopter pilots at the end of the first film runs into Schaefer, who takes him to South America to search for Dutch. Unfortunately, the main characters run into a Predator which Schaefer thought he'd killed in Concrete Jungle, but turns out is still alive. It's going on a psycho killing rampage in the jungle and has already eliminated two military teams. General Phillips comes in towards the end again and we learn how much more of a jerk he really is. The story ends inconclusively, begging for another sequel.Rite of Passage 2/5Rite of Passage is rather pointless. I mean, it's a good idea, but it's just not really that satisfying. It's a total dialogue-less short featuring a tribal warrior hunting his prey, when a Predator lands and tries to hunt him. A short little fight ensues.The Pride at Nghasa 4/5This is actually a pretty good one. In the 1930's, a Predator stalks a British colony and starts killing the colonists and some of the workers in Africa. A famous hunter is called in to help figure out what is going on, but the Predator appears and kills everyone, except for the narrator who attempts to lead the Predator through the perilous jungle, where it is attacked numerous times by various animals until it becomes fatigued.The Bloody Sands of Time 4/5This comic is a little weird, but it's very good. The coloring is a little too flamboyant for something that takes place mostly during WWI, but whatever. The main character is also a little bizarre, but as it wraps up, the story falls into place very nicely and this ends up being one of the better entries in the volume.Blood Feud 1/5Wow, this has got to be one of the worst told stories in all of Predator comic history (other than DotS). It's just so boring and invites no interest in the plot at all. If it was told from the perspective of samurai fighting Predators, it would've been pretty cool. Instead, it's about a blind guy who has flashbacks about fighting Predators when he was apparently a samurai hundreds of years ago until the Predator attacks him and his girlfriend. It just sucks.Well, folks that's Predator Omnibus Vol. 1. It's definitely worth the buy. The "bad" stories on here don't outweigh the good like in AvP Vol. 2, and the good stories are definitely good. Concrete Jungle and Dark River give this book value, but Nghasa and Bloody Sands of Time are great reads as well. Recommended to Predator fans, and also casual comic readers. Enjoy.

$review_text.: Neuroscieintist/philosopher Joshua Greene has a big thesis in this book that requires some quite involved steps. His concern is to argue for a "metamorality" of the kind that should help groups with differing moralities resolve differences. Greene starts out envisioning two prototypical "tribes. One has a morality of self-reliance and "just desserts," where people are responsible for their lot in life and get rewarded in proportion to their efforts. The other has a more altruistic view of the world, where things are shared and shared alike, and everyone feels responsibility for everyone. The question: how do we decide which of these groups - or more likely, which elements of each group's worldview - should win the day in cases of moral conflict? (More specifically: when we face moral dilemmas where we could respond via self-interest and "just desserts" or with altruism and egalitarian "desserts", how should we determine which to go with?)Greene's answer is basically a form of utilitarianism that he calls "deep pragmatism." And to see why requires some explanation, which could be really dull but isn't, owing to Greene's gifts as a good and clear writer. He argues that humans have what is called a "dual process morality" that is divided between intuitive gut instincts (dominated by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and a more calculating thought process (owing more to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). When it comes to questions of "me versus us," the intuition side of things is pretty reliable, making us feel guilty for taking more than "our fair share," breaking rules that we expect everyone else to follow, etc. Understandable, because our intuitions of empathy and the like almost certainly evolved to stimulate cooperation within groups among otherwise selfish individuals (which confers an overall survival advantage).But our instincts also don't do very well with "we versus them" problems, because the same mechanisms that evolved to stimulate cooperation evolved to do so only WITHIN GROUPS (not between them). So, instincts often make us feel guilty at not helping others who are close to us, but the guilt lessens the farther removed the others-in-need are from us. Here, though, the thinking part of our brains can step in, and the thinking part of our brains (Greene's and others' research suggests) tend to be "utilitarian" - preferring whatever option leads to the greatest overall happiness less discriminately.The most interesting (and original) parts of this book are those where Greene reviews his own and others' research on "the trolley problem" - a problem philosophers have concocted to illustrate the dilemma between the sanctity of individual rights and the imperative of maximizing overall happiness. The trolley problem - and there are many variations of it - is of a train going down a track where five people are trapped. One can avert the trolley from killing the five only if one pushes a particular person onto the track (fortunately, you are standing at an area of the track where any obstruction to the trolley will avert it to a side-track, and pushing the man in front of the track will create such an obstruction.)Yes, it is highly contrived, but philosophers have argued for many years over the 'correct' answer to the problem: is it better to maximize happiness by saving five even if it means you have to intentionally sacrifice one, or is it better to let the five die if it means not intentionally killing one innocent person? Greene's study has led him to see the "dual process theory" of morality at work here. Those who have damage to the "instinctual" part of the brain unhesitatingly kill the one to save the five, and those with damage to the "calculating" part of the brain do the opposite. The rest of us struggle because the two parts of our brain are telling us different things.But, far from saying that there is no good answer, Greene suggests that in the trolley case, the best answer is the utilitarian one, because he suspects that our compunctions about intentionally killing to save five lives is a relic of the intuitional module of our brain (as evidenced partly by the fact that those who choose to let the five die can''t generally give any good explanation for why, save that it feels wrong). And Greene also suggests that while intuitional thinking doe serve us well at times - in "me versus us" questions - it is often ill-equipped to deal with "us versus them" problems (problems the world is facing more and more of).This is where I start to find Greene unconvincing. Without getting into too much detail, Greene strikes me as a utilitarian only to the degree that it gets him to the answers he wants to get... and there is a lot of inconsistent reasoning Greene gives about why utilitarianism is the best actual theory, rather than the one that gets him the answers he likes best. Mostly, this comes from a mixture of explaining both how utilitarianism doesn't conflict with some of our most deeply held intuitions (disrespect for individual rights when they conflict with the greatest good, etc), AND explaining that when it does, it is because in those cases, our intuitions are wrong. In other words, when utilitarianism validates our intuitions, that shows how good utilitarianism is, but when it conflicts with our intuitions, that shows that our intuitions - not utilitarianism - is flawed. Something seems very post hoc and inconsistent about this.To be sure, I don't have a much better answer. I think that, in the end, Greene's work actually REDUCES our confidence that there are best and worst answers to moral questions, but that is because unlike Greene, I see no reason to think we can resolve the "dual process" competing answers by somehow stepping above our human moral thinking and saying that there is an objective criteria that can determine which "process" is the right one and which, the wrong one. Might it just be that our impulses toward intuition and calculation conflict and that is that? Yes, Greene (and many of us) do think that it is quite important to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number, but if our instincts about what is morally right can be flawed in some cases, why can't our feeling that the greatest good is important be flawed too (and even though we reason to it, the value we put on the greatest good is still an instinct)? Not that Greene is wrong to put value on it, but I came away thinking that he wanted it both ways: intuitions can be trusted when they validate our calculations, but they're probably wrong when they don't.Anyway, aside from my general misgivings about Greene's conclusion (or at least his defense of it), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Greene's research on the neural basis of moral thinking is intriguing, original, and does a service to moral philosophy. And here, he writes a clear and well-written explanation of those and a larger moral case he draws from it. Those who are interested in this book should also readBraintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality, andThe Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion (Vintage).The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values

$REVIEW.: Unless you have read many WWII memoirs,  I would pass this one up until you have read 10 -15 other memoirs.  For a novice WWII history buff this book is 2 stars.  For the well read  I will give this book grudgingly 3 stars for the reasons stated below.To the well read WWII history buff this book does have some insight to the larger picture.  I do not know the quality of the 15 SS division, but it would seem the units this author was in was 2nd rate.  In that way this book does shed light on what were the 2nd rate units doing.  He was in service for almost exactly 2 years, and during that time saw very little combat.  So this book is very different concerning the intense combat one read about in books like Twilight of the Gods, In Deadly Combat, Kurt Meyers Panzer Grenadier.  It was interesting that this author did not write about building any camaraderie with fellow soldiers, as I have read in other books.  There was lots of heavy drinking that I have not read about in other memoirs, but wonder if the German, Belgium, Swedish authors I have read simply skip over that part to maintain a decorum - or was this a sign that the 15th SS was a 2nd rate unit.  Also, SS units usually were well supplied, but the units Mintauts was with had almost no food the last 6 months of the war - so again, is this because the German command gave more resources to units they thought were better fighting forces?Another point of uniqueness for this book is, the author in no way is pro-Nazi, or desperately wanting to kill communists.  Even though the Soviet Union was occupying his country, he was not going to die trying to stop them.  He never wanted to return to the front, and was glad when he was not picked and other  were. He stated himself, that he just wanted to survive, and not be captured by the Russians.  As a point of clarification concerning the SS and who served in the SS.  The Germans signed the Geneva Convention on war, which among other things stated that you cannot conscript men into your army from a country you have occupied.  So, what the Germans did was force the indigenous men into the SS because the SS was supposedly filled with only volunteers.  Of course not all were forced, but most were.  I actually personally know several.The author was definately a good soldier.  There were a few combat scenes and he did what need to be done. He was promoted, was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class, and at times led a squad of men.  He did all of this as a 18 - 19 year old - very impressive.Other points of interest from this book:-Mintaouts had many examples of the Latvian officers acting selfishly, and once the war ended and the Latvians were packed into POW camps, the soldiers did not want to have anything to do with the Latvian officers. ( The officers were trying to hoard more food for themselves among other things ! )- The author does list extensively what they had to eat on a near daily basis - and often how little they had to eat.  Wrote a lot about trading cigarettes for food etc.- Wounded three times, and wrote about some detail being in a hospital - draining blood out of his lung with a huge syringe. (shrapnel in one lung)-At one point they were equipped with Czech make machine pistols, and light machine guns (British Bren design)- The author mentioned several Latvians being executed for desertion and for looting.  This seemed by far a greater occurrence than what I have read in other WWII memoirs.- Partisans were active in Latvia, killing Germans.  I mention this because my parents are from Latvia and I never have heard this before.  Only how the Russians/Soviets are to be opposed.If you are looking for lots of action and struggle, don't get this book.  If you are new to this history don't get this book.  If you have read over 10-15 WWII AXIS memoirs, maybe get this book.  There is quite a bit subtle detail I have not read elsewhere.I feel bad not rating this book higher...................
$SUMMARY.: Maybe for the well read WWII history buff

Low expectations can make for a more enjoyable read plus this book is well written, has a nice clear concise tone and is personal, yet curiously interesting


For example, the Author doesn't seem to take his journey to China that seriously, sub-consciously deciding to use what is basically left of his youthful immortality on this idiosyncratic quest (But he  could "eat bitter"),  In conclusion, this book is fun, fresh, fast and light and sometimes that's my definition of a day of sunshine, one  minor exception due to our ever faster changing world, the book can feel ambiguously dated at certain points.

$review_text.: There are many well written reviews here about this book and I agree with the mostly positive views expressed. As these reviews say,  this is a fantastic study of an overlooked aspect of the Eastern Front.  This book shows the horrors of war for soldiers and civilians which are are beyond comprehension.My problem with the book has been expressed by others and that is the lack of good maps.  I do not understand how editors of military history can allow books to be published which describe movements of units and do not provide adequate maps.  I cannot believe that the editor of this book even reads military history.  This an issue for me and for any editors out there who read this review, I have some points to make:1.  You have a town or city which plays an important part in a battle, you get it on a map.  You have a military unit in the narration, you get it on a map.2.  Locate maps in the book close to the same point in the narration of the battle3.  Put lots of details in the maps including geographic points which are part of a battle.  Us military historians like detailed maps.  We are map fanatics!  You are not wasting ink.4.  Show the movements of units expressed in the battle narrations in a detailed manner.  Lots of arrows!  We like arrows.5.  Always have a map of the big picture.  This book needed a map of Eastern Europe as well as the map of East Prussia.  Why you may ask?  Even though military history readers probably know the information, we like to see the big picture too.6.  Finally, think about who is reading this book.  It is not Oprah Book Club.  Put in the maps!  We like maps, we look at them.  They are not wasted pages.  Give us maps!!!If any of you know a military history book editor, send this review to him or her.Sully

$review_text.: For single girls who want to be single, at least for the present moment, this book is a great guide

When peer pressure makes single life an abnormality it is nice to find help that says you do not have to "measure up to some over-sexed, under-sexed, or completely idealized conception of womanhood." In other words it is okay to be a single woman


Being single is not just a holding zone until getting married
Single life is a perfectly valid life for as long as "you" want it to be.Emily Stimpson offers counselling not so much to convince single girls how to live (or be good Catholics)but rather support those single girls who "want" to do it right


She offers support of vocations, career women, and the single life; helps her recognize who she is; suggests do's and don't's in dating so she remains who she is (not what someone else wants her to be); discusses those tough issues of sex, chastity and the biological clock; etc.Is it easy being single? The author says "Sometimes being single just plain stinks." And no matter how good you do it "...there will still be days when you feel like Job; afflicted, persecuted, abandoned, alone." But the nice thing, she says, is "that's normal." Actually it sounds the same as how you feel at times even if you were married

And she suggests that if no one brings you flowers "....buy some pretty flowers"..


yourself.The book also deals with nuts and bolts stuff like IRAs, owning your home vs renting, student loans, etc


You can do all these things yourself even if you catch some flak from those you deal with who think this is up to the guy to handle
Maybe the greatest danger to the single girl's life style is being taken advantage of by guys or business people and certainly not being taken serious

Read this book if you want the support that says you are okay as you are


The author offers some support specific to Catholic single girls but other single girls will also gain from this book, immensely

In fact this book is really a great read for all women (even guys).

$REVIEW.: Patterson books are always good.  They are fast paced and I do not feel the author is withholding information.  This is one of several books in the women's murder club series.  I liked this preview but have been adding up what this series is costing so I did not buy it, I got it from the library.  I am beginning to be disappointed with Amazon's policy although they say it is the publisher who will not allow loans.  I do not necessarily want to loan a book but I want to be able to do so.  Also, I have to rely on Amazon to store my books for me.  It makes be a bit nervous to think that I am approaching $1000 worth of books that I do not really own.  Whey I read a paper book, I usually donate it to the library later.  That is my choice.  I cannot do this with an Amazon book.  This book, however, is worth the price if you want to read it, and if your want to follow Sgt. boxer, you may have to.

I love the regency period and Heyer is, of course, my favorite author for witty banter and situations. But I have to say, Miranda Davis is one I'm looking forward to reading more from. While I don't care for the book's cover, the story is just great and so very unusual for the regency time period. It's not a book I'd give to my young teen because it does have a more than warm scene, but for adult romance it's great. And I loved the tattoo!

$REVIEW.: Joseph J. Gabriele pens this noir styled thriller about a wealthy socialite named Eliot Sexton who finds himself embroiled in a murder case when a close friend who happened to be a government official and former US diplomat is found shot in the head at a party in his posh Park Avenue apartment. Even stranger is the fact that a famous drum set has been taken from the apartment.With a promising beginning, the story flows into the mundane with its often vivid descriptions of the life of a socialite/economist/historian/author. The story does introduce some interesting characters. Blair Lockhart is Eliot Sexton&#8217;s love interest and a great deal of attention is put into her character. Pacing may have been slow, but the story flourishes in developing its atmosphere and characters.

I had wanted to know more about THEY, and learned very little.Please forgive me, as I've never read anything else by the author and, while I do understand he is very good, this may be one that fell short, in both plot development and length.

But he has a dark side.Been there, done that!!! But, even if it's frequent, Sean really captured my attention,Avery is shy, innocent and she is a fighter. She is fighting for beter life and opportunity to achieve something in life.Many female characters, lately, have been characterized in this way, but just like Sean, Avery has something special, something that makes it more interesting than the other average characters in other books.Previous books, ie, the eleventh sequel left me shocked, I mean, wich sequel has not? lolHM Ward once again proved that really knows how to attract the reader's attention. I think every book is more and more shocking, and the anticipation of sequel is literally killing me! I need a dose of brothers Ferro soon!I'm glad that in this sequel are introduced characters from other books, and we had the opportunity to read about the rest of the brothers Ferro and of course unique and sexy Trystan!Much has revealed about the murder, but still lacks the facts Who and why?I'm totally on edge, I do not even know what would have happened next!?Ok, to make it short. It is more than clear that I love this series and I recommend them to everyone who loves clifhangers, excellent and more than an interesting story!

$REVIEW.: I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.####If you have reservations reading about forced sexual situtations this book may not be for you####This is the conclusion of Julia's story.  I loved some parts of this book and others not so much.Julia's perserverence in the face danger from a dangerous ex as well as betrayal by people who are supposed to love her shows her inner strength  Though there are times that she falters, her will to survive remains constant.This story takes place over the course of several weeks and there is a lot of story that takes place during this time.  In my opinion the time line could have been expanded to make the story richer.~~Wicked Reads Review Team~~

$review_text.: **War of Hearts by Annette Lyon: I found this story really hard to get into. I'm not sure why because I love this author and her books but I wasn't drawn to this story. Its about a girl Anna who went to cover the winter war in Finland as a journalist and reunites with a ex boyfriend.**The Earl of Oaksey Takes a Wife by GG Vandagriff: I liked this story. It was like a tragic, misunderstanding love story. Melissa thinks her husband only married her for her money and is determined to shut him out, but gets really sick.**Gift of Love by Michele Paige Holmes: This story was SO good!! It was a tragic, mystery, romance! I loved it! The author was able to weave a believable mini mystery in the short time allotted and still created a great story with an unbelievable ending!! Amelia marries Ethan to take care of his daughter only to find out shes wife number 4! One of my favorites of this collection!**A Lesson in Love by Sarah Eden: This was a cute, funny read. Lucy and Reed get married only to discover they have different views about attending social events, which leads to family drama and the extended families trying to interfere and &#34;help&#34; them. Very funny and loved how they worked out their differences in the end.**An Ocean Away by Heather Moore: This was also a humorous, light, romantic read! Gina is an adventurous reader who would rather climb things and hide out to read, than go to social events with her parents. Until she meets the handsome Edmund who does not make a good impression with her parents. Very cute story and made me laugh alot.**What Happens in Venice by Nancy Campbell Allen: This was a good drama, mini mystery. Evangeline has to endure her stepfather and 2 step sisters until she meets a fellow painting lover in Venice- Conte Bellini. I liked that she was a strong character that could take care of herself and stand up for herself regardless of the circumstances. It was like a mini Cinderella story.

$review_text.: First off I would like to say how much I really enjoyed the first book. It was a page turner and I think easily the equivalent of other writers in the genre such as Drake and Weber. However, I am only half way through this book and I feel compelled to write about a glaring inconsistency that stopped me in my tracks. After multiple transitions Captain Eric Weston goes to medical and speaks to the ship's medical officer, Doctor Palin? In the first book Doctor Palin was a linguistic and Doctor Rame was the ships medical officer! What happened?Hopefully this error can be explained or corrected before we move on to the next book.

$REVIEW.: I liked the cover. I thought it represented the book very well.  Looks like this review is going to be one big spoiler.I like books where the hero saves the heroine, but when::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::SPOILER::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::the hero is the one the heroine needs to be saved from, it just messes with myhead.Tess is kidnapped in Mexico while on vacation with her boyfriend. She continually fights the kidnappers. They decide she is too much trouble to sell . So they give her to (of course) a rich man who lives in a mansion and who treats her terrible. She won't tell him her name because she feels she has had everything else taken from her. So what does this poor excuse for a man call her? Slave! This is now her name. She fights being a captive every chance she gets. She is a survivor.She manages to escape and is then 'rescued' by the bad guys who then rape her.Oh yes, the rich man has a tracking bracelet on Slave, so now he is the hero and he saves her.It turns out, he is a 'good guy' who buys slaves and rehabilitates them, then returns them to their homes. WWWWHHHHHAAAATTTT!I can't tell you how mad this made me. He fixes broken women that have been enslaved and abused. So what happens when he gets a woman who is not broken????? He brakes her. WTH! If he had sent her home when she first arrived she would not have been beaten and raped. Actually, at one point she is strung up and tied to the ceiling, by the so called H, so the men that gave her to him could fondle her so she would be degraded and more submissive. Because he is a coward, he doesn't watch the results of his actions and she is raped with a knife handle. And THAT breaks her!!!After she escapes and calls the boyfriend who then calls the police, she decides she loves this monster, then what does this POS do? He sends her home to her boyfriend.Oh, she lets the boyfriend go and she returns to this man. HEA...... Bullhockey!!!!!::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::END SPOILER::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Just in case you wanted to know how I really feel . ;-/

$review_text.: Set in 15th century Spain during the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand, this beautifully written tale is about the ordinary men and women swept up in the chaos and upheavel of the Inquisition and the 1492 Expulsion of the Jews.This can be difficult subject matter for a novelist, both because of its complex historical context as for its tendency to incite a modern-day viewpoint of events that happened over 500 years ago. Mr Kaplan, however, has created a vividly rendered, sensitive account of this intense time as seen through the eyes of Aragon's converso chancellor, Luis de Santangel, who helped convince Queen Isabella to finance Columbus, and Judith Midgal, aunt of Columbus's official translator. His portrayal of this remarkable man and woman and their struggles to reconcile their past with their future amidst a rising storm of persecution humanizes his tale; and his evocation of a troubled Spain at the crossroads of its own past and future is equally well drawn.

$REVIEW.: I downloaded this book with only a passing knowledge of Osho: some revere him as a great guru, others revile him as a dangerous cult leader


Knowing full well that great thinkers often get bad press, I approached this book with an open mind

It is now closed.I found this book offensive, hollow New Age drivel riddled with subtle brainwashing

I strongly discourage reading it, especially if you are emotionally unstable..


which, let's be frank, is not an unreasonable assumption if you are attracted to a book promising "freedom from anger, jealousy, and fear".Much of the book looks innocent enough, from vain platitudes on love to profound(?) insights like "live each emotion that you feel"
Knowing the type of book I was reading, I found it easy to look past the pseudoscience ("the unconscious is nine times bigger than the conscious") and to make apologies for its sexism ("a woman knows that if she cries, she is the winner")

After defending the guru from the ignorant critic - myself - for page after page, it was then that I had my moment of enlightenment: this is dangerous nonsense!Imagine if you will a young woman in distress looking for answers, looking for meaning

How will she respond when reading "if your husband never becomes angry, report him to the police..


a husband who never becomes angry will one day suddenly jump and suffocate you"? Is it unrealistic to think she might believe this? Do you think that following this advice will improve her life?I could go on for paragraphs about how seemingly benign injunctions against jealousy could be twisted into justifications for free love and communal marriage by a manipulative cult leader but I think I've already made my point

To the blind zealots sure to vote me down, may I offer these words of Osho as a parting message: "there is nothing spiritual in it
But people go on mistaking things".

$REVIEW.: Ahhh, the webs we weave, tangled and knotted and frayed, threatening to break loose at any moment. Once again the Banovics are living life on the edge, keeping secrets, playing with fire in places too hot to handle. Looking for another look into the lives of the privileged few, or more correctly, what their children are doing? Gillian Felix takes us back to the soap opera lives of the Banovics in Bastard&#8217;s Brew, her latest addition to this intriguing series.Kevin discovers what it&#8217;s like to truly care for someone when he meets L&#8217;Wren. Too bad he has become entangled in lies, deceit and sexual blackmail with, of all people, his mother&#8217;s one time best friend, L&#8217;Wren&#8217;s stepmother, the epitome of a beautiful, yet deadly cougar. Savi knows she has him trapped and she is unwilling to pull her claws out of Kevin. Is there a way he can save his budding romance with L&#8217;Wren and rid himself of Savi without anyone being the wiser?Is his carefully crafted world about to fall in on him? What of his other &#8220;less than savory&#8221; enterprises? Always the big brother to his siblings, the one who could fix everything, the private Banovic is in trouble, even his role of white Knight may be tarnished, not to mention his heart may take a beating, too.We all need some drama in our lives, right? What safer way than reading about someone else&#8217;s drama, one bite at a time, as their lives start to implode on them? Thanks to Gillian Felix&#8217; ability to cram a gallon of action into a 4 ounce cup, Bastard&#8217;s Brew is a delightful way to escape into someone else&#8217;s life and learn to appreciate living a &#8220;normal one,&#8221; yourself! Ms. Felix knows how to create high tension with seemingly just the flick of her magic pen as it flows with a flair for the dramatic. Each character is desperately flawed, but attempt to function behind their own masks. Secrets, lies, more lies and more secrets. Better than Daytime soaps, I can visualize my own scenes, thanks to Ms. Felix!For a quick escape, with high velocity tension, you MUST read the series Family Portrait!

$REVIEW.: There's a lot to love in Century 2009, and unfortunately there's also a lot to hate. The novel opens with Orlando, who has undergone a pretty major personality change from how she appeared in 1910 and 1969, and it doesn't feel earned. I would argue that it's impossible to have a 40 year time skip and have character changes feel earned, as a matter of fact.One thing I noticed in 2009 is that Moore starts to use fewer book references and begins to start making a lot of TV refereneces, and I'm ok with that. TV has long since been replacing literature as a source of entertainment and artwork, with shows like The Soprano's, The Wire and Breaking Bad deserving of being hailed as iconic pieces of pop culture like we now view Sherlock Holmes to be. The only problem is that these shows are not in the public domain and Moore obviously couldn't secure the rights to use them, so he has to engage in a lot of narrative gymnastics to avoid being sued.That being said, the main plot of the Antichrist involves a pretty major literary reference, and one that I loved. If you read 1969 and have any knowledge of modern books, you know which one I'm talking about. This plot line saved the novel for me, and made the one's that came before a little more enjoyable. As an overall plot breakdown, I would say the first 50% of the novel is Moore resolving the consequences of the previous novel in a somewhat dull way, the next 40% when the hunt for and confrontation with the Antichrist is pure gold, honestly probably my favorite part of the entire league history, but then it gets resolved with a massive Deux-ex-Machina in the last bit that tarnishes the book as a whole.Like Watchmen and the other League novels, Moore ended this story with a companion piece called 'Minions of the Moon'. This piece provides plenty of interesting back story on the characters, along with it's own worthwhile League Adventure in it's own right. Unfortunately, Moore decided to write it at a Nathaniel Hawthorne level of overly-complicated-and-pretentious writing. Still I wouldn't recommend that you skip it.I went back and forth on a two or three star review, but I decided to be a little forgiving of the way this series ended. Still, I probably won't bother with League for a while.

$REVIEW.: Right from the opening scene, GOTU is an action-packed thriller that moves with the speed and attitude of a .44 slug
Sergeant Robin Marlette supervises Arizona's drug enforcement unit, known informally to its members as Guardians Of The Universe, or GOTU

Their job is to stop the worst of the bad guys from crossing the Mexican border with illegal drugs, and they don't exactly issue traffic citations


Robin is the ideal leader, who inspires his men to follow him anywhere

He is a fine family man, which is a crucial fact about him--if the bad guys shoot at the GOTU crew, that's business

But when they threaten Robin's family, they make the worst mistake of their miserable lives


At times he almost seems too perfect, but then we learn that he isn't.With his background in Arizona law enforcement, author Mike McNeff certainly knows his stuff

There's never a dull moment in GOTU, especially when it comes to gunfights


It's a crisply written, satisfying read.

After the death of her parents, she went to live with her aunt and uncle who have left her home alone for the summer while they travel to Italy. She doesn't remember everything from her childhood and is working through things with her therapist. You learn bits and pieces throughout the story... the big shocker coming near the end.I love how Heather and Josh meet. I would have panicked if that ever happened to me, just like Heather did. It was definitely memorable.Somehow, Josh realized that Heather needs to be handled carefully. He is so kind and considerate of her. You can tell he really has her best interest in mind. First, he finds out he has a connection to Heather's past. Then.... he's dealt an incredible blow. I can't imagine either of them having to deal with the situation. Both of them have to deal with the fall out of the new development exposed during a therapy session.I really enjoyed this book.

From the beginning, you get the feeling that his heart isn't in it and his greatest hope is to get out alive

He was no coward (wounded more than once) but he is very straightforward about his self-preservation:-) 
It's refreshing to read an account from a man not ashamed to describe how he and many others felt about the whole ordeal.There is also a lot of humor to be found

$review_text.: 10 year old Helen, the protagonist in this unique and entertaining coming-of-age tale, is an indelible character that you will not soon forget. Raised primarily by her recently deceased, beloved grandmother Nonie and marginally, by her now absent father (he's off doing secret WWII work), Helen is unwillingly entrusted to the care of her 22 year old second cousin, Flora. Helen's wit and intellect is biting and laugh-out-loud funny but Flora, a "simple heart", never rises to the bait. She is the kind of person we all should be lucky enough to know.Quarantined to their rambling old North Carolina home during a polio scare, Helen and Flora learn some interesting things about their family and themselves as they interact with the few people they see that summer including Finn, the grocery delivery man/ex-soldier/kind heart who is a hoot.Helen is maddeningly immune to Flora's charms, leading to a cataclysmic event that is the heart-breaking denouement of this book. The journey they take getting there is a thoroughly engrossing read that you will enjoy and never forget. The author has a gift for dialog, the characters come alive with every word and gesture. Helen and Flora remain in my mind and heart as they will yours.

Never mind the fact work is going to come much too soon for these tired eyes. But it was so catchy and cute I had to keep reading. This is the kind of book that leaves you grinning with that warm fuzzy feeling all over. I adored the lead. Lucia is the type of character I could relate to. You get her with the descriptives in the book that she is attractive but you still feel like she is a normal every day girl. A girl having a rough time finding her &#34;One&#34; and I've been there. Her inner dialogue on fears of being alone forever rang true to my heart. What girl hasn't? Then add a little pressure from family and I felt like I was chatting out love and the treacherous act of dating with my best friend.Not to mention Jackson ends up being completely swoon worthy. This book is a fantastic gem. It made me smile and laugh. Thank you Justine Faeth for allowing me the privilege to read this. It really made my night.

$review_text.: Wolfsangel is the second in the author's `bone angel' series, but can be read as a standalone novel. Set in a small French town, a hotbed for the Resistance during the German occupation, Celeste Roussel longs to join and do her bit for France, but her brothers feel she wouldn't be strong enough to withstand torture if caught.However, when her brothers are captured, it is Celeste who comes to their rescue. But Celeste is forced to lead a double life, because she falls in love with Martin Diehl, a German officer. While Martin is away, Celeste is raped by two of his fellow officers. Her plan for revenge affects the town she loves in ways she could never have imagined.Liza Perrat's skill at bringing the characters and events vividly to life make Wolfsangel one of the best novels I've read on this period of history.Highly recommended - this is one I'll read again and again.

$review_text.: I love Heidi Cullinan's works, I usually enjoy Marie Sexton's works, so of course I could not wait to see what they will come up with together.This story just flowed so effortlessly for me and did not feel coauthored at all, it felt like it was written by one author
The story is written in third person limited POV which switches to first person POV between two main characters, usually such switch (from third person to first) annoys me, but here it worked beatifully


I loved Paul's cluelessness, his insecurities, which again could be very annoying in another character, just worked for him and made him even more adorable for this reader

I don't know, probably because the writers convinced me that Paul indeed sincerely believed in how nobody would want him, but I also loved how he grew throughout the story

Both he and El just grew so much IMO and I loved how they realized what they both want the most and that it was worth trying to keep.Secondary characters were great, humor worked perfectly for me


Awesome.

The pace of the book is great, you just wanna keep on reading and never put it down.  There's danger, love, and more.  I love paranormal romance and this book is one of my faves.

This is an excellent book to  enhance the reader's knowledge and interest in civil war battles.  I look  forward to more of his books.

$REVIEW.: Interesting account of movie making melt-downs and production debacles that's a must for film buffs.Some of these are well-known (Martin Sheen's mental/physical breakdown during the filming of Apocalypse Now and Marlon Brando's refusal to read Joseph Conrad) and others not as much, at least by me. It includes the awful decapitation of Vic Morrow during the filming of Twilight Zone: The Movie and Werner Herzog threatening Klaus Kinski with a pistol during Fitzcarraldo. There's also an interesting account of James Cameron's production headaches while filming the underwater classic, The Abyss and Michael Cimino's megalomania on the set of Heaven's Gate.

$REVIEW.: It's hard to beat a free book that is a complete story, no cliffhangers, and HEA.This was a fun paranormal romance with an interesting and unique world. These aren't your normal Faeries. These guys have wings, fangs and superpowers. This was a cross between Dark Lover and Kresley Cole Immortals After Dark: The Clan MacRieve.I loved the hero(s) in this book but the heroine Izzy, not so much. She was supposed to be fiesty and witty, but I found her annoying and boring. This is written with multiple POV's which hops paragraph to paragraph. I found this distracting and wished we could have stayed with just Izzy and Bain (hero) switching with chapter breaks.Still, a decent read and interesting world. I love being surprised!

$REVIEW.: I honestly didn't know it was possible to learn so much about eBay in such a short amount of time. I buy and sell on eBay all of the time, but my sales often took a long time to finally sell. I hoped to remedy the situation through reading, so I picked up The Compact Ebay Sales Guide. It is not like other Ebay business books where they tell you exactly how to do every small task. Instead, this book is more of a primer or theory of Ebay selling. In the end, I feel like I finally get how to be a better seller. I honestly loved this book and could see myself reading it again to keep my mind fresh. I would recommend this book to anyone who is an online seller anywhere, especially on Ebay.

$REVIEW.: I really like this book, but I feel like maybe they should have broken it down into several books targeted at different ages/skill levels. An older preschooler who could do the cutting and tracing would be bored by identifying colors, and my little guy who is still working on some of the more beginner skills in the book can't do like half of the stuff that is later in the book. Mostly that's okay-after all, we can just wait to do the hard pages until he is older-but it is frustrating on pages that have very beginner skills like color identification, but also ask the child to trace the name of the color that page is featuring. The previous workbook we had for him didn't have that problem, and he is often grumpy now that he can't do the whole page by himself like he used to be able to do!

$REVIEW.: Chloe Lane is almost thirty and single, but in her own mind she's a success: she's followed her passion and her dream of being a fashion designer, opening her own boutique in New York City to sell her clothes

Her mother may still harp on at her about finding a man and getting married, but Chloe doesn't beat herself up about it

But after a night out with her two best friends, Isabel and Veronica, which saw all their attempts at meeting men fail, she can't help but feel a bit down about it

So when her good friend since childhood, Ethan Webster, makes a startling suggestion, Chloe decides, why not?Ethan proposes to test the theory that Chloe, Veronica and Isabel came up with to explain why the men weren't biting: that men like the chase, and that being in a couple makes a person more desirable to others
If Chloe pretends to be in a relationship with Ethan, maybe he'll be able to attract the attention of the woman at work whom he's interested in


And the bonus: they'll have dates for parties, holidays and "other couple-y things"


They work out the details of their pretend relationship, and the test is on.When Chloe unexpectedly receives an invitation to be one of four judges on a new reality TV competition show on NBC, she's excited and also very nervous
Of the four other super-successful entrepreneur judges, one of them is William Shannon, a very sexy, filthy rich bachelor who ignites an electrical charge of desire in Chloe
The chance to test the theory herself sees Chloe extending her lies to her work in order to make William Shannon think Ethan is her boyfriend.As Chloe begins to get her heart's wish in the bedroom-department as well as in business, she finds that the lies and the truth are no longer easy to distinguish, that maybe the lies are hiding a more profound truth - and it's just taking time and life experiences to know which is which.This is the first novel Garner has published under her own name; previously she's released three books under the pen name Libby Mercer

I've read Unmasking Maya and really enjoyed it - it was about a textile artist, again showing Mercer/Garner's love of textiles, fashion, design, clothing and art - and I have The Karmic Connection still to read (I don't think that one has a fashion/design angle, but not having read it yet I can't be sure!)


Garner is on solid ground with the fashion industry, and I have to say that after reading two chick-lit novels set in the world of fashion this year (the other being Sunni Overend's excellent March), I feel like I know quite a bit about it now, too!I remember that one of my slight disappointments regarding Unmasking Maya was that it was a bit short, and I wanted more meat on what's an otherwise great story
Well with Lying to Meet You, I got my meat! There's not only great detail in this story, it also really delves into Chloe's life and fleshes out the supporting cast as well


It felt very realistic and alive; the time I spent in Chloe's head and her life was vivid and tangible


This reads as an engaging chick-lit novel (with very few embarrassing - nay, humiliating - moments unlike most chick-lit it seems) that takes the time to let its heroine grow and mature and figure things out

Nothing felt forced or contrived or rushed
The ending - the romance side of it - wasn't all that predictable: because of the tone and nature of the story, I really wasn't sure how it was going to end until we were nearly there

It did turn out to be true to formula, but it worked and was right for the characters.There's humour here too, and some funny situations that are all the more comical by not being over-done
Other times it's a more gentle kind of humour, a shake-your-head-at-the-folly kind
And then there are the moments of humour that have a darker undertone, making it edgier - especially certain scenes with William Shannon, or the winning competitors diet bracelet inspired by an electric cattle prod


(Chloe finds herself unable to think of him as just William, building him into a major celebrity in her own mind, which does rather point to how things will turn out.) Throughout the novel, it wasn't the chick-lit formula that kept the momentum and tension in the story, it was the tone, the hint of uncertainty, of Chloe wobbling on her high heels, that gave it real tension
A good chick-lit novel isn't a farce, it's a fine balance of humour, realism and deeper meaning - a kind of reassessment of the character's life
In that, Garner was highly successful with Lying to Meet You.I also have to say that I absolutely loved reading that in designing a new line of clothing inspired by Queen Boudicca, she incorporates a tartan: the Elliott tartan
She's absolutely correct, it's the loveliest tartan (not the modern version, the original more muted one), and for Chloe it has personal meaning in that her mum was an Elliott before she married her dad


I loved this because my husband's grandmother is an Elliott too (pre-marriage, but once in a clan, always in a clan), and the kilt he wore for our wedding was in the Elliott tartan
We also gave our son the name Elliott as his first middle name, to keep that connection alive

Both of us have lots of Scottish ancestry on both sides of our families, but the Elliott tartan really is the loveliest.Lying to Meet You was an absorbing, fun, interesting story that brings the New York fashion world to life

I loved reading this engaging, intelligent and well-written novel, and following Chloe on her journey to finding real love and lifelong companionship
Chloe is a smart, endearing, realistic heroine caught up in dreams and lies when the reality already in her grasp is better than both.My thanks to the author for a copy of this book.

$review_text.: For the most part I enjoyed reading this book.  I thought Kaine, the h, was likeable and Spencer eventually changed my negative first impression of him.  I disliked how the author took a likable character Camden, and made him unlikable.  The story seemed a good length and included smex scenes without being too much.The cliff hanger did not bother me because the way the book ended, I feel no compelling need to read the second book.  The cliff hanger had nothing to do with H & h relationship and so for me, the book is a HEA.

$REVIEW.: I don't actually have any children at this time, nor do I plan to in the immediate future. I will someday though, so I accepted this request for review, especially since the subtitle says at any age. I can remember in school writing was a chore for me. I didn't enjoy it, and I know I used to when I was younger. I remember having a journal where I'd write stories that popped into my mind. And when that one became full my mom gave me another to start in. Somewhere along the way though I lost my passion for it. I want to rekindle that passion. Not only for myself, but for the sake of any future children I have.What I love about this book is that the prompts Pam Allyn suggests for getting your kid started is writing about what you see, what you feel, which is also a great way to become aware of the world around you. If we get children passionate about writing when they're young, and being aware, they will grow up with that awareness and hopefully cherish it. They will see something and question why that is, and marvel at it. And then write about it. With awareness and literacy hand in hand, I think as children grow up, they would be less likely to take life for granted, because they'd have the skills they need to live life to it's fullest.She also talks about the importance of reading. I've heard it said by many people over the years that reading helps you write better, and that is absolutely true. With all of the writing tips she gives the reader in her book she also mentions picture books and chapter books that fit whatever idea she's currently talking about. Examples for your child to see how poetry is written well, or humor. Anything. She also lists twenty books that are excellent at showing all the different writing styles there are, and how and why they work. And that while for writing there are some set rules, it's also a creative outlet for your child to express themselves, however they want to. It allows them to think outside the box.The last chapter is a wonderful resource for anytime you or your child has writer's blocks. There are prompts about what to write when you're lonely, where you think up an imaginary friend and write about him or her, about who that person is, what makes them that person. And almost all prompts also have an offering of books that talk about that topic in some way.This book also got me thinking about traditional writing as well as writing with all the new technology we've gained even in just the last ten years. In the beginning I think you should definitely stick to traditional materials like paper and pens, pencils, crayons and markers like she says. And when the child is older add in the computer. Be careful though about how much time the child spends on the computer, because I know from personal experience that it is very easy for a younger child to get addicted to everything the computer and internet can offer, which can be a detriment to child's development. Finding a balance between the mediums will allow him or her to get the best of both worlds.This is definitely a book you'll want in personal library if you have children, or are planning on having them soon. All of the ideas in this book can only help enrich their lives, help them appreciate everything around them, and like Pam says, keep your family close throughout the years, because you are actively helping your child in this process, instead of being a bystander.

$REVIEW.: Playfully written with both humorous and honest stories from his life, Dangerous Wonder provokes readers into looking at Christianity in a whole new light. -- Frontline CBA, January 1999This book is filled with wonderful stories to remind us what childlike faith looks and feels like, and it challenges the Christian status quo. We are told to take risks, to wonder, to love passionately, and to experience God's indiscriminate grace...Dangerous Wonder is a must-read. Many youths in my church think Jesus never laughed and the Christian life is boring. That breaks my heart. My mission now is to liberate these teens in any way I can. This book will help! -- Youthworker, January/February 1999The other day I wore my son's board shorts on my head. The cord hung undecorously behind my ear and the legs ballooned out behind. My nearly eight-year-old came down from his room and placed his swimmers on my head while I was eating breakfast and reading Dangerous Wonder. I normally would have removed them and ordered him to get ready for school, but I was reading that book. So I left them on ...If none of this makes sense to you, then you urgently need to read Dangerous Wonder...If people read it they might sell everything and give it to the poor, or dance with all their might in church, or wear swimmers on their head. They might stop what they are doing and, for the first time since they were nearly eight, do nothing but enjoy life. And suddenly find that God is there enjoying it with them. -- Peter Hallett, Alive, May 1999This is the sort of book which can and will change lives. It is so refreshing to read someone who communicates passionately through words and images. I, for one, hope to find the courage to follow the invitation to childlike discipleship-a &#34;jump-first-fear-later&#34; faith. -- Donald Macaskill, Life & Work, February 1999--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.From the Back CoverJUMP FIRST. FEAR LATER. Remember the thrill of thinking you could fly? The adventure of going places in your imagination? The joy and abandon of running and jumping and playing hard-without worrying about what &#34;might&#34; happen? In Dangerous Wonder, Michael Yaconelli invites you to recapture the joy of being a child and apply it to your relationship with God. You'll be encouraged to ask difficult questions about faith and take Jesus at His word when He says, &#34;Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&#34; If you're looking for the joy and freedom of faith, Dangerous Wonder will open your eyes and your life to the possibility of an exciting adventure in relationship with God. This new edition now includes a discussion guide to help you experience an even deeper relationship with God, filled with wonder and awe.

Would buy the next if ever there is. I read some reviews early on re the writer's lack of expertise on bedroom description & I have to agree on that. I particularly remember somewhere it was something like &#34;he did it so good  but way better than a human&#34; or something like that & I cracked up. I'm not a romance lover nor a porno lover, but that was just hilarious.  Anyways, I was always able to grasp the emotional character of each individual & keep up with all the strange characters thruout & greatly enjoyed them all.

$REVIEW.: WoW!!!!!!I am not even sure where to start with this review....This book wasOne of the ab-so-lut-ly best freaking books I have ever read, and I mean EVER!!!Started it in the afternoon, say around 5pm are so, and couldn't put it down until it was finished; which was around 3:30am. Then getting up for 6am for a full days work. I have to say it was worth it!!!!Until the very end, when the last words of the book were "Jack and Syd story will continue in book 2". WTHHHHHH????!!!!!! Then how was I supposed to sleep after that? LOLBut with the way the book ended, gave me some peace at knowing they still working it out. Just hope the story doesn't go sour, as they usually do. Then that would really suck!!!!I think Michael doing what he did with his lil secretary, was the best thing he could have done. Syd would have never known what true love, heart wrenching, feelings felt like; not to mention what a true sex relief felt like (didn't know how else to put it to keep it clean), lol.I think EVERY woman would love to have a "Jack", and if not, then you should probably go get on meds, cause something is wrong with you.Who wouldn't want a hot, tall, thick, well built, handsome, green eyed man all over them 24/7? I think they were perfect for eachother, if not they wouldn't have felt that chemistry the moment they touched in Hawaii.

$REVIEW.: When I received this novel from Book Sneeze I wasn't really sure what to expect but as I started reading I found many new ways to think about and become closer to God.  I think that Kim Cash Tate really found a wonderful way to show how He is there even when we aren't looking for Him.It does get into much more detail and the story truly pulls you through page by page.  It made me feel closer to God and even cry for the women as they battle with themselves and with others over their own beliefs.  If you believe, want to believe, aren't sure what to believe..this is a great book for any woman to read who has faith of any kind.  I highly recommend this books to all of my Christian friends.

$REVIEW.: Wow! This book brought out a roller coaster of emotions within me


 It is so well written and Nancy is just enchanting

 I don't know what made me purchase the book to begin with - I think I was enticed by a mother/daughter story about the elderly/alzheimers

 But I got A LOT more than I bargained for
 You see Nancy, was a child star, a beautiful child who was naturally gifted at many things/arts
 Without giving spoilers, she had to contend with domineering forces in her life, that slowly ate into her like a disease, making her a people pleaser and person who kept up appearances (so to speak) at whatever cost.The honest narration and conversational style by the author (Nancy's daughter) is just poignant and so heartbreaking


 You feel her pain as she sees the gradual decline of her mother mentally and physically - and how this effects her relationship to her


 People who have/had elderly parents - this book will certainly strike a chord and many will be able to relate.The book is not all heartbreak, there is much joy through the pain
 The chapter about the locking of the door and a peephole is a funny one, which will have you laughing out loud.)I spent the last 15 pages, literally in tears, not wanting the book to end


 To the author, I just want to say - congratulations on this book


 You have done your Mum, the world and yourself a wonderful service.Bravo.

$REVIEW.: MacArthur by Mitchel Yockelson is a pretty good read. Before reading this book I only had a general knowledge of General Douglas MacArthur. Now I feel I am well acquainted with this impressive man and his place in history. Yockleson began the book by telling of MacArthur's birth in 1880 and ended with his death in 1964. In between we are told in great detail of his military accomplishments throughout several wars. History itself shows his intelligence and wisdom stood out amongst men as being quite superior. Yet, the thing that impressed me most was his determination to be his own man, never bowing to powers that be, even when they were directly over him. His belief system was very solid, guiding him along the way into becoming one of the most admired men in America, and even the world. Compromise doesn't seem to be a word that could described him. In each of his military conquests, he seemed to have the unfailing confidence required to make concise decisions that for the most part changed history both at home and abroad.Ever mindful of his men in battle, MacArthur stood beside his troops faithfully. When ordered to leave, his famous words were, "I shall return."  This book mostly read like a historical account of his life with little information on his personal life other than  the where and whens of family events. He was a devoted grandson, son, husband and father. I was quite surprised to read of how influential his mother was in his life. It encouraged me to read of how he was devoted to his mother, always cognizant of her needs and openly giving her honor. To think of a great military hero, most would conjure up a picture of a tough, domineering man. MacArthur was all of those things, yet coupled with an honorable side that included love and respect for his family. MacArthur, it seems was the total package. I recommend this book. It was worth the read.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze.com [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

$REVIEW.: From the Editorial Review this story sounds interesting.  It depicts a period in history and involves a story of a couple; the woman is Irish and the man English. Her dislike of the English control over the Irish and her unwillingness to marry this man in the pre-arranged marriage can be felt.  One can't help but to be interested in how the marriage evolves.

Many parts felt like I was reading an assignment that needed X many words so they added words for the sake of words not for any real meaning. People simply don't speak that way to one another, overly formal and labored. Other people seem happy with it but it just wasn't something I enjoyed.

$REVIEW.: Charles Isherwood certainly doesn't have a dull subject on his hands, and this book is a decadent page-turner.  Titillation is part of the reason, and so is camp.  As one reviewer correctly points out, in its gravitas, this book reads like the biography of an accomplished artist or senator, and the serious lengthy discussion of Stefano as opening the "top"-dominated gay porn world to the possibilities of a superstar "bottom," drive the camp quotient up that much higher.Most of us are both attracted to and repelled by pornography.  Sex is a shortcut to everything, and the world of flesh and juices created in X-rated films is one most males and a few females are drawn to at certain times.  As I found out in life, the unlikeliest people have collections of porn so ample they almost need the Dewey Decimal System to organize it.  As Camille Paglia has said, "A day without pornography is like a day without sunshine."I knew picking this book up that I'd be reading a tragic life.  Joey's physical flaws were few (a flattened nose, a slight doughiness) and his physical attributes were many (a stunning Tom Cruise face and an arse that should be cast in platinum and displayed in the Prado) but psychologically this young man was a mess.Author Isherwood is a good reporter and gathers most of the important facts about his subject's life.  His psychological theses are on shakier ground.  The most important thing to know about Nick Iacona/Joey Stefano was that he was an addictive personality.  Addictive personalities are usually not confined to one addiction, because this personality type is really a mode of response to any pleasure, one which is compulsive and unrelenting.When Nick/Joey wasn't doing porn films, he was going to orgiastic parties, and when these two allowed him any spare time, he was calling up sex lines, cruising parking lots, or soliciting other hustlers!  Now this, my friends, is a sex addiction if any doubt lingers.Ecsape through drugs, frightening and blissful, was another of Nick/Joey's obsessions, and everything from heroin to morphine to cocaine to ketamine found itself in his system.  Spending money compulsively and completely rounded out Nick/Joey's trio of addictions.  A well-paid erotic film star, he never had a dime to his name, and couldn't even save up for a used car.With his good looks, Nick/Joey didn't lack for sugar daddies, and some of these transcended the role and became genuinely fatherly; alas, it was too late, and the porn star's problems were too weighty and too many.  Lacking a human lover in his life, Nick/Joey courted death; his twin obsessions with sex and drugs dealt him a dual death sentence:  HIV and an overdose.People with addictive personalities are also quite productive, since their work often becomes an addiction as well.  Nick/Joey made 17 erotic films, and became one of a small group of icons in gay pornography.  This may seem a dubious accomplishment, but it's well out of the reach of most of us.  "The privileges of beauty are enormous" as Jean Cocteau said, and green-eyed Joey Stefano was clearly beautiful.  But he was the kind of guy who could win the lottery and run through the money in a year.  Tortured soul, his problems were a spooky and endless chasm, and we end up agreeing with his biographer with a chill and a sigh that at least death brings peace.

Seeing the story unfold I felt like I was going through everything with these characters the heart ache, the pain, the disappointment, but my favorite was sharing their ending. Not many are lucky enough to live their lives with intense love and passion Seth and Lauren did. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone. Hope to get more from Kate Stewart.

$REVIEW.: If I could give this book 100 stars as opposed to just 5 I would!  It really is that wonderful and one of the best books I have read in such a long time!  Ms. Kathryn Le Veque really knows how to tell a spellbinding tale that enchants and enthralls you from the very first page and holds your attention pulling you into the tale until the satisfying finish.  Actually I just never wanted the book to end!  The story has something for everyone!  The men will enjoy the non-stop action and battles.  The women will love the beautiful love-story intricately woven throughout and splendidly portrayed by the hero and heroine.You have the stunningly breath-taking gorgeous chivalrous benevolent knight and hero of the piece Maddoc du Bois who guards the heroine Adalind and her family.  Adalind is the fairest one in the entire realm but is the kind of person who is also altruistic and compassionate despite being the most beautiful.  Horrible unspeakable things that happened to her while she was away for five years at court due to people being jealous of her beauty.  Adalind has had a thing for Maddoc and been in love with him since childhood.  Maddoc thought of Adalind as an &#34;ugly buck-toothed little girl&#34; who was the bane of his existence.  Until he meets her again coming home from court and she has grown into a raving beauty that not only is he intrigued by her but is quite taken with her too.  Maddoc is tasked by the influential earl of Canterbury David de Lohr to remove suitors daily that are constantly vying for Adalind&#8217;s hand but ends up falling in love with her himself.  Maddoc in the end proves to everyone especially to himself the strength and depth of his love for her.  Theirs is a love that is truly &#8220;unending.&#8221;All the characters even the minor characters are so well-developed I wouldn&#8217;t mind Ms. Le Veque writing about them too.  Ms. Le Veque even managed to tie in brilliantly other characters besides David de Lohr who has been mentioned in some of her other novels.  Other old hero&#8217;s from her other books like Rhys du Bois Maddoc father from Spectre of the Sword and Gart Forbes from Archangel quite facilely.  Plus, with some new characters you also can&#8217;t help but feel something for every character despite how major or minor their role might be.  It was also gratifying to find out about them too like visiting old family or friends.The book has a little bit of everything like captivating poetry throughout each chapter along with sad tender moments, funny laugh out loud incidents between others characters, deception, conspiracies and a legendary status for some of the characters.  I know that this is one story I will keep in my library to read again and again.  In fact, I am re-reading it currently after writing this review.  I would definitely purchase and would read another of Ms. Le Veque&#8217;s work!

Getting stressed and struggling to change the outcome of any past event is like arguing with an echo to make it see your point of view."  That was a couple of lines from this incredible book which is full of guidance to help a person find the power to never feel powerless again.  But it is "power" of the "right and true" kind that you will find in this book.  I believe that it what each of us inherently wishes, right?  The insights unveiled in this book will keep you reading and reading...

$review_text.: The Breach Between is the second book in The Spiral Dance series
This book is a wonderful combination of magic, political intrigue and reality

The three Magi ( Bruce, Tolen and Maramore) have a mission

They need to satisfy the terms of the Legacy
 If they fail, it could mean the end of the Firma
The Gragona, who are dragons in their realm but on earth take human form, want to alter the Circle of Life


Who will succeed? This story is told from multiple points of view and is filled with so many twists and turns that it kept my interest

I love the mixture of time travel, suspense and especially the mythology
The book is a massive undertaking and the author has done an impressive job
I love the author's writing but I must admit with so many characters and plot points that I had to keep a cheat sheet

When you read this book, make sure that you allow uninterrupted time to savor the story

You won't be sorry.I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: The gripping story is about a super talented bunch of warriors who have to defend the kingdom against a group of terrorizing miscreants. Many interesting characters have also been sprinkled in the novel such as knights and kings. Even the enemy is using powerful and ancient sorcery to wreak mayhem. One of the most notable characters in this book is Quarvik who has a unique talent of aka' tii which is essentially ancient mindspeak. The special talent allows him to share his thoughts with any person he desires. Also, he can see everything in his dreams like the past present and future. The book is a pot pourri of everything dramatic and fast moving. Tidbits like sword fighting, sorcery, magic and fantasy make it a thoroughly entertaining read. The plot is not a drag at all. Also, if you have a thing for dungeons and dragons, then you will absolutely love this book.  Also the action packed twists and turns are a fantastic read. If you're looking for a short read that will keep your interest, this is it.

$review_text.: Last year I read "ROUGAROU" by Author JUDITH ANN McDOWELL.I was mesmerized from page one to the very shocking last page.  I was so impressed with Author McDowell's character development and colorful descriptions of Saint Anthony's Parish, Louisiana scenery.  I was most impressed with her development of Detective Donavan Hays and his partner Detective Jack Olivier.  We lost Detective Olivier at the end of "ROUGAROU" due to his depression pushing him into a downward spiral of pain pills and alcohol.  This was brought on by the firey death of the woman he loved (Chandra).  He resigned from the Sheriff's Department.In "ROUGAROU" the "Hindel Mansion" is the home of wealthy Jonathan Hindel and his son Lawrence.  To the residents of St. Anthony's Parish, they seem odd, almost reclusive.  When an entire family is slaughtered, Detectives Hays and Olivier's investigation leads diretly to Lawrence Hindel and evidence he is a 'living' Werewolf.  His rich Daddy's money gets him safely to England, where he spends a year in a "Mental Institution". With Lawrence out of the country, and the death of his father, Hays and Olivier close the case and the good people of St. Anthony's Parish return to a normal life.In "ROUGAROU II". Lawrence returns to St. Anthony's Parish and takes up residency in his (deceased) father's mansion.  He wastes no time in sauntering into the Sheriff's Office to announce his return to Hays and Olivier, and making a point that NO one is permitted on his property.  By this time, Hays is promoted to Detective Lieutenant.  Coached back to health and sobriety, Jack returns to the job he loves.  Jack has also fallen in love with Seela.  They marry and are expecting a baby boy.  Since Lawrence was enscounced in the English hospital, Hays and Olivier discover his father, Jonathan was in fact a real, living Werewolf, responsible for other murders.  They can't help wondering if Lawrence may have been innocent.When two teenagers go missing, Donavan and Jack learn the last place they were seen was at the Hindel Mansion, with four other teens who had gone to the Mansion to drink, smoke pot and get laid. The teens had believed the mansion to be deserted. This brings Hays and Olivier to full alert, pulling out all stops to find the missing kids.Author JUDITH ANN McDOWELL takes her readers on a roller-coaster ride into the dark,seemingly unbelievable world of Werewolves, a ride that will scare the beegeebees out of the most steeled minds.  I must say I was in fear for both Detective Lieutenant Donavan Hays and Detective Jack Oliver . . . and then my fear mounted for Jenny, Seela and the unborn son of Jack and Seela.IF YOU have not yet had the pleasure of buying and reading "ROUGAROU", then do it NOW . . . and be sure to buy "ROUGAROU II" and read them in order.  You will become a certified fan of the magic workings of Author Judith Ann McDowell's mind as her finger deftly touch her keyboard and the story unfolds for our reading pleasure.FIVE STARS (Plus) is how I recommend both "ROUGAROU" and "ROUGAROU II"!Now I must command all my patience to await release of "ROUGAROU III".Michael PhelpsAuthorMiami Shores, Florida

A small town is founded by Jews in the Ukraine to avoid the anti-Seminism of the Russian Czars. It survives for over 100 years and prospers. WWII comes and the Germans invade. They, with the help of Ukrainian haters kill everyone in the town and then burn it to the ground. A powerful story, well told. I especially liked the interviews of the survivors who fled either before the Nazis or during their occupation. The horror of prejudice and the hatred it causes will stay with you.
$SUMMARY.: What a sad story

$REVIEW.: This volume is among the best of the DC Archives volumes I've read so far.  Apparently DOOM PATROL was a cult favorite back in the 60's, but its reputation has been obscure enough to discourage any sort of systematic reprinting up until this book.  In a pointless lifetime of reading comics, this is the first time I've run across the original series.DC benefited from a number of excellent pencil artists back in the 1960's, such as Curt Swan, Neal Adams, and Murphy Anderson.  Bruno Premiani is a name that never seems to appear in that list, but it really should.  The artwork here is really impressive, comparable in places to Alex Raymond or Lou Fine.The Arnold Drake stories are also consistently entertaining, although you have to get used to a style of dialogue and characterization that smacks strongly of 50/60's-era horror and science fiction films.  But the writing is at least as good as anything being done in that period at Marvel or DC.  In some ways the storytelling reminds me of some non-superhero DC titles from the time, like STRANGE ADVENTURES or MYSTERY IN SPACE.Highly recommended to anyone who likes Silver Age comics.

$REVIEW.: This is the second in this series I have read, I didn't love the first one. The story was ok, but the writing style bugged me. I thought I'd try one more, and this one is much better! What bothered me most about the first one was the bad Irish accents. This one had less of that... still some but not as much.I liked this story, it felt more realistic, which is goofy considering it's about werewolves, but there you go! I liked the Characters, Lark was a sweetie, but a hand full! Declan was strong and alpha. The story had drama and a bit of action, and introduced some new characters.I've bought the next one!

Without the story in the first part of the book, I think the material would have been too dry to hold reader's attention.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a website for their business.  The book gives practical ways to look at your personal website objectively and what you can do generate more customers going to your site.

$review_text.: Trent is a normal teenager. He hates school but does his work, interacts with friends, & likes iTunes. With a busy dad & a mom who teaches at his school, he & his brother, Cole, have a pretty idyllic life.

Now, Trent can attend only the classes that he enjoys & many folks are in on it, too. His &#8216;Imitation&#8217; fills in wherever he&#8217;s needed. Follow Trent&#8217;s unusual journey with &#8216;Imitation Me&#8217;.I can absolutely see teen readers getting a kick out of this book. The plot is fantastically original. The characters are normal teens & quite believable. I also appreciate that the parents aren&#8217;t portrayed as complete dolts as YA sometimes does.In all, it was a fun read & very well written. Denise Atchley has created likeable characters that readers will want to know more about. Trent could certainly head up a series of his own & be successful with it.I received an eBook copy in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.

$REVIEW.: If you like zombies, aliens, werewolves, forbidden romances, and karma for the judgmental all rolled into one story, you will like this book


I would like to say that this is not my typical genre that I read, but I really wanted to stretch my horizons so I gave in and gave this a try


I was certainly not disappointed

Even if you are not used to this type of book(which I think falls into horror/sci fi/fantasy), you will not have any trouble keeping up with it
The world depicted is in the future, where people have only vague recollections of how life used to be

There is very little vegetation and water, but the people make do with the yearly rainfall that seems to come at scheduled time

In the beginning the Mayor and his pregnant wife are killed, but the one child that remains is saved


You later find out that this is no ordinary child, in fact this child will change the future of the world as we know it.Now I am not sure that the monster-like things that the people start to turn into after a while are a combination of zombies and werewolves, but that is the way my mind interpreted it

 I found myself picturing the story teller like the aliens from Stargate: as beings who were highly evolved and intelligent
I'm not quite sure if that is where I was intended to go or not, but it made the story interesting for me, considering my previous lack of experience with this genre.There are a few things that happen in this book that will be stuck in your head weeks after you read it, like the way a prisoner attacks his guards

I really don't want to ruin this scene for you, so let me just say it is graphically horrific and hysterical at the same time

I believe it comes from the author's dry sense of humor


I also like how the story teller could be interpreted as the author planning out how his story would go.All in all, a good read from beginning to end, even for a newbie.

$REVIEW.: I have always been fascinated by Chinese culture and cuisine.  My family and I love Chinese food, and I have been wanting to prepare it in our home more often.  To me, there has always been a bit of mystery associated with Chinese cuisine. I finished reading this book this morning, and a lot of the mystery has been cleared up for me.With 101 recipes, there are sure to be some recipes that will appeal to even the hardest to please devotee of Chinese food.The active table of contents lists the recipes in alphabetical order.  The dishes contain a variety of meats (lamb, chicken, pork, beef, seafood) as well as some vegetarian offerings.I confess that I am only a little better than a novice cook, so some of these recipes intimidate me a bit.  However, I think as I grow more confident with my cooking skills, I'll be able to tackle some of the more difficult dishes.  This is not to say that there aren't lots of simple dishes (there are plenty).The flavors are fresh and bold and they incorporate a wide variety of sauces. One thing that I found interesting on a personal note is that the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce recipe does not contain lobster.  When I was growing up, this dish was a family favorite at the local Chinese restaurant.  While we assumed it did in some way contain lobster... now I kinda think it didn't.Some of the ingredients are very new to me:  Lotus root in various forms (root, root powder, seeds). There are various kinds of exotic mushrooms/fungi (jyo black mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, nami black mushrooms, cloud ears, wood ears) as well as several more main stream mushrooms.  The "Assorted Vegetables in a Clear Sauce" calls for something called Tietsin Preserve (I think this is a vegetable preparation).  A mixed fruit dish calls for "grass jelly."  I am looking forward to exploring these food items that are new to me and I am preparing a list for my next trip to our local farmers market.One of the desserts that I can't wait to prepare is the "Honey Sponge Cake."  I have some baking skills, so I think I can manage this one (in truth though, the cake is steamed).  This cake calls for six eggs, the whites of which are used to create the "sponge cake" effect.  Also in this book are recipes for Almond Cookies and Chinese Fortune Cookies.Such favorites as General Tso's Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, Crab Rangoon, Beef with Broccoli, Kung Pao Beef (and Chicken), Egg Rolls, Chicken Foo Young, Sesame Beef, Teriyaki Beef, and Won Tons are just a few of the dishes you can learn to cook.If you are looking for a foundation cookbook of Chinese recipes, then this book is for you.  It has simple directions and there a lots of beautiful color photographs of the food.

Found out about it through Joanna Penn's The Creative Penn website and snatched it up to absorb Platt and Truant's wisdoms on making it as an indie publisher. Being a sci-fi, fantasy, and thriller novelist (and indie publisher) myself (and having just published my first novel), I needed to figure out a viable game plan to take my creative journey to the next level. Well, boys and girls, this book has it for sure. &#34;Write, Publish, Repeat&#34; gives us the down and dirty nuts and bolts info any indie would need to be successful: from reviews to building a fan base to writing quality work to &#34;building funnels&#34;, you'll get a full education. Pick this one up along with Joanna Penn's &#34;How to Market a Book&#34;, which is also mega kick-ass.Thanks so much, guys! I feel so much more empowered learning from the pros!

$REVIEW.: There is a reason corp-lit and chick-lit are popular

 They can be amusing, relatable and even insightful


 "Rusell Wiley" is an enjoyable example of the genre
 There are some hilarious moments, such as our protagonist's primer on how best to eject the potentially troublesome job applicant who exhibits such warning signs as a confident stride, appropriate eye contact and a firm handshake

 However, while the author's prose is accomplished, we've heard this story before:  mediocre marriages, mid-life temptations, and mid-career weltschmerz

 The book was enjoyable, well written, but ultimately just not all that unique


 It's the kind of book you read once and pass on to an office friend, not the kind that earns a permanent place on the bookshelf.

$review_text.: I'm so glad I stepped a bit out of my box to read this exhilarating, suspenseful debut! Persistence of Vision is well-paced, well written and contains time travel, super-neurochemical powers, mystery, space ships, political ideology...it's filled with so much goody-goodness and keeps you on the edge of your seat needing to know what happens next


It's a pretty impressive feat to weave all these elements together to create a compelling story, and Ms


Hill accomplishes just that!The characters are solidly written and although the novel is told mainly from 2 POVs, I really felt as though there weren't main characters...more that the team is the main character
The team is the (operative) arm of BCO or Brain Chemistry Optimists

They are the group of individualists fighting against the collectivists to maintain humanity.The team consists of Maggie, Marcus, Karl, Doc, Joan, and Clay
There is a prophecy regarding maintaining world order and each of the members plays a specific role.Maggie is a tough little cookie


She is attacked in her home, saved by someone that seems vaguely familiar, thrust into a future that needs her in order to maintain a certain way of life, and is told she has actually been there before but she has no memory of it


That she is the key to the prophecy is astounding to her


Her role on the team is Executioner.Marcus, whom Maggie was acquainted with in her earlier visit to the future, is a talented Healer
Karl is a Traveler, meaning he can time travel which is handy when moving Maggie around in time
Doc is a Witness and studies the prophecy rigorously as well as maintaining detailed records of BCO's history

Joan and Clay serve the team as Protector and Concealer which are important in protecting the team members during missions.I felt the beginning of the book started of a little slowly but that was mainly due to the world-building going on
Once that was established, the story took off and I had a hard time putting it down


I really enjoyed the science that was incorporated into the story

It was fascinating to read about brain functioning and although some of it is fiction for the story, a lot of it is actual science

I love getting to learn something while reading for fun! :) All the revelations at the end of the book...holy cats! However, I think I ended up with just as many questions as I got answers in those last few chapters! I'm not sure how many books are slated for this series, but I am definitely looking forward to the next installment!

$review_text.: I started this series downloading the first book for free.  When I finished I was so hooked I had to buy book two and three.  This is not my usual genre that I read but sometimes you need to mix it up and I'm glad I chose this one.  Here is what I liked:  1) I was continually left guessing what was going to happen next, trying to find relationships between characters and their stories.  There was very little predictability.  2) I do not like an over abundance of details just to fill pages.  These books tied the necessary details in like a charm and even when they were technical, they only enhanced the story instead of boring me. 3) The writing style fit the fast paced nature of the story.  The only thing I did not like about the story was I felt the ending was slightly rushed and too many questions were left unanswered.  That being said, since this is a series with room left to answer those questions, I will still keep it at a five star giving because I liked the books that much.

$review_text.: I would give this two and a half stars if this site permitted it.I listened to the audio version of Priceless Memories by Bob Barker

 It's billed as a memoir, but it was really just a bunch of rambling memories
 Bob Barker does the narrating and, at first, this worked well on the audio because it was like listening to an old relative reminisce, but I'm not sure it would fare so well in the print version
 He tells of his childhood, his time in the Navy, his marriage to Dorothy Jo and of his experiences on both Truth or Consequences and The Price is Right


 He doesn't have an unkind word for anyone and his love for his mother and his late wife are very apparent


 There really isn't any new information in this book and Bob Barker clearly avoids touching upon any scandalous topics.I enjoyed the beginning of this audio book, but by the end of it, I felt like I was being preached to

 I would estimate that 20 percent of the book covers Barker's stand on animal rights - his reasons for them and his activism in animal rights organizations
 Don't get me wrong - I'm all for animal rights, I just don't think it's necessary to know about every parade he's  marched in and what organizations he chooses to donate money to
 I've always liked Bob Barker, but I've never been what you would call a fan - I think his fans would enjoy this one more than I did.

$review_text.: I'm not going to lie...when I first read the description of this book, I was a little hesitant about whether or not I was going to like it.  But, once I started, I couldn't stop!  I literally stayed up until 4:30 AM to finish it!I know, I know...you're thinking, "SEVEN MEN?!"  But seriously, it's not whacked out or anything.  Once you come to understand why these men are all bound together, and devoted to Linden, it really is actually endearing, not creepy.  I promise. :)When we first meet Linden, she may be scantily clad, but it's all in the name of raising funds for the orchestra hall.  While securing a donation from the man she is dressed to please, a dead man from her past walks through the entrance into the lounge.  He is also a potential donor, and despite the fact that Linden is positive she knows exactly who this man is, he introduces himself with a different name, and a slightly different accent.  He also seems to know that she was married, which she hasn't told anyone.  But he leaves politely enough.  That is, until she heads to the ladies room to settle her nerves...Cyril is angry.  VERY angry.  He can't believe what Linden has done, and on top of that, he can't remember it, so he hasn't a clue how she did it.  What is it she did, you ask?  Well, you'll have to read to find out.  But let's just say, in Cyril's world, what Linden did is a HUGE deal.  But, when he accosts her in the ladies room, he doesn't expect the few answers he gets out of Linden.  And of course, the sexual nature of this restroom meeting serves to confuse them both.One of the things I love about this book is their shared passion for music.  Both Cyril and Linden play/played piano, and Cyril taught Linden an even better appreciation for classical music when she was younger.  Linden's appreciation for music is shown in her job, and even after being 'dead' for ten years, Cyril is still a phenomenal pianist, using the music to draw Linden in one night.This book will keep you on your toes, and guessing until the very end...and past the end, making you NEED to know what happens next!  I was very, very sad leading up to the very end of the novel, but when I got to the last page or two, I was cracking up!  I promise, this book will not disappoint!The characters in this book, and their relationships with one another, are so different from anything else I've read.  They are not only interesting, but they make the reader care about them, and what happens to them.  They care about each other for unexpected, and what seem like forced, reasons, and yet their relationships still feel so honest and real.So, go forth and buy this book!  This is a satisfying read for romance readers, but especially for paranormal readers!  You won't be sorry!

$REVIEW.: John Gilmore is right to say, as he does in &quot;Severed&quot;, that murderers and their victims are linked irreversibly for eternity. Who can think of the Lindbergh baby without remembering Bruno Hauptmann, or ponder the fate of the Princes in the Tower without recalling Richard III?In the same way, murders and the authors who write about them also become connected. Whether it be Anne Rule or Truman Capote, Jonathan Goodman or Max Haines, the crime writer and the crime are linked in the minds of the public by bonds as strong as those that connect the killer and the victim.This is why I feel so badly for the Black Dahlia. John Gilmore has written what has to be the most sloppily written, muddled, confusing crime book I've ever read.Factually, &quot;Severed&quot; is a mess. Gilmore leaves out dates, places, and names, neglects to explain what the setup between the police department and the Hearst papers really is (after reading the book twice, it's still not at all obvious to me), and jumps from date to date with not even the slightest attempt to explain what he is doing. He even brings the dead back to life!Stylistically, it's a disgrace. Gilmore's muddled style is the antithesis of the film noir atmosphere he so desperately wants to convey: his prose is confused, thick and unpleasantly ambiguous without even a whiff of the dangerous sexuality or sharp cold fatalism we expect from noir. Sloppiness is not style, and smog is not atmosphere, and Gilmore is not a noir writer.Some books are so good that you read them over and over. Others are okay, but not compelling enough to read more than once. &quot;Severed&quot; I read twice; once in a vain attempt to figure out what Gilmore was trying to say, and once just to gape, like people do when they pass a car accident. But the tragedy I was gaping at was not the murder itself, but the disgrace Gilmore has brought to the Black Dahlia by this travesty of a book.

$REVIEW.: Hmmm...


Where to start? I obviously love the book
I did give it 5 stars, after all


But, I also hated the book


Well, parts of it anyway


There were a few scenes that were very hard for me to read

There were also a few WTF moments
I like my reviews to be spoiler free, so I won't say what any of those scenes are.But, back to the good
The characters


The way Ana and Elijah go back and forth is hilarious


I love the banter between them


And the best friend, Holly

Love her! She's hilarious! If I had to deal with her in real life, I'd probably throat punch her everyday, lol


And Sammy
Cute little Sammy

So adorable, I just wanted to reach in the book and squeeze his cheeks.So, now I'm off to read Book 2 in the series, Enjoy You Stay

$review_text.: Agatha Christie&#8217;s great puzzle-making mystery talents are very well mirrored in Marilyn Levinson&#8217;s novel Murder a la Christie. While the amount of characters presented in the first few pages gives the reader pause and concern the novel is going to be a bit confusing, Professor Lexie Driscoll who leads the Golden Age Mystery Club is a strong enough character to take the reader by the hand and led them though a puzzle that pulls one way and then another keeping the reader always guessing. Marilyn Levinson set up a good protagonist and an excellent means to continue a series in the traditions of what mystery writing and reading is all about. I look forward to other books to come.This review can also be read in lecouerdeartiste.com

$REVIEW.: The author Mark Hyman appears to be a knowledgeable physician. He has put together a system for achieving wellness and healing from the adverse effects of stress and fatigue. In this 2-CD set Hyman gives a good overview of how the mind body system works and how it is overwhelmed with various stressors and overstimulation. He then offers tips and examples for how we can de-stress and activate our healing potential. This includes shifting our diet, using natural supplements, exercising, getting adequate sleep, meditating, managing our breath(much like meditations), and shifting our thinking and attitudes. Dr. Hyman has created an easy-to understand recording that includes exercises which anyone can apply to improve their mental and physical health. This is highly recommended for those looking to learn ways to reduce stress and restore their health without drugs. Author also has some videos that go along with the program. I think you can find them on PBS for free.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed reading this e-book. i found the characters to be well rounded,with accents to match in some cases which if you have any imagination; helped the book to come to life as you read it.The descriptions were vivid, well structured and worked well with the settings of the book.  It was great to be swept up in the story, carried along and teased by the turns and twists the author put us through. I was kept wondering what the scrap metal connection was untill well into the book, and i won,t spoil it for readers by saying here, but it works and thats what matters in the end. i would reccomend the book if you all interested in reading a book that takes you out of the cities, and into the country side, where believe it or not gay excitement is to found alive and well.Daniel S.A.

$REVIEW.: Well, first of all I`d say that I`m not disappointed as some folks here must have been. The story is good, better than the original adaptation by Thomas/Smith, with lots of suspense and intrigue, and the art team really stands out as one of the best in the series. Giorello work is up to Cary`s standard (just check out Giorello`s apes, awesome!).The only gripe I have concerns the colors that do not look as good as Dave Stewart`s, but they convey a mood of terror and darkness that adds to the story anyway.The last chapter of the book is one of the best in the whole series, the fighting scenes are superb!To sum up things, I`d say buy this book, it is really worth reading.

Notable exceptions to "the whole truth" are two in number: 1) Blaming Clinton for Bush Lite and Cheney's deliberate refusal to act on nine months of warnings from the FBI, CIA, and twenty-seven friendly countries concerning the coming attack on the twin towers.2)Ending the Saudi's stranglehold on Mecca and Medina by turning them into International Cities to be presided over by a consortium of Moslem Nations.

Brian Jud's &quot;Beyond The Bookstore&quot; does an excellent job of describing these markets. But he doesn't stop there. Brian explains exactly how to break into special markets and provides detailed, useful contact information.Ever wonder how to sell your book directly to libraries? On page 159, Brian points out there are at least 117,418 libraries (including public, academic, and school) across the United States. In the pages that follow, he explains exactly how to market to libraries, and he includes contact information for library wholesalers you may want to work with. He ends this section with a true story of an author's successful library book tour.In addition to explaining how to approach places like Target &amp; Safeway, airport shops &amp; museum stores, Brian gives practical pointers on everything from promoting perpetually to getting book reviews.A valuable resource which I'm benefitting from immensely in my ever-growing search for new markets for my book. I highly recommend this book to every author. Don't limit yourself -- think outside the box!

$REVIEW.: You can't help who you fall in love with...Oh Karina Halle, how I do love thee. In English. in Spanish. In any language.Diverting from her normal genre of paranormal ghost hunters, the Jacobs, devious drug dealers, and con artists, Halle delivers a love story to end all love stories. Seriously people. It's just awesome. I've mentioned on my blog posts that when I read a good book, I feel it. Every emotion. Damn you Karina Halle for making me feel everything here! Damn you to the stars and back!! Not really, I love you to the ends of the universe!Here's the story, minus spoilers. Well, as many as possible.Vera Miles, a 23-year old astronomy student with tattoos of constellations, wild strawberry-blonde curls, and a spitfire attitude to match, travels to Spain to teach conversational English to Spanish businessmen/women. She doesn't know what she's looking for, only that it's an adventure and something better than what she has at home in Vancouver and figures the month-long experience can enlighten her."Sometimes you are stuck being the person you are, and not the person you were. Or could be" - Mateo.While in Spain, she meets Mateo, a former football (Soccer, since it's Euro) star who is brushing up on his English to help his restaurant business. Mateo is gorgeous. And he's married. And he has a daughter.The two develop a friendship that grows deeper. The friendly banter turns to flirtation. Light flirtation turns into real feelings. A question a day provides soulful insight into each character. While everyone around them can see what is happening between them, they deny it. Or at least Vera does."The thing was, I didn't do love. I didn't have time to put up with complicated relationships or put my heart and soul out there for someone to step on. Love was scarier than deep space." - VeraCynical. But with good reason. She's seen first hand how love can crush a person. A family. How it changes people. She's not having any part in that! Despite conversations with her friend Claudia, she doesn't believe that she can love someone she's only known a week. Ah Claudia. We all need a friend like her - hopeful, insightful, funny."You can fall in love in a second...the heart has no regard for time" - Claudia.By the end of their time, they both realize two things. One, neither one is quite happy with their current life. Two, yes, they do love each other and need each other to really live."I cannot imagine going back to the life I had before because that was no life at all. That was just existing. That was just chasing down the next day so I could feel it pass under me. You made me stop chasing the days. You made me hold onto them." - MateoOf course, any good story doesn't end there. They must part ways, Vera returning to Vancouver. Mateo staying in Spain.Then, each makes a decision that will change their lives forever. No, I'm not telling you what it is -- read the book!Bottom line, the book has just enough build up that you're not bored waiting for something to happen. Just enough angst that you're not left feeling like you want to hurl the Kindle at the wall. Just enough romance that it's not over the top sappy. It's progressive. It covers a span of time. It's emotional. It's real.Go. Read. Now. I know I say this about many books, but really, just do it. I won't steer you off a cliff. This is a stand-alone, so no cliffhangers, no waiting for the next installment. When you finish, you've taken the same journey and reached the same ending as the characters. Just as it should be.

$REVIEW.: Pamela and Roger divorced two years previously.  Now Pamela has come to Madame Evangeline's 1 Night Stand service to fulfill her Pirates of the Caribbean fantasy.  The last person she expected to run into was her ex.  He also is trying to fulfill his fantasy but it looks like they are stuck with each other since neither's dates show up.  Pamela never expects Roger to have changed so much in those two years in Jenna Jaxon's ALMOST PERFECT.I liked Pamela and Roger.  Both have a lot of baggage they have to clear up with each other.  Since they are stuck with each other they have time to talk.  Of course, they also have time for other things.  It was when the other things happen that they forget their past and move forward.  I enjoyed that aspect of the story--moving forward.  When danger threatens that is when their feelings come out.  I like how danger works for them.  ALMOST PERFECT is a good read with a little bit of everything.

I was introduced to Judge Napolitano via Fox News Channel, specifically, The Glen Beck Program.  I was impressed with Judge Napolitano depth of analysis as he explained and expound on race relations in America.  Throughout my reading of this book, there was several times, I had to pause and reflect on what I read in amazement.  As a thirty year old African American male, there is a lot that I am not aware when it comes to slavery and America's role.  This book provided me with so much clarity and understanding on what happened, how it happened, and why.  Judge Napolitano holistically approaches slavery and America's responsibility from the beginning of slavery through the defeat of Jim Crow.  I highly recommend this book to all who seek to understand slavery and the government's role with slavery.

$review_text.: Chanelle Gray has written a very different and very unique novel that I have fell deeply in love with


I connected deeply with the main character, Amerie


She was strong and didn't back down for nothing and nobody
She stayed strong through it all

After her mother had past away a year ago, her life is nothing as it used to be, and she is stronger than ever
She really has no choice
The only thing different now, is that she has decided to no longer hunt
I can't say that I don't blame her

I couldn't help but wonder if her mother would want her to continue even if it is what killed her


It's what they are meant to do
The Sisterhood will come for her eventually
The Sisterhood watches over all the hunters

Amerie is meant to kill the Damned

She isn't just some ordinary girl


Though, she plays it off well to everyone around her.It's when a stranger enters Amerie's life and insists that he needs her attention that things start changing over time


Marshall is determined to get her to like him and I must admit that he won me over long before Amerie fell for him


She has some great friends looking out for her too, but in Amerie's case it just complicates things even more
The Damned start coming after her
She is supposed to attack them, not her

Furthermore, she lives with her father and brother and can't live anything close to a normal life whatsoever anymore
She has a great set of friends, and an even better set of skills
It's the secrets that are tucked away that'll blow everyone away.The ending not only surprised be, but left my jaw stuck on the floor

There's so much action, so much excitement! A very busy read that'll leave you highly entertained.

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by Guest Reviewer/Jennifer & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog"Readers get to see how perfect a connection between Dom and sub can be." ~Under the CoversThe fourth installment in Michele Zurlo's Oasis series is a full-length, developed tale
 Her previous stories in the series give an introduction to the world of Oasis, a wish-fulfillment business that caters to granting the perfect fantasy


 Lydia is the new wish-coordinator at Oasis


 She's a focused, professional woman with a past...an encounter with a man she's never been able to overcome


 He is the Dom that she's longed for ever since, that's left her always wanting more
 How can Lydia be in the business of fulfilling wishes when she's clearly so unfulfilled herself?  The management of Oasis requires her to make a wish of her own


 She wants to sub to a Dom, experience submission to its fullest extent


 But without emotional attachment


 Little does she know how deep she will fall.Wilder Burke, son of the founders of Oasis, has been assigned to grant Lydia's wish

 He also happens to be the Dom Lydia connected with eight years earlier
When they both agree to embark on this journey together, the pull between them is unmistakable and readers get to see how perfect a connection between Dom and sub can be.Having read all of the previous installments in the Oasis series as well as Re/bound (one of my favorites!), I was very excited to see Wanting Wilder as a full-length story
 The concept of wish-fulfillment in a BSDM erotic romance can be a bit clich&eacute;, so I was pleased that this tale transcended the stereotype by capturing very authentic and complex emotions
 It's easy to understand Lydia's motivations and fears


 Wilder comes on strong and makes those of us who are submissive at heart just melt


 Or catch fire


 The scenes that play out are hot and leave you wanting more and more, with scenes of BDSM that range from bondage to flogging and more
 There's nothing too edgy for those that aren't lovers of heavy BDSM


 This is more about the emotional and psychological journey of two characters, played out through realistic scenes and dynamic communication


 The dialog between the characters is so authentic and spot on


 I find that to be one of Zurlo's strong suits and makes reading her stories very effortless
 There's a lot of room for this series to grow and I'm looking forward to the next installment.*Review copy provided by publisher

The language at times was rough, even for me and I can definitely see some people having an issue with the violence and language.

$review_text.: This is book 3 in the 4 part series, and it finds that Jesca has lost her father and Nate, and finds that they trapped beyond the veil.  Jesca and Xander come together, and Jesca is determined to find a way to ascend the veil to save her father, and her link.  Not going to tell you if she succeeds, or what happens, as I don't want to spoil the book.  I will say, in true fashion, there are a lot of twists and turns.  As soon as I thought I knew where the story was going, Ms. Kimball twisted it, and I found myself going in a completely different direction.  It was amazing!Without giving the story away, Jesca has really grown up, and grown into herself as an adult and as a guardian.  I feel she really shines in this book.  She made decisions, and moved forward, without questioning herself.  It was wonderful to see her so secure in herself, her abilities and not questioning her capabilities.I enjoyed getting to dig deeper into the minds of the cast.  I felt that Ms. Kimball did an outstanding job in developing all the characters in the story.  I am excited and can not WAIT until the the last book in the series is released to find out the final answers to questions I've had throughout the series.The storytelling was excellent, and I loved the POV shifts, and appreciated that it was always clear.  The scientific concepts were well researched, and explained very well, without feeling like I was sitting in a boring classroom.  Ms. Kimball is certainly a gifted storyteller.

$review_text.: The VAMPIRE EMPIRE series is an interesting combination of almost-steampunk, alternative history and fantasy all wrapped together. Clay and Susan Griffith have used a solid mixture of adventure, intrigue and world building to create a vibrant tapestry as the background for the story. In The Kingmakers all of this grows more and more intense as war rages and the battle for the survival of two different races grows more desperate.Adele, now Empress of Equitoria, has unleashed her armies on the European continent despite the setbacks in the seasons and the loss of some of her more important weapons of war. Gareth, in his Greyfriar persona, is in the midst of the fight and doing his part to help the humans drive the Vampires back from the South of France. The weather, which favors the vampires, has not helped and things are growing more and more desperate for Adele's trusted retainer Anhalt, the commander of the Equitorian Forces.Clay and Susan Griffith have done a really good job of creating a flow of events that seems natural. Adele and Gareth have been given clear choices about what they can do to control their lives. The challenge going forward is that now that Adele is Empress, the rash, often foolhardy choices she made are unacceptable. This makes for interesting considerations because some risks, in spite of her authority and power as the monarch, are simply too great to be undertaken.Senator Clark, Adele's jilted former intended, wages war on the North American continent with his typical disdain for the ethical constraints that would impair his ability to succeed. Truly, for him, the ends justify the means and if a few innocent lives are lost in his path to glory, that is an acceptable price to pay. The underpinnings of his massive egotism are never discussed, but I was left wondering what trauma or neglect he might have endured to be so wrapped in his lust for glory and power that he can brook no argument. The phrase "if you are not with me, you are against me" resonates in my head when I think of Clark.The Kingmakers is a worthwhile addition to the VAMPIRE EARTH series. The story is fraught with danger, intrigue and a romance between two people who have no business being together -- though, to be honest, the relationship between Adele and Gareth began to be almost cloyingly sweet in this book. There are some arguments for political and social constraints that are being set aside as superfluous that to me don't stand the common sense test. Setting that annoyance aside, the themes of loyalty, revenge, greed and obsession are writ large and make the story something exceptional. To what lengths would a man go to avenge the slaughter of a dearly loved child and spouse at the hands of a predatory race that preys on his own? That's one question among many that permeate this novel and make The Kingmakers profoundly good despite some logical flaws.

$review_text.: I wasn't sure about this book. I mean, it's about werewolves and fantasy, which is a surefire way to gain my attention, but the cover really didn't appeal to me and I wasn't so sure about the plot. But the beginning definitely caught my attention and it remained caught from there.Chloe is an independent and bull-headed woman who can sometimes have crazy outbursts that make no sense. But she's strong and tries to help in any way possible.Sometimes I felt like Chloe would make a scene out of nothing, especially in one occasion when Zane tried to pay the bill and Chloe went off on a rant about how he thought her incapable of paying and whatnot. I really, really wanted to slap her in the face and tell her that she was being irrational, especially when Zane was only trying to help and be nice.Zane is an alpha male type, and he's a sexy one at that. It's obvious that he likes Chloe and tries to protect her, though that doesn't always work out well.The writing style of the author was a bit strange, and sometimes threw me off. There were flashbacks in the middle of a rant and it cut off my train of thought. There were pauses in the writing and sentence structure wasn't the best. It was a little confusing and would make me pause, but the plot of the story (and my curiosity of what was going to happen) kept me going.There were some things in the story where I felt like things occurred too quickly or too abruptly, but it wasn't much and it went with the story.And the cliffhanger. What a cliffhanger! It definitely left me curious about what was going to happen in the next book in the series!I recommend this book to people who like fantasy and werewolves, and lots and lots of drama.

Your heart will be broken as they share their common-ground stories of how they learned to give to those whom life has thrown away...and in doing so...give to the King!  I have spent three years trying to help a young homeless woman with mulitple personalities...facing criticism from every front--including my family and my church.  Alene and Rick have encouraged me to see my friend through the eyes of Jesus-not of the world.  The smoldering wick is once again a blazing fire of passion for all those who need hope through the hands and feet of Jesus!  "I am only one, but still I am one.  I cannot do everything, but still I can do something." ~Helen Keller  "Grafitti" is a MUST READ!  Someone is waiting for your touch...

$REVIEW.: Caitlin O'Conner is a sixteen year old Junior in highschool. Her best friend is Beanie, and other than her dad being really strict, and hanging out at work a lot more than usual, everything is fine. But then she becomes friends with a cheerleader, Jenny, and starts being included in the in-crowd. That totally destroys her friendship with Beanie, but things in the in-crowd aren't all that great either.Caitlin finds that she has to behave a certain way or she'd be kicked out, and since now that she's in she wants to stay in, she tries to toe the line. But then some of the popular boys start noticing her, life at home starts falling apart, and well, for that matter, so does everything else...All I can say is - oh the drama! My word, it makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore! And that my sixteen daughter is homeschooled. I really don't think I could handle this in person even second hand. Caitlyn is a very self-centered young lady, but she does grow and mature a whole lot in this book, which is good. And there are a LOT of valuable lessons included in it, such as teenage sex, drinking, etc.I recommend this book to teenagers (and their parents and suggest they talk about it afterwards, such as why... and why not... topics. Ms. Carlson is really a very talented author and she can really write the ups and downs of being a teenager super well.

Or will time help you heal from the guilt you feel about your  past. These are some of the questions Sarah and Tony have to face in the book and what a ride it is but oh so worth the wait for the HEA.The Blurb pretty much tells you what you need but throw in a sassy mouthed women who was patient as anything with Tony and never gave up on him. Then add a guilt ridden sexy ass Cowboy who caused most of the angst  in this book and a few times I wanted to slap him up the head and tell him to just love her. And just enjoy the pleasure in Tony and Sarah finding each other enjoying each other and finally just letting go.

There weren't any boring parts of this book and I really didn't want to put it down.The hero in this book was enjoyable to follow and his development was fairly good.  I say fairly because his first character change seemed slightly contrived but otherwise it progressed quite well.The world building in this book was very good and everything seems to fit together and is believable.

$review_text.: What could be simpler than a nurse and doctor falling in love?  Well in this case it's complicated.While this book can be read as a stand alone novel, it is best read following the Her Two Billionaire's Series and Random Acts of Kindness.  It's Complicated is the glue that pulls it all together.To make love a bit less complicated one must follow the following rules:1.  Start with a nurse determined to avoid commitments at all cost.2.  Add in a doctor head over heals for the nurse, and who doesn't know what to do about it.3.  Throw in two separate menage triads4.  Create chaos at work and changing careersSomehow it all comes together to create a beautiful love story.  Julia Kent has the ability to take (somewhat) everyday people, put them in the strangest situations, and make us (the reader) fall in love with falling in love all over again.This is a long book, but well worth the time to read it.  Grab your kindle, get comfortable, you won't be able to put it down.  I can't wait to read what happens next.Note:  This review is based on an ARC provided by the Author for free for review purposes.

$review_text.: Yes, there are a few great quotes by Pope Francis in here. But honestly, Pope Francis has not spent his life writing books. He has written little, yet done much. I think a book like this should have waited for the new Pope to publish several encyclicals and speak publicly more. A lot of the quotes are from old translated interviews and are somewhat out of context. Plus the commentary did the same ole "Francis V.s. Benedict" thing. Probably better to watch Francis do his job as pope rather than read this.

We start out with Prescott (Pres) who is a wonderful and famous chef, he suffers through a very traumatic event that leaves him without his sight. After wallowing in self pity for a while, he is reminded of his love of cooking and with his newly found extra senses he begins to live his life again. His professional life is great, where his love life is lacking.Pres meets his neighbor Rickson (Ric) his feelings of being wanted for being him and not a disabled person start to surface, while never being in a true relationship with a man, Pres is starting to feel as if the &#34;what&#34; doesn't matter compared to the &#34;who&#34;. A practical joke gone wrong and not communicating with one another causes the new couple to break apart. While wallowing in his own self pity Pres calls an escort service for a little companionship, Blair is just the person Pres feels he can talk to.When Ric decides he is done pushing the man he loves away, he now feels as if he has to fight Blair for the attention of Pres. Pres and Blair have other ideas in mind for Ric. The 3 men must work together to figure out how their relationship will work, and sometimes staying in a relationship takes as much work as it takes to start one.While this love story is taboo in society, it is still a very well written and enduring love story of 3 very strong and stubborn men who find what they are missing in their own lives, with each other.I look forward to reading more works by this author. I received and ARC for an honest review

$REVIEW.: Justice is Rebecca Royce's fifth book in her Warrior series. The Warrior series is a young adult series featuring the same heroine in each book. A person should read each book in order to understand and fully enjoy the on-going story but I will say this is the first book I have read in the series and I had no problem understanding and enjoying this book. Rebecca does a great job of summarizing past events so it is possible to read this book as a stand alone book.Justice is set in a futuristic society where vampires & werewolves are a constant menace and groups of people have banded together to survive. In this final installment of the series, Rachel Clancy finally gets her chance to serve &#34;justice&#34; to the evil Dr. Icahn.I really enjoyed this book. I kind of felt like I was reading a &#34;t.v. series&#34; from a network channel, which is a good thing in my opinion. Definitely recommend!I was given an arc copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
$SUMMARY.: Great YA series!

$review_text.: I have been a Bond fan for years both novels and films. This book is a collection of the Bond comic strips that were in the papaers in England from the 60s into the 80s. They are brief well drawn stories based on Ian Fleming's novels. I found them well done and an easy but fun read. The book is a graphic novel and I believe most Bond fans well enjoy looking at the strips and reading the book.

$review_text.: Nouriel Roubini is the rare economist who, in the midst of a speculative bubble, accurately warned that the financial crisis of 2008 was coming. His bona fides established - and his "Dr. Doom" nickname well earned - Roubini and economics professor Stephen Mihm offer an insightful, entertaining look at the history and future of crashes. Get ready, Roubini warns: After a period of relative calm after the 1930s Great Depression, financial markets are in for a wild ride. He expects financial crashes to continue and offers advice for mitigating the damage, such as restructuring Wall Street bonuses and reining in big banks, although you may suspect that his recommendations will go unheeded. getAbstract recommends this book to investors and business leaders seeking a deeper understanding of the markets' gyrations.

$REVIEW.: Who doesn't like vampires? If you don't, lose my number...we can't be friends anymore. :)This book included five short vampire m/m erotica stories. Very short, but very hot. About as hot as Eric Northman sitting on a Swedish mountain in the sun...and then bursting into flames hot!If I said picking a favorite is like picking a favorite child, I'd be lying. I know which child is my fav... I liked them in this order:Story 1: Natural Adaption - Why did it have to end so soon! I about killed over when the story ended. I would love to see this turned into a longer novel (even a novella).Story 3: An Executioner's Absolution - Would also like to see a longer version of this.Story 5: The CatchStory 4: Mile High - Clubs are awesome :)Story 2: Master AviatorI received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review through the DBML program in the M/M Romance group.

$REVIEW.: SPEECHLESS!!! Don't be fooled by the title

Powder, is very well written


You feel bad for Samantha from the very beginning until she meets Shaunie (NeNe) who lets her know she has to stand up for herself


She becomes stronger and has a new identity as Powder

BlaQue takes you on a journey with Powder, Marshall, NeNe, Rashun,Adekite, Katavious, Tieriek,and Marshall's mom and what a rollercoaster ride

Great anticipation of what's going to happen next and when you think you know, you're totally wrong
Powder is so different from the usual urban fiction and I loved it

Towards the end of the book Powder found what she really had been looking for her whole life LOVE(someone to love her for her)
Didn't want it to end the way it did, but KARMA is a B****!!! Great 5 ***** read and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!

The frightened her at first because they were Feds and very big men.  She felt for them but did not know how to channel her feelings for them.  What started out as play ended with a beautiful relationship.  I love this series very much and recommend you read them in sequence.  This book is about emotional issues and conquering them, love in all aspects between all three individuals, honesty, intensity and perseverance.  The outcome is great.  I so hope there is another installment to extend to Uziri's finding her Dom.  Thank you ma'am for such fantastic reading.

$REVIEW.: If you really enjoy a book that's filled with warmth, laughter, romance, and heroines that won't quit, then Sugar Jamison is the author for you

I fell in love with her A Perfect Fit series from the moment that I began reading the first book,Dangerous Curves Ahead: A Perfect Fit Novel


So I was really happy to note that among the many authors offering special books for the holidays, she too had a new A Perfect Fit installment for her readers, Have Yourself a Curvy Little Christmas: A Perfect Fit Holiday Novella

I recently received a copy from her publisher and just have to say to you all right upfront, you should be downloading these books to your e-readers immediately as they are that good.In Have Yourself a Curvy Little Christmas, the story picks up a year after the last chapter of Dangerous Curves Ahead


Ellis' sister Dina (who was the one I think everyone loved to hate) is now a single mom who's travelled cross country via bus to track down the wealthy father of her son
She's not looking for anything beyond social security benefits, so right there we know that this gal has changed.In addition, the former stick thin dancer now has some curves herself post pregnancy - and seems rather happy with her body


So, former detractors you need to take a real look at Dina, because she's a rather fabulous work-in-progress.Jamison's novels are laugh-out-loud funny yet at the same time incredibly poignant as they do offer plus size girls realistic heroines, who not only struggle with their body self-perceptions, but also acceptance in society
I totally bonded in the first book with Ellis, but have to say that Dina struck a real chord with me as well
This former wild-child has to go against everyone's preconceptions, including her ex's brother Ben, whom she's attracted to


Not for her figure, but for her ability to remain steady and be a good mother.I won't spoil the story, but just advise that if you want a funny, heart-warming, romantic, and yes, sexy holiday read - this is the book for you


It could be a stand-alone novella, but once you've read one of Jamison's books, you'll want to read them all


So I'd recommend buying both and having yourself A Perfect Fit all-night read party.The next book in the series,Thrown for a Curve: A Perfect Fit Novel, is scheduled to be released in February


I'll be marking my calendar and bet you will too


So five stars for this fabulous holiday read from Sugar Jamison.Fab Fantasy Fiction[...]

$REVIEW.: I was very impressed by this book.  Franz Bardon lays out a step by step, easy-to-understand series of exercises with which to train the mind, body, and spirit for magical work.  It's so practical and straightforward; this book makes it look .. well, not exactly EASY, but it definitely puts highly advanced abilities reasonably within the reach of a diligent, patient, and motivated student.  Of course it may take years to reach your goal (and the author admits that) but this book's calm, methodical approach makes it all seem very POSSIBLE.This style of magic has been divested of almost all religious, mythical, and mystical trappings.  There are no arcane symbols or mystical words, no lengthy tables of correspondences to memorize.  To anyone who has studied "magick" based on the medeival traditions, Bardon's system may feel sterile and empty; just like modern architecture, it lacks all the decorative touches that make the traditionalist feel comfortable.  But fret not:  A touch of old-fashioned mythology is re-introduced at the end, in Step X.  Along the way, Bardon says that the student will discover much information on his own as he advances, and will make use of rituals and symbols that are either revealed to (or created by) him.  These things will be highly personal once obtained; the book tells how to go about finding them, and explains why they should be kept secret.The first chapter deals with magical theory; things the student "ought to know" before starting any exercises.  This chapter is full of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo about electromagnetic fluids and what-not, which will be daunting to first-time readers.  I was dismayed by it, thinking "This is no better than any other magic book I've read!" but after reading the rest of the book, the theoretical chapter makes sense.  I think it must have been designed as a filter, to discourage the idly curious from reading any further.My only quibble is with the occasional Biblical references, which show a distinct unfamiliarity on the part of either Franz Bardon or the translators.  None of the quotations were correct, though usually they got the gist of it right.  However, on page 27 a serious error:  The first words in the Bible are not "Let there be light."  Those are the first words SPOKEN, but heaven and earth are created ("without form and void") in verse 1 and 2.  Earth is the first mentioned element, followed by water.  Light is not created until verse 3.That one slip-up wasn't worth removing a star.  I have to give _Initiation into Hermetics_ a full 5 because it's the most coherent and practically useful course of magical instruction I have ever seen.  Definitely a "must read" for anyone interested in the theory or practice of modern magick.

$review_text.: This "mystery" was a treatise on feminism, even distinguishing between plain feminism and Marxist feminism. The indentation of the "textbook" quotes made the novel seem terribly, terribly long. I frankly didn't mind the refresher course, but I did mind the long, tortuous path to the solution of who was killing the "swans." Everybody became a suspect, including the woman with whom Inspector David McClennan was falling in love. Back and forth, back and forth the investigative team would go, and meanwhile we would see the several students asking themselves questions about one another. There was suspense as the bodies piled up and fears became monumental. The author employed rumor, secret-sharing,and lack of communication as plot-twisting tools. Ms Greaves is a very clever writer, and a clear writer. She also was careful to describe the layout of the campus, the location of rooms, the use of doors, but she doesn't provide much in the way of English atmosphere; to the contrary,the ordinariness of the town was almost depressing. Too depressing to go on for 36 chapters. John Waddington-Feather, for example, also writing about the North and about contemporary problems, stops to smell the roses.The Graveyard Mystery (Blake Hartley Detective Novels)

The second book has some paranormal in it (warewolves), but is enjoyable none the less.

$REVIEW.: In reading parenting books, you rarely find one you'll agree with 100%. The trick really is to take the good and leave the bad. The book is a good book if the good outweighs the bad. Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves did contain quite a bit of good. However, it also contained, in my opinion, an awful lot of bad.I'll start with the good this book had to offer. It is true that far too many people do not view children as people. Our society tends to place them somewhere around a well loved pet, not a fully formed person. For some reason, the trend has remained that magically at 18 a child becomes a person, capable of having their own opinions only at that magic point. However, that isn't as it should be. This book offers great perspective on treating children as persons, equal persons. Considering their needs and desires as you would the needs and desires of any other person in your life. I wish that message could be sung from the rooftops. Respect children! Treat them like people!"Many small events... don't require solutions even if the child reacts with tears or rage." (p.100) What a great point! I don't have to rescue my child simply because they are upset. If I'm there, that is all that the child needs. It is not my job, place, or duty to "fix" everything for my child, even if they react negatively. I think that many parents fail to see the value in letting a child be mad and not trying to "fix" them being mad. This book was great at pointing out that children should be free to express all emotion, even negative emotion, and there isn't something you need to do in letting them express their emotions other than simply listen. "We cannot stop the rain for out children and it wouldn't be good for them if we could." (p.145)I also found many of her communication techniques to work wonders. Simply listening and validating my children has been a big game changer around here. I am listening, I am there for them, but their feelings are their own. I feel that they've been owning their lives more and relying on me a bit less to provide them their happiness or solutions to their negative emotional state. I've noticed a particularly evident change in my older daughter (she's 6) that she feels more "at home" expressing herself these days, good or bad, and she doesn't blame others for her feelings so much. She's also gotten much better at her problem solving skills since I'm not jumping in with suggestions every time she encounters another child who doesn't want to play with her or some other disappointment.So, there is a great amount of good that can come from this book if you have the particular ability to take the good and leave the bad. If you are one that fixates on what is wrong with a book, then this may not be the book for you.Most of the personal stories given in the book seem outright fake. The interactions between parent and child or counselor and parent just don't feel real to me. Perhaps much was condensed so that the point was easily displayed, but the stories just didn't sit right with me.I often felt Naomi Aldort went too far. That she had a good point and I was with her, until she went too much to the extreme and threw the point off a cliff. It seemed many of her points went from me nodding in agreement to saying, "Whoa Naomi! Too far. Too far!" I feel like I took her basic points and then had to throw the rest out of my head.I felt like she was asking the impossible at times. I get that "power games" (where a child empties the garbage over and over while you pick it up while play acting that is is a big deal, but not trying to stop the child) can be a good tool for kids who are feeling a bit helpless, I just don't have the time or the energy to play anytime my kids says to. I cannot possibly come up with the energy to chase my 3 year old around every evening at bedtime so he can feel powerful. Often I just don't have the time for a game of throw the sippy cup on the floor. There were multiple point like that that could make a parent feel like a big, fat failure because they just can't do that today or right now.Dr. Aldort and I also disagree on expectations. I know that my living room being relatively clean is my goal. Dr. Aldort feels that as such, it is my responsibility to keep it that way and should my child trash it, I can verbalize my wish that it be clean, but I cannot expect them to help clean it. In my world, family just doesn't work that way. We all have to pitch in and do what helps the whole. There are many goals that my children have that I help meet. Likewise, I expect their participation and cooperation with some of my goals. I don't expect them to steam clean the carpet or keep all the toys on the shelves at all times. I do expect that they pick up their own things when they are done with them and that they pitch in on family cleaning day for the good of all. Mom is not a slave. Community works when everyone works for all, not just when they personally see benefit.I was also very confused when Dr. Aldort told me I should not praise my children. She seems to believe scolding nor praise should take place. Everything should be matter of fact and avoid trying to steer them on way or another. I want praise when I accomplish difficult things. I anticipate my children wanting the same. I think this is just one instance of Dr. Aldort throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Some people use praise to coerce their children toward certain things. So, no one should praise their children. I think that is very short sighted. I think praising a child in the things the child is proud of or does well is a good thing. And I can't imagine stopping myself from telling my daughter the picture she spent hours making is lovely because I don't want my daughter to think I only want her making such pictures. That's just silly.So, if you can leave the bad and take the good, read this book- it will do you good. If you are one that fixates on the bad- avoid this book, you'll hate it. If you are a slightly insecure sort of parent who easily feels they fall short of expectations- avoid this book, it'll make you feel worse. If you can read her expectations and feel they are silly and not feel personally assaulted- the good in this book could outweigh the bad for you.

$REVIEW.: W. Somerset Maugham is one of my favorite authors and I find his writing to be always insightful and interesting. The Hero is far from being one of his masterworks and yet there are passages in it that are just so stunning in the way he is able to capture a person's essence and reflect their inner life that forshadow how some of his later more complex novels are structured. As a playwright first and a novelist second Maugham has a unique feel for the dramatic confrontation and that quality is reflected throughout this book.A decorated veteran of the Boer War returns to his small town in England to his family and his fiance only to find he has changed in his attitude toward them through his experiences overseas. He struggles to reconcile his feelings and actions with tragic results. The plot is excellent, the tension is palpable and the characterizations are typical Maugham. For those who like me can't get enough of his writing this is a fine selection. If you are new to his writing I wouldn't start here but read one of his better known works first.Overall I found this relatively short work by an author I revere to be exactly what I would expect from him.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely LOVE this series!  The characters in this book and the story are the type that keep you thinking about them (it) long after you are finished reading.  I felt like I was part of this story and not just reading it.Sometimes second books get drawn out and boring; this is definitely not the case with Pulse!  Emily and Gavin's relationship is so loving and sexy (I have goose bumps now just thinking about it).  I cried at a few points in this book; really CRIED.  My husband couldn't figure out what was wrong with me - haha.  This book takes you through many emotions and it definitely does not disappoint.Kellan Kyle, Colton Donovan and Gideon Cross might be my book boyfriends, but Gavin Blake is my book husband!  I want to have a bunch of book babies with him and I want to live in our beautiful book home!

$review_text.: A Balanced, Biblical Look At The Holy Spirit&#8217;s Work In Our Lives (the subtitle) As with a lot of books I review, the subtitle more appropriately tells the subject of the book compared to its title. Especially those two words&#8212;balanced and biblical. Those are two of the best words to describe this book. It is balanced by presenting many sides to each argument. It is balanced by talking about the Spirit and the truth. It is biblical with its many verses cited (that did not seem out of context to me). It is biblical in the way he greatly encourages personal regular Bible reading and prayer.This book is also thorough. No topic related to the main idea has been left out. He talks both about  the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the fruits, about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and about cessationism. He also thoroughly discusses every Bible verse related to actual fire, too.This book is also controversial, in that, not every one will agree with everything that Mr. Kendall has written here. There will be dissenters on both sides of the fence. The author tries to tread lightly but actually steps on toes from both sides of some of the issues discussed.  No need to take things personally though as this author does not &#8220;name names&#8221;. He talks mainly about doctrine and reveals actions but never people&#8217;s names.Throughout I did not feel like Mr. Kendall&#8217;s opinions were presented in a bigoted or arrogant way. On the contrary, he was very humble, even revealing times in his life where he was wrong and had to change his mind about some belief related to the Holy Spirit. He also on several occasions admits to not knowing the answers and asking, &#8220;you tell me&#8221;.Mr. Kendall&#8217;s reasoning was easy to follow and he mixed things up by adding in relevant personal stories, scriptures and quotes and stories from other respected Christian leaders.He concludes with, &#8220;We must pray for the fire of God to fall on us today. But we  must equally be faithful to teach the fear of God to be instilled in us today.&#8221; (page 191)I am hard pressed to think of any Christian who can not benefit from reading this book. Even if you know you believe very similar doctrine to Mr. Kendall&#8217;s, there will be explanations that you could use to help explain these issues to others. And to cessationists, please, please, buy your own copy of this book!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Charisma House Publishers through their blogging for books program.

With this book, I was able to get more inspired in writing and keeping a journal with me and at the same time, I'm all the more motivated to keep a daily diary to bring with me anywhere and take down anything I feel like expressing to anytime. Moreover, it has also helped me in my stress management, guiding me in properly handling any negativity in life through journaling approaches.

$review_text.: I'm always on the lookout for a new urban fantasy author, and this novel by Justin Gustainis seemed to have an interesting premise and solid characters

The plot moved quickly and kept me interested enough to read it through in a day or two, but in the end I felt like I still didn't know much about the main characters


There are some books that draw you in with unique, charismatic people that you just can't wait to read more about
That's how I felt about the Harry Dresden series by Jim Butcher, I was hooked from the very first novel because I loved the characters
This book just didn't have that draw


Quincy Morris had a fascinating background, but the man himself just wasn't very interesting

I'm writing this review a few weeks after I read the book, and I don't even remember the name of the detective, Van something or other, because he was equally uninteresting
There was very little in the way of character development, which I'm hoping will be corrected in any future novels

I will probably pick up the second one in a library somewhere, but it's not something I have to have as soon as it comes out like other series I could name.

$review_text.: Oh my! This was such a sweet and fun romance! I absolutely loved this
Rachel Harris is amazing at writing swoony love stories, and this was one of my favorites

Very low drama, very sweet, and very entertaining
Sherry and Tyler's story took me away on a whirl-wind romance that I didn't want to step out of


Both were amazing characters that I easily connected with and I enjoyed being in their heads
Most stories like this have some type of major drama that is usually a stupid misunderstanding before the HEA comes, but this one didn't have that
Yes, things weren't totally smooth, but there was no fallout that makes things crazy
(or crazier) I loved that the most about this.Sherry is a character that I instantly liked

We meet her in the previous books, but don't really get to know her


We already knew she was a little feisty and fell for the bad boys, but we get to know her on a deeper level


She is in love with love, just not so lucky in it


She falls fast and hard and usually gets her heart broken

She makes a promise to herself that she will settle down with a boring nice guy...after one last fun fling in Vegas
She is instantly drawn to Tyler, not knowing he is the famous lead singer of Blue, a super popular country band

After a fun and wild weekend, she wakes up on the bathroom floor of a hotel room with some major bling on her left hand
She goes along with a plan about how to deal with the whole marriage thing, but as she gets to know Tyler, she knows she is in over her head and it will lead to heartbreak


It is just a ruse after all, right?Tyler Blue was amazing!! Instantly stereotyped as a man whore, he's anything but that

True, he has no desire to settle down, and this crazy marriage is the last thing he wanted, but he's a total romantic (leaving post-it notes with sweet messages) and super sweet (he's great with kids)

As he gets to know Sherry, he knows that she is the perfect wife, but his lifestyle isn't the type of thing he would want her involved in
Being a country star is his dream, but she has her own

He knows that he is falling for her, and the more time he spends with her, he can't help wanting her for real.This romance was so perfect

Complicated due to their situation, but not really drama filled at all

It all starts when Sherry and Tyler have a fun weekend in Vegas


She thinks he is just a hot roadie on the tour and decides he is her perfect final fling

He is intrigued that she doesn't know who he is, and liked that he can have a fun time and act normal

When they end up married, it's disaster for both of them

Except it's perfect publicity for him and he has a plan

When he goes to her hometown to stay with her for a month and act happily married, they both are fighting the real attraction they have for each other
They are both falling, but don't think the other is


When it comes time for him to go back on the road, of course we know it will be heartbreak for both of them, but hope that they will both be brave enough to go for what they really want.I adore romance that has you swooning and this totally did


It was fantastic from start to finish
I loved both of them and their personalities
Their chemistry was off the charts!! I also loved having the characters from the previous novels so present

You don't have to read them to enjoy this one at all though

It does not change this amazing story one bit


Rachel Harris is totally my girl crush for awesome romance novels! She has done it again with this, and I hope for many, many more to come in the future!!*An advanced copy of this book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review


I did not receive any compensation.

$REVIEW.: This financial planning book attempts to simplify retirement investing. It focuses on three principles: 1) Asset allocation; 2) Approximate the stock market average; and 3) Saving.I loved this book for a couple different reason. First, it simplifies investing. Retirement planning has always been an overwhelming prospect for me given the multitude of products and services available to consumers. It left me feeling too overwhelmed to take action. This book offers a simplistic AND sensible approach to retirement planning/investing that really resonated with my wife and I. It has given us the confidence and motivation needed to move forward with the development of short and long-term financial goals and has given us the tools to implement a plan of action.Secondly, I found the author's personal anecdotes about extracurricular activities gave this book a certain charm AND Mr. Schultheis usually did a good job of connecting those stories (including the pumpkin pie recipe) to this oftentimes bland topic. These anecdotes likely took up a grand total of 5 pages of the entire book and gave it a much needed human touch. By the end, you actually feel like you know and trust the author. This style of writing was either a clever marketing scheme or merely a reflection of a genuine person hoping to enlighten the do-it-yourself investor so that they/we can get on with our lives and cease living in fear of the happenings on Wall Street of which we have no control and make little or no sense. It that regard, it's a very liberating book!

$REVIEW.: This is a seminal work of science fiction and one that is surprisingly effective given the brevity of the book.  The Time Traveller tells his tale to a group of his friends - and it is interesting how every character in his time is labeled by their profession and not by name.  Except for the narrator who is never named at all.  The story is wrapped in thought-provoking speculation on the nature of mankind and because the Time Traveller works to understand why mankind has seemingly evolved into the two races he sees in the future, the reader is treated to a discourse on the nature of man's intellect, the need for fear and hardship and the possible outcome of a real utopia.  It's rather a disheartening story when you think of how H. G. Wells visualized the future.  But so readable and engaging - especially seeing how the Time Traveller uses his ingenuity to get back to his time.There's little in the way of character development - the focus is on the narrative and the world-building and the cleverness of the story.  And while it's possible that the story could have delved more into the relationship between the Eloi and the Morlocks, the believability of the story is maintained because the Time Traveller is more concerned about getting back to his time and away from danger than really recording future history.  So while this story seems very sketch-like, there's so much ingenuity in the main character and in the story that it more than makes up for it.The actual descriptions of the fourth dimension - time - was a highlight for me.  I loved how possible the author made time travel seem.  And how simple it seemed too, with the comparisons to how we perceive the three dimensions.  If only it were that easy!  This is a wonderful, short read, and so full of incident and mystery inherent in discovering what the future holds.

$review_text.: This is a basic vintage/classic cookbook.  The introductory pages include some no-frills basic information about cooking methods, temperatures, measurements, etc.  This information is covered in a very concise manner, taking up only five pages. Twenty-four tabbed recipe chapters follow, each with its own table of contents on the first page.  These chapters include appetizers, beverages, breads, cakes, candies, canning & preserving, cereals, cheese, cookies, eggs, fish & wild game, frozen desserts, fruits, gelatin, icings & fillings, meats, pastries, poultry, puddings, salads & dressings, sandwiches, sauces, soups, and vegetables.  Unlike many old cookbooks, the recipes DO include oven temperatures.  They are composed of basic ingredients and many will, by nature, be more time-consuming to prepare than those in most modern cookbooks.  Not all ingredients are healthy (sugar, shortening, etc.).If you're interested in a very basic cookbook with an easy-to-reference format, or in vintage homemaking books, this is a nice one.  If you're looking for a comprehensive recipe book, a book of "quick and easy" recipes, or whole/health food, I recommend finding something else.

$REVIEW.: I've been a reader of Coach Jenny Hadfield and John &#34;The Penguin&#34; Bingham for a long time -- since I got into running in my late 30s.  I find their advice and training plans to be doable, and always walk away with realistic expectations about the running experience.  Following their advice and plans has allowed me to enjoy running and progress at a modest pace without getting injured, which is the goal.  I appreciate the fact that both relate their own experiences, including their bad training decisions, to illustrate points.  It reminds me that we are all &#34;mortals.&#34;

$review_text.: Julia Foster was a missionary in India until her father's sickness brought the family home to England, requiring her to find work as a governess to financially support herself and her parents. At Highland Hall, Julia quickly becomes like part of the family, catching the eye of the estate's master, Sir William Ramsey, as she attends to the children. Meanwhile, Ramsey struggles to save the estate from financial ruin.The front-cover praise of best-selling author Julie Klassen compares this novel to Downton Abbey, and I fully agree with this assessment. I am not a super fan of Downton Abbey--I watched and enjoyed the first couple seasons, but have not recently been following the show. The Governess of Highland Hall is more engaging to me than Downton because the pace is a bit faster, and the characters are lovely. Turansky's writing is vivid. The story is predictable, but so sweet and delightful that it is a joy to read. The Edwardian era is also captured particularly well.Moreover, faith is (appropriately) a large part of this narrative, as is the tension between social classes. There are definite moral and religious themes presented throughout, and while they are direct, I liked how the story enveloped these seamlessly. Julia's faith, especially, is a guiding element within her personality and decisions; it is the Christian faith in comparison to the materialism and class separation of the period that brings life to these characters.I do think the ending could have been written a bit more powerfully. And, since this novel is complete within itself, I would have also enjoyed a clue to what the next in the series will offer. I am not left with any suspense toward the narratives to come, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the lightheartedness of this one.I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah.

I really liked &#34;Sandman&#34; but I thought this one was better. Don't read when you're home alone!!!I read it in about 2-2.5 hrs. But I am a very fast reader. Its definitely longer than a novella, but a shortish novel. Or maybe it felt short because the time period was only a few days.****************.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!  ****************I liked that Meagans sister was also a concern and a worry; it was an interesting subplot and helped make the story longer. Otherwise it would have been too rushed. Figuring out who the killer was wasn't TOO difficult; I had my suspicions but wasn't sure. Where did she take them though? How did she manage to do all the physical work required for all the gruesome tasks? Where did she get the snake? How did she get in Jillys house?I agree with what one person posted about Cody being somewhat stupid to not realize they were all girls he had dated. Sure, they look different with makeup and all, but he is in the FBI. He should be more observant than that.Still, I really enjoyed it and look forward to more books by this author!

$review_text.: When my nose is deep into the Wall Street Journal at night, I'll look up and discover my Interior Designer wife has stolen the remote and the TV channel has mysteriously switched to HGTV

 (It happens often.) But while she's the expert on this stuff, she's also an excellent teacher and mentor (even to her husband)--and so when a good interior (or exterior) design book comes along, I've learned to appreciate it.So if you, too, love the outdoor spaces and homes featured in Veranda magazine, you'll appreciate this elegant coffee table volume

The book covers a diverse range of styles (classic, modern, romantic and exotic--the four major sections) to satisfy every creative taste


Page by beautiful page, you'll be transported to stunning homes and outdoor settings


And even a wanna-be designer like me will find inspiration for our own outdoor living options
It's a terrific book!

$review_text.: This is not necessarily a pleasant book; the overall tone is not uplifting, and some of the scenes are explicitly awful.  It is, however, an entertaining read.  If you're a lover of vampire fiction and books and films, you may find yourself identifying with the protagonist.It's a very clever take on the concept; placing a character who's read all the same books we have, and knows all the lore, into a really untenable situation that he has to somehow survive.  You have no idea where it's going, until the very end.  That's also one of the things that makes this a great read.  The author has created a very dark reality, but it's not completely devoid of a glimmer of hope, which is part of the reason why the bad things seem so much worse.If you're looking for good-guy vampires, you won't really find them here.  You'll find absolute monsters, and some that aren't quite so bad.  We're made to root for and care about Avery because he's not an absolute monster the way his opponents are, rather than because he's a saint.  I highly recommend this book for vampire fiction lovers; it's worth reading, and the worldbuilding and tone make it stand out from the usual fare these days.  The arrangement of the book is also refreshingly different from the usual formula.  Check it out. :)

$review_text.: Topics Entertainments' Instant Immersion Spanish is a computer program and audio program for Spanish language learning

 The program is marketed as a less expensive alternative to Rosetta Stone (Rosetta Stone Version 3: Spanish (Latin America) Level 1, 2 & 3 Set with Audio Companion), but in reality is a more traditional flash-card and dialogue based approach to language acquisition
 This program is definitely a user friendly way to memorize a Spanish phrasebook


Instant Immersion Spanish, however, is disappointing in the sense that it doesn't harness the full potential of the modern computer to really teach a language.That is not to say that you cannot learn a great deal of Spanish using this program, but it is not nearly as smooth or user friendly as its Rosetta Stone counterpart nor does it employ a natural language approach ('dynamic immersion' in Rosetta terminology) to learning a language


 On the other hand, it is considerably cheaper than its Rosetta stone counterpart and this more traditional approach to learning a language may be more familiar to some users.Please note: I have reviewed all of the disks and canvassed the content, but certainly have not progressed through all of them

I will try to update the review later when I complete the course
 I have used Rosetta Stone for another language, but not for Spanish


 I do believe, however, that all the Rosetta Stone courses follow the same basic progression.THE LONG REVIEWWHAT'S IN THE BOXThe box includes a number of CDs that are part of the language acquisition program
 Rather than being a coherent program, these are a hodgepodge of CDs from various (and some, perhaps, retired?) programs from EuroTalk and Transparent Language


 In spite of the slick packaging, this is not a single language program
 Rather it is a bundled product


 By looking at visual cues and how these are put together, they seem to run the gamut from more effective to less effective and the late 80s to late 90s.Please note:  none of the computer CDs will work unless the CD is in the computer itself
So far, I could not figure a way around this


 This is okay for most desktops and laptops

 The advantage to keeping all information on a CD is a small installation footprint

 But if you want to learn Spanish in flight to Mexico using your netbook, you're out of luck without an external CD drive (unless you find a solution to this problem).[Note: originally, I commented that you might want to learn 'Spanish in flight to Brazil.'  S

Frisco, quite correctly,pointed out in the comment section that the official language of Brazil is Portuguese


 One still could learn Spanish en route to Brazil, but it wouldn't help you nearly as much as learning Portuguese whilst going there
 In spite of some Spanish learned, I am in desperate need of a program to help me with Geography 101

I should also point out that the CD that contained only MP3 'language lab' type files can be transferred to a netbook or MP3 player for CDless playback.]Incidentally, these CDs work equally as well on my PC and on my iMac (Intel processor, with Snow Leopard)

 There is a short installation process on the PC


 No installation is necessary on the Mac, although the program puts some library files on your computer to follow your progress.They include:Level 1 Disc 1: EuroTalk Talk Now!  This is one of the slicker and more modern CDs, still being sold separately by EuroTalk

 It basically is a visually appealing audio and visual flashcard program


 Objects and simple phrases are learned in this phase


Little or no grammar

 You can learn the cards, be tested, and record your voice
 Simplistic, but reasonably effective for vocabulary learning

 As with all the modules, there is a portion where you can record the phrases while you try to match the accent of the native speakers


 The only assessment, however, is the one you make by playing back your recording


 Moreover, on both PC and the Mac there seemed to be a delay in the recording of my voice
 Once I realized this, I was able to successfully record and listen.Level 1 Disc 2: multimedia flash cards: a program that looks as though it is from the early 90s, but still effective


 Vocab building flash cards, simple games, and recording again, but with a decidedly lower tech graphical environment
 Other than different vocabulary, there wasn't really a logical progression between disc 1 and disc 2.Level 2 Disc 1: EuroTalk "Talk More" Basically a phrase book and dialogues for various situations: the alphabet, at the restaurant, shopping etc


 Some of this is rehashed in the interactive DVD
 Very early 2000s type programming
 Once again, there are phrases but no emphasis on grammar and no testing on grammatical constructs.Level 2 Disc 2: EuroTalk "Talk the Talk"  Vocabulary, Family, At School, Hobbies and Friends etc
 A little more up to date than the last disk, but really more of the same for different environments.Level 3 Disc 1 Most modern disk

 More advanced games

 These are much better
 Lots of choices

 The games, once again, are mostly vocabulary building
 There are some that emphasize time and numbers which are very helpful


 This is the most unique and best of the disks that I saw.Level 3 Disc Two:  EuroTalk "Talk Business"  Phrases and dialogues for: on the phone, business, careers etc
 Similar to the other EuroTalk disks in the programThe interactive DVD looks like a late 80s early 90s production
 It is basically a rehash of the same video segments from Level 2 Disc one, using a less sophisticated technology and doesn't add much.Who is Oscar Lake: A mystery game in basic Spanish, somewhat like early Myst or Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiago

Late 90's programming style
 Seems like a cool way to use the Spanish you have learned, although I am certainly not at a high enough level to use this game at this point.Audio Disk: This is a standard vocabulary and dialogue based language learning CD
 Think 'language lab' from high school or college


 The voices are clear and there is an excellent PDF file that serves as a guide
 This can be downloaded to an iPOD for better use.This disk is actually key and oddly may be the most useful and best thought out part of the whole program


It provides the most bang for the buck in terms of actual language acquisition and familiarity with Spanish
 It should probably be the primary focus of the user and the computer programs could be used to increase vocabulary and learn how to use Spanish in more specific situations


 On the other hand, the process used here is very much like high school 'language lab'--a bit of frightening memory, but once you get over that it's not so bad.THE ACCENTI am not a native Spanish speaker nor am I an expert thereof, but the accents used throughout the program seem to be European (e.g


mainland Spain) and not the dialects used in Puerto Rico or South America

 This makes sense, as the bulk of the program is from EuroTalk


 However, my guess is that an American audience would be more interested in the Spanish spoken in Latin America: this is a more likely vacation destination for us and Spanish speakers within this country are predominantly from Latin America

 Even so, the audio is always well recorded

The actors modeling the language all have clear voices and articulate carefully
 You never get the sense that you have to strain to hear a word or can't make out part of a phrase.THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM:One of the major downsides of this program is that it is a phrase and vocabulary based program


 It seems to be an excellent adjunct to a course or book, but does not seem to be a stand alone language program

 Using the program, you could definitely learn how to ask for directions or order in a restaurant, but there are few tools here to help you construct full sentences and really learn the Spanish language


 You can think of it as a fun way to learn a Spanish phrasebook.This contrasts with a program like Rosetta Stone or audio programs like Pimsleur that work on both vocabulary and grammar at the same time
 Rosetta Stone is also infinitely smoother in its interface and moving from units 1 to 3 in Rosetta is a more logical progression

 However, no computer program alone will teach you a living language

 Eventually, you will have to actually speak to an actual person to develop fluency

 However, Rosetta will give you a better base for this than Instant Immersion.On the other hand, Rosetta Stone is more slow-going than this program
 It takes more time to teach language when you introduce both content and grammar
 I personally prefer the Rosetta way because it is more natural for me, but others may prefer the flash card and phrase methods


 If you are taking a trip abroad and need to get around, learning a basic vocabulary and specific phrases is the fastest way to go
 The problem is, it doesn't give you a working knowledge of the language.The discs are arranged in 'levels,' but these are levels in name alone

There are differences between disks, but mostly, they expand your knowledge of phrases and words for different contexts, rather than progress you to a truly different level in the language


 And this is another place where I believe Rosetta Stone is better
 In Rosetta Stone, you learn both vocabulary and grammar simultaneously


 The program is 'smarter' and your skills build with each step.It would have been helpful if there was an overall guide included with the software, to give you examples on how to most effectively use the components of the program
 I found myself most attracted to using the computer CDs and playing the games, only to find out that using the audio program in conjunction with the computer program seems to increase the efficacy.The most intriguing portion of the program is the Who Is Oscar Lake CD


 Had the company worked more on a more novel way of language learning, this might be a more compelling package.CONCLUSIONS:This program offers quite a bit at an attractive price point

 You could buy this with an accompanying Spanish text book (and even supplement with some paid 'live' lessons for conversation) and learn a great deal of Spanish--and still pay less than you would for Rosetta
 One of the advantages of a mostly vocabulary and situational based course is that you can more rapidly gain a usable vocabulary for travel


 However, if you want a computer program that comes close to actually teaching a language, you'll have to pay a premium because Rosetta Stone is probably a better bet.



$SUMMARY.: Certainly instant, but not really Immersion: a great Spanish vocabulary booster and a nice introduction to Spanish

$review_text.: Normally I don't write negative reviews, I feel the author deserves at least a 3 for all the work involved with writing

Thus my 3 rating
Otherwise I would have given it a 1.Unfortunately I found this story  quite offensive


 It's definitely not a child's book due to all the f* bombs in the story  and the fact that the cat wanted to kill it's owner is another reason

 There is absolutely no reason for them other than shock value
Also the premise that humans are just &#34;2 legged no brains&#34; was so unwarranted.I feel like the author just wanted to see how much he could shock his audience,  definitely not a humorous book and most definitely not a book for children.I'm sorry that this is the one story I didn't complete, and I deleted the book as soon as I could.Would I read another book by this author, I'm not sure


I would definitely sample before I buy.I'm sorry, I just had to make my opinion clear so someone else thinking about getting this book will stop and sample it before they buy if they are thinking about getting it to either read to their child or allow the child to read it on their own.

$REVIEW.: Initially, I was intrigued by the concept.  An alternate history with magical operas?  Awesome.  Unfortunately, some structural problems kept me from enjoying this book as much as I would have liked.The book opens slowly, with lots of tell don't show.  I did not find the religion vs science debate(s) compelling.  And as the book continues, the discussion becomes more polemicized & repetitious.  I was reminded of Heinlein, and his characters being obvious mouthpieces for the author, giving long speeches that don't convert, but rather are more in the vein of "preaching to the choir".As the book progressed, there seemed to be a problem with its pacing.  The ultimate denouement seems to be artificially delayed again & again.  By the time the story ended, I was more than ready for its conclusion.

$REVIEW.: "Guns & Roses:  The Untold Story of Dean O'Banion, Chicago's Big Shot Before Al Capone" by Rose Keefe is a long overdue crime book.  This biography of Chicago's first celebrity gangster (he was a popular florist) is excellent and has numerous unpublished photographs.  Dean's death started a five year run of killings and bloodshed.  Keefe's writing style is very good and easy to read.  I agreed with previous reviewers who have encouraged others to purchase this book.Mike Koch, Author of "The Kimes Gang."

$review_text.: Have you ever wondered about NDE's (Near Death experiences)? If you have then The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences: How Understanding NDE's can help us live more fully by Dr. Penny Sartori is for you. This book is an in depth look into near death experiences.We are shown just what Near Death experiences are and also the after-effects many people experience after an occurrence. One such after effect is not being able to wear a watch due to the fact that it stops working when the person who had the NDE wears it, but it works when others put it on. I also really enjoyed the chapter entitled, 'The Cultural Variations of the NDE&#34; in which we are shown how different cultures have different experiences during NDE's. We are also introduced to the history of how death became medicalized. I really enjoyed reading the experiences of those who had experienced and NDE and the insights they have gained from the experience.Overall, this book was a wonderful in depth look into Near Death experiences and how we can experience life more fully by learning about them. I would recommend this book to all those who are interested in the end of life and near death experiences.I acknowledge that I received this book free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

I went in to this book wanting to hate him, just because I read Sins & Needles first, but I kinda don't hate him (well not as much as I thought I would). This book was great. It took us back to where Ellie first devised her revenge plan against the man who scarred her, and that meant getting close to Javier, a real dark and dangerous man, and very hot!! The thing that wasn't supposed to happen was, Ellie (Eden) wasn't supposed to fall in love with him! How could you not though, he was just too perfect, he adored her, gave her everything...owned her. Maybe that should have been a sign. But she was on a mission, or was she? Was she willing to throw revenge out the window to have a life with him, can she overlook all the bad he does? Javier takes the "bad boy" image all the way, but yet I love him! I think I am still leaning toward Camdem tho...I loved this book, it totally filled in all the blanks about what happened with Javier in Sins & Needles.

$review_text.: Reviewed by ValerieBook provided by the author for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookSherry Soule has continued the Spellbound Series in a page-turning fashion with book two! Moonlight Mayhem had me hooked &#8211; I cried, felt tension, suspense, and could not wait to read the end. In book two, Shiloh&#8217;s character really begins to grow and come into her own. Right at the beginning, her dad is killed and she vows to avenge his death. One of the most memorable scenes in this book is when she attends his funeral. It is written with such clarity and pain that I was there hurting with her. From this point on, Shiloh is vengeful and determined. I really felt her focus.Shiloh spends a good portion of the book trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on in her town &#8211; but revenge is still at the forefront of her mind. Soule added a variety of characters in this sequel, such as lycans, zombies, and angels, which added depth to the story. At times, I was surprised that she kept introducing so many different types of characters in the same setting, but they didn&#8217;t take away from the plot in any way. While Shiloh does work with her mentor, Evan, at times she seems to be able to do more without his help. She is even able to set up a coven to fight the evil battering her town. While I was happy for her independence, I was a bit disappointed too, because I wanted Evan to have more of a story as I really liked his character in book one. As for Trent, he is still in the picture as her boyfriend, but he starts changing in weird ways too. It seems that their romance picks up a bit more than in book one but doesn&#8217;t seem to really be the focus at any time in this story which I hope evolves in the rest of the series. For now, the focus between them is a secret that Shiloh knows.Similar to book one, the pacing of the events is well written and the reader can keep up without confusion. The action and suspense build in the book to a page-turning frenzy until the last page. It will be interesting to see where Soule goes next in this series and whether or not she continues to add supernatural creatures to the world of Whispering Pines.Favorite Quote:  &#8220;Whatever the hell was going down, it wasn&#8217;t good. None of it added up. Only one thing still made sense to me. Avenging my dad.&#8221; End of Chapter 28

$review_text.: Muckley has written an intellectually gripping thriller that demanded and kept my attention from the start


 What happens when you walk out of your front door and realize that you no longer officially exist in society? When you realize the little plastic government issued ID card that you must use everywhere to do almost anything has suddenly become deactivated? This is the mystery Ben Stone, a prominent medical scientist working in the U.K., must solve after he awakens one morning following the celebration of the success of his team&#8217;s NEMREC project.Ben has dedicated his adult life to finding a cure for genetic diseases, such as the debilitating Huntington&#8217;s disease, which gradually destroyed his father&#8217;s life

The emotional scars he&#8217;s carried from childhood as he watched his father&#8217;s quality of life slowly disintegrate have been the driving force behind the past twenty years of his scientific work
Unfortunately, over the course of his life, his passionate need to save others has gradually eroded his personal life, and when we meet Ben, his marriage is barely hanging on by a thread and his family life is less than fulfilling.When the book begins, Ben&#8217;s medical dream has finally come to fruition when the NEMREC project proves to be successful in changing an individual&#8217;s genetic code by repairing faulty DNA to cure diseases


Ben is pleased that his revolutionary scientific breakthrough can now save lives, but what he doesn&#8217;t realize is that the reverberations of NEMREC&#8217;s success will reach beyond the medical community to a covert government organization with nefarious plans for NEMREC&#8217;s use.The story starts off a bit slowly so Muckley can immerse readers into a world where almost every aspect of your life can be tracked by the government via your identity card, and the government has the power to deactivate your card for even the tiniest of infractions that can leave you vulnerable and take away some of the basic rights and freedoms many of us take for granted

The author spends a great amount of time with character development

Ben may be the protagonist of the story but he&#8217;s not the one dimensional good guy wearing a white hat

In reality, he&#8217;s a flawed hero who must now deal with the consequences of his past actions and mistakes.The action picks up when Ben finds himself on the run from powerful enemies who have erased his identity as a precursor to ending his actual life

 Deception and betrayal cut deeply into the grooves of this cat and mouse chase that ensues with Ben trying to stay alive without knowing who he can now trust

As Ben begins to realize that many of his memories of significant life events have been manipulated by others, his whole perception of reality comes crashing down around him


Now he&#8217;s left with the realization that he has been a pawn in a game of warfare and, ironically, his life&#8217;s work will be used for death and destruction rather than improving the quality and longevity of life unless he can stay alive long enough to intervene.By using a third person omniscient point of view to tell the story, Muckley helps readers to get the thoughts, perspectives, and motivations of many other main characters who are involved in the plot

While this certainly adds depth to the storyline, at times the shift from one character&#8217;s thoughts to another occurred within scenes and the abrupt transition caught me off guard and interrupted the flow of the story as I found myself re-reading passages to see when the shift occurred.The ending is quite dramatic and suspenseful but was a bit vague for my preference since it was left open to speculation about what eventually happens to Ben and his family

The last chapter is really an epilogue with an OMG scene that would make a great foundation for a sequel


If Muckley decides to build upon this shocking conclusion, I&#8217;ll be ready and waiting to read the follow up to this engaging thriller!I received a copy of this book from the author for an honest and fair review.

$review_text.: There are some things about this book that I really like, and some that bother me. I find Mary Meyer to be a fascinating individual, and it was great to read an account of her personality and character from someone who actually knew her. Janney is an insider, and his perspective is interesting at that level. He also does a good job of conveying a sense of  the Cold War social and political milieuof the 50s and 60s. I learned some things from this book. For example, I had never heard of the United World Federalist movement for world government.However, this book has some problems with presentation and content. It needed some serious content and copy editing that didn't happen. It could have been streamlined. And it was full of typographical errors, especially in the first half. Also, I caught a couple of factual errors; for example, Janney states that the moon landing happened in 1968 (vs. 1969 when it really happened). This mistake makes me wonder what other information might have been off point, but I just didn't know enough to have caught it.Another major problem for me is that in his obvious support of Ray Crump's innocence, Janney doesn't tell the whole truth about Crump's later criminal career. Janney only mentions Crumps arson offences, and downplays them at that. But he is totally silent about Crump's later violence against women, which included rape. I think that was disingenuous of Janney to sanitize Crump's criminal record and to make excuses for him. I don't buy that any alleged abuse that Crump endured in prison turned him into a criminal.  Frankly, I'm not convinced that Ray Crump killed Mary Meyer, but I wish that Janney would have been honest about the man's criminal record. Let the readers know the full truth, and let us decide. It makes me wonder if Janney bent other information to suit his narrative.All of the problems cause me to question the rigor of his research. Overall though, I don't regret reading the book. I would encourage Janney to fix these issues and release an updated edition.

$REVIEW.: Wow. What a great, revealing book. Having been on both sides of the scale, I was floored by the author's understanding on why men cheat. But at the same time these results can be applied to women. I love that she was plain and direct with no scientific mumbo jumbo or an overload of statistics or experts with a million titles after their names. She actually gives the Best Damn Advice Ever. There are going to be a lot of men upset with her about this book. She hit the reasons on the head. It was embarassing to look at my former behavior when I was a young man and painful to know that I even participated in something like that. It also allows you to take a look at the hurt and devastation that this one tiny act does to years of building. Ms. Moore knows and understands what motivates one to this level of betrayal. I am not only recommending this book but will be sending it to a few friends and family members.

While fleeing armies populated by child soldiers and led by cruel men,  she learns about brutality and what she must do to survive as she searches for her family.  She experiences first love, loss and betrayal.  It is a story of remarkable courage and coming of age without guidance. A fast paced and well told story.

$REVIEW.: I love reading stories with princesses and magic, but I have always been a tomboy. I really identified with this princess, because she wasn't like most princesses we read about. She gets into a situation where she has to be a hero and a leader, because there is no one left to do it. If you like princesses, but not the &#34;damsel in distress&#34; type, I'd recommend this one. When I finished this book, I was sad it wasn't a series.

$REVIEW.: I adore short stories, I think too often they are pushed aside for something more lengthy. While short stories do not allow for much character development, they are entertaining and leave a lot to the imagination. These are the types of stories told around camp fires, they inspire and bring magic to the lives of children and adults alike.While the first book in the series promised to be very kid friendly, the second book is not as much as it mentions the nude body of the main character. If choosing to read this out load as a family, of course you could skip the details.Aside from that, I am loving this series for the whole family. Short stories can be great reads, they sum up the story, leaving a lot to the imagination, and a starting point for your own imaginings. This series is exceptional in that.Magic and dragons abound, and this series showcases the kindness of the human spirit even in the midst of their own troubles. Looking forward to story #3!

$review_text.: Loved the story! I was up until 3am because I NEEDED to finish it.Just This Once is a story of apprehension. Of both sides being scared to take chances. Her, falling for the bad boy. Him, falling for a woman in general. Lots of times we are afraid to do something because we don't want to disappoint someone (like our parents). Ultimately it is our decision as an adult and we have to live with the consequences of those choices. We have to open our eyes, and realize that what we may be trying to run away from really is exactly what we have been looking for. It is what is on the inside that matters. Their heart. A person's actions can tell you more about them than their appearance ever could.I loved Bert. We also have a lovable, goofy GSD, so this appealed to me right from the beginning.Shannon grew up as a sheltered minister's daughter and now that she is away from home, she wants to walk on the wild side just once. One afternoon, that temptation ends up on her doorstep. A gorgeous bad boy and he just so happens to be her neighbor. She makes it clear that anything between them would happen only once because she knows that she could never fall for some one like him. He is the bad boy that her parents warned her about. But, he makes her feel so wild, so free. She has never felt like this before. Never experienced things like this...until him.Rick is a cop that takes his job very seriously. His only love is his spoiled, silly GSD. He has always been the love 'em and leave 'em type and knows that anything between him and Shannon would be strictly sexual, nothing more. No feelings. No late night conversations about their lives outside of the bedroom. But now he doesn't know what has come over himself. He doesn't understand how he can have these feelings he has developed for her...even when she's not around.They had both agreed that anything between them will be a one time deal...but it turns out they can't stay away from each other. Shannon is getting the chance to explore new things with him. Things she has only dreamed of doing, just once in her life, before she settles down and finds some respectable guy out there and marries him. But, she cant get enough of Rick. She has never felt what she feels when she is with him. His body. His smile. Her time here is almost up. She just doesn't know how she is going to be able to leave him without feeling torn apart inside. Like she would be leaving part of herself behind. Rick is learning that he can open up and have real conversations, not just having fun for a week before he gets bored and moves on. And that deep down, he can care. He tries to understand that her parents wouldn't think very highly of him. So what can he do? She's set on leaving. He doesn't know if he can change her mind, but he is definitely going to try, whatever he has to do, to keep her.I received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: George Santayana once said, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."In all of my years in high school and university/college, I was never told anything about comets or cosmic catastrophes as ever being evident in our world's history

It was simply not acknowledged nor accepted


Our perception of "history" has been seriously limited and controlled by those who have insidious agendas

History, indeed, was written by those "in power." I grew up, knowing full well that history have a habit of repeating itself and how we should always learn from history
But, the important question was, "what tragic event that occurred in our past that will happen again on a global scale so many times over?"Hidden within known myths, history, astronomy/astrology, and the ancient Greek literature, Laura Knight-Jadczyk has discovered the presence of so many comets in such a far distant past, which has caused a great number of catastrophic events on our planet


This latest analysis will open our minds to the past in a hope to seriously comprehend the cyclical nature of cosmic catastrophes throughout the history of our planet, and we sure are due for another event."Comets and the Horns of Moses" is the second volume of "The Secret History of the World" series, with the first volume being presented almost 10 years ago (one does not necessary have to read the first volume in order to read the second, which can stand on its own...or so I think)

This volume focuses firstly on the analysis of Moses before heading onto the studies of cometary events with a grave look at several myths and historical/archaeological records and how these events were deliberately twisted and erased from human awareness
The author also attempt to bring the reader to understand how our history got so convoluted, why the masses of the past so readily accepted the slandered narratives and invented histories as being spoon-fed to them by the elites, based on recent psychological and cognitive researches as well as a neoteric look at the origin of astrology and religions.This is truly an eye-opening and astounding work as the author pulls on so many threads that lead towards the most important examination on "what really happened." Very much like the first volume, this second book brings a great deal of multidisciplinary information together to shape a coherent whole.It's certainly one of those books that I got more and more engrossed as the more I read and began to question everything I have ever learned about history and myths, and even unknown mysteries of our past

It is very well-researched, so nicely written, and such a fascinating read

It's sure would be a valuable addition to any library in the world.

$review_text.: Here For The Cake was just what the doctor ordered! A deliciously fun, exciting and hilarious read with fantastic characters and a fabulous and conniving storyline. I absolutely loved it!Mina Joseph is an academic, studying and assisting at Boston University. Since the tragic dumping by the love of her life, Luke, who is now getting married to one of her &#34;friends from high school&#34;, mega biatch Ella, in Mina's dream location, Costa Rica; Mina has buried her head in her study, forever pining over him, never being able to let go.When an invitation to the wedding arrives, Mina dismisses it. But when Luke's best friend Ben drops by and offers her a plane ticket and spending money for a makeover in the hopes of breaking up the wedding, by showing Luke what he let go, Mina only needs a little encouragement to agree to go along. If worst comes to worst she gets a free holiday with her 2 besties, Josie and Salma and a hot new look and wardrobe.What happens next is an unbelievably excellent story of deceit, romance, hope and longing, with a truck load of frivolous fun, laughter and a bloody awesome ending.What a cast of characters! I think I've fallen in love with them all! Especially Mina, Josie & Ben.Mina isn't like most leading ladies. She isn't an idiot who makes ridiculously stupid mistakes that you just want to slap her for; she doesn't play the victim, she is a strong admirable woman who just needs closure so she can move on with her life. Bestie #1 Josie, is an absolute firecracker and someone I'd want in my corner! The stuff that comes out of her mouth had me literally laughing out loud, to the point I was worried I was going to wake up my sleeping husband and kids. Just so freakin' funny!Bestie #2, Salma (Luke's older sister), was the pacifier of the trio, but she was a little pocket rocket herself, and such a loving and caring friend.Luke is so mixed up. He clearly has feelings for Josie but is adamant that marrying Ella is the right thing to do. I only felt sorry for him a little bit.Ella is a....(I've got to watch my language here) crazy MOLE!!! (the skin growth, not the animal). What a piece of work! She is one stuffed-up (see how I censored it!) individual! The level to how low she could stoop totally added to the twisted story!And last but not least, Ben. He's a male tart and proud of it! But what a guy! His humor and hubris were just do damn charming! And that wit! He was to die for!One thing I particularly enjoyed was what was going on in the background of this novel; so much detail with all the dirty little side stories of all of the &#34;high society&#34; guests, I just couldn't get enough! The setting was beautifully described, leaving me with a vivid picture in my mind.Here For Cake would have to be the BEST &#34;chic lit&#34; book I've ever read. It is a feel-good book that all though had some sad parts, was a fantastically uplifting story. Excellent writing Ms. Poule! I can't wait to read more of your fabulous work!

He is not the best, nor the worst, but he can get the job done
This book has a bit of mystery, a bit of suspense, a bit of humor.I like this story


It has many good things going for it
It has a touch of mystery, it has good guys and bad guys


It has suspense, yet it has humor


I was not happy with the way the book ends, but it does leave a wide opening for the next book in this series.This book is fun to read

It is not a book requiring the reader study each line, nor is it difficult to understand
It is a good story, with enough twists and turns to be fun to read
It will keep you guessing, at times
The author's humor will be difficult for some to understand.I would recommend this story to those science fiction readers that find delight in strange universes that seem familiar

If you are looking for a short book to fill a couple of hours, that will not force you into deep thought, grab this book


I am looking forward to the next book by Robert Beacham.

$review_text.: I have to admit, I like marketing books.  In graduate school, my favorite classes had a marketing focus.  So when I saw this book about marketing I felt a strong pull to read it.  Maybe it's the fact that I live in Vermont where black and white cows are everywhere.  Maybe it was the intriguing purple cow milk cartons that were around to initially promote the book.  Maybe it was the purple cow on Seth Godin's website.  Whatever it was, I was sold and got the book.I would label this book as a "pop" marketing book.  This book is to marketing like a mass-media self-help book is to psychology.  If you are a business owner or solo entrepreneur don't look to this book to really help you build a market strategy.  If you are looking for a nuts and bolts marketing book, this book is not it.  David Bangs' "Market Planning Guide" is what you need.This is a "fun" book:  a book to put on your night stand and read a few pages before you go to sleep; a book to supplement what you already know; a book to reinforce your existing strategies.  This would be a good book to read on a plane flight or on vacation while sitting around the pool drinking margaritas. It is cute enough to be entertaining while being wrapped in some thought-provoking concepts.There is nothing "new" in this book.  No comparative studies document the purple cow phenomenon.  The examples seem only to illustrate the author's ability to come up with clever terms to apply to pre-existing concepts.  For example the "sneezer" metaphor just presents as silly and distracting.  I can't see anyone seriously discussing how to mobilize the "sneezers" in a business meeting with other executives.But I could see a CEO asking people on the executive team read it before they go on the next company retreat.  It might provide a good entrance to brain-storming before doing the next year's marketing plan.Overall, this is a good read - a quick read - an easy read.  I would recommend it to any individual responsible for marketing a concept or product -- or even trying to get the edge on their competition.  The purple cow concept stuck with me weeks after reading the text -- probably because of a great introductory story.  I like the purple cow.

$review_text.: I like legal thrillers almost as much as I like westerns and Kenneth Eade has written a real page turner in Predatory Kill.  As the story unfolds Eade puts his years of experience as a lawyer to good use in taking the reader through complicated labyrinth of the legal process making you believe that you actually were in court watching the trial unfold. His characters are believable and well written and and his description of the bad guys was riveting. but this book would have benefited with a good editor. I came across a few annoying typos, but I don't judge a book by typos, I judge the book by the merits of the story and this story was a good one. Eade should write a sequel and continue the character of Brent Marks. I liked reading about Marks and the way he handles himself both in and out of court. Eade is what Grissom initially was when he first started writing, and I know that readers will enjoy this legal thriller written by a fresh new writer, Kenneth Eade.

$REVIEW.: So, I typically avoid romance novels


 They just...irk me

 You generally have some crazy, unrealistic love story and if you're lucky, there might be something parading as a plot, or a storyline


 Forget character development and growth; these are things usually put on the back burner by most authors of romance novels
 Most.This novel was different
 I immediately felt a connection with Katie, with her emotional pain and distress, with her need to put herself second, even if it were to her own detriment

 Katie was a REAL character with a REAL history (which of course, involved Ash), and these elements were nicely tied in to the story.I didn't feel like I was reading romance
 I mean, the romance was there, but the actual story was much more prominent, in my opinion
 And when there was romance, it wasn't cheesy


 It was well-done, and left me wanting more of it, to be honest.I don't want to give too much away, but I did indeed read and finish this work, and will absolutely purchase the sequel

 I'm a huge fan of character-driven stories, and that's what I got with See Through Me


 I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance, or mystery novels


 The two are entwined fantastically here.This is one of those stories that just sucks  you in, page after page, and you find yourself having read it in only one sitting.Yes, there were questions left unanswered, but it's a series- of course there are going to be unanswered questions

 I was very happy with the ending and thought it appropriate, and satisfying.This author has a lot of talent and I'm looking forward to reading more from her in the future!

$REVIEW.: The story had some potential, but moved very slowly; the product summary made it sound like something entirely different than what I ended up reading.The descriptions of the setting were interesting. The main character was sort of likeable but did stupid things that put her in jeopardy constantly - and she wasn't very nice to the 'hero' at first.  And the 'hero' was at first made to look like a handsome, brainless dunce when in fact he was a well-mannered, well-educated man who didn't seem to have much self-confidence - the author did a very blunt switch-around with him halfway or more through the story, and it didn't flow smoothly.I couldn't decide whether the author was trying to write a horror story, a mystery, or a last-minute romance - plus last-minute shifters. And the author's reference to "rent[ing][the hero] out to the Mormons so they don't have to electrocute their lesbos anymore" was as offensive as it was tasteless, and had not a thing to do with or to enhance the story line.  That sort of thing - little mismatched wordbombs and odd or grisly descriptions unexpectedly dropped into the story - made it hard to stomach, and took the enjoyment out of it; and left me trying to figure out what the author was about.  I did finish it, though I wish I hadn't, and the author managed to tie up most of the loose ends.To sum it up, I guess I would say that it had potential to be an interesting story, but had too many 'eewwww' moments dropped in that broke up the otherwise smooth flow.Actually, my favorite character was Drake, the dog; and he didn't come into the story until halfway through the book.I wouldn't read this book again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone; there are lots of enjoyable books to read out there, and apparently some people think this is one of them - I don't.

$review_text.: 4 StarsI can't take this. Eamon is pulling from one side and Bastien the other. Both sides are as miserable as I am. How can this be my path, to hurt everyone I love?Illyria is living in a place where Caldonians have taken over, where sky ships land each night scouring the woods for humans. This place used to be her parent's earth, it has been lost to the past. She must face the skeletal remains of the city, a place she has to explore, to find the truth so that they will have a chance to survive.Illyria grew up in the Rebellion. It is the only world she knows. She also knows how to fight, survive and trust her instincts.  The leaders of the rebellion (their parents) have been killed, leaving her and her friends in charge to protect the elderly and the young. Toren has stepped up to lead. Eamon, her best friend has always been there for her, protected her, trained her and loves her. She loves him, loves them all. Her BFF Aminah, is the motherly one and Toren's girlfriend. Then there is Zahra, always trying to get Eamon's attentions and has been nothing but a thorn in her side. Regardless, they are all she has left and they are her family. It is up to them to fight a war which seems far from over with a dismal chance of winning.Running low on ammo, medical supplies, clothing and food, she had no choice but to search in the forbidden City for answers. The tremors are getting worse and he Caldonians are searching for something and she needs to know what that something is. Following her instincts, she leaves her grounds without telling anyone. She ventures into the City, which is unfamiliar to her, a place deemed off limits and very dangerous. This place has memorized her. *Insert sexy rebel survivor here* Illyria runs into Bastien. He is annoyingly gorgeous, strong and stubborn. Denying her attraction for him is harder than she thought. She can't get him out of her mind and he has somehow managed to sneak into to her heart. *insert love triangle here*Bastien grew up in the city, lost his parents and learned to survive. When he runs into Illyria *insert intense attraction and let off some fireworks here* WOW... There is an unexplainable connection he feels towards her. She is beautiful, stubborn, strong and fearless. He is enamored with her and will risk his life to protect her.I've gone head-to-head with a wolf while hunting, dove off the Cascades to satisfy a teenage dare and entered the forbidden City. alone, but I've never let a guy get this close. If I had known kissing would be this intense, I would have done it a lot soonerWhen Bastien is captured and his life threatened, something takes over her and unexplainable things happen but she was able to set him free. When she is almost captured herself, she runs into a Caldonian solider, Kyan. He isn't what he appears to be and Illyria will have no choice but to trust him.His lips press into a tight line, but he nods in understanding. "You can't outrun your destiny forever, Illyria.""Watch me." I shoot off one final round, severing the wire that holds the ceiling fan aloft and sprint for the hall.Commander Drakon is hot on their tail. Illyria and her friends with have to fight to the death. She will also have to make the toughest decision of her life, a decision that will affect the fate of the world as she knows it. If she chooses to be with the one her hearts wants; desires and needs, her people will suffer, the world will suffer. If she chooses to be with her soulmate; the one she feels at home with and deeply cares for, she will lose the love of her life the one man she gave her whole heart to, the one her heart knows it belongs to.I am too young for this, Kyan. How can I save the world when I'm only eighteen?I know this is not the path you would have chosen for yourself, he thinks, glancing at me from the end of the table, but we do not choose our destiny. It is chosen for us.This book had a few surprises, great action, a little bit of angst, drama, sadness and a few steamy scenes. The characters were all fantastic. Each had their roles and they made the book that much better.Yeah, that's the past that sucks. I sink my chin into my palmIllyria is a beautiful, strong, stubborn, adventurous 18 year old. All she knows how to do is survive. With the fate of the world in her hands, she has to make the biggest choice of her life. Eamon is handsome and sexy; the one who plays it safe, who is dedicated and reliable. He is your home, your comfort, you can't help but love him. Definitely swoonworthy *sighs* Bastien, is the bad boy; gorgeous, adventurous, yet protective. Intense and honest- doesn't stand for any shinanigans. He pushes the limits but is soft and caring under his tough exterior.  He is a panty melter for sure! *fans self-off*Amy Miles left me hanging and wanting even more. It didn't end quite the way I would have hoped but I am keeping my fingers crossed that things will change for our heroine, Illyria, in the upcoming book Relinquish (book # 2) due out this fall.Amy has written the beginning of a successful trilogy with the Rising series. A fantastic job!

Who would of thought a Rob Liefield Wonder Woman ripoff character could become such an interesting book when taken over by the creative team of Joe Keatinge and Ross Campbell. Joe does an excellent job of weaving an interesting story and creating interesting and compelling characters. Ross' artwork is awesome! It's so different and far more interesting than the usual superhero type stuff. A word of warning though, there is a good bit of gore. I highly recommend checking it out.

$review_text.: If your into the older time stories with mystery and I suppose romance then you might want to check out this book. And it cant really hurt since it is free after all. This story is about a hand full of rich people stuck in a house because of some type of illness. And the only way to keep it from spreading is to lock the people who have come in contact with it in the house. While they are locked in there things get stolen, people get blamed, well only one person gets blamed and that's the main character. The lock in all started because the main character wanted to lift the spirit of one of her friends. At the party the friends relative that give him the money is coming over. No big deal except the relative doesn't know that the guy is not married anymore. The main character gets tricked into playing the role of the wife, to only find out that first off the relative is a horrible old lady and secondly, the mans really which shows up. It seems just a few minutes after the really wife shows up everyone at the party except for the help gets locked in the house. So everyone has to keep the lies up so the old lady doesn't find out that everything is a lie, but also the main character has to lie to a love interest she has at the house too. Because he like the old lady, thinks that the main character is married. This book has unique twists and turn in the story that it might be hard to put it down. If my some what explanation makes any sense, and the story does sound kind of interesting, then you will love reading this book, because it is a lot better then what I can explain because I'm horrible at telling stories or explaining.

She's now finding out about a proposal, someone named Nate, A business and more.  She's confused and trying to figure out the last year of her life.In her life is the gorgeous Max whom she always had a crush on; but now he's supposedly her finance?! How can this be especially with him working all the time and late night things going on?Then there is the mysterious Nate. The rock god whom is somehow connected to her. Who and what is this man to her?I loved the characters in this story. Lexi makes it interesting and suspenseful in what is going on in the lives of these characters.You will sympathize and love Hanna. She's a woman who worries a lot about her weight just like a lot of women do today. I love her personality and her friendship she has with her sister.Max well, I have mixed feelings about him. That's all I can say. I feel he's arrogant and not worthy of Hanna in any shape or form.Nate-- well I feel bad for this man. I want to know more about him and know more about him and Hanna. I'm team Nate and want to know more!!! &#60;3There are also others who draw conflict and also pain for Hanna. I'm looking forward to the 2nd book in hopes that those people we suffer for their wrong doings and the lies etc that have been concealed.If you want a page turning amazing book and interesting love triangle this book is definitely for you!! You won't be disappointed you purchased it.I am now eagerly awaiting for book 2 come June...... especially from that MAJOR CLIFFHANGER of an ending!!!** I recv'd this book from the wonderful Lauren Blakely as a gift.

All NASA preflight info. Also recovery and quarantine and much more. Dozens of NASA scientist bios listed that helped during the mission. All 3 of the astronauts qualifications, rank (Armstrong was a civilian), degrees, graduation etc. The book has a lot to offer in many categories of Apollo 11.I really liked the interview with the astronauts after they went through quarantine. The press asked some great questions and all 3 of the astronauts gave INMO honest answers.There is a nice bonus DVD  supplied with lots of pictures, animation and movies. Wonderful bonus DVD. The DVD itself is worth the price. Many many lunar pictures...fantastic, and  movies. Here is a chance to see history. Have this for my kids and their kids to see one of mankind's greatest accomplishments.The book was 5 stars. I plan to get part2.

$REVIEW.: Great book Mr. Hankins. I couldn't get enough and almost read through the night. I wanted to know who, when and why and I finally got my questions answered with a lot of turns. The book almost had as many turns as a Coben novel. I also like the pricing of Mr. Hankins books. So many unknown authors price themselves above what I am willing (and I'm sure others)to pay. If you are or have not been on the NY Times bestseller list keep your prices reasonable.I look forward to more books by this author.

$REVIEW.: Is there any child who isn't, at some point, afraid of the dark? Who doesn't, at some time, harbor a terror of the Things that lurk in the closet or hide under the bed?Eventually, most of us grow out of those night-terrors. We laugh at our fears, peer under our beds at ... nothing more frightening than dust-bunnies or, at worst, boxes of accumulated possessions that we have nowhere else to store.But ...What if our fears have basis in reality? What if there are indeed creatures that lurk under our beds, waiting for that moment when the lights go out and we are helplessly locked in sleep ...Welcome to the world of Syeribus, Creatures of the Night!I have given this book 4 stars because of some editing issues, but the story itself, the premise, is 5-star worthy. L.M. Boelz does a wonderful job of building on the fear that lurks in our subconscious - the fear that - when we are at our most vulnerable - we are not alone.She also provides some beautifully on-target descriptions, and I love authors who can weave spells with their words.Without giving away the plot, the story is about a group of children who discover that the "bogieman" indeed exists.Let me add, in my opinion, this isn't a book for children! It is a book for those who love tales of terror, tales of the supernatural - a book for people who enjoy a story that will leave you with shivers along your spine, and that doesn't involve (so far as I can tell) vampires or werewolves!Two caveats: First, the story builds slowly, so don't expect to be immersed immediately in the night-terror. Boelz does, however, have a definite talent for building tension. The book, for me, was a page-turner.Second, the ending is a cliff-hanger. If you want to know what's going to happen next - You have to get the next book in the trilogy. Which I intend to do.

Is that so bad?&#8221;  My personal answer &#8220;Hell to the NO!!!&#8221;However, I HATED&#8230;. And I mean HATED the best friend.  How dare she judge something that she  any doesn&#8217;t know anything about!  Yeah, I know that some people experience abusive relationships but I get soooo frustrated with people who believe these relationships are all abusive.  Any relationship can be abusive.  Even this book points out their tag:  safe, sane and consensual.  People really need to focus on that and not their unfounded beliefs&#8230;&#8230;I enjoyed Drake and Kate&#8217;s relationship.  He made sure she knew that she would be safe.  He was also extremely honest with her even about his own emotions.  &#8220;It&#8217;s OK.  I know you&#8217;re nervous.  A bit excited.  You know what?  So am I.&#8221;  He used his own honest emotions to help her calm down.  I also loved that he had a psychology degree and they analyzed the realities of being &#8220;bare&#8221; to someone and not sexually bare but emotionally bare.  AMAZING!!!  She even implied that men just have sex and they are not open emotionally with sex.  Men have sex.  Women make love.  I found this concept very interesting and it was woven very nicely into this book.  Only a talented author could seamlessly put that into a book.  It challenged me to understand the psychology behind sex and their defense mechanisms.  It also touched on society&#8217;s influence on sex.  Women are taught that sex is bad, but yet men are placed on a mantel for being a playboy.The BDSM in this book was written beautifully.  When done right, a writer has the ability to show you that a taboo subject can be wonderful, pure and exhilarating.  Most people worry about the power differential, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be about that.  This is the perfect book for someone wanting to be introduced to the BDSM lifestyle through books.  The author also gives you a taste of the other no so come things that would be considered taboo as well.  Electricity&#8230;..Male-on-Male.  (Not so sure about the electricity myself, but hey that is the point of the phrase &#8220;to each their own&#8221;).There were some formatting errors when the legal agreement was laid out on my iPad, but overall was well written.Stars:  4.5 stars.  I tend to like angst in my books and would have preferred just a little bit more in order to get 5 stars!Reviewed by Melissa :)

$REVIEW.: I read the last two books of the series before I started reading the first two, sort of out of order but they don't have to be read in order, and man I love these books! I will most definitely be reading them over and over again and I cannot wait for Lynn to write more!To Catch a Wolf is wonderful, full of funny moments and sad moments, idiots that you want to smack because of the way they're behaving and those you want to just squeeze until their eyes pop out! Eric the Alpha is not your typical Alpha, then again Jamesburg isn't your typical town! And poor Izzy; the things she deals with is astounding. I loved the book so much I read it in a few hours, actually growling when someone or thing interrupted my reading!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book but then I did jump into the pages with low expectations due to the low price
 I love time travel fiction so happily bought this book as soon as it appeared on my recommendations list.The story tumbled along nicely and wasn't as predictable as most time travel stories tend to be


 The plot was more complex than I had anticipated and the historical accounts all tied in nicely with the fiction

 The characters were believable and colourful and I enjoyed being a part of their lives for a little while
 The twists were a pleasant surprise and I found myself wishing for an immediate sequel when I read the last page
 A nice, easy read with a feel good glow at the end

I do hope there is a sequel as I find I really do want to know what happens to Tara next.It won't appeal to all time travel fans due to the twists but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

$review_text.: Wings: A Novel of World War II Flygirls by Karl Friedrich is a historical fiction book about the Women Airforce Service Pilot or WASP. The WASP were part of the US Army, before the Air Force became its own entity.Sally Ketchum came from a poor family of dirt farmers, her mundane life were changed forever once she met a Tex, a pilot who makes his living barnstorming. However Tex died in an accident and Sally enrolls in the Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) program.At the school, known as Avenger Sally learns to fly planes, large and small, contended with sexism, egoism on part of her commanders and fellow WASP , and high powered Washington lawyers hell bent on shutting the program down.Wings: A Novel of World War II Flygirls by Karl Friedrich is a fascinating book centered around strong female characters. It is no secret that I love World War II book and the stories which come out of that period of time never cease to amaze me.The book is rich in history and does justice to a group of women which, until recently, it seemed that history forgot their magnificent contribution to the war effort. This select group of young woman, 1,074 to be exact, were pioneers, heroes, role models and very much as pilots as their male counterparts.This novel is readable and fun. The author does a fantastic job make the WASP candidates as determined, intelligent, resourceful and capable individuals who are getting a shot at making something out of themselves regardless of class, social standings or background.I did find the dialogue a bit clunky and a characterization which played up to certain stereotypes, but that was part of the fun of the book. The plot was over the top entertainment, the protagonist, Sally, seemed to be the one to find herself involved in near fatalities which she only survived due to her tremendous flying skills honed during her barnstorming days.However, the details of the WASP program and the airplanes are what made the book worth reading for me. I have heard of the WASP program but never really read anything about it. Mr. Friedrich has a marvelous ability to combine technical writing and ease of understanding difficult subject mattes (aeronautics, maneuvering, learning to fly etc.).It was astonishing to me to learn of the way the U.S. military treated women during World War II. I've been in the military and while sometimes resentful of the support personnel who were drinking cake and sipping coffee in town square while I was eating mud on a cold night (that's the way I envisioned them anyway), in hindsight I always appreciated them. Once I worked my way up the ranks (not too high), I learned how valuable they actually were.Coming from this point of view, it seemed incredible and idiotic that the top brass didn't recognize what the support at home always knew. How valuable they actually are.

$review_text.: Untamed magic is not the worst book I've come across, but it's a far cry from the best
The bond between the characters seemed incredibly rushed
The sex scenes were pretty pointless and honestly not the best I've ever read
This book is mostly about the main characters having sex and not much else in between
I think this could have been a better story if the author had just taken the time to develop her characters, their world, and their romance.

It would have totally ruined the entire book and I wouldn't have been able to continue reading.Helen struggled with the loss of her dad and basically her entire family.  She also had inner turmoil about deciding to take up photography again after 18 years.  Something she put away for Cassie, when she thought it caused her pain.Cassie too was trying to find her young self as needed to start feeling again after the loss of two of her band mates, her sister in law and friend.I absolutely loved this book.  The charatcers were wonderful together.  My wife and I have been together for 17 years and this book just made me smile.  Together they were able to open up and discuss their feelings.  They also found a new desire for one another that had been missing for years.  Well done.

I've really enjoyed the Afterlife series to this point and now I'm just over it.  I'm sorry Stephanie, but I've read hundreds of books (several hundred actually) and this is the first I find I can't finish. It's not that the characters are bad, as I do really like Jared and Sigurd, and even Kiera, but I just can't keep reading something that isn't going anywhere.  I'm tired of the wild goose chase, the cryptic messages, that are WAY TOO LONG and its hard to remember the details.  Frankly, I'm bored.  I wish I had read the reviews before I spent the $10 to buy Quarter Moon but I was so excited I didn't want to read any spoilers. Had I known, I would have waited for Book 5 in the hopes something actually happens.

$review_text.: This is one of those books which you wish you could get people to read.It centers around Ludwig Wittgenstein a philosopher who I've tried to read and who I can't pretend to understand.He's most famous for  saying whereof we can not  speak , we must remain silent.Wittgenstein was a very strange man who came from a very strange family.Duffy lays it out in a brilliant, compelling fashion. Some reviewers clearly think this book drags , I was  riveted.Much of the book focuses on Wittgenstein's relationships with Bertrand Russell and G.E.Moore.These can't really be said to be friendships in large part because Wittgenstein was a man who didn't go in for that sort of thing.If you are my age and remember Russell from the '60s it is also amusing to encounter a "young" Russell.The Russell we saw was a Methuselah always going on about how bad the US was and he should know having been around since creation.Subsequent to reading this book I read Nicholas Mosley's HOPEFUL MONSTERS and they make a good combination ,a kind of dissection of the British intelligentsia.I should also point out that Wittgenstein and Russell were fascinating men who lead interesting, unusual lives that are well worth reading about.( Notice I'm not trying to make that claim about Moore).

At the end of that story I was introduced to Kat, during a deliciously naughty scene, which left me anxiously awaited the release of this story!Did it live up to my expectation - MOST DEFINITELY!!It was all kinds of messed up and wrong, but oh so right&#8230;.did that even make sense!? Chris was all kinds of nasty but for some reason, the relationship between him and Kat seemed like it was &#8216;supposed&#8217; to be, again it seemed so wrong but so right!Add Chris&#8217;s best friend Andreas to the mix and what follows is a lot of dom/sub/slave scenes, breaking and training! Kat is a tough cookie and doesn&#8217;t break easily; she attempts to escape a couple of times but is re-captured and punished for her actions! I found the training and sex scenes extremely disturbing yet EXTREMELY arousing at the same time!The side story of human trafficking was very well done. It also bought about some extremely hot girl on girl action! My inner lesbian was purring ;)As for the epilogue.....I think the author might just be a sadist herself ;)I received an ARC of this story in exchange for an honest review&#8230;short version, BRILLIANT I LOVED IT!Well done Cari, bring on the next instalment!

$REVIEW.: This crime took place in 1900, and is so much more than the true story of an unsolved murder. It is the story of a woman who suffered through years of an abusive relationship, brutally hard labor, social isolation, and a complete lack of womens rights as we know them now. Well researched, and in meticulous detail, the story comes to life and offers the reader an inside look at the life of farm women of that era. Although we may never know the complete truth about who committed this murder, it offers a very fascinating look at life at the turn of the century.

I loved both Dalton and Rory, and while they were the focus of the book you also got to see how most of the other McKay family members were doing! I also have never been so happy to read that someone had been killed off

$review_text.: I have been a Christian for two decades now and cannot deny it--the Bible is a difficult book to understand. Sure there are parts of it that are so simple that even a child can explain them. But to know the Bible well, to know how it all fits together, to know how it applies to me all these years after it was written, requires dedication, hard work and skill. Though there are many books that teach how to dig into the Word and to learn from it, many do so in a way that is difficult to understand for new Christians or young Christians. Dig Deeper by Nigel Beynon and Andrew Sach steps nicely into that void."This is a book to help you understand the Bible correctly. ... We want to help you to dig deeper and find hidden riches in the Bible. We hope that parts of the Bible that previously seemed like gobbledygook will begin to make sense, and that bits that were clear already will become even more vivid and gripping." They go on to say, "Most of all, we want to help you do all this for yourself." While acknowledging the place of pastors and Bible experts, they want individual Christians to know that God has equipped them to understand the Bible on their own. And in this book they give them the tools they will need to begin to dig into the Bible on their own, mining its infinite riches.The format is very straightforward. The book is to be understood as a kind of toolkit with each chapter adding another tool to the set. Each chapter has many examples and illustrations from the Bible. And, of course, there are exercises that give the reader a chance to practice using these tools on his own.Among the tools are:* The author's purpose tool* The context tool* The structure tool* The linking words tool* The vocabulary tool* The translations tool* The repetition tool* The genre tool* The Bible time line toolThough no passage will require all of these tools, the reader will soon find that he can apply several of them to any passage and in that way begin to build his knowledge of it.Ideal for young Christians or Christians who are eager to begin a new depth of Bible study, Dig Deeper does just what it promises--it provides tools for understanding the Word of God. In his praise for the book Kent R. Hughes says that he will keep a few copies handy to give to others and even to refresh his own preaching. And Jay Thomas, who serves as College Pastor at College Church in Wheaton, Illinois, says that he would be glad to put it into the hands of any of his students. This exactly that kind of book--one to read and one to keep on-hand, ready to give away. I recommend it for both purposes.

 While reading I thought hey this concept could be really good in real life

 Asia and Dexter were good together, but I felt that Asia fell too fast for Dexter, and there really wasn't much there to back those feelings up to me
 Dexter's epiphany of his feelings came out of nowhere as well
 This book can really use an epilogue because I'd like to know what happened to these two, and if Dexter's new business model worked

 We were left hanging a bit in the end


 Overall I thought the story was ok


 I think it needed a bit more length to make Asia and Dexter's love more believable, and as a mentioned before a wrap up of what happened afterward would have been nice.

And this is an excellent book for getting to be "in the know" fast when you're in the middle. You'll find most the classics you "should" know with just enough of a twist to make them fit the contemporary palate.The book has well balanced directions - explicit enough for anyone to follow but not condescending. An enough of a personal note to make the book interesting to browse. And if you are as uninformed as I on the subject of mixed drinks, browsing is exactly the right approach. If you are trying to find something in particular, the organization is somewhat mysterious. If you're browsing to find something to strike your fancy, it's organization is perfect.

I love, love, LOVE this series and Evacuation most definitely did not disappoint! There really are no words to describe it, awesome? Amazing? Incredible? None of those words do Evacuation justice, it is phenomenal! From the first page I was swept away yet again and it was like I had never left Meric! I was so excited to be back with these characters, I especially adore Drexton, Beliza and Markella!  I don't want to risk spoiling it for anybody, but let me just say, I didn't think I could be anymore entranced by Shaw but I was proven wrong, if you love Shaw and want to know more about him , you 're gonna go nuts over what is in this one! Evacuation is full of amazing twists and turns, many of which I did not and would not in a million years have seen coming! Jennifer Hartz is a master not only of fantasy but also suspense as it all came down to a killer cliffhanger that left me whining yet again about how much Jennifer tortures her poor readers! LOL!!! I am so in love with this series, they are books I have been waiting all my life to find!  I think that Evacuation is my favorite so far! There is no possible way Evacuation could have been any better, it is absolutely perfect! My only complaint is that Desecration the next installment isn't being released until December! I cannot wait for it because I am positive it will be out of this world!!! If you are a fan of this series you will not be disappointed by Evacuation! If you haven't started this series yet, then what in the world are you waiting for? Go get them now!

$review_text.: Fans of Ashley Knight already know how amazing the Fins Trilogy was and we&#8217;ve been waiting anxiously for what would come next.  Falwyn is no disappointment!  Vivid characters, action, adventure and love awaits in this tale you can really get lost in.  Lara Dupree isn&#8217;t your run of the mill female heroine.  She feels she&#8217;s weak but finds a strength inside herself that is admirable and above all believable.  Draven can&#8217;t always save her, but she does fine enough on her own and gets herself out of jams in the most interesting if not quirky ways.  In the end, they usually have Draven freaking out but underneath you can tell he&#8217;s amazed.Knight&#8217;s secondary characters feel just as complex as her primaries and you can see there are openings for her if she wishes to make Falwyn a series.  They have quirks and desires of their own, which tells me they each have a story of their own. Some of which we hear about and some we&#8217;re just left to wonder about.  Add the masterfully written and rather compelling plot and you&#8217;ll find yourself wondering which characters you should trust or like.While you&#8217;re trying to figure out who you feel the main characters should or shouldn&#8217;t trust, Knight proceeds to wrap us up in several plotlines that makes the reader leave the real world behind for a time.  Are Draven and Lara destined to be together?  Who will stand in their way? Is there a war coming?  If so on what fronts?  Why is this happening?  Why is that happening?  Who is that?  ( hehe no spoilers here! )  It was enough for me to forget my ever nagging back pain for a while.  At the end, I was screaming &#8220;WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?!?!!  No.. There was no way that was SUPPOSED to happen!&#8221;  I love a book that evokes a response from me.  That is why Ashley Knight is on my to watch list and I always clear my schedule for her books.Now&#8230; I wait.  Which is why my job as a reviewer is a double edged sword.

$review_text.: Tons of baby boomers grew up with 'Gunsmoke.' As a youngster I can vividly remember Marshall Dillon stalking through Dodge City's Boot Hill in the show's opening moments, commenting on the tragedies that made up frontier life as mournful music played in the background. As I grew up I and my family were loyal fans, marveling at the wonderful characters and plots presented year after year. 'Gunsmoke' set the standard for TV westerns. Now, at last, it has a proper tribute in Ben Costello's oversized volume dedicated to what he terms 'an American institution.'This is a great book, well-researched, well-written and well-illustrated. The show and its marvelous cast of characters comes alive again in this warmly affectionate volume. It is a shame someone didn't undertake this years ago when Milburn Stone and Amanda Blake were still with us. And I was disappointed that James Arness apparently chose not to contribute but perhaps he feels he has told his story in his recent autobiography. In any case, we should be grateful for the work Costello did. The book is filled with wonderful reminiscences from so many 'Gunsmoke' alumnus along with tons of photographs. You couldn't ask for a finer tribute!Highly recommended!
$SUMMARY.: Wonderful Tribute to THE Classic TV Western!

$review_text.: I like biographies.  I really, really like biographies but this one was a bit of a slog.  If I was writing a term paper or wanting to assign a reference book for a student, this would be a go-to book but as an enjoyable read, it fell flat.  The information is well-organized, there are many excerpts from actual letters to and from G.W. Carver, and the book is obviously well-researched, but I was still just a bit bored.  When I start a book, I'm usually finished in a day or two but this one kept sliding off my radar.  Perhaps my tastes have been a bit tainted by the terrific narrative non-fictions that are coming along, much like trying to snack on broccoli after candy bars.Overall, despite the slow pace this book is full of solid research and factual writing.  Not quite my cup of tea, but a worthy effort and worth looking into if you have a term paper due soon.I received this book for free from BookSneeze for this review as part of their blogger review  program.

$review_text.: As I began reading this novel I didn't quite understand the reasoning behind the author putting a note at the beginning where he seems to apologize for or at least explain the lack of hard science in this novel.  That part of the story didn't worry me very much, but because it was initially called to my attention I found it hard to stop looking for the "missing" hard science facts.  Anyway, the author is correct, there is some discussion but not many  facts of science involved in how Ellis Rogers travels to the future.So, what about the story?  I have to admit to being disappointed by the sheer ordinariness of the novel.  This takes place far into the future and would seem to have been fertile ground for inventing some unusual and interesting aspects of the life Ellis found.  Instead it reminded me more of most of the clich&eacute;s of futuristic times that I've come across in books, television, and movies.  There wasn't anything really innovative and while it was adequate to telling the story, it certainly didn't inspire me or even make me wonder overmuch about how things worked.  A single incident of time travel wrapped around a murder investigation needs, or should have, enough possible suspects to at least make me work at trying to figure out what is going on.  The one orchestrating the murders was much, much too predictable.  Instead what I found was the story of a sensitive man who met other sensitive earthlings and instantly managed to adjust to their advanced world.  If you are looking for a thoughtful, caring character who encounters a whole world filled with almost docile people who help him work through his psychological problems he brought with him from his own time period, you've picked the right book.

$review_text.: I was provided this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.I was hooked on Whatever It Takes by the end of the first chapter, addicted after the second, and by the end of the book I declared this to be one of my favorite reads of 2013.  This book was absolutely amazing.  It is a tale of the perfect couple- Gavin and Emma.  They have what their friends and family consider the perfect marriage.  They balance and complete each other."Gavin was my rock. I was his tranquility."But one bad decision brought their entire lives to a screeching halt and brought with it the possibility of breaking the couple beyond repair.This book was an emotional roller coaster with its tale of marital cheating and its consequences.  Emma is shattered  when Gavin admits to a one night stand with his ex-fiance.  Gavin wants to work to move past his indiscretion and repair their marriage while Emma wants nothing more than to run and escape the pain.These characters are flawlessly written.  You can feel Emma's pain, anger and hurt like their a living viable entities."It was a moonless night, the sky dark and lonely. Exactly how I felt."You hurt and cry for Emma. Her pain grips you.And Gavin...he says it best,"I was an a**hole."Yes Gavin, you were.  His impulsive actions wreak such devastation that makes you want to never forgive him, but he acknowledges his wrongdoing and is willing to pay the penance for it.  The amazing thing about this writing is even though Gavin has done wrong by Emma and you want to hate him.  You can't.  There is such honesty and earnestness in his apology and you see past his transgressions to the pain in his soul and the devastation it will reap if he loses Emma,  the one thing that matters the most to him.This book is also a tale of irony.  Gavin cheats with his ex in order to exact revenge upon her because she had cheated on him while they were together.  Yet Gavin turns around and does the exact same thing to Emma.  It was at this point that I wanted to yell and ask Gavin, "What were you thinking?"I love how the author takes us there.  The reader is simply not a bystander but an active participant in this story.  Every moment of pain, every teardrop that falls and every sweet and tender emotion can be felt.  The story reaches off the page and grips you and doesn't let go- not even for a second.The character development throughout the story is divine.  We see Emma go from a slightly neurotic, insecure young woman to a lioness, demanding to know answers and raging against her pain in order to begin the healing process.  We also witness Gavin change from a suave, smooth talker to a man willing to humble himself in order to save his marriage. Kudos to the author for creating such strong characters that have flaws and make mistakes.Whatever It Takes is an absolutely superb story that at no point lags.  It is an intelligent, thought provoking, emotion gripping, heart wrenching, romantic tale of pain and forgiveness that will leave you breathless.5 out of 5 stars isn't enough.

I really just stayed on my literary toes with this book. Nothing was as I expected and turned out a million times better then what I expected! I loved the updates on past characters and how they meshed so great with the Sammi and Ellis. (Yes, Alexis is still too damned cute!! ) Ms. Collins wrote this book fabulously. I really didn't expect mystery and intrigue but hellz yeah! It was there. I loved the amped up sex. She took it to a whole new level. Not raunchy but I definitely felt the intensity. The chemistry between Ellis and Sammi was mind blowing and had me thinking back in my life wondering if I'd ever had that. I adore the quirky friends. And I really did appreciate that there were feelings presented from Devin.

If you are looking for an entertaining rocker story, this book is for you. Mankin builds lots of chemistry between the two main characters and I actually really enjoyed the second half of this story as the tension and angst between Marcus and Avery builds to a very satisfying conclusion.There are several interwoven story lines in Book #3 and I really enjoyed the presence of the guys from Tempest. Watch out for sexy Bryan &#8216;Bullet&#8217; Jackson! The author creates lots of chemistry between Bryan and Avery, and tension between Marcus and Bryan, and I would love to read more of Bryan&#8217;s story. There is a heartbreaking scene involving him that really gives a glimpse into his tortured soul.But Love Resolution is truly Marcus and Avery&#8217;s story and Mankin really delivers on the intensity between the two characters. All in all, a very enjoyable story about the world of rock and roll, filled with lots of very memorable characters.(ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review)

$REVIEW.: The final instalment in the sweeping saga by Catherine Cookson, this time mainly featuring the offspring of Barbara (named the Mallen litter) and Michael's daughter Hannah. This is actually probably one of the saddest in the trilogy, I found, but still captivating. The Mallen curse is rife throughout the trilogy, but none moreso than in this one. Will the curse end with Barbara's boys? While he Mallen streak is the telltale white streak of hair in the males, in the woman it is more the somewhat stubborn and wicked ways. While the books are rife with drama, scandal, passion and pain they are written tastefully without colourful language and descriptive sex scenes.Begin your journey with the Mallens with this book before moving onto &#34;The Mallen Girl&#34;, and finally &#34;The Mallen Litter&#34;, and you won't be able to put them down. I couldn't.

$REVIEW.: I love this book. It has a wealth of information about every aspect of your cat. I especially appreciated the chapter on vaccines. I always suspected that our pets are being over-vaccinated and this book confirmed it. One of my cats has suffered from allergy-type symptoms on and off for most of his life with no definite diagnosis from several different veterinarians. (They just keep prescribing steroids to shut off his immune system. And for 2-3 weeks, my cat has a different personality, the meds would make him very irritable and constantly hungry. Prednisone is nasty stuff.) His symptoms matched several of the 'side effects' listed in this chapter. Ms. Yarnall's book has given me the tools I need to open a discussion with my veterinarian regarding vaccinations and some other treatments. I have also begun the transition to a more natural, species appropriate raw food diet. When I first started, there were days when it seemed rather daunting, (cats need a lot of time and patience), but this book has given me the confidence to stay the course. I highly reccommend it for a more natural, holistic way to raise your cat. It is both easy to read and understand.

$review_text.: Frankly, most of Amazon's short fiction is a lost cause, that no amount of fixing up could fix. This story, however, takes place in a well thought-out setting, and the dialog is not merely exposition in masquerade. The action sequences are crisply reported in a way that doesn't force the action, but doesn't hold it back, either. There are economies of wording that the author misses, but all can be put down to personal preference.The one inexcusability that marks this work as amateur could have been corrected by a good copyeditor. Professional writers don't confuse "their" and "there"; they don't say something "laid in the wet grass". And "collude" doesn't mean what this writer thinks it means. These things ARE inexcusable; a reader should never have to make allowances for the writer.The story takes place in a future when androids outnumber humans by, in some places, 5-to-1. The central character, an android designer, chafes at government restrictions. And then she makes an interesting discovery.The author uses a bit of shorthand that chafes, a bit: she calls her robots "androids" even though they resemble animals, not humans. (Furry fans should be gratified.) She explains that the real technical design term is "ani-droid" but that in common speech, lazy tongues tended to drop the extra vowel.  (And we won't go into the fact that androids, if designed after females, should properly be called "gyndroids".)Lily, the protagonist's android (or ani-droid) companion, makes an interesting observation. When asked "What do you think it would be like to be human?" she explains that androids experience downtime when they are not interacting with humans and are therefore not expected to give logical responses, during which they use their thought processes to correlate filed-away data. She parallels this with human "dreaming", and then gives the thoughtul answer that she supposes being human would be like dreaming all the time.The story is worth reading. Make allowances.

I felt it was boring and it was hard to keep my interest. It started off very good but after the 3rd chapter is when it went downhill. I felt that there was too much dialogue between the adults and kids. It's a shame I didn't like this book cuz I enjoyed the first one. In my opinion she didn't focus on making sure there was interesting content. It was boring. If you really want to know what happens after part 1 the first 3 chapters solve the issues from book 1. After that nothing significant happened.

$review_text.: As a kid, I loved reading the Honey West books.  I think I started in 1964 after Honey's appearance on Burke's Law, a show I greatly enjoyed.  When Honey got her own series, I was there.  I loved it and watched every episode and I continued reading the Honey West novels, now with Anne Francis on the cover.  I was always disappointed that Honey was only a half-hour series and more disappointed when it was cancelled after only one year.I appreciate the author deciding to write this book about a series he obviously loved.  However there is just so much you can write.  There is a brief history of Honey West: the books and the tv series. Afterward, there are a series of interviews with Gloria Fickling (the surviving member of the husband and wife team that created Honey,) Anne Francis, John Ericson, Honey's stunt arranger, etc.  There are brief histories of individuals no-longer with us: Irene Hervey, the stuntwoman who doubled Anne Francis and Bruce the Ocelot.  Afterward, every episode of Honey West is summarized in detail.  I don't suggest you read the summaries if you have not watched the episodes since they give everything away.  The author does not give any critical opinions as to whether the particular episode is any good or not.Most of the interviews feature similar questions: "What was it like working with Anne Francis?" "What was it like working with John Ericson?" etc. etc.He ends his interview with Anne trying to talk her back into acting.  Sadly, this is now a moot point since Anne Francis left us recently.  (I met her years ago at a movie memorabilia show and had her sign some Honey West items that I had, she seemed like a very nice woman.)I really don't want to criticise this book, the author's heart was in the right place.  However there is very little there with the exception of the detailed summaries of every episode.  However, as stated, the series only lasted 1 season so there is only so much you can write.  If you remember this series with great fondness, want to see several nice black and white pictures of the beautiful Anne Francis as Honey or want to know a little bit about each episode before watching the dvd,(remember not to read the entire summary,) then you will probably enjoy it
$SUMMARY.: Theres Just So Much You Can Write About a Series that Lasted 1 Year.

$REVIEW.: This is the worst book I have read in years. There are several good plot ideas that were not developed - i.e. the grandmother's power of &#34;visions&#34; that related to the &#34;visions&#34; of the granddaughter's powers. The plot was not drawn out to a good conclusion, it was simply broadened with words and the ending was awful.

$review_text.: Jack the Ripper was the name that was given to an unidentified serial killer in 1800's London. He typically murdered female prostitutes, mutilating them after slitting their throats and removed some of their internal organs. This case, has been widely discussed, researched, and even been highly subjected to speculation; from some people thinking that the killer was a doctor to the possibility of other worldly influences. As you can tell, the killer was never caught. However, this case has inspired several works of Fiction; such as Robyn DeHart's novel The Secrets of Mia Danvers.The Jack the Ripper case has always fascinated me and, after reading this book, I am even more intrigued. I felt like I was transported back to that time and place. It kept me so intrigued that I forgot some of my other responsibilities just so I could keep reading until the end. Who knew a historical romance, with a main character who is blind, could be so hot!? As most of you know, I've never been a fan of historical romances, but Robyn DeHart has changed my mind in the past, and she has done it again with this book.One thing that is really hard to accomplish is having description when your main character is blind. But, this author did it expertly. I absolutely fell in love with the characters. Alex was not only swoon-worthy and romantic, but he was a bit of a rebel as well. He was so sexy that it was kind of inappropriate for the time period. He was gorgeous AND sweet.Even though it didn't end the way I was expecting, this book was expertly written and had me entranced through every page; I could not stop reading! It was so well written that I was sad when it ended, but I can not wait for the sequel. I hope and pray to Mother Nature that there will be a sequel... The author informed me that it comes out in November, so we're safe.Pick up your copy today!

$REVIEW.: I kept seeing this book on my "recommended" lists and of course the title enthralled me!  I own my gr gr grandparents' old homeplace in Fayette County, WV, and I immediately put on my "wish list".  I started reading it yesterday morning and finished it last night - I could not put it down!  There was not one thing in this book that didn't grab my interest - the introduction of the Shaman was wonderful......and unexpected.  The writing was very well done, I felt main character's sorrow and also the children's. This author was able to draw me into each character and make me feel for them as well as get to know them. I immediately thought "that was the perfect read for me".  Cannot wait for Mr. Lake's next book and have already ordered another one of his previous works.  I have my favorite authors and will keep up with and read anything published by them - Mr. Lake has become my newest!!  My only negative comment about this book? It wasn't nearly long enough - did not want it to end! Keep 'em coming!

$review_text.: Choices: The reaper must save his daughter from eternal bondage to Death.This is a continuation of the story in the first book and it was quite good, I liked the character a lot and the whole premise. 3.5*sSiren: This was very short and sweet but likable. 2.5*sMuse: Unfortunately, I just didn't get this at all. 1*Mourning: A Son's Good-bye. Told from the sons' POV of the man in book 1, something to think about. 2.5*sEscape: I Liked it. 3*sWraith: Anne, Wraith and Lena must find a way to break the curse before it destroys them all. - Again really good, stood out as one of two best stories and I enjoyed it. 3.5*sExtra Short Story! Fairy FoiblesA quite funny story about the best intentions turning into the worst possible outcomes. 3*sI am reviewing these books together, in my opinion they could have been one book. I enjoyed these short stories, some weren't more than a page long but always thought provoking. I would say they were easy to read, quite imaginative and a nice way to spend a couple of hours. I think what made these books for me were the longer stories - Choices & Wraith. I would love to see a longer book of them, maybe brought up to date in the modern world. I think they would make a good read by modernising them and maybe introducing a romantic element, it would do wonders for them and I would read it. I only had a problem with Muse, I just didn't get it at all, but that didn't affect the rest of the book at all which was good. I didn't like the way Choices and Wraith were split over the two books either, if it were me and I needed to split them, I would have part one at the beginning of the book and part two at the end, one larger story per book not split and put in separate books, what if a reader couldn't get hold of book two and was left unsatisfied - I like a conclusion not to be left in the air. All in all though it was a nice read with some good short stories, I liked it.

Ms. Connor has me constantly laughing out loud with the many humorous situations and language of her main character, Ginny. Never knowing what she will say or do, keeps me on the edge of my seat.  What a refreshingly honest author that can bring to life a charmingly realistic character.  I cannot imagine anyone coming away without honestly good feelings after reading this series. At the age of 65, I am rarely impressed. This is an author I would love to meet!  She just has to be somewhat like Ginny -refreshingly honest plus a great sense of humor!

$REVIEW.: And she was also gay?  I found this book so intriguing and suspenseful.  Anyone may love the shoot 'em up mafia shake down melodrama, but this was much more intense.  Nothing is as it seems and I was happy it strayed from the typical, money, drugs, and killing at random that most mob books provide.  I think what made this book roll so smoothly was the fact that the Don is a girl.  The plots within plots all woven by one person was mind blowing.  Calculated, cunning.  I was racing through the pages wondering what would Cain do next and also wonder WHY?  This is definitely a book that everything happens for a reason not matter how obtuse.

$review_text.: This book may offer the best answers I've ever read to the question, &#34;How can the ordinary people of a civilized nation allow their government to be taken over by mad, evil leadership?&#34;This is not a typical childhood memoir, but Fest recalls memories of his father taking a principled stand against the Nazi regime despite personal and professional loss and its effects upon his wife and five children


Each was affected in his or her own way
Although there were family friends who shared these sentiments, many felt the price of not conforming was far too great for it often involved imprisonment or even death


Their resistance was principled but passive.Joachim's school years as Hitler came to power and consolidated his hold on the German nation involved typical boyhood activities overhung by political turmoil he only vaguely understood
He was an intelligent and curious child who read extensively, serious literature beyond his years, and from his father, priest, and teachers had discussions that led him to an unusual perception regarding his country
An aunt introduced him to opera and a lifelong inspiration in classical music.The irony is that such a schoolboy is forced to transition into the German military and is taken prisoner by the Americans a little before the war comes to an end
Fest leaves as many questions as he answers, but he does not flinch from confronting the truth as he attempts to discover it


This is a must read for anyone who has ever asked &#34;What would I have done?&#34;

$review_text.: OK so first things first this is the first book of Lily White's that I have read
I had heard GREAT things about her and wonderful things about her writing

I was looking forward to reading this and seeing if she was as great as everyone was saying


I had been told that it was a dark read and that I would be surprised by the twist and turns in the story
So, it was time for me to curl up and read and I was ready to climb into the darkness and have my mind blown
So why the 4 stars? Well, I loved the story line and the characters were good


I admit I was not the biggest fan of the dear sweet librarian, Autumn


I kind of wanted to slap her and put duct tape on her mouth

She just annoyed me with her prim and proper self


I can't say to much about her or I will spoil it but she did get better as the story when on and I would be willing to leave the duct tape off her mouth towards the end but I still wanted to knock her upside the head


Lucas was a very interesting character and there were times I was in love with him and then times that I wanted to hide in a corner


I kept thinking he is crazy and needs some meds then he would be sweet and my heart would melt
Well done on that character, Lily
Then there were the other characters like the best friend who seemed a little crazy to me, the assistant to Lucas, and the detective


Again I don't want to say to much about them but they need to be mentioned and you can see what you think of them after you read it.It was a good story and I enjoyed it BUT

There is always a but isn't there? It was not as dark as I had thought it would be and the twists and turns didn't shock me as much as I had thought


I actually wasn't shocked at all and that mad me a little sad
I was also left with a few questions but nothing to major just my curious mind wanting more on the characters
Over all it was a good read and I would recommend that you grab a copy and read it if you like a little mind play and don't care if there is a little mind games going on and want an erotic story.

$review_text.: The four very long short stories in "Fujisan" are very interesting situations and the characters grapple with finding meaning
 However, the English seems almost like a cleaned-up computer translation at times and the dialogue is very stilted and unnatural even for a translation.I guess I haven't read too many books translated from Japanese but I have seen enough Japanese films to have an idea of how it should feel
 The author is widely-published and very successful in Japan but this particular book was difficult for me  to actually enjoy reading although the stories were interesting.So with the understanding that I am rating the translated version and not the original, I am giving this the benefit of the doubt with a rating of 3.5 stars considering everything and then generously rounding up to 4 rather than down to 3

That's not exactly a recommendation but again, the stories themselves were interesting while not pleasant to read.

$SUMMARY.: Interesting stories but not a smooth translation

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC Copy in exchange for an honest review by the author.First I would like to say that the cover was definitely the best choice for this book all the way to the character profiles, the story is about two different people from various clans in the highlands.Alana and Morgann are from two different clans who used to be on friendly terms and grew up together until a stake was driven between two and now they are enemy clans. Now years later Morgann has a plan but you will have to read the book to find out what he has planned. I loved Alana and her constant drive to become free (trust me she has some COURAGE and SPIRIT), and has her beauty to match it. You also have Morgann who has grown up into a strong, tall, and very handsome warrior who is only trying to right what was wronged to his family, including giving what the "stepmother" deserves.  There are a couple of characters in this book who I think just needs to be taken care of.And to add to the amazing book, the author gave an extra and added a little bit of magic (they believed in magic during those times) so it is perfect to me.  They are continuously fighting their feelings, and how long can they deny each other? LOL..Romances that are from a different time and definitely if they include a sexy highlander type warrior and magic is always a plus in my books. Mrs. Samantha Holt has outdone herself with this book, even though this book was a short length the speed to me did not feel rushed;  also, the plot and characters are well defined and thought out all the way down to the magical character you will meet when you read it.I will definitely keep my eye out for upcoming books by this author. I highly recommend this book to everyone!

$review_text.: These days, you simply have to read a Travis Thrasher novel to understand the fascination.  I cannot think of another writer that I can compare him to...he is so unique.  And every novel is a new experience, even within the same genre.And that is a very good thing!  He's found his niche in the young adult fiction genre, but don't let that label fool you.  These books have a mass appeal, with elements of romance, suspense, a lot of supernatural elements, and relevant topics.With &#34;Marvelous&#34; the story unwinds a little more on every page, evolving slowly and building as the characters reveal more and more.  The beauty of a Travis Thrasher novel is getting pulled in from page one and having to read until the final sentence to truly get the essence of the story.Don't waste time trying to 'figure it out'...just enjoy the ride and allow it to unfold as Travis planned it for you.  On a side note, abuse in any form is monstrous and turns my stomach...so be warned.My thanks to my friends at Tyndale Publishing for my advance copy of &#34;Marvelous&#34; via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: Surfing for some is a sport, but for others it is a life style.Kimo Kanapa'aka has always surfed but now he is undercover for the police department and acting as though there is nothing in his life to be concerned with but surfing. Even his parents don't know his real occupation and think he is just playing around on the north shore of Oahu. Kimo is not comfortable with the fact that he is not being honest with his friends and family, but his current situation offers him no alternative.Kimo was released from his duties as a police officer when it became public knowledge that he was gay. Even his parents were in the dark and had to learn from a TV report that their son was gay.Now he has a chance to return to the police department and a transfer to another division. The only problem is when he meets his new boss Sanford, he finds that he will be working undercover on a murder investigation. Three people have been murdered on the North Shore, and Sanford wants Kimo to investigate. He feels that the investigation has made little or no progress-and that Kimo is the right person for the job because he can fit into the surfing community at North Shore as well as the gay community.Kimo accepts the assignment and finds very little connection between the three victims but he soon begins to dig up more and more information. Mahu Surfer is a mystery that will keep you guessing. A couple of more murders happen before Kimo gets the whole story sorted out and by that time Kimo has even been threatened.This is a real page-turner and a good mystery. Some readers might be turned-off by the sex scenes but overall it is a good read. Mahu Surfer gives quite a bit of insight into what it is like for a gay man to come out of the closet. Some people understand-and others are very cruel.Armchair Interviews says: A unique blend of mystery and surfing.

$review_text.: Annie and Chase were both raised in the midst of violence; Annie was born in the middle of the Costa Brava civil war while Chase was the product of two alcoholic and physically abusive parents. They found love amidst all that violence. The difference was Annie remembered while Chase has forgotten.Fast-forward 5 years: Like a bad penny, Annie turns up in Wyoming and introduces herself to Chase as his wife then promptly faints. Chase did not have any choice but take care of a woman he had no recollection marrying or having met at all.***SPOILER ALERT***A story of love of being at the right place at the wrong time. As part of an elite military force, Chase rescued American citizens living in dangerous places. At 16, Annie was one of those Americans albeit a woman without a country because there was no paperwork to identify her as a U.S. citizen. Marrying her was the only way Chase could bring her out of the country. But an accident that left Annie for dead and Chase having very vague memories of that time.The book is a bittersweet recollection of that forgotten time between Annie and Chase. And as they remember, their own upbringing also comes into the picture. The violence they had lived through made them very wary of truly falling in love. Plus there are trust issues on both sides, thanks to their violent past.Published in 1992, the "Child Bride" is timeless. The reference to the Ford Broncho and the wars in the Middle East and in South America can put the story between the 1970s and the 2010s. Unlike other books that have been re-issued, "Child Bride" still gives the feeling of "hot off the presses." And the story of Chase and Annie speaks of finding love with the right person at the right time though circumstances say otherwise.

I thought it would be a fun book, but it turned out to be fun in a different way than I anticipated. Zombie Kong is a horror book more than anything else.I can't think of anyone who would not love Zombie Kong. It has zombies, which are fairly common these days, and it has a giant gorilla, not too common. Mixing the two together makes it into something far superior than either one is on their own. Loved it!

$REVIEW.: Review of The Antithesis by Terra WhitemanReviewed for Full Moon Bites Blog ToursAn unusual and highly complex novel of metaphysics, philosophy, and quantum physics, "The Antithesis" postulates not just one universe, but thirteen Multiverses-all of which contain hundreds of planets. Only forty of these worlds, though, are controlled by Heaven and Hell, in the form of The Atrium, housed in Purgatory. In The Atrium, a coalition of judges, all Vel'Haru-one noble and her three guardians-rule on soulcases, determining which side gets the points for each individual soul at death. The newest judge, Aleziar Czynri, is taken straight from the Nexus, turned Vel'Haru by noble Leid, the Justice Commander, and made her guardian. Alezair retains no memories of his tenure in the Nexus..or of his "before."I can honestly say that "The Antithesis" is unlike any other metaphysical novel I have read. This is Heaven and Hell, Lucifer and Yahweh, as you certainly never expected to see them. There is no shortage of passion, sensuality, character derivation, profane language, or graphic violence. Readers will keep turning the pages to discover what new wonder appears next (yes, there is planet-travelling too). I do rate this book 18+ for violence, language, sensuality.I reviewed an e-book copy provided to me by Full Moon Bites Blog Tours in exchange for my fair and impartial review.

$review_text.: I've not had the chance to read this completely yet as I am reading my soap making books first, but I have been tempted many times to glance at its contents and am not disappointed at my purchase so far.The book is nice and thick, but easy to handle, and covers a wide range of areas for home-made cosmetics and cleansers. The recipe layout is clear and concise and has good detail such as the shelf-life of the product, which is essential to know if you are looking to experiment with new recipes or sell you own products. Recipe instructions are restricted to one page which makes the book much easier to reference and work with and is indicative of the book's no-fuss style. I also love some of the titles for the recipes such as the "Out Damn Spot" Anti-blemish Elixir which throw in a subtle flavour of humour.I have given the book 5 stars in anticipation of a great read and would recommend it to anyone, rookie or experienced, looking for inspiration in organic body care, both for commercial or personal use.

$review_text.: Now I for one have had a love to hate relationship with regard to Kade


He's always come across as arrogant, selfish and so so ambivalent with other peoples feelings


We've seen flickers of concern and sympathy for Ava and Mason, but that's all flickers.This book redeems him as he actually allows himself to feel for another as he realises he is not meant to be with Ava, the start of the book is Kade blocking that void left by accepting he isn't meant to be with Ava and then we meet Grace

Grace the unstoppable, fully firing warrior


We've met her before NSC, she's linked briefly in the trilogy and Atonement and we know some of her family.Without spoiling anything these two are brought together under the worst scenario and Grace has to protect Kade, he is not obliging and is his usual self
After events unfold and Kade sees the real Grace he admits he is falling in love again and Grace feels a connection growing to Kade too, but will it be too late to save them both from the inevitable outcome from the forces at work


The walls from both come down but as always violence, deception and other factors cause heartache, death and ultimately plenty of pleasure along the way


Ava and Mason are involved in this book too, but I can't say to what degree...If you've enjoyed heart of stone series you'll love this, it is better to have read the others so you know what to expect from D H Sidebottom, if not try this book and welcome to the world of D H Sidebottom.

$review_text.: I enjoyed this story quite a bit
Pack law states that a female must take multiple males in order to help the were population but that is not something that Dana is interested in


She is a very strong character and is unwilling to bend to the law on this one


Except when she meets up with her childhood lover, Nathan and his two friends, she is starting to find that a polygamous relationship might not be so bad.I liked the characters in this story
Dana, is confused because she never wanted anyone other than Nathan but is finding herself quite okay with multiple guys at once


Nathan, who was once okay with sharing Dana, is now not so fond of the idea

John, is the sensitive type and knows how to act around Dana to calm her down

The only character I didn't really care for was the ladies man, Kody

He reminded me of the one guy in the bar using every cheesy pick up line known to man in hopes of snagging himself a girl

If you take Kody out of the equation, it would be perfect
However, that is just my personal opinion


Even though his one liners were eye roll worthy, he did add some comical relief to the story

Everyone is so tense over the situation of Dana going from "No way in hell am I sleeping with more than one guy!" to "I'll take him, and him, oh and Mr
McDreamy too!" but he just sort of goes with the flow.I thought the story flowed well and considering it is a shifter book, who's to say that the mate connection doesn't change the game when it comes to what you think you want? I look forward to reading more from this author.

$review_text.: This is one of those books that was very, very good. To the point where I had to put it down and walk away for a while because I was SO ANGRY over some of the things that were done to Helena. While I was angry for her, in the context of history and how women were treated at the time, it completely made sense. But it was still hard to read.Might I say, I get a huge kick out of seeing well known tales given little twists to keep them fresh. While book 1 took on King Arthur's story (although he was a secondary character, not one of the mains), book 2 throws us into Robin Hood's adventure. Again, not as the main character, but as someone who's still integral to the story being told.Okay. So I had some issues with some of the ways women were treated in this time. As a woman, Helena is subject to the whims of her guardian. With her guardian scheming to make a better place for herself and her family and Prince John DELIGHTED to see his gross, nasty adviser taking an interest in Helena, she's put in a very fragile position. Throw in the fact that she's masquerading as someone else to try to ferret out the truth about her father's death and it's difficult for her to object too strenuously. She does object, don't get me wrong, but her safety depends on keeping her true identity hidden so she has to be very careful.Stephen is... well, I liked him. Despite being out of favor with the king for daring to speak his mind, he's an honorable man who's still willing to rush to his king's defense if the situation calls for it. His time in the Crusades have changed him and his time with Helena changes him even further. Honestly, I LIKED the two of them together. He's willing to admit his mistakes and he's willing to push her to see her own.Very well written with enough tense moments to leave me crazy-eyed. The romance was both sweet and hot and, in the end, everyone got what they deserved. Just the way I like my books!-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal

Ever since I heard he was coming out with a prequel that could only be found on the Kindle, I knew I had to get it..and I was definitely NOT disappointed in the least. If you are a Steve Alten fan or a fan of Megalodon, then this e-book is definitely one you want to get.

$review_text.: I give Pull Yourself Together 3 stars for "It's OK." I felt like I could be a Thomas Glavinic fan after reading the translation of his novella-length novelThe Camera Killer. I enjoyed The Camera Killer so much that immediately after reading it I bought a copy of Glavinic's novelNight Work. I started to read it when I was offered an advanced proof review copy of Pull Yourself Together, so I put Night Work aside and read Pull Yourself Together. And now I can say that I am not a Thomas Glavinic fan and doubt I'll bother to read Night Work.I was able to read The Camera killer in one sitting, both because of its short length and because I found it to be a page turner. Pull Yourself Together is considerably longer than The Camera Killer and it is not a page turner, nor is it meant to be, for unlike The Camera Killer it is not a mystery novel.Glavinic wrote these books by following a formula, which is basically to choose a character with a unique voice to tell the story, where that voice becomes part of the story and gives us insight into the character that the character's actions alone cannot. In Pull Yourself Together the voice in which the story is narrated is second person, where "You did this" and "You did that" means "I did this" and "I did that." This worked okay for me for a few pages, after which it started to feel tired and gimmicky, at which point reading Pull Yourself Together started to feel a bit tedious.Glavinic's repeated use of the phrase, "Note to self" throughout Pull Yourself Together also struck me as gimmicky (and though I can't blame Glavinic for this, every time I encountered it I couldn't help but think of Norm MacDonald's use of the phrase in Saturday Night Live skits).Pull Yourself Together did have redeeming moments for me, some humorous, some clever and some wise. But overall I was underwhelmed. If you are considering buying a copy and you have not read any Glavinic before, you might want to first read The Camera Killer simply because it involves much less of a time investment than does reading Pull.

$REVIEW.: Emma is determined as hell to find Jesse. She was a great character from beginning to end! Usually with female characters, I find myself getting annoyed at certain points because of the ridiculous things they do, but not with Emma.Jesse is sexy and has a bit of a kinky streak to him that I like! No complaints about him whatsoever, except that he is a bit too trusting of people, and the price of trusting the wrong person almost cost Emma&#8217;s life.Andy is a friend every girl should have. He was loyal and caring for Emma but knew her boundaries and respected that&#8230; al while being a man-whore. He&#8217;s great.Ally is... an interesting character. I could never understand how authors get in touch with such a dark side to create characters like Ally, but it makes for a great story. She is the queen of all bitches. Anything and everything that she could do to try and get Jesse to love her, she does and much more. Deranged probably isn&#8217;t a strong enough word!The ending was good, but I prefer not to have open endings life this book did. The ending wasn&#8217;t a cliffhanger, but was left so that you can come to your own conclusions. It did provoke thought, but I felt like I came all this way and nothing. That would be my one issue with this book, but this is a story I can definitely read over and over.

The rest just didn't understand why we found it so entertaining.  I found I chuckled quite a few times over the silliness of it all.. It was like slapstick humor. The irony of a pig creating such havoc and all in Ireland. Quite different from any book I've read. I intend to get the second book in the series :"The Pig Comes to Dinner".

$review_text.: If you are looking for a contemporary romance that doesn't dance to the same tune as many other romances, Playing the Maestro by Aubrie Dionne might resonate well with you! The Easthampton's Civic Symphony is slowly becoming obsolete and in desperate need of new patrons, new interest and new money to keep going. Enter young German conductor Wolf Braun, looking to get his life back on track after a disastrous relationship with a beautiful, yet poisonous model. His job is to breathe new life into the group, and getting involved with any of its members. First flutist Melody Mires has sworn off dating musicians, until she lays eyes on Wolf. Too bad their first meeting hits a sour note because beautiful Melody bears too much of a resemblance to wolf's ex, but she is being set up for failure by anothers machinations in the ECS and Wolf can't just stand by. Breaking all the rules, these two find they are meant for each other, like rosin and a bow.Aubrie Dionne has written a light romance with characters that are NOT damaged beyond belief by their pasts! The angst is at a minimum, making this a perfect fast read with a little intrigue, a little romance and a plot that moves along quickly. Take this one the beach this summer!A copy of this book was provided for my honest review.

I haven't studied much about this era, but the smooth way he slides in historical details
I could follow along easy
The characters were so well written and real

I could visualize them in today's world

Macha, a wife of a High Ranking Roman Citizen, found her world changed and turned upside down when news reached her that her husband had been arrested.Through her eyes, the reader follows her as she struggles to free her husband and untangle a few mysteries.Jess Steven Hughes is an amazing storyteller and writer


His historical knowledge is flawless

I have learned so much about AD71.I highly recommend this book and Author

Enjoy!

$review_text.: The cover was what caught my eye on this book!  I read it a couple of months ago, but never wrote a review.  I decided since I wanted to leave reviews on Jayson James' books, I would leave one on his short story.  Though I liked this story, it was no where near as good as "Finding Our Way" or "Tormented Discovery."  I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars being I think it is worth reading and getting a feel for the way Jayson James writes.  I have read much worse short stories, with no where as cool covers.
$SUMMARY.: Short, Yet Good Read

$review_text.: Very good book.  Amusing, interesting, and well written.  My only complaint was the ending.  There was build up but then the story just dropped.  Made the story feel incomplete.  Other than that though, it was a very good book and I couldn't put it down.  Well done Ms. Darcy.

$review_text.: I sat down and read this usually just before I was going to bed.  It is good enough to hold my attention, but I generally did not care what was happening to the characters, though I followed the development pretty carefully.  It may tweek your interest.

$review_text.: This paraphrase is already noticeably dated, and was originally written to address specific problems of a specific locale and people. However, it's unique and practical approach is still refreshing to read. I think other admirers of Clarence Jordan, Koinonia Partners, and Habitat for Humanity will find it interesting.Other, free and Koinonia approved electronic versions of Jordan's entire Cotton Patch translations can be found on the web, but the Kindle version definitely has advantages (and of course is always available when offline once downloaded to one's device).

$review_text.: Zoey Delacourte who is curvy girl who just gets fluff pieces from her editor at the Courier, decides that she is going to dig into a recent murder execution style that involves biker gangs. She goes uncover in the Kings Club of whom Jax Traeger & Hunter Ericksen are the presidents. The two find her hot and decide to have some fun. So here we have Zoey a sexy curvy girl with two hot guys with tattoos who are all over like they are starving.  They know they are not good for her and that they need to stay away, but they cannot stop thinking about the hot sex they had with Zoey.  Zoey at the same time cannot stop falling for them. This book had me laughing the first time she meets the boys. That set the book off to a great start, I could not help but fall in love with these three.  This book will become one of my favorite reads for the this year. I could easily read the book again and that just shows you what a excellent read it was.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome Read

$review_text.: I chose this one quite out of the blue when it caught my eye and I read an excerpt

 I was in the right mood for something that both touched on the Pride and Prejudiced story, but also did very liberal and creative things to it
 This is not one I would recommend to those who are purists or need their variations to stick really close to the original storyline or tightly to the nature of the original characters.This one delighted me from the beginning


 It was like reading a Wonderland version in which I fell down the Pride and Prejudice rabbit hole and this was what I got.Lizzy is a Gardiner instead of a Bennet

 She still lives at Longbourn, but grows up with an eccentric and distant Viscount for a father
Jane is a much older long married sister who is still married to Charles Bingley, but he is a knight or a baronet and not the son of a man from trade

 The Bennets are the comfortable and fashionable relations in London that she goes to when her aunt wants her to enjoy the Season and Aunt Bennet determines to get her a good match.Darcy is a widowed Duke with two lovely children

 He is older and his arranged marriage with his cousin Anne is behind him
 Georgiana is older than Lizzy and married to a retired Col
Fitz and has three children of her own


 Biggest shocker is that Wickham is their endearing, but poor rakish cousin on the Darcy side and he has set his sights on Lizzy and is her aunt's choice for a strong suitor.Darcy is strong armed into coming up to London for the Season and to bring along his children to be with his sister's children and his friend Bingley's children

 He has no desire to parade himself about as a prospect for a wife
 It is there that he and Lizzy Gardiner first meet

 Lizzy is charmed by the duke's children and how he is such a wonderful father unlike her own

 They encounter each other everywhere both at family gatherings and social events.He is a widower who is old enough to be her father and thinks the vivacious and full of life Lizzy won't even look at him twice amongst all the other handsome gentlemen buzzing around her that are nearer her age


 Lizzy thinks a duke and man of sense who has no interest in society is only being nice to her because of their connections through friends and family, but she can dream.But inspite of what they imagine as the barriers to standing a chance with each other, fate finds a way with the help of a pushing matchmaker set on a different match, a foolish suitor, Darcy's children and a carpe diem moment


 And that is only the beginning as they discover that marriage, family and life can be an even bigger challenge

 This story continues on and shows what life after the kiss and wedding can throw at them.So, if you are familiar with the P&P; story, you'll note from my summary that things are wildly different from just a slight variation or retelling

 Instead of being put off, I found myself quite intrigued

 Lizzy is the only character who is young and it was interesting having the other players much older.Darcy is more mellow from age and experience, but admits that he was very proud as a younger man.Bingley and Jane are an interesting blend of appearing nice and handsome when they are pretty self-absorbed in this one.Georgiana is still sweet, but she's an older and happier wife and mother of three


 The Colonel was a lively and engaging character that lit up any scene he was in.The Bennets are childless and a milder version of themselves

 Lizzy and Jane's father has a touch of the familiar Mr

Bennet to him, but he's a new creation as well.Wickham was his charming self without the evil in him

 He still gets around as a rake of sorts, but he's just shallow and flirty instead of truly bad
 Mr

Collins, Charlotte and even Caroline make an appearance and they are versions of the originals.I think that other than the lovely courtship and relationship between Darcy and Lizzy that the best part of the book were Darcy's children, James and Catherine, and his Great Dane, Agatha
 The family moments were so heartwarming

 I also loved yet another new creation, Darcy's best friend, The Duke of Bellam

 That storyline was compelling and I felt a few tears there.So why did I score it as average?  This book just ended mid-note


 I was reading along with a few plot threads still open so I didn't even see it coming

 It just stopped

 Now if I ever discover that there is a sequel that continues the story, I will be happy to come back and bump up the rating, but as it stands...there is too much left open and incomplete.Do I think it is still worth reading?  Absolutely
 It is a lovely gentle romance that hints at the passion in this love affair and marriage without getting explicit and it tells of people with both shining traits and flaws
 I loved it and recommend it to others who enjoy gentle historical romances or Austenesque lovers who can tolerate their P&P; being turned upside down and inside out.

$review_text.: This was not a great read nor was it a terrible one.  I found the main character to be over bearing and arrogant but the storyline kept me interested enough to finish the book.  There are better books available.
$SUMMARY.: An in betweener
