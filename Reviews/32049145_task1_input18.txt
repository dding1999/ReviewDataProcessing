$REVIEW.: Daniel Ocean has just been released on parole after 4 years in prison, with 10 other guys he is planning one of the biggest job ever by robbing 3 casinos at the same time.  Is he in this purely for the money or is there something else he's looking for?Ocean's Eleven is one of the smartest heist film I've ever seen, with an excellent director, a talented cast with some great chemistry, and smart dialogues.  The movie was fast paced, unpredictable, and a lot of fun to watch, there was never a dull moment.  Even though the movie lacked character development, but a decent plot and solid performances by Clooney (as Daniel Ocean,) Roberts (as Tess) and Pitt (as Rusty) more than made up for it, and created an enjoyable experience for me.I've never seen the original and therefore cannot make any comparison with the 1960 film, but I can say for sure that Ocean's Eleven is a great way to spend 2 hours at the theater, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

$REVIEW.: Much of the hype of this television movie lies in the fact that CBS refused to air it, apparently bowing to conservative pressure


This of course created a bunch of hype prior to the release of the movie, and its quick demotion to a DVD release


After watching it, it made me wonder what all of the fuss was about


The Reagans is a comprehensive, yet inch deep look at a powerful couple destined to greatness in the political world.James Brolin plays an eerie, and I mean eerie, Ronald Reagan throughout his lifetime


His acting is spot on in portraying a Reagan who is both wonderfully amiable to everyone that he meets, and yet distant to everyone who loved him the most
This Reagan is an actor through and through, and he continues his performance during his White House years


Judy Davis turns in an admirable performance as a hyper-supportive, controlling Nancy Reagan
I couldn't help but still see shades of Judy Garland in her performance here.Nancy and Ronnie struggle with many issues not uncommon today: the politics of blended families, the politics within a relationship
The movie dares to suggest that Reagan and Nancy weren't perfect demi-Gods that the conservative portion of our population elevate him to be

Perhaps it's too daring to show this man, this couple, as human, foibles and all, and perhaps, that is the nature of the controversy.Overall, very little was surprising about this movie, other than showing the onset of Reagan's Alzheimer's disease into his second term, which long has been suspected

It certainly wasn't the tell all bashing of the Reagans as some would like us to believe

If you want a glimpse into the lives of the Reagan, perhaps a perusal of this DVD would be in order.

$review_text.: The movie is great! everybody knows that! but to be a Quentin Tarantino movie it have a lot of stereotypes againts the asians.Quentin says that Hollywood movies are the ones that increase the sterotype againts the minoryties, and now he made a movie that is even worst than Hollywood. I know that he wanted to do a tribute to the martial art films, but I mean.... Not every asian people knows about swords, anime, samurais, revenge and killing people with martial arts, for example: The fist time that O-Ren (Lucy) appeared, she was quickly introduced by anime sequenses of Yakuzas killing her family, then she grewn up to be an assasin after avenging her family.. When Uma Thurman arrived in Japan, the only person that didn't know about martial arts and killig people was a lady that sells tickets in the airport.. In Japan, all the people were born with fake blood that comes out like a shower if you get cut and all the americans were born with normal blood.. If you saw Kill Bill 2 you realize that anything that is not asian is normal.There are many more things but I think that I finished for now. Like I said before &quot;the movies is great&quot; because is packed with action, swordfigthing, good story, so-so acting, great music and interesting characters. I could say that is one of the coolest movies ever since Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. The movie is &quot;whorth buy&quot; but I think that Quentin could do a great tribute movie without so many stereotype, so let's hope that he doens't make the same mistake again.Thank you for lisening! goodbye and take care.
$SUMMARY.: COOL MOVIE!!! But there are to many stereotypes!

$REVIEW.: Given the decent job Sylvester Stallone did reignitingRocky Balboa, I had decent hopes that "Rambo" might be as good. Alas, not too be. The aging John Rambo is a snake catching recluse in Thailand, still having flashback nightmares about being a supersoldier and giving 'that 1000 mile stare' to show he's still in a war zone somewhere in his head.Along come a band of arrogant missionaries who want to save the world by sneaking into Burma (aka Myanmar) and giving out Bibles and pills. John Rambo stands in the dark rain and grunts things at them until the pretty missionary (Julie Benz) babbles some nonsense about caring and he cracks. Why Rambo suddenly decides she is worth changing his mind over is never given, he just does it. Then...Big Surprise...the missionaries are caught by sadistic Myanmar goons who think fun is betting on which POW will get blown up in a race through a mine field.Thus it is up to John Rambo and a bunch of foul mouthed mercenaries to extract the prisoners. They do so in standard comic book style, all smart-mouthed quips and great big guns. The goons are creepy torturing rape machines, and so they must all be destroyed, right? Of course! And so, Rambo and his motley crew rescue the fair maiden and her friends with unbelievable amounts of blood, explosions, splatter, decapitations and screaming. The final ten minutes of "Rambo" are ridiculously surreal and dopey, including the patriotic rah-rah of making a wimpy snot-nosed pacifist into a real man by having him bash an enemy's head with a rock. USA!! USA!! USA!!Given that you have no true idea why Rambo has a thing for Sarah (Benz) or why he'd agrees to take/save her, the characters have all the depth of a blood splatter. (Even as hyper-masculine asRambo: First Blood, Part 2was, you empathized with John Rambo.) The mercs are a multi-national pack of clich&eacute;s who look down on Rambo until they suddenly decide to follow every order he gives. The missionaries, other than Sarah and Michael, are human props. It was hard to give a darn about anyone involved, as the whole movie is a gloriously shot excursive in mayhem. Unfortunately, for all the flying body parts and spewing blood, "Rambo" has no heart. It is as generic an actioner as they come, which is a huge disappointment after what Stallone did with "Rocky Balboa."

$review_text.: The show "NewsRadio" first came on TV, in 1995, just before I stopped watching sit-coms in 1996. I recall looking forward to it then, so after I finished my watching every episode of "The West Wing" in order, I looked around for something new, and I was reminded of this show, which had a lot of promise, because I enjoyed it when it first aired, I only saw the first, and maybe the second season when it was broadcast, and one of the stars is Stephen Root, who was a featured guest star on Season Seven of "The West Wing."One may be inclined to compare this to "The Mary Tyler Moore" show, but that's unfair in many ways, except that "The Mary Tyler Moore" show created the character types against which "NewsRadio played. A closer comparision is with "WKRP in Cincinnati" which was produced by the MTM, Mary Tyler Moore's production company. "Mary Tyler Moore" was stronger than both, because it had two rather than just one focal point. It played out both in the studio and in Mary's apartment.It's odd Stephen Foley is given top billing as the new station manager, who, in the pilot, is expected to fire the old station manager. We immediately see this character seems to have only the most modest amount of backbone, a strong contrast to the fire-breathing news manager, Lou Grant. His affair with Nr. 4 billed Maura Tierney seems to occupy the center of the story arcs in the first two seasons. But most of the real sparks come from Stephen Root, the entrepeneur who owns the station "on a whim", and who mixes some of the oddest quirky behavior with eminantly good business sense. The actor in the trailing, and therefore place of second highest honor, is Phil Hartman, who is a strong contrast to the hapless Ted Knight on MTM. He is totally competent, and is recognized as such by his peers in New York City Radio. In many ways Root and Hartman get most of the best gags. The "goof-offs", the roles comparable to Les Nessman and Herb Tarlik on "WKRP" are played by Andy Dick and Vicki Lewis. These are the characters whose persona tends to wear out faster than the others. Joe Rogan, the handyman / electrician has the advantage of being in the background much of the time, so it is easy for him to surprise you, as he did when he was put on the air to replace a sick broadcaster, and did remarkably well. It's not unlike the gag when Jim Ignatowski sat down at the piano and started playing beautifully (on "Taxi"). Khandi Alexander is the last listed regular star, and has a role which, in these two seasons at least, are virtually pure "straight man" (sic). I recall no lines where he casts the punch line of a joke. Her primary role is to punch holes in the windbag of Phil Hartman's character. Foley and Tierney are also prinary the straight roles against which the Dick, Root, Hartman, and Lewis play. They are the Alex Rieger ("Taxi") and Andy Travis ("WKRP") roles who try to keep things together, but rarely succeed.One thing I like about this kind of show (you expect it with big dramas like "The West Wing", but not in comedies done with about 1/10th the budget) is when they have guest stars, which average about one every two episodes. Mostly, they are "Hey, look who it is!" episodes, with people like John Ritter, Norm MacDonald, Bebe Neuwirth, and Janeane Garofalo. They add interest to a single show, and don't reappear.My main impression on seeing three or four episodes a night is that one gets very used to the quirks of the characters, and you can start anticipating their reactions. There is only one story line, the affair between Foley and Tierney, which bridges more than two episodes. It starts around episode two or three, and runs to the end of the second season. In those two seasons, not much else happens. What we don't also have is one or two "GREAT" scenes, like the infamous "WKRP" scene when live turkeys are dropped from a helicopter before Thanksgiving, which ranks as Nr. 40 in TV Guide's 100 greatest TV episodes.Each episode is a little gem. None are especially weak, and none are especially strong, in these first two seasons. This may play much better as viewing with your siginificant other than by yourself. That's what romantic comedies are for, after all.Note that I sensed none of the problems some reviewers complained about regarding "compression". It all looks fine to me, on a conventional TV, the kind I used to watch it 17 years ago.

$review_text.: First off, I would like to say that this is NOT a martial arts movie. The fight scenes were few, short, and unimpressive. The movie is entitled "The Duel," where two great sword masters will have a great duel to the death - so that is what this movie should build up to. But at the end, the duel was approximately 3-4 minutes long. And how they finished off the duel? Terrible. They could have done the finishing move at the very beginning of the fight if that's how they wanted to kill each other (if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about). If the movie had longer fight scenes with actual fighting, this movie would have been better. Especially the ending fight.However, despite the disappointing fight scenes, the humor and plot line save this movie from being a total disaster. Instead of a martial arts movie, we get a mix between comedy, mystery, drama, and action. You would have to watch the movie several times to understand what happens (as far as the mystery goes). The movie was also a bit touching between Yip and Princess Phoenix. Dragon 9 was funny. All the characters had good personalities and moved the story along well. The production and quality of this movie is outstanding. Everything is great (save the martial arts).But, if you are looking for an awesome swordfighting and martial arts, this is definitely not for you. This movie is nothing like The Matrix and the only resemblance to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is that the actors had the same skin color. Don't be fooled like I was in thinking that this was going to be a great martial arts movie just from watching the trailers. But despite The Duel's major lacking in actual fight scenes, this is still a pretty good movie.

$REVIEW.: In the beginning It's hard to see how anybody wouldn't like this fun little film. It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors .this is a movie. A good, old-fashioned, suspend-all-disbelief, Hollywood comedy that leaves you laughing The cast and crew of &quot;Showtime&quot; do a credible job of melding the buddy-copfilm genre with our society's penchant, lately, for the whole reality television business.I had serious doubts about&quot;Showtime&quot;  expected a combination of&quot;48 Hours,&quot; Beverly Hills cop~ and the plethora of buddy-cop movies, and not much more But, though there is a lot of all of these flicks in &quot;Showtime,&quot; I have to admit I had a good time watching these veterans play off of each other

$REVIEW.: This is a brutally told but compelling version of the Aileen Wuornos story.  She was a deranged psycho, sure, but Charlize Theron's "monster" performance also allowed us an insider's view into the woman and her troubled past.  While there can be no excusing her actions, this movie makes it possible at least to understand why she turned to prostitution, and then ultimately to murder.Christina Ricci is also excellent as the lonely lesbian who befriends Wuornos, and inadvertently, at least at first, sparks the violence that rages within Wuornos' troubled mind.  As the story unfolds however, the tough hooker becomes putty-like in the hands of the disatisfied, nagging girlfriend, falling deeper and deeper into trouble, in an effort to buy happiness for their most unlikely partnership.While certainly disturbing and at times depressing, you'll find yourself unable to turn away, even though you already know how this story ends.To assist the people who are watching this movie for the ...ummm.. "Cinematic experience", your chapters are six and fifteen on the DVD, and your new favorite song is "Crimson and Clover".Well performed and directed, and thoroughly deserving of all the awards that have been heaped on it.Amanda Richards, November 26, 2004

$review_text.: I Love Lucy, Mary Tylor Moore, Rosanne.  Comedy series that have, and will continue to last throughout the ages.  And now we can add Absolutely Fabulous to that list as well.  Groundbreaking in every way, this is one show that's after shock will be felt in television for years to come.  The outrageous adventures of drug addict/alcholic Patsy Stone and her fad of the moment best friend Edina Monsoon never fail to leave you in stiches.  And you won't believe the things you find yourself laughing at.  The poor, the crippled, celebrities, countries, nationalities, religons, sex, and body parts all get skewered (no to mention how they lambast friends and family)!  How people can be so dispicable in every way and still be endearing is a testament to the exemplary writing and acting.  All 24 episodes are inlcuded and although that's not very many shows compared to a US series, the quality more than makes up for it.There are bonuses but the main attraction is the show itself.  The outtakes can be very funny once you've grown to love the characters and see the actors slipping in and out of character.  On the other hand, the picute gallery wasn't done properly.  Too many of the shots are taken directly from the series and the image quality isn't impressive.  You get much better stills from just pausing the DVD.  After watching the series only on Comedy Central, it's astonishing to see how crisp and bright the image is for this transfer.  One other thing I really enjoyed was the menu screens.  They fit right in with the theme of the show and are easy to navigate.  I have a question though.  Is the singing voice on the menus RuPaul?  I hope so!  It would be a perfect addition to this FABULOUS set.Ok Darling, now buy this DVD set right away to enjoy one of the best comedy series ever.  You simply can't be disappointed sweetie!

$review_text.: I recommend this movie...That's all I will say no just kidding I have more to say. But I will say that I do recommend this movie wholeheartedly because it is a solid "superhero movie" from a different angle.Now if you don't know who Max Landis you should correct that right away. Just Google "The Death and Return of Superman". It's a 15 min. video about the comic story arc dealing with the issue where Superman dies/is killed off by Marvel comics. It is brilliant and I watched it no less than 10 times. But the reason that's important is because Max is the writer of Chronicle. Now I didn't know Max as a writer and whatnot before The Death and Return of Superman. But I've been following him ever since and I think is going to be somebody that in the future of Hollywood will do amazing things. Now why is this important?Because he wrote Chronicle and the story is compelling and interesting and keeps you wondering what will happen next. But the thing I like best is the character development. See to me I judge a movie based on how much I care about the characters and what happens to them. So many movies today skimp on character development and thus leaves me feeling like I really don't care what happens to you main character, Go-ahead run off and get killed by giant menacing robots or attacked by bloodthirsty piranha I don't care what happens to you or the rest of the people in your party.  but that is why I like this movie so much Chronicle had me wondering what would happen to these people that I had an emotional interest in and I think that is the true mark of a good movie.So that being said I recommend not watching the trailer for this movie go into a blind and you'll be much happier I think with the result. If you seen the trailer (I think they give too much away nowadays) still check this movie out if you like character development and decent story. I'm a fan but I'm Uptomyknees in like with Max Landis!Oh and by the way this movie I will re-watch in the future and that really is the foundation for a movie for me, would I watch it again. And this one hands down will be getting a 2nd viewing maybe even a 3rd viewing. Definitely a good flick and watch and Max's best is yet to come, I'm sure.

$REVIEW.: Michael Mann is the master of crime dramas, that much is clear
Heck, The Last of the Mohicans was as far away from the genre as he could get and it still turned out to be a very good film

I had high hopes going in to see Public Enemies today, especially with such a talent filled cast


Johnny Depp's acting chops are as strong as they have ever been

He doesn't overplay the part and at times seems a little too relaxed, but overall he captures the essence of the character nicely


Christian Bale has been better, but he brings the right amount of quiet intensity to the role of the man assigned with hunting Dillinger down

Marion Cotillard is beautiful here and I thought she did well with what little material she had to work with

I wish they would have gotten into the other characters in the gang a bit more and Billy Crudup as J
Edgar Hoover had less screen time than I thought he would.The pacing is a little slow at times, but there are a few realistic shootout scenes that are well down

A major flaw is that the timeline is out of order (Baby Face Nelson was actually killed after Dillinger is just one example) and it strays from historical truth at times


I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't love this movie

When it ended, I left the theater thinking that I was entertained, but also how forgettable it was


I expected more from such a good director and was hoping that the life of one of the country's most infamous bank robbers would have had more of an impact on me.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

Now I'll need to move all the DVDs over to another case to keep them from getting scratched.Otherwise, amazing show, great DVD release, Nowhere Man was way ahead of it's time when it came out, and I think it would fare better today, even with a new cast and starting from the very beginning.

$review_text.: 54,000 great fans packed the Safeco Field in Seattle. What a show it was, if you ask me I wouldn't mind this event being WMXX. I had a feeling that the night would be extraordinary and my goodness what a show.WMXIX Video Intro : pretty insprirational video to build up this huge eventRey Mysterio v. MV1 w/ Moore-On (WWE Cru. title) I got disappointed with this one actually, mostly because of Rey rey's costume. Anyways decent opener.Limp Bizkit performs ROllin' : I still love this song but they should of performed this in 2001, you know a time where people cared about them.Taker &amp; nathan jones : A-train &amp; Big Show: I got kind of disappointed that guys like Kane,RVD,the Dudleyz,Lance Storm, Hurricane and so many more guys lost their spot to someone like Nathan Jones. But whatever Taker pulls an exciting match to make his streak at Wrestlemania 11-0.Women's title Triple Threat : possibly the best women's match. goodness.By the way Jazz's arms are scary.WWE Triple Threat Tag Titles Match: ok I guess, filled with talented performersHBK v. Y2J : I was dreaming about this match for I don't know how long. My very favorite two of all time battle in the match of the night.Miller Lite Girls meet Torrie and Stacy ft. Coach : Ridicoulous segment but entertaining. Torrie is so hot...Limp Bizkit performs &quot;Crack Addict&quot; pretty good song actually but I still could not care anymore for Fred Durst.Triple H  w/Ric Flair vs. Booker T (World title) : I felt bad the Booker man lost but in a creative standpoint it made sense to make Trips retain.Hogan v. McMahon (20 Years in the Making) : One of my top five matches in and of WrestleMania, obviously not the technical geniuses they pulled off an awesome rollercoaster ride.Rock v. Austin III : I couldn't believe it, I was wishing of this match, I never thought it would happen again. Not as good as their previous encounters but still loved it.Lesnar v. Angle : Another match I've been waiting for almost a year. Not that great because of Angle's neck condition going in to it. But I respect him so much for doing it. Ending, I think I was going to cry when Brock landed square on his forehead. Shocking.Recap videoOverall awesome video if you love the whole sports-entertainment spectacle that made WWE the worldwide provider in exciting action.

$review_text.: I thought the TV show Firefly was good but not great. Serenity however rates a "great" on my personal scale. Although it builds on the same characters that were in the show, you should still be able to catch on if you've never seen it. (Although if you have, it probably makes more sense as you're able to reconnect with the characters much quicker).The story is inventive, interesting, and captivating. It also answers a few unanswered mysteries from the TV show, so if you were a fan of firefly, you'll want to watch the movie for that aspect at the very least.

$REVIEW.: This 2001 "Anne of Green Gables" is the DVD version of the superb 1986 Canadian television adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel by Sullivan Entertainment.  It is blessed with terrific casting, excellent production values, and a surprisingly faithful visual translation of the original novel.Megan Follows is superb as the redhaired Anne, a spirited and imaginative young orphan who comes to live with a middle-aged bachelor farmer and his spinster sister (in spot-on performances by Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst).  Jonathan Crombie is entirely credible as Gilbert Blythe, Anne's childhood rival and patient would-be sweetheart.  This three-hour production works in screen appearences by most of the characters from "Anne of Green Gables", including Mrs. Rachel Lynde, Diana Barrett, Josie Pye, the teacher Miss Stacey, among others.Authentic sets and lushly beautiful location shooting in Prince Edward Island and Ontario, Canada, add immensely to the visual appeal of the film.  Green Gables farm itself, Avonlea's one-room schoolhouse, and the White Sands Hotel seem just as described in the novel.Even die-hard Anne fans should appreciate the remarkably seamless translation of novel to screen.  Inevitably, the storyline has been compressed, and the order of a few events have been changed, but many scenes and whole swaths of dialogue are reproduced.  Some scenes have been redone, but the changes seem faithful to the author's intent.  For example, the episode in which an embarrassed Matthew purchases Anne's first pretty dress is now staged entirely at the store, with the aid of store clerk Alice Lawson.  The priceless closing scene, in which Anne finally acknowledges her friendship with Gilbert, allows the actors to show the feelings implied in the original text.The "Anne of Green Gables" DVD is very highly recommended to fans of the "Anne-girl" of all ages.

$REVIEW.: &quot;I got a good story, it's about a campus serial killer who murders eight students&quot; At Pendelton students battle to make the best student film which will win them the Hitchcock award, who ever wins is basicly garenteed a place in Hollywood. Amy is stuck for a movie idea for her collage thesus, so when she gets a ride from the sucurity guard, she also gets and idea, to make a movie about a serial killer who murders are all based on Urban Legends. This seems like a good idea and it gets approved but as soon as she starts she runs into problems, bad acting, other members are pissed at her for stealing their genre, oh and a masked psycho seems to be killing off her cast and crew. It all seems to start when one student kills himself because of his low grade Amy seems to suspect something is wrong, the dead students twin brother also shows up to look into the sueiside more for he is convensed his brother didn't kill himself. Amy's crew seem to be getting shorter and shorter. Compitition is a killer, now it seems as if someone is killing the computition. Lets get something straight, I love slasher movies and I truely enjoy the new breed, Urban Legends is a fantastic entry into trendy slasher movies. I found myself jumping in my seat alot of times, John Ottman really knows how to scare his audence. The deaths where compleatly edge of your seat stuff, I for one loved them. I really enjoyed the amount of suspence there was in this movie, it was great.  On to the killer, although he/she looked cool I often found myself thinking that he/she looked like a big walking micro phone, I liked the idea of changing the costume around. I found pretty much all the charicters likeable, they all seemed to have their own personality. One thing that was great was the first death, that has to be the greatest death I've seen so far in a 90s horror movie. The rest of the kills arn't really gruesome but somehow this didn't seem like a gore movie, much more to do with suspence.  Over all I truely loved Urban Legends: Final Cut and I advise fans to go see it, it's a must, and if your not a fan of the first, see it anyway, it's like a different series. 10/10

$review_text.: "The Ring" is different from almost every other horror flick out there today.  There's not a lot of gore in it.  There's no monster, per se.  And there's no big shocks until the very end.Yet it's still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.Yes, "The Ring" is one of those rare gems that keeps the suspense and intensity going throughout the film.  From the very beginning scene where two girls talk about watching the tape to the very end, which has a twist that will have you sleeping with the lights on, there is an uneasy tone to the movie that keeps you on edge, waiting to see what happens next.The acting is good in this movie, although the only person you've probably heard of is Naomi Watts, who plays a newspaper reporter who's niece viewed the tape and died seven days later.  She of course views the tape, then gets a chilling phone call that says "seven days".  Most of the rest of the film has to do with her trying to find out where the tape came from and how to prevent her from dying.  Her ex-boyfriend assists in the endeavor, just slightly lightening the mood at times.As I said the tone is very dark.  Unlike a lot of horror movies, which have some comic relief, there is nary a chuckle to be found in this one.  Much of this movie is disturbing, especially when they discover the horrible secret of the tape.  You sort of create a lot of your own fear here, because you almost always expect something bad to happen every time a character makes a move.  That adds to the tension and is one of the reasons why I liked this film so much.  You scare yourself more than this movie scares you just by thinking about it.This is definitely a "must-own" DVD if you're a horror movie fan, and the extras look well worth the price.  Finding out more about the legend of the tape and getting to see it, uncut, for yourself is a great bonus.  And, like me when I saw the movie in theaters, you'll have a nerve-wracking week after you see this, wondering if the legend is really true.

$REVIEW.: So, based on some reviews I've read and comments I've seen from viewers on TV...apparently INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDON OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is supposed to have been a life-changing movie.  At least a groundbreaking film sure to vault to "all-time classic" status.  Because there sure are a lot of disappointed viewers around.If, however, you have the more reasonable expectation of a highly-entertaining, highly-implausible action film that hearkens back to the "cliff-hanger" brand of old-school adventure...but gussied up with all the modern technology can bring...then you'll be fairly well satisfied.Let me get to the "bad" stuff first...the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Without giving too much away, let me just say that the quest Indiana Jones finds himself on is not terribly interesting on its own.  The bad-guys are Soviets (led by a hugely over-the-top Cate Blanchett as Irina) are in the US to snag a crystal skull from the same storage warehouse that the "Lost Ark" was hidden at the end of that film.  This unusual artifact can apparently bestow some great powers when it is returned to its home in a lost kingdom in the Amazon.  Naturally, the Soviets want to do that.  Indiana, for various reasons, is compelled to thwart their efforts.  At the end, when all the key characters are assembled in this hidden temple...the payoff is actually unexciting.  You just don't quite understand what is happening, and it feels, quite frankly, like the final scenes of either NATIONAL TREASURE movie.  Overblown sets and not much excitement.  I was disappointed that these scenes were all the movie was leading up to.Here's the good stuff:  the movie has several truly outstanding action sequences...including a lengthy chase scene through the jungles of the Amazon.  It involves trucks, jeeps, machine guns, fistfights on the backs of these vehicles, much leaping from jeep to another, giant ants, playful monkeys, wild rivers, waterfalls and more.  It is wildly unbelievable yet I found myself laughing in delight, cringing in anxiety and marveling at the technical skill.  All the while, Harrison Ford served as the droll centerpiece...agile yet admitting his age.  I was so delighted by this long scene that I nearly burst into applause...but I was certainly smiling in gratitude for such a breathless good time.A motorcycle chase is loads of fun too, as is Indy's initial brush with the Soviets, which leads to a very funny scene involving an atomic explosion (don't ask...just see for yourself).Harrison Ford is certainly older, but he's as wiry as ever and if anything, the age has made his world-weary irony fit him even better.  Shia LaBeouff is Mutt, a young man who enlists Indy's aid is funny and makes a nice foil for Ford.  Blanchett is probably a little broad with her characterization, but it fits the tone of these movies.  Ray Winstone is Indiana's long-time friend and partner...and he's adequate but the script isn't really all the interested in him either.  John Hurt is fun, and even Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood...and she and Ford have instant and convincing chemistry.RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a classic because it melded so well the cheesy action movies of the `40s with modern filmmaking technology and a well-conceived central character.  Subsequent entries in the series are merely extensions or enhancements of the original amazing achievement.  They are loads of fun too (some more than others), but only RAIDERS will ever have classic status.  CRYSTAL SKULL is a worthy partner to the original three films, and I hope you'll set your expectations at the correct level and just go enjoy the heck out of the film!

$review_text.: Chris Rock is funny as a local aldrman who gets tapped to run for president when his party's candidate for both president and vice president are killed
He is put up for the purpose of losing but nobody tells him he's a stooge

In his plain talking naivitee, he begins to hit home and his campaign gather's momentum


The problem I have with this movie is that the premise is too far fetched

Obviously, good satire is somewhat far fetched

However, here, all the situations are so unreal and impossible that it becomes difficult to determine what is being spoofed
A good example of the type of comedy that is a great spoof is the classic movie Airplane

 It is all a bunch of silly antics and crazy site gags

However, it is always clear what is being spoofed: diasaster movies of the Airport and Airport 1975 genre
Maybe the classic political spoof of all time is Dr

Strangelove


In that movie, the situations are surreal at times but, there is a certain grounding in political reality for the satire to attach itself too


The silliness in Head of State is, often hilarious, but it isn't connected to anything as a spoof so it loses a little of it's punch
Not only was he the star, but Chris Rock also wrote the movie
Perhaps it would have hit the mark more if Rock knew a little more about the workings of national politics so that there would have been something concrete to satirize
The movie did, occasionally, have it's moments, including a very funny spoof of negative campaigning


It's a funny movie full of silly comedy


Unfortunately, with only a few exceptions, there isn't much underlying cleverness in the silliness.

$REVIEW.: I like to see movies where ordinary folks do extraordinary things, and Calendar Girls pulls this off with a little heart and a twinkle of the eye.Helen Mirren as Chris and Julie Walters as Annie lead the exceptional cast.The ladies of the local chapter of the Women's Institute meet regularly where they hear lectures from horticulturalists and others who speak on topics that aren't exactly exciting.  Annie's Husband John is a nice chap who develops leukemia.  Annie and her family and Chris spend a fair amount of time at the hospital waiting on an uncomfortable sofa - the kind of sofa that matches a hospital waiting room with magazines spread out from years past.The Women's Institute does a calendar every year - usually on some agricultural theme.  When John passes away Annie and Chris get the idea to do a different calendar.  They want to take tasteful nude photos of themselves and make this the new WI Calendar.  Any proceeds they plan to use to replace the worn out old sofa at the hospital.The Calendar becomes a huge hit, sells tens of thousands of copies, and suddenly the 50-something homebodies are juggling their previous domestic lives along with reporters and offers from Hollywood.  The narrative conflict begins in the second act as the families feel neglected and the women begin to have a little friction (Annie, who has just lost John, thinks that Chris is shamefully neglecting her still-living husband.) The third act feels a little rushed. There are many movies that are made a little loooooong, but this film wraps up as if the writer, director and editor looked down at their watches and said "well, we've only got ten minutes left, lads, better wrap things up!"  Things are wrapped up - and pleasantly - so I recommend this movie.  It probably misses the under-30 demographic entirely, but for anyone who likes the idea that a woman over 50 could be sexy, this movie is a nice shot in the arm.

For all his talent as a writer and director, JJ Abrams shows NO understanding of or respect for the Star Trek canon.  He has devolved the franchise into a mindless, over-the-top action series that holds none of the charm or character of anything done by Roddenberry or his immediate successors.Gene is turning over in his grave at what Abrams has done here.

Morse and his crew spring into action swiftly to bring their man to justice

Ignoring procedures, protocols, and even the law, they rush to judgment."Driven to Distraction" is a fine piece of mystery writing but the saddest of the Morse episodes


Without revealing too much, we find our lovable curmudgeon a little less lovable

The "Christmas Special" episode could become as essential an annual viewing as Dickens' "Christmas Carol." or "The Snowman." It is a complete story in itself and does not have its genesis in earlier episodes and does not carry the story forward in subsequent ones

So watching this episode is satisfying in that it has a beginning, a middle and an end


You can then move on to the continuing story from the events in the first season
The new maid, Minnie (Ruby Bentall) may strike you as a bit too muddled and accident prone to be true in the early episodes, but her back story emerges gradually through the series and she develops into an interesting character, and we learn why Dorcas employed her rather any one of a hundred less problematic girls available to her


Twister is revealed as not just a comical figure but that he has a mean streak in him at times
Laura will melt the hardest heart, and I defy anyone not to weep at what I consider is her strongest scene in the whole series, and that is from an actress who shines in every scene in which she appears


I am watching season three at the moment and it is every bit as good as the first two

$REVIEW.: This is a bit of a renaissance-man-film, if one can say that. It does a lot of things simultaneously. Firstly, it is a great kung fu flick, with some of the best names in the buisness including of course Jet Li, the inimitable Yuen Biao as well as Yuen Wo Ping of later Matrix fame. Secondly, it is a big, well told drama about doctor Wong Fei Hong, a real life character and something of a Chinese folk hero, and the modernisation/changing of Imperial China some hundred and a bit years ago. If you took away the fighting, it would still be a good film, a very rare thing with martial arts films. Thirdly, it is a great opportunity to see how the Chinese themselves (if "only" the Hong Kong Chinese) look upon their own history and their own heroes. That particular time in Chinese history, in which "Once Upon a Time in China" plays out, is not only tumultuous and chaotic, but the actual transitional period between imperial and repulican China.It is well acted, wonderfully directed, beautifully scored, and a blast to watch. Definitely one of the best films ever to come out of Hong Kong.

Fans of the series will recall the previous ill luck that befell the original release back in 2000 when they had to recall the sets due to licensing issues with the now defunct Pioneer. (According to rumor, Full Moon had not gotten approval from Pioneer to sell the series on DVD.)The box set is comprised of the first seven films in the series, from the first wonderful Puppetmaster to the inferior sequels that came after it. I have to admit- I really didn't like the later movies nearly as much as I did the first three. They have their "charm", I suppose, but overall they're just a little too cheesy for my tastes. There is also an additional disc in the boxset, a collection of trailers for the films. I have to admit that as far as extras go, I was a little underwhelmed. It's been about 20 years since the first film was released- wasn't there anything else they could put in there?Now for what the series is about. Since Amazon has no description of the actual series, I'm going to give a brief outline of the series. Killer puppets that frequently end up in the hands of the wrong people. Ok, so maybe it's a bit more complex than that, but the beauty of the series lies in how the series' creators were able to take a simple idea & turn it into one of what is arguably one of the most infamous series in horror. Forget Jason & Freddy. If you haven't seen this series or at least the first movie, you can't call yourself a true horror movie buff.
$SUMMARY.: Collecting the first films together (legally) for the first time in 9 years!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed Pleasantville the first time I watched it

After another viewing or two I am not as sure

I really loved the black and white to color

It was so artistic, and different from the usual special effects we see all the time
That is what drew me in
The message of the movie, however, was weird.Now, I was not around in the 50s
I wasn't born until the 80s, so my only reference points are the TV


Let's take my two favorite black and white shows, I Love Lucy and The Dick Van Dyke show


They were not mindless


Working husbands, stay-at-home wives, but that was accurate for the era

And we saw Ricky and Rob at work, they didn't just appear at the door at 5:00 for their dinner
Both Lucy and Laura occasionally expressed interest in working and definitely were not subservient

Sure, they had twin beds, but who cares? We were watching comedy, not bedrooms
(I really don't find people bouncing all over each other that interesting, and it doesn't involve much acting ability.) And we never saw a toilet..


who cares about that, either? It also baffles me that anyone wants to see someone sitting on a toilet on their TV screen

Especially when the person is having, um, difficulties
And rain was not non-existent
That's silly
I understand that Pleasantville was trying to make a point, but it was really kind of offensive to our favorite classic shows and characters.On the other hand, it made some really interesting statements
I guess the big one is that change is good


It is what keeps things interesting
However, like a lot of other reviewers said, we do not see the results of Pleasantville's conversion


It could be pregnant teenagers, broken homes, violence in the streets
Is that better than everything they had? Probably not, even though everything they had was totally boring
That's why I bring up my two favorite old shows


They had old-fashioned values but were not clueless like the world of Pleasantville


By the way, I am a liberal

The state of the world just saddens me

And I think movies have gotten more and more "graphic" not because of "freedom of expression" but because people are competing for "shock value."

$review_text.: You just know there's going to be trouble at the party when the fire sprinklers release blood, not water.The plot for Blade, if you don't know it already, is simple. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire shortly before going into labor. What resulted was a half-breed with all the strengths of the vampires - strength, speed - but none of their weaknesses. He can venture into the sun, he can withstand garlic and silver. But he has their bloodlust, one he refuses to indulge. He has donned the nickname "Daywalker."It shows he has teamed up awhile back with an old man with long hair and an interesting attitude named Whistler. Whistler's family was slain by vampires and he hates them as much as his sidekick. He spends his time concocting numerous creative weaponry and other powerful ammunition for their war. He also created the serum Blade injects to fight off the cravings for that bright red liquid nourishment that is splattered onscreen throughout. Together their mission is to wipe out as many bloodsucking freaks as they can.Another character is a woman, Dr. Karen Jensen, who is slowly turning into the undead through a bite. She tries to help Blade and Whistler on their goal. Trained in Martial Arts and knowing how to handle every weapon possible, Blade has now met his biggest match in the first installment of the Blade series. (Trust me, they won't just stop with 2)A half-blood vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Doriff) has a plan. He's not happy with the current order of things and wants to get rid of the current council, resurrect an ancient vampire God, and make it so that instead of outcasts, vampires will be viewed as the leaders of the world. This wicked plan includes Blade as a main pawn in the game but he's not a willing player.Action-adventure and martial arts lovers will be cheering from their seats. There's enough kicking action to have made Bruce Lee jealous. And these movies have plenty of the slosh to satisfy gore hounds. The death scenes of the vamps are brilliant, exciting, and delightfully messy.The opening with the party club scene where Blade first shows his bad ass face got my heart pumping already. You just know there's going to be trouble with the fire sprinklers start spraying blood instead of water from the ceiling. Blade boasted powerful directing and eye catching production shots, adrenaline-filled action scenes, and great acting.Of course this movie wasn't perfect though. I thought the mother sub-plot toward the end was a bit too out there and contrived. Also, the movie relied a bit too much on action than on true emotion, making it come off a bit stale when it could have held more genuine drama. This movie is full of eye candy so that when you dig through the fluff there's not a great deal left.The plot is simple and straight forward; it's all about kicking vampire butt and leaving no survivors.

$REVIEW.: I couldn't decide whether to give *Sex and the City* 4 or 5 stars

 What the heck, I'll give it 5 stars.First of all, I loved it!  It was wonderful to be back into the lives and adventures of these 4 fabulous gals
 I loved the montage shown from the TV series, showing what these women have experienced, individually and collectively.Carrie and Big are still together and are looking for an apartment suitable for them

 However, a legal question comes up about property and rights
 When Carrie and Big get together to talk about, their conversation eventually lead them to marriage.The night before the wedding, someone says something to Big, which caused him to get cold feet on the wedding day

 Humiliated, Carrie and the girls retreat to Mexico (Carrie and Big's honeymoon destination) to recuperate.However, throughout the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Miranda and Samantha were really the focus of this film

 Miranda considers divorce from Steve as he reveals that he has had an affair

 Samantha isn't the same gal that we've grown to love from the TV series
 Samantha has now been in a relationship with Jerry for 5 years


 Meanwhile, men around her are just getting more gorgeous every day.Meanwhile, Charlotte discovers she's pregnant but is fearful because she has had a miscarriage before


 At the same time, she holds the biggest grudge against Big for the cancelled wedding
 As luck would have it, she encounters Big and ends up needing his help.When Carrie discovers that someone said something to Big before the wedding, she wonders if it's too late to save their relationship.I wish Stanley and Marco had more screen time.Anyways, *Sex and the City* is still fabulous


 Fashion galore!  Sexy!  Trendy!  And still as hilarious as ever!

$REVIEW.: These episodes are considered the beginning of the Avengers to most fans of the show today
These are probably the best episodes with the Cathy Gale character


As she is forced to become deeply involved in criminal organizations undercover with the direction of Steed
Each episode has a theme of a murderous criminal minds, and it is not truly apparent who is behind it all until the end.This dvd set is a better bargain than most of the Cathy Gale era with 7 instead of 6 episodes
However, 2 of them are with the spunky Venus Smith instead of Gale.Agian my biggest complaint of these A & E dvds is the lack of special features


It comes only with production stills
Still at least we can get to see episodes of a classic series that was not orginally aired in the US at the time they were made.

$review_text.: I saw this film when I was 16 and still like it today. The photography is a bit too Hollywoodish as the prison camp looks like a rich boys summer camp. But, beyond this flaw the story is gripping throughout with so many twists and turns embellished by Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack. The cast is an all star line up of male stars of the day. Why this film was only nominated for one minor Academy Award boggles the mind. It's the first WWII film I remember where several German characters were not portrayed as mindless thugs. Why there has not been a follow up DVD release with extra features to give The Great Escape the credit it truly deserves is perplexing.

$review_text.: The first season of AMC's The Walking Dead was subject to a great deal of speculation, hype, and varying degrees of opinion.  There were some who thought the hype was too much and that, despite the right components being in place, the show would fail to meet every expectation laid out for it.  And there were those who felt that The Walking Dead would break onto the scene and immediately launch itself into the stratosphere of history's greatest television shows while simultaneously reconfiguring the public-at-large's opinion of the horror genre.  And, in the end, neither side was truly right.  But what is clear is this: The Walking Dead is excellent fare that has occasion to be uneven, but it's tempered in such a way that it takes its time with the characters and never becomes dull or wanders aimlessly.  While not the greatest show on television, never mind not being the best show on its network, The Walking Dead is wonderful and innovative television that horror buffs and drama fans alike can stand beside proudly.As someone who has read the entire run of the comic series to current, I can safely say that Frank Darabont, Robert Kirkman, and the production team around them manage to hit on the important aspects of the comics and translate them with great efficiency.  What they also manage to do successfully is introduce a number of new locales and characters, and deviate (quite distinctly, more often than not) from the source material without infringing on the tone, rather adding layers to the story and planting seeds for future arcs and many happy (or quite the opposite) returns down the road.  The Walking Dead strikes an almost perfect balance for adapting a work, expertly recreating powerful scenes that made the comic the success that it is while using artistic license from the considerable talents involved and tweaking the formula in ways conducive to the television format.  When the credits roll on the sixth and final episode, the landscape is one considerably different from where the comic left readers after six issues.  And that is a comforting thing, as prolonging events (or even altogether avoiding them) that transpire in that first arc allows tension to metastasize and characters to flourish.The heart of The Walking Dead is, as it is in the comic, the characters.  All of the primaries are dutifully played: Rick Grimes, the central protagonist imbued with a natural leadership, is portrayed with conviction and by Andrew Lincoln.  The first episodes focus particularly on him and his struggle to locate his wife, Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and their son, Carl (Chandler Riggs).  Shane is represented wonderfully with an additional air of menace by Shane Bernthal, who never goes over the top in rendering the character as one on a particularly precarious edge while maintaining the believability that he is, more often than not, a good man and a devoted friend.  There seems to be more to do with Lori in the early going here when compared with the comic, and Callies is up to the task, portraying Lori as a strong woman focused on survival, and the deeper exploration of the questionable relationship between her and Shane is made even more potent by their performances.  Carl's role is a bit suppressed when compared to the comic, but Riggs handles him well and should serve the role well in later episodes.What The Walking Dead does extremely well is allow the performers to bring these characters to life, and that extends to the large part of the supporting cast.  Jeffrey DeMunn's Dale is the calm, sage-like center, often providing the voice of reason in the wake of the show's darkest moments, and DeMunn plays him with passion and power.  Laurie Holden is at her best as Andrea, brimming with real, tangible emotion, particularly in the episodes "Vatos" and "Wildfire," bringing a suitable grace to scenes that pack a heavy emotional punch.  Few stones are left unturned, and almost every member of the group of survivors is given nuance.  There is very little in the way of cannon fodder characters, and even tertiary characters are given careful consideration.  Lennie James' turn as Morgan Jones in "Days Gone Bye" is one that nearly steals the episode away from the main players and certainly calls for a return and a more prominent role in later episodes.But that isn't to say all characters involved are perfect: Ed Peletier (Adam Minarovich) is little more than a stock domestic monster, and has little to do with his screen time aside from repulsing the viewer as a relatively by-the-numbers wife beater cliche.  Merle Dixon is played well by the always exceptional Michael Rooker, but the character is relatively hollow, a racist archetype, who is introduced in the midst of something of a breakdown, spewing racial epithets and endangering (and outright assaulting) other survivors.  Rooker's acting (and a bit of timely dialogue) saves the character in the cold open to "Tell It to the Frogs," leaving the hope that the character will return with more complexity and allow Rooker to display his talents further.What is impressive about The Walking Dead is the verisimilitude with which it carries itself.  It plays things razor straight and never deviates into needless exhibition of blood and guts.  And for all the emphasis on character and acting, enough cannot be said about the work done by Gregory Nicotero and KNB EFX, rendering the living dead and the gory details in as realistic a manner as possible.  And, at times, the show moves at such a pace that one may forget that it is just that: a show about the zombie apocalypse.  This is why the show succeeds.  It never deemphasizes character in favor of the living dead, rather using the latter as a means to punctuate the story.  It succeeds as wonderful television because it can go for nearly entire episodes without utilizing that selling point.  There is so much intrigue surrounding the survivors and their stories that when the "walkers" show up, it is not to simply punch things up with some zombies.  Rather, it is a reminder that these very human problems are capitulated by the threat of the living dead and the crushing reality of the end of humanity.  "Vatos" serves as an exceptional example of this, particularly the ending, using misdirection to make the viewer dread people and what they are capable of before the viewer is reminded of the very real danger of the living dead.Through six episodes, The Walking Dead relies on extremely compelling performances and pretty exceptional writing and directing, though it occasionally lacks punch, particularly in the wake of the strength of the Darabont-directed first episode.  The finale does enough to draw toward the second season, which has quite a bit to live up to.  But for the occasional unevenness, the first season of The Walking Dead powers along and serves as something of a screen test for a longer second season.  A test that it passed with flying colors, audiences and critics alike eating it up.  The first season leaves its audience wanting more, and it makes for exciting, fresh TV and one of the brightest new series to spring up in some time.  Fans of the horror genre, as well as compelling television drama such as AMC's own Breaking Bad and Mad Men, should be proud, as The Walking Dead bridges the gap between a well-worn sub-genre and expert storytelling.

$review_text.: Caspar Hauser, the enigma of a centuryis the true account of one early 19th century foundling, Kaspar Hauser, who was locked and shackled in a dungeon from birth, only to be freed and exposed to society after 17 years in isolation (save for the lone keeper who fed and abused him). To add to his tragic circumstance, he was murdered almost as mysteriously as he was confined.What makesThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauserso compelling is not so much this man's biography. Rather it is Werner Herzog's exploration of the individual's role in society, especially when he has a personal history like Kaspar Hauser. Herzog looks at what would happen to such a person were he to interact with ordinary villagers, children, bureaucrats, clergymen, scientists and educators.We discover over the course of the film that his perceptions would be different from their own. As he learns to walk, develop language skills, process logic, interpret dreams, understand the concept of God and perform piano solos, we realise what constitutes normalcy and civility according to society. We see man's incessant need to analyse, to explain, to classify and to codify that which is seemingly different than himself. More importantly, we see how individuality is broken and conformity becomes the norm. Not that all men are such cruel and intolerable ogres, Herzog lets us also see the tenderness and kindness humanity possesses.Herzog's symbolism is quite subtle too. The abrupt cut to a still photograph and silence at the beginning is reflective of Kaspar Hauser's life. It too began peaceably and was cut short. It's a scene that foreshadows and epitomises the events to come.The symbolism can even be ironic. I was particularly amused at the end when the crippled bureaucrat walks away thinking about Kaspar Hauser's 'abnormal' brain after an autopsy has been performed. Once again, one has to wonder who and what is normal, or so Herzog would have us think.As you watch the film, you cannot help but feel empathy for Kaspar Hauser. This is owed partly to the performance of Bruno S. He is brilliant. The rigidity, the blank stare, the child-like innocence could perhaps only be depicted by someone who had lived and endured a similar fate. When you see Bruno S., keep in mind he was a 41 year old, non-actor  playing a teenager.  He, himself, had been abused, not unlike Kaspar Hauser, by his mother who was a prostitute; he was sent to an asylum and incarcerated for a petty crime.Overall, "The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser" is a wonderful film. The DVD  package is not bad either. It comes with a commentary from Werner Herzog synced to the film, if one so wishes. A biography on Herzog is also included. Subtitle options are in English and German.

$REVIEW.: Some Trasnformers fans are very bitter people, look past the death of Optimus Prime and you have a heroic coming of age movie which showcases the new Transformers admirably.When evil planet devourer Unicron first graces our screens for the first time, it' a graphic, destructive sympothy that is only surpassed by the Deceptacon assault on Autobot City Earth, the final encounter between Optimus Prime and Megatron is one of the greatest fight scenes in ANY film, animated or otherwise (One shall stand...one shall fall), and shows us all that sometimes, the good guys don't ALWAYS win...at least for a while.Oh, and pay no attention to some idiotic reviews, Prime's death IS pretty sad, AND it caused the fracnhise to plummet to levels that ended Generation One...AND it gave us the whiny, brooding Rodimus Prime, but given that this movie shows us everything that they could have done RIGHT with the character, ("Dark Awakening" and "The Burden Hardest to Bear" are other examples of how good Roduimus can be) and the themes of leadership, sacrifice, and heroism, make this film more than acceptable to people who appreciate it, the TRUE Transformers fans and not ones spoiled by Beast Wars and thier own biased preferences for Optimus Prime

$review_text.: Warner Archive's beautiful transfer on 1966's M-G-M Ann-Margret fun-fest "Made in Paris" will not be available forever as it is one of their made on demand titles.  I was given a DVD of it made from Turner Classic Movies which tended to pixelate and I originally hoped it would suffice.  But as Warner Archive catalog grows, and money allowing, I purchased several movies from them that I already had in my collection in what may be poorer quality presentations.  The Warner Archive edition is stunningly beautiful and well worth the price you pay for it.  Ann-Margret made ten films from 1964 to 1966 after her triumphal success in "Bye Bye Birdie" up to and including "Murderer's Row" a Matt Helm spy film she did and it is surprising how few of them are available on DVD or even VHS.  "Made in Paris" was directed by Boris Sagal, who besides directing Elvis's "Girl Happy" later directed the cult classic "The Omega Man" with Charlton Heston.  "Made in Paris" has a great cast including Chad Everett, Edie Adams, Louis Jordan and Richard Crenna and they obviously spent a lot on it, some sets achingly beautiful in a kind of deja vu to when they made these films regularly in Metrocolor.  Knowing the film will remain in my collection to watch so gloriously every time I decide to watch it is a kind of insurance for the future I wouldn't want to live without.  DVD includes a trailer.  Worth it.

$REVIEW.: This film is going to garner a lot of comparison to 8 1/2 and deservedly so, it's among the few movies about movies that morphs into what it is actually attempting to deconstruct, comment on, whatever.  8 1/2 is a sort of meandering film that splits it's time between the protagonist director's (Fellini's) thoughts on women and on the movie within the movie that we're watching and likewise, Adaptation gives us an epic human story within what is essentially an inside joke.  Hollywood types, screenwriters and more importantly aspiring screenwriters will get all the jokes and laugh to themselves at Brian Cox's brilliant portrayal of Robert McKee, but what this movie does is change, unlike 8 1/2 which always sort of feels like it is aware of what it is (it's smart, it's witty, it's self aware because the genre requires it).  Adaptation makes a point of not knowing where it's going, not knowing what it's about, but staying true to the human elements the director and writer have worked into the film.  These are what we hold onto as the story starts to become what it seems to abhor (an erotic, action, suspense film).  What's amazing about Adaptation is that the cliches built into the movie, the cliches that are supposed to make fun of the Hollywood process and the people, actually come off as genuine because of the honesty of the characters.People are put off by the ending, the car accident, the action, but even 8 1/2 embraced the sort of spectacle of movie endings with the space shuttle and the party with all the returning characters.  These elements are what writers and directors have been working with since the beginning of movies.  The lonely writer, the split screen twin brother story, the eccentric hick, the drug mystery, the sappy dying last words, three act sturcture, reversal of expectations, big ending.  And they are all in this movie, but it remains real and the characters remain fresh and alive.Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufmann are among the most innovative people making movies today.

$review_text.: Rebecca DeMorney steals this show. Some reviewers here and elsewhere are expecting too much of this movie. If you want "high brow" sensibilities and cinematic perfection, look elsewhere. This is an A+ B-Movie, however, so to speak. The violence was creative, and pretty disturbing. I watched about 15 minuutes of SAW 1 and had to turn it off because it was too intense and gross for me. (This flick is lovingly offered by the Director of a few of the SAW movies, so  expect some scary stuff. The only two likable characters here are the criminal family's mind-controlled daughter, who, with the help of the hostage-doctor, begins to see that her life was a lie created by "Mother". As for the rest of the cast, the hostages are pretty venial, refusing to cooperate to defeat the decidedly dysfuntional demonic family. I had no interest in the fate of them, ,save for the aforementioned doctor, who revels all the secrets which need to be revealed. Who lives and who dies is pretty irrelevant here; the fight scenes are great and crappy, even if one hopes both combatants lose. There is avery strong anti-yuppie thread through the proceedings, so if you swill Starbucks coffee and really care about how your coworkers will be intimidated by your overpriced wannabe luxury car, be prepared to be insulted. The main fun here is hating "Mother" and witnessing her descent into a June Cleaver-but-this-time-she's-insane meltdown. Deborah Ann Woll does a great job as Lydia, a modern day Squeaky Fromm who I still  found myself rooting for. She wants out of the family business, but doesn't know how far she's will to go to break free. So sit back, get yourself a caffeinated beverage, and join your special  someone and watch this often darkly amusing production. Veterans of the ultra-splatter genre may find this movie a tad tame, but for me, it had just enough nasty in it to make it more than worth the rental price. Good times!

She is still alone, her daughter in trouble, but things are about to come to a head


What we learn is that life is about compromise, political, personal, public and private


Nyborg blames herself for her daughter's problems, the marriage issues, and is now trying to look to the future to see what lays ahead


She has proved her mettle, and shown her colleagues that she is a true Prime Minister, in word and deed.This is one of the best political series on either side of the big pond
It is a must see for everyone.Highly Recommended

$REVIEW.: "Hamlet" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But while many adaptations of Shakespeare's classic play feel stuffy and distant, this "Hamlet" has it all -- sleek elegant sets, powerful acting, and clever modern twists on the age-old stuff. And the best part is the brilliant performances by David Tennant and Patrick Stewart.Prince Hamlet of Denmark (Tennant) is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude (Penny Downie) marries his uncle Claudius (Stewart). But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (Stewart again), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia (Mariah Gale), arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon (yodeling with a fake crown?). But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy, Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too..."Hamlet" is one of those plays that only really comes out two ways -- either you have a passionate, intense tragedy full of very human characters, or you have two boring hours of some whiny guy talking to himself. Having suffered through the latter in the past, it makes me appreciate a well-done performance all the more -- and this "Hamlet" is full of energy, vitality and wit.A lot of that comes from Tennant, who is simply brilliant as Hamlet -- loads of energy, and a weird edge to his "madness" (example: freaking out Polonius by pulling a weird face). And he runs the entire emotional gamut here -- love, pain, puckish comedy, loathing, sorrow and shock, with the absolute peak being the hauntingly sad "to be or not to be" scene.And Patrick Stewart is casually brilliant in his double role -- Claudius seems like a genial guy, but Stewart lets out little hints of his true nastiness; on the other hand, the ghost is all heavy intensity. Downie is excellent as Gertrude, and Gale is rather flat in her first few scenes, but after Ophelia goes mad she's amazing. Ripping off her clothes, leaping around, smacking Gertrude -- it's frighteningly good.And the settings and costumes are similarly amazing. The entire play is done in a sleek, elegant modern style ("mad" Hamlet runs around in jeans), but the grandeur of a royal court is still there -- lots of elaborate formal clothes, and a looming, columned black palace-stage. There are some clever modern twists (Polonius spies through a one-way mirror and security cameras), and there are some truly brilliant bits of symbolism sprinkled through the story (Gertrude seeing the mad Ophelia in a shattered mirror).This adaptation of "Hamlet" is a solid piece of work, with the smooth feeling of a classic play done by insanely talented people. Also: David Tennant is astounding.

$REVIEW.: When Marianne (Kate Winslet) seeks to reproach her sister Elinor (Emma Thompson) on that score, watch out! The normally repressed and sedate Elinor, always choosing her words carefully and weighing them before she speaks, bursts out with a tirade against Marianne that almost draws applause from the viewer.It's not that we don't like Marianne; on the contrary, she is herself quite loveable. It's just that at last to see Elinor give way to the turmoil she feels inside is a catharsis for everybody. She's had a very hard time of it, too. First, her father died leaving her, Marianne, their younger sister, and mother destitute and dependent upon others' kindnesses. Then she forms an attachment to her sister-in-law's brother Edward (Hugh Grant_, but when it seems certain he will propose, zilch. Along the way, she is the recipient of a confidence she doesn't want which cuts her to the quick.And Marianne? Well, she has the unwanted attentions of Captain Brandon (Alan Rickman) to contend with, until she is literally swept off her feet by the romantic Willoughby. THEIR engagement seems a done deal, when suddenly, zilch again!Jane Austen was a master at presenting a story which appears to have no happy ending, a story where you suddenly realize you're as blind as the heroine about what is REALLY going on. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a wonderful adaptation of her great novel, the precursor to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Everything works: the casting, the countryside, everything. And those last two scenes are the classic fairy tale ending, absolutely the sweeter for having gone through so much.Demonstrate your good sense, and check out &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; as soon as time permits.

$REVIEW.: Showtime's "Weeds" offers a stellar second season as a follow-up to its hilarious opening salvo.  The second season of every good series is a treat as the actors get more comfortable with their characters and the writers get to explore some of the better ideas they couldn't squeeze into the first season (plus, by virtue of being picked up for another run, the writers feel a little more free to push the envelope).  But nothing has gotten tired or stale, and the writers generally haven't written themselves into a corner.That description holds true for most of Season Two of the Battle for Agrestic.  On the one side we have our heroine, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), emerging marijuana entrepreneur.  She's still trying to keep her dysfunctional family together while dealing with her beloved husband's early demise, but at the end of Season One she was pulling it together.  She even found her rebound relationship with the sensitive, dryly funny Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan).  But in the Season One cliffhanger par excellence, she learns the hard way that he's a DEA agent.  Not only that, but in Season Two we learn that Peter's more than a little familiar with the drug heirarchy in Agrestic, although this clever guy is able to sidestep Nancy's chosen career rather neatly.At least, for a while.Season Two is essentially Season One again, only more so.  Conrad (Romany Malco) continues to pine for both Nancy and the freedom to grow truly divine weeed.  Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) remains the Queen Bee of Agrestic and takes on Doug (Kevin Nealon, still awesome) for his cherished city council seat.  Nancy's kids and brother-in-law remain screwed up - comically so.  And through it all Nancy soldiers on with the blithe knowledge that things have to work out for her, 'cause she's got nowhere else to go.My only problem with Season Two is that one character does a dramatic u-turn during the season, and the change is not true to the character.  I don't want to give anything away, but this change smacks of writers realizing a looming problem with where the show needed to go, and so this character is suddenly transformed . . . with dire consequences.Still, this is a minor complaint for a season that builds to a Mexican stand-off in the finale that would have made Sergio Leone proud.  Kudos to all for another fine season in Agrestic.

It's a great aerobic workout and the 50 or so minutes goes by pretty quickly because you don't spend your time watching the clock, but instead watching the guys and gals on screen who seem to be having a blast.My only complaint is that there isn't a DVD copy of this available.I highly recommend this for all levels of fitness.  Beginners can start out just doing the movements...and then add more intensity as you get the hang of it.  But this tape is fantastic for those of us who have been doing aerobics for years as well.  Richard knows how to make a work out more than just something you have to force yourself through.  Sure, it's a little cheesy at times, but that's part of the fun.

$review_text.: When one looks back at the 1980s, one of the great actors has to be considered William Hurt.  Back in 1986, he won an Oscar award for "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and also garnered several other Oscar award nominations.  1988 seemed to be Hurt's banner year as he was also nominated for an Oscar for 1987's "Broadcast News".  The following year, Hurt also was in another movie that year entitled "The Accidental Tourist".  This is a different spin of a male mid-life crisis.  His co-star Geena Davis seemed to get most of the accolades, but I think it is Hurt's performance in this film that was the strongest - and perhaps as strong as any role he had taken on to date.William Hurt plays Macon Leary.  Leary is a travel guide writer.  The film opens with Macon and his wife Sarah (played by Kathleen Turner who also starred with Hurt in "Body Heat")  separating after many years of marriage.  Their marriage had broken apart because their 12 year old son had been murdered in a shooting.  Following the shooting, Macon had become even more introverted than he usually was - and this is evidenced by his eccentric brothers Porter (played by David Ogden Stiers) and Charles (played by Ed Begely Jr.) as well as his eccentric sister Rose (played by Amy Wright).  Sarah moves out and leaves Macon to care for their dog Edward, who is having obedience problems.  This is where Macon meets dog-trainer Muriel Pritchett (played by Geena Davis).  Muriel is a very forthcoming and outgoing woman who takes a liking to the introverted Macon.  Macon is at first very resistant to Muriel, but eventually gets involved with her and takes a liking to her son Alexander.  Macon eventually moves in with Muriel and she begins to draw him out of his shell.  Muriel eventually starts to push Macon for a commitment and Macon begins to withdraw.  Macon and Sarah eventually see each other and Sarah tells him he wants to reconcile putting Macon at a point where he must choose.There is a very interesting subplot with this movie too.  Macon's siblings have a role in the movie too.  It seems as though Rose is playing homemaker to the Leary brothers - particularly Porter and Charles.  Macon's publisher Julian (played by Bill Pullman)  eventually takes a liking to Rose and asks her to marry him.  This causes an interesting spin because despite the fact that Rose loves Julian, she still feels the need to take care of her brothers.  I really think this was a good subplot and wouldn't have minded this being a more integral part of the movie.One thing that I thought was a big positive were the settings for the movie.  The first 3/4 of the movie was set in the Baltimore, Maryland area while the last part wraps up in Paris, France.  This movie shows what a great setting the Baltimore area was.  While Macon grew up in suburban Baltimore, Muriel lives in the inner city.  The settings seem to work perfectly in contrasting the differences between Macon and Muriel.  The way the movie winds up - despite Baltimore being a great setting for the majority of the film, Paris proves to be the better place for the endingThe film does other things to contrast Macon and Muriel.  Most notably is the way they dress - Macon is a stodgy. conservative dresser.  Meanwhile Muriel is a miniskirt-wearing, trendy dresser.  We also see that Muriel wants marriage while Macon is sour on the idea.  Yet despite the differences, we see that this couple works well together.The casting was done very well.  I couldn't think of two better people to play the eccentric brothers of Macon Leary than David Ogden Stiers (remember him as Major Winchester from M*A*S*H*?) and Ed Begely Jr.  It almost as if these roles were tailor-made for both of these men.  Perhaps the most unsung actor in the film though is Bill Pullman.  I really enjoyed his role as Macon's publisher Julian.  The scene where Edward the dog has Julian up in a tree is a classic.  I really wished they gave Julian more screen time.  Speaking of Edward the dog - Edward was a real scene stealer.  It was disappointing when Edward's role diminishes in the second half of the movie.As for the performance of Geena Davis - I just didn't get it.  I heard so much about this performance for so long.  Yet when I saw it - it fell way short of my expectations.  Yes she dressed trendy and had this bubbly personality.  My reaction - so what?  When I looked at Hurt's performance along with Pullman, Ogden Stiers, and Begely Jr, I felt Davis' performance wasn't as strong as the others.But ultimately it is Hurt who is going to keep this movie moving along.  It's kind of funny that Hurt was under 40 years old when he played Macon - he seemed so much older in the movie.  Hurt does a great job at blending comedy and drama throughout the movie.  One of the most comedic moments of the film occurs when Macon breaks his leg in his basement (with a little help from Edward the dog).  Yet, we see a completely serious side to Macon when he shows up at Muriel's door and explains how going out to dinner reminded him of his late son.I was entertained by the movie, but ultimately I found the ending too predictable - yet satisfying.  Because of the many likeable characters throughout the film, I wouldn't have minded a sequel to the film.  In fact,the only character I didn't find likeable was Kathleen Turner's role as Sarah.  Overall, this is a film that will entertain you from start to finish - highly recommended.

$review_text.: Bliss is a film about the status and symbolic value of a woman in some Moslem cultures. It is a status so low that they can be murdered by their family if someone rapes them. Meryam is such a woman. After being viciously raped and lacking the money or education to flee her fate, she is forced to follow the son of her father's cousin, Cermal, to Istanbul, where he has been ordered to kill her. This could have easily turned into a bash Islam movie, instead, it becomes a character study of people caught between the modern Islamic world of Istanbul and the brutal rural customs of the remote countryside.Though Meryam is the central figure in the story and we certainly feel her anguish, the story focuses as much if not more on Cermal. She has already been tested by emotional adversity and forced to break with her culture as the story opens. Cermal's journey is just beginning. The ruse designed to hide the real intention behind the trip is going to visit their relatives in Istanbul. The couple they visit have fled the village and its harsh authoritarian relationship between parent and child. They understand what Cermel is being asked to do, but their view of honor killing is at least tempered by whether the woman was guilty of putting herself "at risk" to be raped. While Cermal is still caught in the throes of his culture's black and white thinking, they can see the gray. What makes the film most interesting is not the plot, it is the growth and struggle of the characters as they are forced to adjust to a new culture that lacks rigid scripts. It is the careful unfolding of these characters and the baring of a humanity, hidden beneath layers of prescribed attitudes and behaviors, that takes this film from good to great.

$REVIEW.: Many moons ago, my parents let my sister and I watched "Diamonds are Forever" on TV

I'm sure my sister and I would have preferred a Disney movie at the time, but even at our age, it was pretty impressive when Sean Connery got his Mustang up on two wheels


Between that fateful starry night and now, I have ended up seeing almost every James Bond movie


To me, taking James Bond back to the basics--literally, back to square one--might have seemed a daunting task, as the 007 franchise had been waning in recent years (for a myriad of reasons) and the idea of a "prequel", if you will, may have been rather risky.Fortunately, this fined-tuned Bond is what a lot of fans have been clamoring for, and new addition Daniel Craig brings James into the 21st century with thuggish aplomb
Curt, compact and arrogant, he's a secret agent who isn't above making big mistakes; his own ego often times his worst enemy

James attempts to infiltrate a terrorist organization, and within the first ten minutes the film has globe-trotted so far across the map that you may be wondering who all these villains are and what their place in the story actually is (the movie opens curiously in black-and-white, with a confrontation and also with a flashback!)

Judi Dench's "M" really lets James have it for 'needlessly' killing a bomber whom they hoped to interrogate, but she has a change of heart (indeed, quite a number of them) after Bond becomes involved in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro with terrorist-operative Le Chiffre, a real poker-face (and asthmatic!) with a bloody tear duct
Watching him made me realize he was the weakest villain of all time


I heard the book was more interesting with an equally fantastic history of him


I also thought Mads Mikkelsen was miscast

Lambert Wilson probably would have been a much better choice."Casino Royale" is packed with thrills; it looks terrific and has many moments of action, romance, macho violence, and even beauty

The one thing it does lack is humor, but we may get more of that next round.

$review_text.: Well, they tried. If you could see the credits at the begining of the movie rather than at the end yould see that it was filmed in Lousiana by a small local production company. The result is less than mediocor. Peter Jurasic does do his usual excelent job of presenting a complex charicter for all three minutes he's on screen, but everyone else's performance is somewhere around the level of a highschool play. The idea of a quantum 'something' eating the earth and being saved at the last minute by a 'rain-man' with a nuclear missel which results in a time loop is interesting, but the sub plot of a highschool romance and a complete disregard of anything like real physics, coupled with a paint by numbers script leads me to give this movie only a D+, and that + only because it wasn't bad enough to make me angry that I watched it.  Better stuff elsewhere.

$review_text.: What a "FAILED" attempt to show the world what Idi Amin was. Bear in mind that this is a movie "based" on facts. The Scotsman's character is fictional and "based" on a character from a book which also like the movie is again "based" on facts during Amin's tyrannical rule. The movie should not be considered 100% historically accurate. The fictitious Scotsman's character is based on the the life of Bob Astles, an Englishman who was a close associate of Idi Amin and who after Amin's ousting fled to Kenya. He was later apprehended and was sentenced for crimes (theft, murder and corruption). He denied charges and was acquitted but it is anyone's guess what someone associated with the dreaded Amin and his security apparatus were up to.In the 70's the very word Amin meant terror. His big and towering 6 ft plus frame, looks and candid speech made him both a hated and dreaded personality. He was a perfect example of the phrase "Absolute Power corrupts absolutely". With a good measure of insanity, hedonistic evil and torture his reign was almost that of a modern day Caligula.Since many of us already know who Amin was this movie simply capitalizes on that very powerful presumption or at least expects us to have this hideous view of him and develop or possess hatred towards Amin. However, what you get in this movie is a cute, happy, chubby and cheerful Idi Amin who many would easily think, after watching Forest Whitaker play the role, could have even easily been guided from his evil ways on to a path of sanity and goodness. With his brilliant straight-from-the-heart 10,000 watt smile and innocent eyes Foresh Whitaker plays a very different Idi Amin we aren't used to. Compare videos or images of the real Amin and you'll see there's no way that smile and those eyes of Whitaker could exude evil or fear of the real dictator.Then comes the fictional Scotsman who by twist of fate ends up as Amin's personal physician, friend and adviser. But is everything ok with the Scotsman and did he do right?Here is his list of misdemeanors.Killing of man and beast.1. In one of the early scenes where he confronts Amin, a cow is involved in an accident. The scene is a total goof-up. Amin needs nursing and the Scotsman who is there to assist seems to be more irritated by the agonizing cries of the helpless animal (as he is not able to concentrate on treating Amin) that he shoots it to death in cold blood. The viewer is made to believe that the Scotsman did right by delivering the animal from its pain. But Why didn't he think of administering a sedative? He could have given it an anaesthetic and later put it to sleep or nursed it to health. Better still he could have asked his female companion (who is also a doc) to do something about it. Euthanasia is not even advocated by doctors.2. Wrongly tipping Amin of an innocent colleage and that which cost the colleague his life.3. There is yet another scene where he runs over and kills an injured man to save his life and Amin's during a failed assasination attempt on Amin.4. And finally the most daring of all - trying to kill Amin himself. Amin's wife and the doctor who saves his life in the end are both killed or sacrificed for the Scotsman.And of course not to forget the Scotsman's no.1. misdemeanor - Philandering5. One of his one-night-stands is shown briefly in the beginning of the movie. When you can pass that off as lightly, comes the next one.6. Trying to unsuccessfully seduce his friend's (another Doctor's) wife.7. Having an affair with one of Amin's (of all people) wives and impregnating her in the process and then desperately trying to abort the baby.Be he a criminal, a terror, a despot, a murderer or even a canniabal but wasn't Amin's trust in his friendship betrayed? Or is the film trying to say, "If your trusted friend is a tyrant, you can go ahead and be a lover to his wife?" Preposterous!With all this going against the Scotsman how can the movie expect the viewer to offer sympathy for the Scotsman and let him get away with all of this? Well you could if the movie shows the real Amin, but what you get is some chubby, cheerful and guileless looking guy for Amin in Forest Whitaker.Then there is the sour Scotsman - Englishman rivalry which was totally unnecessary because that too backfires on the Scotsman when the latter agrees to help the Scotsman. I really want to know if Scotland is another country totally different in thinking and evolution and views from English. When the Scotsman says "I am Scottish.", does that mean they are much better off than their cousins and neighbors, the English, who at one time in history had colonized most of the civilization on this earth.This movie also has a very ridiculous scene where the Scotsman meets up with Amin, who with his friends are watching a porn movie under the influence of drugs and alcohol.All the negative aspects hides the good Afro songs and the lovely African landscape the movie has. Only the presumption that Amin was a hated guy saves this movie to some extent.Sharad Patel's "The rise and Fall of Idi Amin" made soon after Amin was ousted was in many ways comical and sometimes even exaggerated but at least it showed the world why the infamous despot was so dreaded. But even for those who knew Amin well this movie misleads them.

$REVIEW.: Cactus Flower is a cute and harmless film, but its dated and kinda corny now. Goldie Hawn is so adorable in this movie, no wonder she won best supporting actress, she's a hoot! Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman are great together, I just love them. Cactus Flower may have a few thorns but it is much-loved by fans so give this film a chance.

$review_text.: Necropolis (Bruce Hickey, 1987)Bruce Hickey's career in Hollywood as a writer/director lasted for all of one movie. Now that I have seen that movie, I'm pretty sure I understand why.Necropolis is the story of a 300-year-old witch (LeeAnne Baker, whose other credits are as obscure, and likely as awful, as this one) who is reincarnated as a punk rock/biker chick. She needs to sacrifice a virgin in order to regain her full powers, but she doesn't mind sacrificing a few non-virgins along the way in order to get the energy to feed the army of zombies she's growing beneath the streets of New York City. No one notices. (Oddly, this is the one detail in the entire plot for which I didn't need to suspend my disbelief.) There's a murder-mystery subplot that is, of course, tied back into the main plot, and a lame-brained romance between the cop investigating the case and the aforementioned virgin, but you can safely ignore it all. For that matter, you can ignore this entire movie, which has not a single redeeming quality to recommend it. The direction is shaky at best and nonexistent at worst, most of the acting makes more recent amateur productions (and I'm not talking about the really good ones, either) look like Oscar-winning fare, the cinematography is messy (and how hard is it to screw up a film that's basically perpetual night with lots of fog?), the sound mix seems to have been recorded through cotton batting... I could go on, but really, why waste any more words on this? Unless you have a serious penchant for awful eighties horror films, avoid this like the plague. I want my seventy-seven minutes back.

Until you have lost someone near and dear you want really understand the motivation, if you have then the animation is geared to a younger crowd...  A bit like your computer manual coming in crayon as another parallel.Reminds me a lot of when I went to see Marlie and Me with some relatives.

Well, in this Chipmunk movie, Alvin and the gang wash up on an island and find a lady that works for U.P.S. and has basketballs, golf balls, etc. with faces painted on them. So, there is nothing original in this flick.

$REVIEW.: This film reminds us of the stunning power of movies to alter historical fact and blind the clueless, fawning masses. Humberto Fontova helps us remember the real Che:"When you saw the beaming look on Che's face as the victims were tied to the stake and blasted apart by the firing squad," said a former Cuban political prisoner Roberto Martin-Perez ... "you saw there was something seriously, seriously wrong with Che Guevara." As commander of the La Cabana execution yard, Che often shattered the skull of the condemned man (or boy) by firing the coup de grace himself. When other duties tore him away from his beloved execution yard, he consoled himself by viewing the slaughter. Che's second-story office in Havana's La Cabana prison had a section of wall torn out so he could watch his darling firing-squads at work.Even as a youth, Ernesto Guevara's writings revealed a serious mental illness. "My nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood. Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any vencido that falls in my hands!" This passage is from Ernesto Guevara's famous Motorcycle Diaries, though Robert Redford somehow overlooked it while directing his heart-warming movie.The Spanish word vencido, by the way, translates into "defeated" or "surrendered."And indeed, "the "acrid odor of gunpowder and blood" very, very rarely reached Guevara's nostrils from anything properly describable as combat. It mostly came from the close-range murders of defenseless men (and boys.) Carlos Machado was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets from the firing squad shattered his body. His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley. All had resisted Castro and Che's theft of their humble family farm, all refused blindfolds and all died sneering at their Communist murderers, as did thousands of their valiant countrymen.The one genuine accomplishment in Che Guevara's life was the mass-murder of defenseless men and boys. Under his own gun dozens died. Under his orders thousands crumpled. At everything else Che Guevara failed abysmally, even comically.During his Bolivian "guerrilla" campaign, Che split his forces whereupon they got hopelessly lost and bumbled around, half-starved, half-clothed and half-shod, without any contact with each other for 6 months before being wiped out. They ... seemed incapable of applying a compass reading to a map. They spent much of the time walking in circles and were usually within a mile of each other. During this blundering they often engaged in ferocious firefights against each other."You hate to laugh at anything associated with Che, who murdered so many defenseless men and boys," says Felix Rodriguez, the Cuban-American CIA officer who played a key role in tracking him down in Bolivia. "But when it comes to Che as "guerrilla" you simply can't help but guffaw."Why is this murderous moron a hero of Robert Redford?

That is what kids feel


Especially if you do not know how to interact with not physical essence

Normally if you not interesting in contact "they" will eventually will loose interest in you or you will ask "them" to leave

Same like with people
That what mature psychic Chip Coffey trying to do in this film.Kids look really scared and it does not look like they faking it
Some kids posses with healing gift
And this work for them even better then any adult psychic could do because they not polluted with negative energy yet

But to perform healing they need a guide of course.Movie well done

There is a glitch though in second disk in "Angels and demons" (last 7 minutes of video does not synchronized with sound)

$REVIEW.: Here's one for the books! I find it interesting that a modern-day horror remake has gotten so many positive reviews, and I for one am happy! For I, too, think "The Hills Have Eyes" is an excellent modern-day horror movie! Early this past summer before I saw the movie, I watched a fan-made preview on Youtube and was stunned at the intensity and gore even in the preview! I knew I was in for something big when I got this.And wow, was I ever correct! "The Hills Have Eyes" is EXTREME and pushes the boundaries with visual shock

The mutants that live in the hills of the desert are all pretty terrifying and brutal, and there's LOTS of gore ALL throughout the movie.And that's one thing about this movie that I find really interesting: The fact that it can combine being really scary and MEGA gory at the same time! Most horror movies incline towards being really scary, but not having such an intense amount of gore, OR rely heavily on gore but not be as scary."The Hills Have Eyes" manages to be both really suspenseful and uber-bloody
The fact that the film-makers could find the perfect medium for the movie, and also maintain the awesome scenery and character development has thoroughly impressed me as a horror lover.Well, there's not much else to say here, other than this movie rocks! If you want a great horror movie, and one of the far better remakes of the last ten years, "The Hills Have Eyes" will have you glued to your couch! Thanks for the time, and peace.

$REVIEW.: Jose Cura, simply not in his best vocally here.In the 'bonus CD', Hvorostovsky and Cura commented on their portrayals in this production: they carried out real sword fights in Act I, as opposed to Pavarotti and Milnes' sham sword showing in the other set I've got. However, this highly dramatic scene has its cost - Cura was not attuned to this physical assertion. Dmitri actually gave an account of this scene in the commentary part - he gave credit to Cura, being a tenor, for making this scene dramatically effective. Judging from the performance, however, the credit actually goes to Dmitri, whose singing and acting (in duel) go on simultaneously in a high level without any sign of strain either way. A really great singing-actor. His di Luna is so adorable that really saved the production.Cura's great duet with Yvonne Naef was also strained. Excuse me for comparing his Manrico with Pavarotti's. Naef isn't bad, but the other has got the great Zajick...

$REVIEW.: Okay -- everyone has talked about the shaky camera work, the monster movie aspect, the limited backstory and exposition, and that it might not be the most horrific horror movie ever, but I think that these commentaries miss the point.  What ultimately makes a movie work (or not), is whether we care about the characters, and Cloverfield succeeds because we root for Rob (played by Michael Stahl-David) to save and reunite with Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Hud (T.J. Rogers) provide enough wit, sarcasm, humor and reality to keep us grounded and  involved.  The conceit of the single camcorder gives the movie a reality Youtube feel that heightens the illusion that these are real people, not just actors.The story in a nutshell is that a video has been recovered that shows what happens the night a horrific monster attacks New York.  It was supposed to be a testimonial tape for Rob as he prepares to go to Japan, and it was shot over a tape he made of a magical day he spent with Beth.  This way we get some of Rob and Beth's backstory at strategic intervals, we get introduced to the characters, and the horror story that unfolds is an accident of time and fate.It feels like the moviemakers -- JJ Abrams produced it, Matt Rees directed --must have felt that the 1998 remake of Godzilla was a missed opportunity, because this feels like an extended commentary on that film.  Like that movie, we don't see the monster fully for most of the film.  Unlike that film, this story is not about the military, scientists, etc. trying to fight the monster (though they are certainly present), but how ordinary people might experience the night.  As such it is much more successful.The jittery style may be tough to take at moments, but this is a film definitely worth seeing, and I think it will stick with you a little longer than the average horror movie because of the relationships at its heart.

$REVIEW.: This was a nice continuation of part 1; Loose ends are tied up, and we got to see a little more into the business side of this extremely disturbing 'industry'; The eBay-like auction sequence for people was quite amusing; I would have like to have seen the inner workings of this 'business' just a little more

There are several nice surprises, and Roth is a very skilled director who just gets better w/each picture


The consumerism thread will be lost on some, but that's okay
Roth has created a tense, great looking horror film; And while it's not quite as good as part 1, it's def
a worthy follow-up
It takes the premise of part 1 and expands it into other areas; There is one really horrific sequence in here I could have done without(the first torture sequence, literally a bloodbath...), but this sort of stuff just comes with the territory nowadays

Great stuff for those who liked the first and can stomach more of the same...and then some

$review_text.: Watching "The Matrix" more than a decade after it was made, my first thought was to how well the film stands the test of time. Granted, it has only been 11 years. But ideas about cyberspace have become more sophisticated, just as they have become a part of the daily lives of more people. The internet has become indispensable and mobile, whereas it was more esoteric in 1999, when "The Matrix" hit movie theaters. The cell phones were bigger then. People still had hard lines. And "hacker" had not yet become synonymous with Eastern European cybercriminals. The word still conjured up images of a sort of amateur insurgency in cyberspace that sought out information about hidden worlds. That is what the hackers of "The Matrix" do.It begins with two voices speaking over the green glow of a computer monitor. "Are you sure this line's clean?" one says, hinting at deception. Then to Earth's dystopian future, where a beautiful hacker clad in black vinyl, possessed of seemingly superhuman abilities, fights with police and flees federal agents to a phone booth, where she disappears. After that jolting introduction to stunning, dark production design and gravity-defying martial arts, we are transported to more familiar territory. A sleepy hacker has dozed off, when his computer appears to send him a message. "Wake up, Neo," it says. And "Follow the white rabbit,", which he does. He follows a punked out young woman with a white rabbit tattoo to a loud party where he will meet his destiny.It was quite an opening. Larry and Andy Wachowski, who wrote and directed "The Matrix", relied on imagery and ideas that the viewer would recognize to bring us into the world of the Matrix, while they created a truly beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic that audiences would not soon forget. "What is the Matrix?" is the nagging question that will drive Neo (Keanu Reeves) to discover that his world is not what it seems. He is a prisoner of illusion, a slave of an enormous system of inhuman machines. Kind of abstract for an action movie. But "The Matrix" cyberpunk tone, its stunning visuals, combined with themes that have variously been interpreted as socialist and capitalist, Christian and pantheist, postmodern and crassly commercial, give it staying power.A decade later, perhaps it has more meaning when a federal agent calls Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), fugitive hacker and hero of the rebellion, a "terrorist". And now that the Info Wars are upon us, the idea that hackers will save the world by revealing its hidden recesses, is either all the more nave or all the more likely, depending on who you think will win. Politics and post-modernist themes aside, any viewer who was unhappy with his or her job could, then and now, relate to the drudgery of the Matrix. It's one of those rare, good, character-driven actions movies that has wide audience appeal. And it would be a mistake to underestimate the power of the film's beauty, courtesy of cinematographer Bill Pope and production designer Owen Paterson. That's what keeps bringing me back.

$review_text.: This is the first Bond film with a pre-title sequence that has no direct relation to the ensuing action, with the implication that our hero has all kinds of adventures between the ones we actually see from beginning to end.  He's in South America somewhere, with the intent of blowing up some bad guy's lair.  But before he does, he unzips the drysuit he's been wearing to reveal a white dinner tuxedo.  This causes us Bond fans to grin from ear to ear.  By the time the credit sequence starts, with the credits super-imposed on a girl dipped in gold, and with the smutty-sounding, braying trumpets of the title song, culminating with Shirley Bassey belting out, "Gold-FEEN-gahhh!", Bond fans' toes are curling in ecstasy.My personal favorite was the preceding adventure, "From Russia with Love", but I can't blame those, inside or outside the 007 fan club, who give "Goldfinger" pride of place as the best Bond film.  It's certainly the quintessential one, the one that added the finishing touches to the blueprint already drawn in the inaugural film of the franchise, "Dr. No".  The (almost) real-world intrigue of "From Russia with Love" is cheerfully thrown overboard for mind-blowing gadgets and comedy.  If the first two films were a finishing school of sorts for Sean Connery, he graduates here with flying colors.  His performance is now complete:  unflappable, no wasted motion, always ready to deliver a wisecrack.  Held captive aboard Goldfinger's Lear jet, he awakes after having been drugged, focuses on Honor Blackman in front of him, who says, "My name is Pussy Galore."  Connery, bemused, looks down and mutters to himself, "I must be dreaming."  This was the moment when James Bond became a global cultural icon for all time.  As if that wasn't enough, just about the next thing he asks for is a "martini -- shaken, not stirred."  Game over!  Audiences laughed ... and secretly envied Bond's cool.Music and title sequence:  Not necessarily the best song of the franchise -- indeed, not necessarily the best song sung by Shirley Bassey in the franchise (see: "Diamonds are Forever") -- "Goldfinger" is, nonetheless, the most iconic.  Those three opening notes blasting your eardrums out compensate a great deal for the rather puerile lyrics.  John Barry uses variations of the theme song throughout the film.  The Monty Norman "Bond Theme", and Barry's own "Second Bond Theme", is scarcely heard.  The music here is "Only gold".Bond Girls:  I count three, though I realize not every fan does.  #1, of course, is Jill Masterson, played (all too briefly) by Shirley Eaton.  This aide-de-camp to Goldfinger, who we meet while she assists Goldfinger at card-cheating, ends famously belly-down nude and dead on a bed, entirely dipped in gold paint.  (Hilariously, Ian Fleming apparently thought that skin "breathes".)  It is one of cinema's all-time stunning images -- once seen, never forgotten.  #2 is her sister, Tilly Masterson (Tania Mallet), out for revenge, tracking down Goldfinger in Switzerland.  Because Bond is never given the opportunity to seduce her, some might not consider her an "official" Bond Girl, but I think that's a cavil.  #3 is Miss Galore, another aide to Goldfinger, a pilot who manages a troop of voluptuous female pilots, all blonde, calling themselves "Pussy Galore's Flying Circus".  Oh, and she knows judo, too.  I think the script toys with the idea of Galore being lesbian.  "You can turn off the charm, it won't work with me," she tells Bond early on in their acquaintance.  She's able to flip Bond over in a barn -- female physical prowess has traditionally been a sign of lesbianism in older literature and movies.  Her litter of blonde pilots is suggestive, as is the fact that Bond has to force himself on her a bit to consummate the seduction.  But none of all that is really to the point; what's interesting is the surprisingly strong feminist undercurrent under all three women's stories.  These women work for killers, or are potential killers themselves.  Not a damsel in distress in the lot.  This feminist strain would ebb and flow in later installments of the series (mostly ebb, though, at least until the 80s.)  Here, that tide is unusually high, unusually early.Gadgets:  The Aston-Martin DB5.  Enough said.  To give an idea of this car's hold on the public's imagination, when it showed up in "Skyfall", 48 years after its debut in "Goldfinger", people cheered in the movie theater I attended.  In many people's minds, the car defines what a Bond movie is supposed to be about.  It does everything but pay your taxes, let's put it that way.  Because of it, production designer Ken Adams' stunning room at Goldfinger's stud-farm, with its shifting walls and retracting floors, gets sadly overlooked.  The laser that nearly ends Bond's career as a seducer, and the Chinese "dirty" atomic bomb, both marvels of design and creativity (note the complicated-looking spinning rotors in the bomb), also qualify as gadgets, as far as I'm concerned."Goldfinger" is the funniest, and simply the most fun, of all Bond films.  The caveat, however, is that its grandiose plot (radiating the U.S. gold supply), over-the-top villainy (tossing bowler hats at people), and campy humor grew less enchanting with the view as those elements manifested themselves in later entries in the series.  Still, though:  5 out of 5.  Gold medal.

$review_text.: Relying on a horrifying story supposedly based on some true events and a very creepy atmosphere that builds throughout the movie, The original "Amityville Horror" is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, haunted house movie ever made.  Critics consistently point to the lack violence and overt action in the movie but, perhaps, what the "Amityville Horror" does not do is indeed the very same thing that makes it an effective ghost story/haunted house horror movie.So many of today's films attempt to create manifestations of demons, ghosts, and the like...the result is usually something laughable or just pathetic.  A brilliant case in point is the remake of "The Haunting".  The manifestations created there, while imaginative, are entirely ineffective at creating horror, and resulted in a disaster of a movie by the movie's conclusion.  In the original "Amityville Horror", the filmmakers do not try to do too much with the movie.  Thus, the saying, sometimes more is less and vice-versa.  What you do have in the original "Amityville Horror" is a classic haunted house movie, a great story supposedly based on true events, and a very true murder that happened at the Amityville house so many years ago.  Please see the "City Confidential" Amityville for an excellent treatment of that murder.The makers of the original "Amityville Horror" knew that the fact that several people were actually murdered in the Amityville house was unsettling enough for the audience.  So, the trick was to accentuate that horror by employing the Lutz's story (which they claim is based on actual events witnessed by them when they lived at the Amityville house) along with the house's morbid history to somehow convince the audience that the house is haunted, and that the house is evil.  I think the filmmakers of the original "Amityville Horror" were largely able to pull that off, but such a task does present difficulties of selling it to the audience.Basically, the original "Amityville Horror" (notice I say original because there has been a remake...look for my reviews on the remake and the sequels to the original in subsequent reviews) is about a family that moves to the Amityville house after some absolutely brutal murders take place at some point in the house's past.  After moving into the house, strange things begin to happen which are indeed rather small and pedestrian when considering the reputation of modern day horror movies.  However, the makers of the original "Amityville Horror" were able to create a scary atmosphere which is absolutely essential to any horror movie's success and effectiveness, especially a horror movie based on a haunted house.  It is this atmosphere present in the "Amityville Horror" that gets the viewer's imagination working.  Of course, the manifestations e.g. floating pig with red eyes, that are employed in the "Amityville Horror" do help in my opinion to accentuate the horror and the resonance of the scary atmosphere which is clearly present in this movie.Finally, the filmmakers' use of the story itself (which, as viewers' we should be skeptical of the Lutz's motives here) helps in the creation of the horror which is clearly evident in this movie.  The actual story of the Amityville house is presented and driven home to the audience quite well by the quality acting that is present in this movie.  Frankly, Margot Kidder and James Brolin do a hell of a job in this movie, as does the supporting cast.  The question remains however, whether the filmmakers did enough to this movie to make into the best horror movie it could be.  I would argue that they did for the very reason that the story itself has limitations, and therefore the movie has limitations as to how great an effective the movie can be as a horror movie.  I would argue that the original "Amityville Horror" is a very good horror movie, and that no horror movie fan's collection is complete without a copy of this DVD, mainly because the original "Amityville Horror" and probably "Burnt Offerings" are two of the very best haunted house movies ever created, if not the best, period.  I would argue that it is very difficult to make a movie like this work, but clearly the original "Amityville Horror" does work quite well, notwithstanding its obvious limitations (lack of manifestations of the evil entities).Perhaps the most effective criticism of "Amityville Horror" is its lack of violence within the heart of the movie.  Clearly, the audience gets a good picture of the brutal murders that occurred prior to the Lutz's moving in, but that is in the beginning.  Beyond that, there is not much violence in the movie at all, but that is because the filmmakers were trying to sell the original "Amityville Horror" as a TRUE haunted house story.  Now, whether they pulled that off or not is for the viewer to decide.  That being said, I do recommend the original "Amityville Horror" to any serious horror movie fan as one of the best haunted house horror movies ever made.

$REVIEW.: Five stars for the LOTR trilogy, theatrical editions or extended director's version. These movies made over a billion dollars, so why the greed. Both versions should be included in this blu-ray release. 'They' must know that everyone buying this, already own at least one set of the standard versions and will never watch them again. As for me, I'll rent the blu-ray from netflix or BB and wait it out.

$REVIEW.: I can't say enough about this wonderful movie.  I had not heard of this movie but caught it on one of my movie channels when checking upcoming movies and was floored by the acting, the story line, directing, everything!  I knew I had to get the DVD. It's a must see and especially poignant to anyone dealing with a loss, which is everyone at some point.  I admire how they tackled and portrayed this topic.  I have watched it several times since I purchased it and it feels the same way every time, heartwarming, heart wrenching, eye-opening with unbelievable acting.  All the actors did a wonderful job, but Mark Thompson's acting was riveting and filled with emotion and he made you feel that emotion and amazing veteran actor Kevin Pollak's acting was right-on as the psychiatrist, extremely touching.  It was an amazing movie, one I will never forget.  Fantastic!

$REVIEW.: I love horses

I will suffer through bad acting, awful plots, and overly precious child actors in just about any horse movie, and for me to say Black Beauty was almost unbearable is a statement and a half


I was hoping for so much more from this film after reading about how much more faithful a version it was


Having sat through two '80s animated monstrosities, an entertaining but in-name-only New Zealand made TV series, and a downright awful '70s version that has Beauty in the circus, going to war, and involved with a bunch of Irish Travelers, I was expecting much better from something prouduced in the '90s.It all starts innocently enough, with the lovely Sean Bean attending to Beauty from his birth and throughout his training and though I was a bit annoyed that the fox hunt was cut I could understand why something so brutal was left out


From thereonin it was all downhill

Absolutely pointless changes were made, nobody is permitted to die, they simply get fired or move to the country, and if we aren't shown anything an offhand remark tells us that 'all the other horse were saved too'
I can understand not wanting to frighten children but for heaven's sake, animals died in Babe didn't they?Black Beauty was not intended to be a kids' book, it was meant to draw attention to animal cruelty of the time period and for it to be so dumbed down is annoying


We are told Ginger is vicious, and there is an offhand comment about previous bad owners but that's about it

Only Beauty is given a voice and Merrylegs' and Ginger's stories are left frustratingly untold, replaced with overlong shots of them frolicking that will have even children getting antsy


And how annoying is it that Ginger is bizarrely made into a love interest? At least with the other Black Beauties the changes were apparent enough from the start that you weren't expecting much later on.Weird edits give us random shots of doors as scenes end or shots of Beauty tossing his head for minutes on end

The movie is 87 minutes long but because of the extended horse footage it seems to take forever

You know there's a problem when I'm counting down the minutes to when David Thewlis pops up instead of swooning over the horsies.I'm not so heartless as to not admit that the film made me cry, twice no less, but those were the only times I felt anything other than apathy or annoyance

It's too bad, because this really had the potential to be like Nightmare Before Christmas or Spirited Away and have a crossover appeal to young and old audiences

If you want a good horse film you won't have to suffer too much through, get Misty instead and, for a lush children's period piece, pick up the '95 incarnation of A Little Princess
Either way you'll have a nice family movie that will encourage kids to pick up a book without insulting your intelligence in the process.

$REVIEW.: I share the views of my fellow balletomane and reviewer, Jack Wilensky, but will be less generous than he in my rating (1 vs 2 stars).  There is absolutely nothing in this production of merit.  I can only hope that Patrice Bart's equally deplorable re-staging of Coppelia (for the POB) never makes it to DVD, as it was torture to sit through it (at 80 Euros per ticket, no less).  Although I would never say "no to innovation," there are some ballets where too radical a departure from the original choreography / libretto (Bejart's Nutcracker and Bourne's Swan Lake come to mind) simply destroys the beauty of the work.  And I regret that's just what the Mariinsky succeeded in doing here.  Stick to the definitive (though hardly flawless) Australian Ballet version.

$review_text.: Sorry if you are looking for the Hercule Poirot of the earlier series


Gone is Capt Hastings and Miss Lemon and much of the light-heartedness


Instead, we have an isolated, frustrated, Poirot who is aboard the Orient Express


David Suchet has created a deeper Poirot
The classic 1975 version plays up the camp - this one plays up the inner life of character
Suchet's Poirot now is an older man who's world is closing in on him
A crime at the start of the movie sets the tone which is not from the novel

What comes after is a study in appropriate crime verses punishment and a test of Poirot's belief that the guilty must always be punished

Some complain about the scene where Poirot is praying


While not in the novel, Agatha Christie did make Poirot a Catholic
The scene of the detective and the victim both praying before bed speaks volumes about their inner lives


Not preachy, just exposing another facet of a complex character.We also need to email ITV ([...]) or WGBH ([...]) to ask them to continue the series as they are considering canceling it before Suchet finishes the last handful of stories


Of course, the last episode should be "Curtain," the death of Poirot

$review_text.: "The Expendables" is an action film that's less about the action and more about the 80s retread cast.  Where else can Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) face off once more? Or watch Jet Li face off against Lundgren? Or witness Jason Statham compete in a knife throwing contest with Stallone? Or watch Mickey Rourke lecture Stallone? Or listen to Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Stallone quip wise in a church? Nowhere else!  Depending on whether or not you find these kinds of face-offs intriguing will determine your level of interest in this film.That's it.  The characters' names and back stories mean less to the film than the actors themselves, whose legendary oeuvre make it impossible to see them as anything else. This is not a film where Jet Li plays the demolitions expert and Stallone is the martial artist.  Everyone fits comfortably back into their own roles like a well-worn glove and embraces it with gusto as they take on the actor known for arch-villainy across all of Syfy-dom, Eric Roberts.Our motley team of mercenaries belongs to a biker gang known as The Expendables, based in New Orleans. There's the leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), stabby guy Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), sniper Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), heavy weapons guy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and blow-things-up guy Toll Road (Randy Couture). Their workaday rhythm of blasting bad guys goes south when Jensen loses it during a mission and Christmas discovers his girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) has left him for another man. That's what passes for character development.In an aging warrior dialogue reminiscent of Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns," Ross wears his military mantle with a heavy brow.  He no longer fights for anything - it's part of being a mercenary after all - and without family to speak of he longs to be passionate about something, lest he turn into a raving psychopath like Jensen. The film reaches its spiritual apex in a dialogue between Ross and Tool (Mickey Rourke), who does more acting in five minutes than the entire crew manages in the rest of the movie. Can our hero find redemption?Ross finds hope in spunky Sandra (Gisele Itie) who ferociously resists dictator General Garza (David Zayas, subdued here) in the South American island nation of Vilena. Of course, there's always an evil American behind all this, and unrepentant ex-CIA officer James Monroe (Eric Roberts) pulls the puppet strings. Even with Paine (Steve Austin) and the Brit (Gary Daniels) amongst his troops, Monroe doesn't have a chance.If you can't guess how this is going to end then you haven't seen many action movies. Suffice it to say that dictators are overthrown, buildings are blown up, and souls are saved. Along the way villains are shot, sliced, stabbed, crushed, and burned alive.  The dialogue is occasionally funny (Yang complaining about how he has to get paid more because he works harder due to his small stature really cracked me up), the violence always intense, and the pace never, ever slows down.  "The Expendables" doesn't aim very high but hits the bulls-eye anyway as an action flick that's all action.
$review_summary.: All action, all the time!

$REVIEW.: Even with the sometimes less than clean special effects (this WAS 1957!)the acting and story line I do believe could not be acceptably duplicated even in this day and time, unless an understanding and wise hand guided it (I'm thinking of Frank Darabont or Rob Reiner, for example). This has been called a horror movie by most, but it is in reality a science fiction film much like "Tarantula" and "Monster on the Campus", also fun to watch films. Grant Williams was trained in acting by the now legendary Lee Strasberg. He literally beat and hammered his students into greatness! The moving, touching, and well muted performance given by Mr. Williams as can be seen in the fact that he carried much of this film by himself, acting against nothing, but had to react against large spiders, oversized cats, and so on, and telling his narrative throughout, and is pulled off with rare ability that works all the way. This is a captivating, well acted, very well directed film that no one will regret viewing again and again, and again. Two thumbs up for this one. HIGHLY recommended Sci-Fi feature.

So when I saw the preview ofDurango Kids on another DVD, I decided to rent it on Netflix.  It isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish, and the kids, whilecute, outsmart all the stupid adults.  The first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around Durango, including the steam train (that'swhy I purchased a used copy) but then it goes into time travel to saveOuray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore,intended for young and undemanding children.

$review_text.: It's the future, which looks a lot like a more extreme late sixties, and Italian Marcello Poletti is SO done with women, and plain tired of life. American Caroline Meredith wants something, anything to excite her - she describes herself as "an iceberg." A computer in Geneva pairs the two of them. Not for a possible romance, but for murder - they are to be Victim and Hunter, respectively, for Caroline's tenth Hunt. The Great Hunt is a globally sanctioned contest that allows a legal, entertaining outlet for humanity's murderous impulses, and we watch the two main characters stalk each other through the streets and night spots of Rome. Cool, sexy, even romantic in the way only a late-60's Italian film can be, Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress plot, plan, double-cross and scheme right up until the final minutes of the film, in a flawed but entertaining romance/comedy/social satire. It scrapes classichood - if it had only been a bit more daring in the script and had a tighter ending. But it's worth repeat viewings - Cult film with a capital "Cult." The English version is good...the Italian just a touch better. Soundtrack cooler than mint gelato.

$REVIEW.: &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; is a unique docudramedy about the port city of Manchester, England, and the man who reigned over not one but two separate musical & cultural revolutions in that city, &quot;TV personality&quot; Tony Wilson. While it has some hilarious moments rivaling the mighty &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; in how it nails rock culture so succinctly, and some surreal touches (like the seaside funeral of Ian Curtis), it's a compelling blend of &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot;-style underground history with a verite, documentary feel and great characterization of Wilson's massive ego by comedian Steve Coogan. He's by turns irritating and endearing, but always ironic (and one has to be when dealing with the likes of record producer Martin Hannett and the Happy Mondays, as Wilson did). Winterbottom's film embodies a world-weary and wizened viewpoint on the whole thing by employing a loose & episodic structure as we witness Wilson/Coogan struggling to keep everything in perspective for himself and the viewer. All talk of Renaissance Florence aside, he's not the 20th century equivalent of Lorenzo de Medici (and he knows it) but you feel his half-serious attempts to justify himself and Manchester while the British economy collapses and his personal life tanks while he struggles to keep from selling out (not selling out being the only true way to succeed) and honor the vision of his incomparably influential Factory record label artists like Joy Division/New Order and the Happy Mondays. Then comes rave culture, born in his very nightclub, the Hacienda. It's quite an extraordinary story (I knew nothing about Wilson's hand in any of this, so I learned a lot while being thoroughly entertained by Coogan and the cast, who do a great job). And all the music is great of course! Highly recommended...

 As has been said before: the name Ozu and the word "great" are synonymous

But I thought I might warn you about the "box".This box set doesn't have one


 But what's that in the photo you see up above?  That, friend, is a slip case -- a piece of cardboard with four sides


 There is no top, no bottom..

no box.What you're actually buying is 5 discs in the new slimline cases held together by a sleeve
 A sturdy sleeve, yes, but one that shifts form into a parallelogram depending on how you hold it
 Either way, make sure you hold it horizontally
 As I mentioned, there is no top and no bottom
 Hold it the way you'd initially be inclined to and all five slimcases promptly slide out the bottom

Does this make sense?  Who builds a box with no bottom?I'm grateful Criterion has created the new Eclipse series and is thus bringing us films we wouldn't usually have access to, but why lie about the packaging?  Yes, the photo they provide is a lie


 If you look at that you imagine a slipcase that opens on the side, properly holding your movies, right?  Or a fold-out box keeping your precious new Ozu discs snug in a logical manner
 Who enjoys pulling something off the shelf with their other hand supporting the bottom so the contents don't spill?Speaking for myself, if I had seen the product properly when it was advertised I wouldn't feel cheated and disappointed right now.

$REVIEW.: With a plot that sounds like it might have come from an Alfred Hitchcock or Brian De Palma movie "Prison Break" seemed the least likely candidate for buzz and a large following on Fox. I expected the show despite the high quality writing, top notch pilot episode directed by theatrical director Brett Ratner ("X-Men: The Last Stand" and "Red Dragon") to tank with audiences.Boy was I wrong and happy about it. The suspenseful series got the right promotional push from Fox and luckily audiences were ready for another ground breaking series using a season long story arc much like "24" and "Lost". I would have expected a show like "Prison Break" to be on HBO or Showtime (as their answer to "OZ" another ground breaking prison drama that focused less on the gimmicks of this show) not on Fox's network. Reportedly the producers planned a shelf life of "Prison Break" for two seasons recognizing the issues they had with shows such as "The X-Files". I suspect that if the show continues to be popular this will morph into something akin to "The Fugitive". The show also was clearly inspired by "The Shawshank Redemption" and the TV show "OZ" but has its own unique flavor making it much more than a simple copycat. Between top notch writing, directing and acting the show has become the only breakthrough hit from last season worth following.If you know what this show is about skip this paragraph and go to the extras. The story for those that haven't followed the show is quite simple; Michael Scofield's brother Lincoln has been sentenced to die in the electric chair for a crime he didn't commit. Michael will do anything to get him out of prison. As the clock is ticking and its clear that legal options are limited he obtains the prison blueprints to get his brother out. How can he get them to his brother so he can use them? Simple Michael has them tattooed on his back. He then stages a bank robbery to get himself thrown into the same prison as his brother. His plans are to break out with his brother and eventually disappear. While their lawyer tries to get Lincoln out legally Michael must move forward with his plan and also negotiate a complex peace with inmate John Abruzzi (the marvelous Peter Stormare best known for "Fargo" and "Constantine") who controls many of the inmates inside the prison to achieve his goal."Prison Break" is presented in its original widescreen presentation and looks quite good here. There were occasional compression artifacts and edge enhancement but nothing too distracting. Overall colors are accurate with nice clarity and definition to the images. The surround tracks are used quite effectively as well evoking the atmospheric surroundings of the prison.For those interested in the extras included with this set they are quite extensive. We get multiple commentary tracks on the pilot episode by Paul Scheuring & Dominic Purcell with a second one by director Brett Ratner & Mark Helfrich.

Extras also include 2 Alternate Scenes for Cute Poison as well as three featurettes. The first  "If These Walls Could Speak: Profile of the Joliet Correctional Center" takes you inside the correctional facility.  "Beyond the Ink: Tattoo Featurette" focuses on the extensive "map" that plays a key role in the series tattooed on the back of Michael Scofield and one of Fox's routine " Inside Look" previews. All in all an exceptional package of extras considering the price for the series that will definitely make this set worthwhile for both new fans and ones that have been following it on the Fox network since its premiere last year. This set arrives just in time for the premiere of the second season as well.A terrific, comprehensive set from fox "Prison Break" has been packed with commentary tracks and has three featurettes two of which vary from exceptional to very good with one so-so one recycled for this set. Overall this is a great value and is highly recommended. I suspect that the creators of the series weren't sure if the show would last more than one season and, as a result, structured the series so that it could be easily wrapped up if necessary but also allowing an out for a second story arc recognizing that fans would be frustrated if they remained within prison walls beyond the first season of the series.

NBC blew it when they cancelled it

$review_text.: Wow! I feel like a little kid at Xmas time, with the long awaited release of Maude on March 20th, a six season release of All in the Family Feb. 13th, and another installment of The Jeffersons!!! Thank you Sony!!! Eventhough I'm thankful to see The Jeffersons being released, it would be nice if there was some kind of tribute or rememberance of cast members who are no longer with us, which include Roxie Roker, Franklin Cover, Isabel Sanford, and Mike Evans. I was looking at an episode of All in the Family today on dvd (The one when George and Louise move on up), and it was kind of sad to realize that more than half of the original cast of the Jeffersons is gone, along with Mother Jefferson.Unfortunately, most shows from the 70's don't get the royal treatment with dvd extras like current tv shows. It just seems like the studios just don't care enough to take the time to include the actors, who are a major part of the shows success. I'm sure Sherman Hemsley, Marla Gibbs, Paul Benedict, and Belinda Tolbert would love to share their stories of being apart of a sitcom classic!!! Oh well, I guess I'll just be grateful to even get The Jeffersons and All in the Family on dvd!

$REVIEW.: This was a rock on kind of film. I liked it a lot, and thought it was well made and filled with fighting, blood and gore, intense terror, and everything else one would want to see in an R-rated dinosaur flick. I don't know why some people put it down. I loved the nasty raptors and ferocious T-Rex, and of course the sex scene in the truck just before the girl's dopey boyfriend got ripped to pieces. And Dr. Hyde was a good villain. I also thought the blonde woman in it was hot, and that there were many cool quotes. And the guns? Forget it! They and their users were all that and a bag of chips. This movie is cool and well put together, and I recommend it highly! Only reason it doesn't get 5  stars is because the acting and ending could have been made a little bit better, but otherwise it rocks.

 They have to eliminate the People who are the Backbone of this country to get what they want total Dictatorship, period


 They send our jobs overseas and do NOT care at all about our safety, environment, nor each and everyone who is not a member of the Republican Party
 Progressive People is the answer to stopping this, as look what they did recently in the Senate by NOT passing Gun Control Law that would prevent more of us innocent dying right before our loved ones

$REVIEW.: Apparently one of Dostoyevsky's more obtuse works, the lack of audio in English and VERY POOR SUB-TITLES (some parts are just gibberish, written I think by a Russian who has a basic, working knowledge of English rather than by an English speaker who has a good knowledge of Russian) meant that I found it very heavy going. I think I need to find a good translation of the novel and watch it over again to even get a rough idea of what it is all about.If nothing else the sub-titles to this visually impressive movie lends a great deal of weight to the idea that sub-titles should first be written by a native speaker of the language in which the movie is set and then vetted by a native speaker of the target language.

$REVIEW.: {4.25 stars}First off, I'm sure that there are discrepancies between this film and the real story of the Columbia University love-triangle of Allen Ginsburg, Lucien Carr, and David Kammerer. I'm judging KILL YOUR DARLINGS according to story-value, not historical accuracy.KILL YOUR DARLINGS is well-filmed and well-played, and Daniel Radcliffe is particularly memorable as the young Allen Ginsburg. It shows a great deal about how he was influenced and changed by the early Columbia "Beat" circle of Burroughs, Kerouac, and others such as Carr whose names, for various reasons, have been largely forgotten. It realistically evokes the 1940s, and the story of WWII is skillfully paralleled with that of the young writers' circle. Their college-boy pretensions, which, nevertheless, have real sincerity behind them, also shine through very well. Coincidentally, it's intriguing to see the horribly inconsistent laws regarding homosexuals, as well as the level of "in loco parentis" control universities wielded at the time.Not to sound snooty, but one needs some basic familiarity with the major literary characters and the Beat movement in general in order to really appreciate and enjoy this film. Those who aren't into fiction and poetry of the sort written by these characters may be rather bored with KILL YOUR DARLINGS. Otherwise, while there are a few patchy spots, the whole tale of the antics, jealousies, and everything else that happens in the young libertine writers' circle, ending with a murder and the dilemmas that follow, makes for a gripping and very intelligent movie.

$review_text.: What should have been a nice showcase for Liv Tyler is instead an almost unwatchable 93 minute failure.  Hottie Tyler comes to jerkwater town running a con and ruins the lives of five men, four who end up dead.  This is all in the name of attaining a house that in her words could be featured in a magazine, but this dream is in reality just [an] enclave of bad taste, like when hillbillies rob an armored car.  In the end, she prances off unscathed and oblivious to the lives she's ruined. Paul Riser is contemptable as usual, John Goodman is just going though the motions, Michael Douglas is pratically cadaverous looking as a hitman with a high rise wig.  I think the main reason he is in this movie is because it is his production company or something like that.  Matt Dillon's performance is harmless enough, but the true surprises are Reba McEntire as a shrink and Andrew Clay as the vengeful brother at the film's climax, a shootout which borrows from True Romance (they may have borrowed it, too). Liv Tyler is barely on screen and when she is they don't give her too many lines; it's mainly a sausage parade.  There was what could have been an amusing Village People riff if better scripted, but there are basically zero laughs in this movie.  I do not recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Alot of Bewitched fans looked forward to this film coming out since it had been talked about, and planned for several years


Nicole Kidman was always expected to play Samatha too


 Even as far back as 1998 there was talk about this film happening at some point.Move forward to 2004
Bewitched is made, and then released in 2005
Mixed reviews start to surface, most of them bad
I still went to see it, being a Bewitched fan and all


 Unfortunately, all the reviews were right, this is a total disaster
A film about an out-of-work actor trying to reprise his career by doing a remake of the Bewitched TV series set in modern times
 Unknowingly they hire an actual witch to portray the role of Samatha Stevens

Sounds like it could work
But it doesn't because the film focusses far too much on Will Ferrell's character
Why oh why didn't they just do a movie about Bewitched, instead of doing this silly idea

The reason it failed is because Will Ferrell was so annoying and not at all funny throughout the film

In addition, he has no resemblance to Darren Stephens (an idea would have been to use Jim Carrey)


 Nicole Kidman put on a whispering voice the entire film, although this is probably what she was asked to do by Nora


 Unfortunately for Nicole, this was her third dud film in a row ..
Stepford Wives, Birth and now this


 Even The Interpreter was pretty bad, but nothing quite takes the cake as Bewitched.Do yourself a favour

 Dont hire or buy the DVD unless you can get it for a bargain

 Better still, avoid at all costs.

$review_text.: It was Tolstoy who declared that "happy families are all alike," and while he probably wasn't thinking in terms of the passage of time, this classic screen adaptation of an equally classic stage play (which was itself adapted, and very well, from Clarence Day's volume of reminiscencesLife With Fatherof his boyhood in late-19th-C. Manhattan) shows that there are certain constants about family life even after more than a century.  In 1883 the Day family--stockbroker Clarence Sr. (William Powell), known to most of his intimates as Clare; his wife Vinnie (Irene Dunne); and sons Clarence Jr. (Jimmy Lydon), almost 18, John (Martin Milner), 14, Whitney (Johnny Calkins), 10, and six-year-old Harlan (Derek Scott)--lives a comfortable upper-class life in a brownstone house at 420 Madison Avenue, where "Father" definitely rules the roost, or at least tries to.  But the servant problem, a loveably scatterbrained and financially hopeless wife, and four boys with redheaded high spirits make life a lot more difficult than he'd prefer.  When Vinnie's Cousin Cora (Zasu Pitts) and a young friend, 15-year-old Mary Skinner (Elizabeth Taylor), come to visit, a revelation ensues that shocks the devout Vinnie: Clarence has never been baptized!  Will he ever get to Heaven?  Is she really married to him?  Are her sons (horrors!) even legitimate?  Vinnie resolves to get her husband to the font come hell or high water.  Meanwhile young Clarence is suffering the pangs of first love, which he tries to deal with as he thinks his father would (a situation complicated by the inexplicable fact that his new suit, cut down from one of Clarence Sr.'s, seems disinclined to "do anything that Father wouldn't do," including kneel to a girl or let her sit on his lap); John, eager to earn some extra spending money, is given "the whole territory of Manhattan" in which to sell a patent medicine that proves a good deal less virtuous than its advertising suggests; Whitney struggles with his catechism, and Harlan with issues like oatmeal (which he hates) and the prospect of being kissed by girls (which is even worse).  Clare and Vinnie don't seem to share a bedroom, yet it's obvious that they love each other dearly and have ever since their marriage 20 years ago; Vinnie is constantly trying to soothe Clare's outbreaks of temper, and Clare, when Vinnie becomes mysteriously ill, is utterly lost without her.  And while the four boys may behave much more formally than youngsters of today, they're still recognizably red-blooded American lads: girls and money interest the older ones, and though he may have to do it in a short-pants sailor suit ornamented with soutache, Whitney is so eager to pitch that he bolts his breakfast shamefully.  At the center of it all is Father, played so masterfully by Powell that he should have been awarded the Oscar (he *was* among the finalists).  This is a great family film, full of humor, unforgettable characters, and talking points.

The director sends a letter about the show to a Mr. Oppenheimer who is going to send Mr. Guffman from Broadway to view their play.  This stirs up some high expectations by the actors and director of the play, and they begin to dream of what this might lead to. Waiting for Guffman is a comedy that has dry humor that grows on the audience as the film progresses.  The actors perform well, which creates some very interesting characters that keep the audience's attention and leads the story toward a very rewarding cinematic experience.

$review_text.: I have seen this mini-serie on HBO, in my country, Brazil and I have LOVED it! I have readen Victor Hugo's Les Miserables several times and I have seen almost all the movie-screen versions of this romance and I can assure all that it is the best one! First, it follows the twists and turns of the book with almost meticulous details. Second, G&eacute;rard Depardieu is the PERFECT Jean Valjean, almost to the bones of his crooked nose and slightly hunched back (read his description in Victor Hugo's book!) Liam Neeson is too elegant and too handsome to fit this description!!! Third,  as Les Miserables comes, longer is better, because there is so much to tell, so many nuances that the shorter versions do not show! And I would go on and on because that is one of my favorite books and this movie is my favorite version. A plus: John Malkovich as Inspector Javert is ousttanding and Christian Clavier as Th&eacute;nardier oh, that is a trio you will not easily forget. Another movie made by the three of them is NAPOLEON, with Christian Clavier as Napoleon, John Malkovich as Taillerand (chilling as a machiavellian politician !) and Depardieu as Fouch&eacute;, a minor role, but very important in the plot. If you REALLY want to see the very best version of LES MISERABLES see this movie. You will not regret the almost 7 hours of duration. To know the best of Victor Hugo go to the French versions! Hollywood may do great action movies but the classical...I prefer the French adaptations!(That is not a prejudice, but compare, if you will, the Hollywood version with Liam Neeson with this meticulous and very literary French version with G&eacute;rard Depardieu and you will agree with me.That is the same with the Count of Monte-Cristo, starred by the same G&eacute;rard Depardieu. Oh, well, if you can see a movie starred by G&eacute;rard Depardieu I garantee it will ALWAYS be a good one, because Mr. Depardieu is one of the finest actors of our times.

$REVIEW.: WARNING :  This review is for the theatrical film not the DVD.You know a movie is in trouble when a major character is so unsympathetic you wish he'd be the first one to go.  That's exactly the case with the flesh-eating-virus blood-fest CABIN FEVER. Braindead-but-gun-happy Bert (James DeBello) is so aggravating, relief is felt when his life finally ends (where, ironically, the hunter looking to shoots "gay (!) squirrels" becomes the hunted himself).  If only his presence is the only thing that makes the audience cringe, but alas, most of the production does as well.  What could have been a fun B-movie extravaganza a la Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a la Evil Dead only turns out to be a less than impressive copy-cat film of all these classics.  Everything you watch feels taken badly from one horror movie after another.  The Sam Raimi woods-speed shots, the Tobe Hooper panorama-filmed atmosphere, the Peter Jackson below shots...  As for his cast, the only one who brings some depth to his otherwise thinly created character is TV Boy Meets World star Rider Strong.  His performance as the doomed hero is both sharp and fresh, and so worthy of better projects.  The rest of the cast (including the uncredited acting part of director Roth himself as the pot-smoking freak) goes from decent (first girl-victim Ladd) to awful (Debello).The second half of the film is where the "fun" really begins and it is also where the plot really thickens, as we are treated to a no holds barred action/horror flick with surprising twists and turns.  The only downside is its last shot, which would have worked better on the cutting room floor ; did we really need to see the town folks drinking that infested lemonade to understand that all are doomed ?  Speaking of less is more, the overlong relieved-reaction shot of the hiding-in-the-woods "survivor" Jeff (Joey Kern) was desperately in need of some cutting as well.  Anyone could have guessed his outcome.  But despite its many flaws, the film stays with you.  Just like the so-much-better 28 DAYS LATER, the subject is so contemporary, one can't help but wonder if-or when-reality will take over. 2  stars.-----Martin Boucher

$review_text.: Batman Begins is such a good, involving film, it almost renders all past film incarnations obsolete! The only one worth mentioning in a positive light from now on is Tim Burton's 1989 original-but I still liked this better.Christian Bale is absolutely dead-on as Batman/Bruce Wayne! I remember being pleased with the news of his casting, but his performance exceeded my expectations. He nails both the intensity and the wry humor the character should always have, and he actually looks the part of both Bruce (handsome playboy) and Batty (physically intimidating, athletic). The supporting cast here is quite impressive (They actually support without taking away from the central character. Genius!). Michael Caine is actually better than the previous Alfred, which is saying a lot! Morgan Freeman is reliable as ever, as is Gary Oldman. Liam Neeson is also in fine form in what you initially think is an obvious prototype performance as the wise mentor. Even Katie Holmes comes off at least as good as Kirsten Dunst did in Spiderman.Other helpful attributes to this film are it's story, which thankfully takes the time to explain itself and, as a result, all the usual Batman myths become more than just convenient plot devices. Also, the tone of the movie just feels right. It's dark and serious when necessary, always edgy, and adds just the right amount of quirky winking humor at just the right times. This is probably due to Christopher Nolan's more-than-capable directing. He is a real talent and has yet to have a misstep in his short but impressive career. The music is typical Hans Zimmer material without much of a theme (not a criticism) and not very comic-book sounding a la Danny Elfman, but still evokes a since of legend and excitement.Overall, Batman Begins is a real summer treat! An entertaining film that rings true on just about every level. This lumbering franchise has been both redeemed and taken to new heights, and I for one can't wait to see how it unfolds this time in sequel form. As long as they keep the essential elements of this film intact, it should be a very enjoyable ride!

$REVIEW.: This is the best I've seen of the Fulci collection


Although the script and acting were less than perfect, the gore was the best I've seen in any of his movies

While most of his splatter effects are somewhat unrealistic in his other films, the ones in 'Zombie' were quite convincing - AND original

The splinter into the eye was painful just to watch

The shark/underwater zombie scene was also original.The soundtrack was actually quite good

It's erie and futuristic (for the time)
Every now and then, I catch myself humming the main theme.Since all zombie movies inherently share many characteristics, 'Zombie' parallels several other works
But overall, this one is original enough to have its own identity.

$REVIEW.: Viewed: 9/11Rate: 29/11: As much as I love Roman Polanski's works, The Fearless Vampire Killers left me extremely disappointed

There has been a countless of vampire movies that this film never stood out

And also, believe me...I've seen probably a good fifty to seventy-five something vampire movies, so many that there ought to be a law banning any more movies


They are all the same to me, and there isn't a single good one
If you want to get your full satisfaction and a truly thorough pleasant experience, just read the book Dracula by Bram Stoker


It has been often imitated but never ever been equaled


Back to the film The Fearless Vampire Killers, it is quite apparent that the makers just happened to find beautiful settings and then proceeded to do impromptu scenes right to the end

The film attempts at comedy but fails to elicit a laughter out of me

Pretty much the entire time, I kept looking at the timer and asking myself, "How much longer?" All in all, The Fearless Vampire Killers is a huge dud.

$REVIEW.: it says it right on the cover "oldschool american horror." if you go into this expecting an Oscar winner, you are obviously gonna be disappointed. this is a no frills, no holds barred slasher flick. on the other hand, the villain's appearance among other things really keep me from taking it very seriously. part homage, part spoof, Hatchet deffinitely gets the job done.the killer is one Victor Crowley. born with various deformities all over his body, he grew up secluded in his home with his father. that is, until the day some local kids accidentally start a fire in the house. Victor's father accidentally killed him with a hatchet while trying to get through the door to save him. now he wanders those same woods and swamps looking to dish out some pain in return for his own.starts off with a relatively traditional horror intro (you know what im talking about)cut to a couple days later. the main character("villain" from Grandma's Boy! also in Accepted) of this movie is highly unhappy at Mardi Gras and looks into a haunted swamp tour for some alternative entertainment. most of the characters are fairly cliched. you got the paris hiltonish girls (eh), the hero, the token back dude, the sensitive guy, the completely helpless old couple, and the sleaze. traditionally, it doesnt take too long for the chaos to begin.a fairly over-used formula at this point, but just like "The Tripper", "Hatchet" manages to be supremely entertaining with an extremely interesting kill or two thrown in for good measure. plenty of blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan, but probably not grisly enough for the most jaded of gore hounds. kills with nothing but bare hands, kills with the ominous hatchet, and a power tool may even just get thrown in there. the action does not disappoint. while i didnt find it genuinely scarey at any moment (they hardly ever are), you feel a little tension at times, it has very satisfying death sequences(victor can be so creative!) and some surprisingly good humor, its an extremely entertaining horror movie. recommended to fans of the genre, especially slasher fans. most others wont get it.

$REVIEW.: It's probably unfair to compare this with other hospital TV series, but it's inevitable--at least, it is for me.  For the most part this is an excellent series, but not quite as good as "Grey's Anatomy," because I didn't identify as closely with the characters.  Anthony Edwards is fine in the lead, and George Clooney is surprisingly good.  The one character I found distasteful was the one played by Eriq La Salle.  I don't think it was the actor's fault.  He didn't write the lines, nor was he the director.  It's just that his character is always negative and makes all sorts of contorted, smirking faces to show his displeasure at everything, and with everyone.The story lines are quite good, and most of the characters feel exactly right.  The sets couldn't be better.  As an aside, however,I can't imagine why anyone would want to work in the emergency room of a hospital.  I have, alas, gone through emergency rooms as a patient, and it's amazing that doctors and nurses there can keep some semblance of sanity.I did feel tense in watching the chapters of this dvd set.  It's bloody sometimes.  There are tragedies and very little happiness.  Will I watch subsequent years?  Probably not.  It's just a bit more graphic than I find entertaining.

$REVIEW.: Had not Lexus thought of it first, Pixar could've adopted the motto "the relentless quest for perfection" -- especially on this movie


From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; "humanizing" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed
Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, "I may never look at a car in the same way again!" I'm betting that your whole family will feel the same way.

The film is well written and directed and the casting is pitch perfect. Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce are excellent, but it's Terrence Stamp who steals the show as an over the hill transexual. What makes Stamp even more enjoyable is that it's a role you would've never expected him the play. After all, this is the guy who played General Zod in Superman II.

$review_text.: "The Seventh Seal" opens famously with a long shot of gathering clouds with a still, hovering eagle, gliding portentously against a dark grey sky looking down upon a desolate landscape. The music blares out in rising crescendo ending with a wail of singing reminiscent of Mahler's Second Symphony. Another long shot of a beach at dusk with the voice over of a prophetic warning from The "Book of Revelation" sets the peculiar tone of this medieval world on the verge of being devoured by the plague:"When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them...Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them."With this biblical context in place the film's narrative is put squarely in the fire and brimstone prose of the "Book of Revelation". After this unsettling opening we are introduced to Antonius Block, a Knight, who has had a tough sojourn at the Crusades in the Holy Land. Block is now resting, his eyes closed in a rare moment of leisure. Block is then showed playing chess with his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand), but Jons seems uninterested. Antonius  is still intensely engaged with the game, when Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has been stalking the plague-ridden land to claim lives, walks towards Antonius to claim him.  Block's chess game had just turned into a strategic battle of ideas between good and evil, life and death, meaning and meaninglessness. When Death has put him on notice the knight pleads for time. Antonius Block is not afraid to die, his spirit his willing, but his flesh is weak.  He realizes that there is more work to be done in his life with his quest only beginning as he seeks to answer the ultimate questions of meaning. He challenges Death to a game of chess and convinces him that the victor should decide on whether he dies or lives on. Death obliges.The scene with the Knight and Death shown in profile playing a strategic game of wits is among the more iconic scenes of World Cinema, certainly the most recognizable scene in Scandinavian Cinema. This first round of chess with Death ultimately allows Antonius and Jons to move on. Death is postponed for Block when he wins this first round. They journey through the wild and grim landscape of a medieval world  ravaged by plague in search for answers.The Chess motif and the impending doom that awaits Block and his friends builds this film into a dense, brooding, performance. The atmosphere of the film is charged with an existential angst as Block desperately clings on to make good on his new lease on life. The warring contestants, the Knight and Death, attempting to upstage each other is set against the backdrop of a world where priests and monks fill the landscape preaching fear. They attempt to preach repentance and formulate a cure for pestilence with penance and self-flagellation.  The ground and air are strewn with holy water, incense, to keep evil at bay.Antonius and Jons walk through this grim landscape questioning the existence of God in the face of the plague. The specter of the Crusades, why Antonius was in it, given the harsh realities of the world opening up before them, is a haunting presence. Block ardently wants to believe that death cannot be the final answer, while Jons has resigned himself to death's impending victory. Jons's cynicism is fueled further after his conversation with a mural painter at Church with the artist's terrible insight into life and death as it is brought out in his paintings. The painter is a cynical observer of a world where monks and priests rule only to spread more fear and superstition. The painter has not only documented the ravages of the plague but has also attempted to offer meaning for all this suffering.This idea of personifying death in The Seventh Seal is inspired. Bergman, like his great contemporary Tarkovksii who also looked to a medieval artist for inspiration, got his initial inspiration for this script, one of his greatest, from one of the great medieval frescoes, "Death playing chess", by Albertus Pictor (1440-1507) now at the T&auml;by kyrka, a Diocese of Stockholm.Bengt Ekerot as "Death" is no skull and bones figure like the image of "Death" in that medieval fresco. Instead Death is a meticulously robed figure in black with his face in white mask with Bengt Ekerot's bulging, severe, glowing eyes, set in striking contrast to the always tragic eyes of the Knight. Death is a living, breathing, mesmeric presence, who claims his victims by hypnotizing them into a careless  ease. Ekerot cuts a worthy, even brutally dignified, figure on screen and is a worthy complement to the austerely severe tragic countenance of Max Von Sydow's knight.Antonius Block's tragic sensibility imbues the film with much of its poetry. The brooding processionals of the crucifixion, the terrible plight of a young girl condemned to the stake, and the relentless pursuit of Block and his ever increasing group of fellow sojourners and friends by Death make this unforgettable cinema. But the doom is often punctuated by the innocent and lightness of the only actor in this troupe, who is also a seer, poet, and a visionary. The delightful "actor" Jof, played by Nils Poppe, and his wife Mia, played by Bibi Andersson, and their infant, Mikael, are a ray of light in this grey and somber world. The lyrical music of Jof's harp, Mia's pure love for him, and their delight in their son and in life itself, bring consolation and much needed relief to this demon weary world. They are also a  relief to Antonius Block's strained mind. Block revels in their company and his spirit is lightened for once in a touching conversation with Mia, over milk and strawberries. This is the more endearing side of Bergman, this delight in life brought to screen with unforgettable lyricism and humor, and it as though we have temporarily landed in the enticing and innocent world of Bergman's  "Wild Strawberries" and his "Smiles of a Summer Night".Death gets impatient with Antonius's strategy of postponing the next round of the chess game that will decide his fate. After Death discovers a new weakness in Antonius Block, his growing love for his friends, especially Jof, Mia, and their infant child Mikael, Death hints that unless Block complies with his request and meets him for a deciding round of chess, he will shift his attention to claiming the happiness of his new friends. Antonius's anguish, his dilemma, and his tortuous and searching soul ever seeking answers, make this film a grand allegory of Bergman's own quest as an artist in the films to come. The dramatic images put on film, right up to that last dance with death, reminiscent of the silhouette picture films of Lotte Reiniger, has a nightmarish clarity. This last scene will be the fulfillment of the Church painter's vision and prophecy that was revealed to Jons earlier in the film.  Gunnar Fischer, the brilliant cinematographer, does his magic to make this among the most lavish black and white films in existence."The Seventh Seal" has some of Ingmar Bergman's most inspired writing, in turns lyric, funny, brooding, and defiant. The script is his grandest rebellion against God and life, and as eloquent and memorable a testament of life and death, as we can hope to have on film. This is an impassioned protest against life and death, of the brooding Ivan Karamazov variety, with Bergman displaying as much flair for invective writing and bold images as the stark passages in that incomparable Dostoevsky novel "The Brothers Karamazov".

The trees that he wanted to log off were on land owned by a band of Quakers interested in saving the land. Greed is the morsel that is the controlling factor in this picture.

$review_text.: &#34;The Masque of Mandragora&#34; is the opening story to season 14 of Doctor Who, and unlike most fans, I love it. Perhaps it was overshadowed by &#34;The Seeds of Doom&#34; or &#34;The Hand of Fear&#34;. Perhaps people didn't like the concept. Whatever it was, this story isn't very well liked among fans. And I cannot for the life of me see why. Louis Marks has proven himself to be a very good writer, with stories like &#34;Day of the Daleks&#34; and &#34;Planet of Evil&#34;, and here, he does not disappoint. The setting is brilliantly done, and really captures Renaissance Italy. The characters are pretty good for the most part, but the performances are outstanding. I especially like Norman Jones as Hieronymus. I also love the plot of the story. In this four part adventure, the Doctor and Sarah Jane encounter the deadly Mandragora Helix, which then follows them to Earth in the TARDIS. Mandragora wants to take over the Earth, so that mankind will never reach the stars. This was a story which tried to use a different kind of villain, and it is very successful. Mandragora is a great villain, and is even able to nearly kill the Doctor. Overall, the Masque of Mandragora is a great story that every Doctor Who fan should see.

$REVIEW.: Not your "James Bond" Daniel Craig role in this movie, which consists of a down and dirty melange of assorted thuggies and druggies in a complex tale of double and triple dealings in the "layered" London/Western Europe drug empire. Craig's role as "XXXX" starts out as an interloper/middle man for the London big-wig drug kingpins, which is a left-handed way of saying he keeps his hands clean of the normal day-to-day street operations and makes big cash as a squeaky-clean go-between for the money men. But the so called Mr. Big, Jimmie Price (Kenneth Cranham), has some additional work for our pristine college boy that most assuredly leads him into unsavory territories where he must get his hands dirty (and bloody). His normal crew of Clarkie, Mortie and Terry are now to include the likes of Gene, Duke, Slasher, Sydney etc., who comprise some the street riff-raff he has to associate with to carry out the boss' directives. Add to that, another big boss emerges who may, in fact, be the "real" Main Man. The local constabulary along with the Liverpool boys also have some pivotal involvement in this nefarious mix.What ensues is a complicated but engrossing tale of criminal crosses and double-crosses as the Serbs, the Liverpool boys and others in the London mob and law enforcement intersect one anothers' paths in this melodramatic tour-de-force. The layers of our metaphorical cake are eventually stripped aside and lead to a most dramatic conclusion. I don't think I'll see another crime film of this mettle for quite some time. The contributions by all involved in this project were realistic, poignant and entertaining. My only negative takes on the film are the occasional scenes of gratuitous violence that I, for one, can do without. That aside, if you like well paced and intelligent crime drama, this film is for you!

$REVIEW.: In THE DESPERATE HOURS, Humphrey Bogart, returned to his signature bad guy roles after years of playing the world weary hero.  Fredric March co-starred in this classic thriller, directed by William Wyler and based on a true story, which, in turn, was adapted into a hit stage play by Joseph Hayes.March plays the head of a happy suburban family whose household is invaded by by three vicious escaped convicts, led by Bogart.True, this kind of hostage drama is familiar television fare these days, but this 1955 film is still the best of them all.  The movie holds up remarkably well, and the cast, which includes Arthur Kennedy, Martha Scott, Dewey Martin, Robert Middleton and Gig Young, is superb. Michael B. Druxman

$review_text.: Obviously a lot of people didn't GET IT.  A little dragged out, but it made its point.  Worth a watch especially if you are disturbed by the direction of our society and aware of many perverse directions societies like ours have taken when they've had our same challenges.What was it Khan Noonian Singh said in "Space Seed", paraphrasing a bit "technology might change, but man changes very little at all" (yes, its been 45 years plus or minus a year since I've seen the episode).  Greed, envy, and hatred are as old as civilization itself.  This movie was a reflection of what many in society really think but never expose.Worth the watch, but best with a fast forward at the draggy parts.

$review_text.: I am so glad I never watched this show when it was first on, because I would have been outraged when it was cancelled. Instead, I caught the marathon on MTV - I watched every episode, back-to-back, and enjoyed every second of every episode. A couple of years later, I got into watching Dawson's Creek and was highly amused by how every single high school character talked like a college scholar. I thought that it was refreshing. But now, looking back at My So-Called Life, I realize that it was so much better than any teen drama today. Angela Chase (wonderfully portrayed by Claire Danes) is like a lot of girls in high school: shy, insecure, and in love with the cutest (and baddest) boy in school. She never used big words, she never tried to be clever or cute. In other words, she is the realistic version of a high school student. She had a wild and crazy best friend, a geeky boy across the street who loved her, caring parents, a sometimes-annoying younger sister, and ultimately the coolest guy in school as her boyfriend. A lot of people thought the Angela/Jordan relationship was a little far-fetched, asking themselves what he would ever see in a girl like her. I thought the idea of their relationship was wonderful, far-fetched or not: it showed young women that they don't have to be easy and dress provocatively to get guys to notice them.To this day, I'm still amazed that this show was so short-lived. It dealt with serious issues such as drugs, sex, violence, and it dealt with them realistically. I realize now that My So-Called life was the clever one, not Dawson's Creek. This DVD is  a must-have for the many die-hard fans the show still has today. One thing is for sure: the show may have been cancelled, but it will never be forgotten.

$review_text.: First I saw the billboards for the coming second season

Never heard of it
After much review I took a chance with the first season on BluRay
My wife and I knew Timothy Olyphant from Hitman and couldn't imagine this fellow starring lead in his own dramatic show about a lawman gone home

Boy we were wrong


Tim is delightful and a natural, reminding you of a younger Tommy Lee Jones


He plays the role of the US Marshall without bravado or over the top southern machismo
And what else is wonderful is that you are getting to know him a little bit better every episode
Not everything that makes him tick is obvious nor simple and that's just fine that they are taking the time to flesh him out.We are waiting now for season 2 to hit blu ray because the stories were so great the first season we just had marathon viewing of the discs and intend to do the same for season 2


Definitely a winning show

I hope its here to stay a while as some decent series have been getting the axe right and left as of late.

$SUMMARY.: Great show.Tim Olyphant shows his acting chops.

$REVIEW.: I saw "La Vie En Rose" a few months back while in France.When I came home I was so excited (but not enthralled as others) about this film that I went with friends to view it again.SOMETHING IS MISSING and another reviewer caught it:the American release is really cut to shreds that no small wonder the time sequences and especially the rushed ending baffled some viewers.I echo another reviewer here to only say that if you buy this "extended DVD" on "La Vie en Rose" be careful,because it may not be even the version I saw in France.Sometimes there will be a "Director's Cut" released only if "an extended release" achieves some monetary success.If I indeed did see the movie as it was intended in France,I will vouch that the American release IS only a three star film at best.There is way too much that has hit the cutting room floor to excuse an ending that reveals an enormous amount of information in the last few minutes that has no prior inkling or allusion.Marion Cotillard will probably win her award as an actress, but the American version of this film is really a hatchet job!
$SUMMARY.: American release is sorely lacking as much has been cut from the original.Please read on.

$REVIEW.: As you might expect, a blockbuster disaster movie usually lives or dies by the quality of its special effects. "Poseidon," perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal "here's what I'm looking at" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death. It's a bland, generic, cash-in of a remake that isn't even afforded the buoy of good eye candy. Don't bother.

$REVIEW.: I am a lifetime martial artist ,and I have great respect for Michael Jai White.  He is without a doubt one of the most talented martial artists I have ever seen ,and I have been to asia 5 times.  This guy is no joke ,and that is why I was excited to see him in a starring role.  To my disappointment this film was a waste of his talents.  He performs flawlessly, but the story is so overacted, so cliche, so disgustingly male, that even his skills are wasted on this pathetic story.  This man deserves a starring role in an A list movie asap.  Hollywood ,as usual, is squandering a supernova of talent on dung heap stories like this.  Watch it for Michael's fight scenes but fast forward the rest.  The machismo in this one is putrescent.  This guy should be the Black Panther from Marvel.  If you hollywood suits are listening, cast this man as the Black Panther or another lead role with a good script.  Drug dealer bad guy scripts are played out like old falling apart sneakers.  Enough is enough!

$review_text.: HART'S WAR turns the currently-in-vogue tables of viewing the Jewish Final Solution aspect of the concentration camps and elects to explore the microcosm of US soldiers incarcerated by the Nazis of WWII.  From the opening sequences which blend artfully into the credits we are introduced to Colin Farrell's character, an officer who sits comfortably at a desk behind lines, due apparently to the fact that his father has clout with the military.  Very quickly Farrell becomes a fugitive from an ambush and ends up in a POW camp run by two powerful characters, Bruce Willis as the understated US oficer in charge of the POWs and Marcel Iures as the Commandant of the camp.  Power struggles develop, Farrell moves gingerly into the role of a defense lawyer for an African American officer, the inevitable tunnel out of the camp toward escape is dug, etc.  It is not so much the tale that is being told that is as winsome as the performances by the actors mentioned.  Colin Farrell is becoming this generation's fine-tuned heroic actor, Bruce Willis manages his part without the usual wisecracking asides, and the work of Iures is extraordinary.  Well photogrphed and paced, this is a very good psychological thriller.  Recommended!

$REVIEW.: NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.Like all of the offerings in the Element series, TARGETED TONING PILATES FOR BEGINNERS is set in an outdoor garden with the ocean as a backdrop.  Most of the DVDs in this series feature two workouts, but this video provides three PLUS a bonus abs segment.  The practices are led by certified Pilates instructor Elizabeth Ordway, who teaches via voiceover and provides mirrored cuing.  The only prop required for these routines is a mat.  I have described the workouts in greater detail below.TOTAL BODY LENGTHEN & STRENGTHEN (21:25 minutes)Ordway begins in a seated position for breathing, lengthening, seated chest expansion, and seated side stretch.  Remaining seated, she also performs bicep curls, triceps turns, arm circles, and roll back (light weights could easily be added for these moves).  Ordway then transitions to the floor for bridge/single leg bridge.  Abs-focused work follows, including abs curl, hundred, face-up frog, roll-ups, single leg bicycles and circles, and scissors.  After performing back extensions, Ordway stretches with spine stretch forward and saw and then finishes with rolling like a ball.LONG & LEAN WAISTLINE (23:10 minutes)For this abs-focuses routine, Ordway starts with the single leg and double leg stretches to warm up, then continues with a move she calls "barre legs."  For the obliques, she performs an oblique crunch and criss-cross.  Seated moves include a spine twist and roll-up with rotation.  Next, Ordway moves into "elephant" (a.k.a. down dog), pulling in the knees to work the abs.  Coming back down to the floor, she performs single leg teaser and single leg rocker prep.  The final sequence includes tick-tock, cobra kicks, and in a side kneeling position, leg lifts and pass&eacute;.  Ordway concludes with a mermaid stretch.LOWER BODY LIFT & SCULPT (21:30 minutes)This workout starts with a lengthy, thorough side kick series.  Ordway includes standard moves such as front/back, up/down, leg circles, and inner thigh lifts, but there are also some lesser-seen exercises, including knee dips, clamshells, and princess kicks.  For the last 5-6 minutes of this routine, Ordway performs an all-fours series that includes rear lifts, knee ins, and side karate kicks; between sides, she does a bird-dog, or alternating arm-leg balance, and this is how she concludes the workout.CORE STRENGTHENER BONUS (10 minutes)The section starts with a simple abdominal curl.  Ordway gradually ups the challenge, first lifting the feet to chair position and then to raised perpendicular to the ground.  Additional crunch versions include four-point crunch and targeted oblique touch.  Ordway then moves through criss-cross and single leg extension, and for her "grand finale," she combines these two moves.  She finishes with a lying full-body stretch.I enjoyed these routines.  I like adding on Pilates to my other workouts, and so the length of these sessions felt just about perfect to me:  Ordway moves along at a nice, measured pace, and the time went by quickly.  However, as someone who has been practicing Pilates for over ten years and who considers myself to be at an approximately intermediate level, I disagree with the "for beginners" label of this DVD.  Ordway does offer some modifications, particularly during the total body workout, when she performs fewer repetitions and other easier versions of some classic Pilates moves.  Otherwise, however, Ordway includes some much more challenging exercises (e.g., corkscrew), and she does not provide the level of instruction that would be necessary for those truly new to Pilates.  For this reason, I would take a 1/2 star off my rating and rate the DVD at about 4 1/2 stars, as I would ONLY recommend the DVD for experienced Pilates practitioners and above.

$REVIEW.: So I bought this DVD nearly 3 years ago, and at the time when I first tried it, I did not like this workout

Back then I thought it had something to do with the DVD, but now I realize that was all me

I was lazy, a newbie to working out, and I blamed my out-of-shapeness on the DVD

3 years later and in average shape, I have to say I LOVE this workout, and I'm so glad that I found it lying around in my basement.First and foremost, this workout is fun
It's fast moving, but I never feel like it's TOO fast, and Hemalayaa keeps it easy to follow

There are different sequences with repeated moves that build upon one another to create larger sequences
 As someone who loves to dance, I wasn't so focused on the cardio aspect of it--I just danced

As for the less dancey stuff (washing machine, hopping around, etc.), there are your typical leg and knee raises, which target the abs (which is the point)
 The segments move quickly, and I think that doing the warm up and the three segments isn't asking too much at all


 It's challenging, but it's never too difficult, and unless you're a beginner at working out like I was 3 years ago, you shouldn't reach that point where you've had enough and you just turn the thing off.Basically, I felt compelled to write a review for this workout because I loved it so much and I was so wrong about it the first go-round

 This is one I'm definitely putting into my weekly rotation.

$REVIEW.: This film is moving beyond imagination.Gael Garcia Bernal's portrayal of Ernesto Guevara is just magnificent.The actors were just beautiful and each one fitting in their respective roles.The landscaping was phenomenal and just beyond my wildest imagination.But most of all, what the film is trully about is a long journey of Ernesto Guevara and his best friend Alberto Granado travelling throughout most of South America.There, you get to see Ernesto Guevara whose spirit is nearly superhuman,very polite,empathetic,wise and towards the end you get to the transition from Ernesto Guevara to Ernesto "Che" Guevara.Throughout the way,both men come across many people, some of which shape their personal and professional lives and it's most obvious in Guevara.This film is nearly capable of changing life perspectives or to give you a perspective on life.You see the suffering of nations,a suffering of people,the suffering of both young men struggling to survive and find many means to survive.This film throws at you wisdom of men,sadness but plenty of happiness and paves the way for Guevara's future political struggle.It's beautiful.

$review_text.: The enchanting idea of being in love in the past and present, the enchanting idea of being in love wholly and completely with someone you've never met, the enchanting idea of not touching but wanting, the enchanting idea of the existence of a soul mate for every soul.The Lake house at first received mixed reviews, I watched the movie curiously wondering if it was a total failure, the mood and pace may not be as fast as "Speed" nor as thrilling but the intensity of which two forlorn souls come to together in the most uncanny of situations is surprisingly superb.Keanu Reeves have always been accused of being wooden when it comes to acting, but I believe his woody approach to art is somewhat amazing to a certain degree that made lake house a believable movie of sentimental value
Sandra Bullock on one hand was considered at one point of time as Americas Sweetheart, which charmingly played to tune on this mature yet approaching flick.Alex moves into a house on the lake only to find a letter in the postbox, a letter filled with words that only he can begin to understand, words that would begin to make sense with every sentence as time moved on
Kate would move in a couple of years later and discover a distance so close to love that is almost inexistence.The Lake House was executed so well that I loved every minute of the movie, the art direction is space filling, and the shots are full of depth and strangely encapsulates the existence of the two main characters

If you were ever in love...this movie captures the spirit of being in love and every minute of bliss plus the sorrow

 I would watch it again just to believe.

$review_text.: While on the surface, this movie may appear to be just another comedy, it raises important issues. Burt Reynolds plays stuntman Sonny Hooper. He is amongst the best in his field, but he is also at the point where age is starting to flash the caution light. Moving on, Reynolds is exposed to the younger stuntman Ski. He naturally feels somewhat threatened. (Nice reality issue. We may occupy the spotlight for awhile, but are we going to listen to the caution light of age when it flashes, and moreso, will we feel resentful when a younger person comes into the picture?) Moving forward, the comedy does continue for awhile, but in the spirit of good writing, serious issues gradually come into play. Trying to prove himself still capable, Burt Reynolds does a a stunt and jumps too high from a helicopter. Soon afterwards, his doctor warns him that all it may take now is a bad hit in the right place and Reynolds could be paralyzed for life. While Burt really doesn't want to hear it, somehow the caution of his doctor does stick in the back of our mind. Reality continues to break the comedy when Sally Fields's father gets a stroke, and Reynolds realizes that none of us are immortal. The most important issue this movie raises is the hypocrisy behind movie making. A not so nice director wants Reynolds to do a stunt that is beyond risky. This is especially scary if we realize that the reason Shakespeare's plays are here to tell the tale 500 years later is because the words and the actors were powerful enough to tell the story. More often than not, action movies are here today and gone tomorrow. The real crux of this movie is that Hollywood doesn't know where to draw the line where stunts are concerned. Furthermore, even when confronted with the issue, they don't seem to understand that: "No film is worth a man's life." Burt's finest moment is perhaps when certain powers feel the younger stuntman Ski can do the absurdly dangerous stunt, and Burt has to explain that they don't understand the stunt they are asking for, and that two people are required to do it. For the record, Harrison Ford was seriously injured in "Temple of Doom" when he threw someone off his back. So while "Hooper" starts easy going and offers generous amounts of comedy, it gradually gets more serious and raises issues that are worth thinking about. Most of us probably already know James Best as Sheriff Roscoe on "Dukes of Hazzard." But in this movie he shows another side of himself as Burt Reynolds's friend, and the voice of caution. Burt Reynolds will probably be most remembered as the Bandit, but this movie "Hooper" is really worth looking at. (SIDE NOTE: Burt Reynolds also deserves thanks for helping the type cast Adam West get a small role in this film.)

$REVIEW.: Want a good laugh? Scan through these reviews and read all the ones with *five star* ratings. What is WRONG with these people?!? Don Bluth's original NIMH is (deservedly) an animation classic that doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence and isn't afraid to engage a deeper sense of worldly honesty that most animated features won't touch with a ten foot pole.The best that can be said for "Timmy To The Rescue" is... well... actually, nothing.Everything about this shameful excuse of a sequel screams "lowest common denominator" which can be verified by the few positive reviews listed in here. MGM should be slapped (hard) for contributing to the dumbing down of the masses by pereptuating such inane, anemic garbage like this. Sadly, thanks to the WalMart inspired "git'r dun" dummified mentality of the poor souls who flock to and support such substandard drivel, those of us seeking intelligent and thought provoking entertaiment have to dig deeper.Horrible.

$review_text.: I saw this in the theater when I was 10 years old, and I was both captivated and bored at the same time. John Huston once said he always wanted to do a biblical epic, but unfortunately he was a little late. By 1966 these type of epics had become passe as indicated a year earlier by the box office and critical failure of George Stevens' mammoth all-star production of the story of Christ "The Greatest Story Ever Told" (PLEASE! John Wayne as a Roman centurian?). Biblical epics hit their stride in the 50s with the first Cinemascope presentation of "The Robe" through "The Ten Commandments" and then hit their peak with "Ben Hur" in 1959. By the early 60s, it had become more fashionable to do epics that were straight out of the history books rather than the Bible with the likes of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Doctor Zhivago".So what does old John do? He goes way back to well...The Beginning. Starts off with the story of Adam and Steve, oops...Adam and Eve (my apologies to gay community) starring a very young pre-"Then Came Bronson" Michael Parks in the buff. This segment is rather frustrating because to get the censors off his back for the nakedness presented here, John opt for soft-focus lenses and very little exposure resulting in a rather dark fuzzy picture. We, of course, move on to Richard Harris playing Caine beating his brother Abel to a pulp, the world's first murder, and then cast out of the Garden of Eden. Then we come to the most entertaining part of the film, Noah and the Ark. With Huston himself playing Noah, this segment has the only comedy you'll find here while still maintaining the dignity of the story. Whenever I watch this part, I just can't help but be reminded of Bill Cosby's classic Noah routine:God: NOAH!Noah: What! What do you want?God: YOU GOT TWO MALE HIPPOS THERE AND YOU NEED TO TAKE ONE OUT AND BRING IN A FEMALE!Noah: I'm not doing nothin' you change one of them!God: COME ON, YOU KNOW I DON'T WORK LIKE THAT!After the intermission, we go into the Tower of Babel with an unrecognizable Stephen Boyd playing Nimrod. Then the film really starts to bog down with the story of Abraham that is just too slow and long despite George C. Scott's passionate performance. The only highlight is when we get to Sodom and Gomorrah. Here, Huston does a really neat little special effect with Peter O'Toole playing the three angels. You see the angels all sitting in the same frame with their hooded robes shadowing their faces, when each one speaks, you see O'Toole's face appear! Pretty nifty! After that, the film just continues to drag on to the final attempted sacrifice of Abraham's son Isaac at the conclusion.Is the film a total failure? I wouldn't say so. Technically, it's beautifully done with great cinematography and a majestic music score by Toshir Mayuzumi that would've even made Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa (Ben Hur) envious. Huston initially wanted this to be part one of a series on the Old Testament, but the box office performance pretty much nixed that. So, basically I would recommend this film to Bible completist and maybe parents who would want to present the Old Testament to their kids in a more entertaining fashion. The Bible is a very metaphorically cryptic book to be able to translate well to the big screen. Only "The Ten Commandments" was able pull it off successfully in terms of going more verbatim while the "The Robe" and "Ben Hur" used the Bible as more of a backdrop of a human story.  Again, nice try John for tackling a difficult source, but too long and a little too late.

Got it? Now add popular favorite Bill Murray, doing his &quot;lovable shmoe&quot; shtick

Toss in American Rhapsody's up-and-comer Scarlett Johansson, doing her standard &quot;like, duh&quot; face


Dip them both into emotional torpor in the sleek Park Hyatt, add local color, stir
Et voil&agrave;: Lost in Translation.For Sofia Coppola, this must have been the easiest pitch in the world -- which is perhaps helpful when pitching to Daddy
The youngish director and heiress to American cinema did things her way a few years ago with her ambitious adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel The Virgin Suicides, crafting a truly poignant slab of Middle American art with A-list Hollywood talent


This time around, though, her effort feels as pedestrian and confused as its subjects
She hasn't delivered a turkey -- it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed CQ -- but when work this potentially satisfying remains flatly obvious, it's almost worse than being flat-out bad.We begin with a close-up of an ass, and it's tempting to suggest that the remainder of the film is simply a product thereof, but the project's kindly nature doesn't call for that kind of harshness


Rather, the tone is more distinctly bumming

The peach-panty-clad glutes belong to dewy depressed Charlotte (Johansson), who's loitering at the Hyatt in hopes that her busy photojournalist husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), will take five to comfort her


No such luck, but Charlotte does find a surrogate friend in Bob Harris (Murray), an American movie star and cultural castaway who's in town for the noble task of plugging whiskey.Perhaps it cuts just a little too close to home when Charlotte bemoans: &quot;I just don't know what I want to be


I tried being a writer, but I hate what I write

I tried to be a photographer, but I don't take good pictures.&quot; Well, that's OK, but if she's the director's mouthpiece, we've got a problem
This is further complicated by Lost in Translation's being another feature shot on 35mm film with an A-list cast
An amateur with a DV camera would be more welcome under these circumstances, or even the director herself just wandering with her friends across the street from her father's San Francisco offices into Chinatown


But a well-heeled princess with a professional crew struggling to prove her funky street cred ends up feeling lost indeed.

$REVIEW.: With "Horror of Dracula" as its "Daddy" this film had a very hard act to follow and live up to. In its own right I find it a good installment in the Dracula cycle that Hammer produced between 1958 and 1972.Hammer waited roughly 7 years after the release of the classic "Horror of Dracula' before they produced a sequel. In the interim they had produced the interesting "Brides of Dracula' that was minus the Count's involvement. Christopher Lee was reluctant to don the Black Cape again and was only persuaded after much discussion by the director Terence Fisher and Hammer execs. The one fatal flaw in this production as has been mentioned by other reviewers, is the fact that Dracula never utters a word of dialogue during the whole running time of "Dracula Prince of Darkness" and is reduced to a series of sinister snarls and hisses. Part of Christopher Lee's great mastery of the Dracula role was his excellent deep voice which fitted the character to perfection and the fact that Lee still gives Dracula an arresting presence in this production without dialogue says alot for his excellent technique and commanding presence. Be that as it may Dracula in this production, despite limited time on screen, is still a frightening and very eerie presence and does add to the overraul look and atmosphere of "Dracula Prince of Darkness".Atmosphere and attention to period detail is certainly one of the very strong points of "Dracula Prince of Darkness". I watched this film for the first time in 2 years recently and I was very impressed by the beautiful look of the production, its top notch cinematography, excellent use of colour and above all else its settings. The set pieces are what make this film. For the first time Hammer made use of Black Park, a strange and wildly beautiful rural district full of birch groves, old oak trees and tangled undergrowth which would become a constant setting for future Hammer productions including their next Dracula film with Christopher Lee, "Dracula Has Risen From the Grave". The outdoor photography is some of the best used in Hammer productions. After 7 years no attempt was made to reproduce the original  Castle Dracula exactly as it was in "Horror of Dracula". The new castle in this film is a much grander building which really adds to the overraul atmosphere. Its Gothic entrance way, sinister hallways, old paintings, and antique furniture are in the finest traditons of Hammer film settings and I feel add a very sinister feel to the whole production which is totally appropiate.The storyline is a fairly typical one but is one which sets the scene for an interesting story. 2 couples become lost in a mysterious wood after their coach driver refuses to travel any further in the direction of the former Dracula Castle. A sinister driverless black coach suddenly appears and before they know it they have been driven to Castle Dracula where they are invited to dine and spend the night by their unexpected "dead" host. The frightening manservant Klove (superbly played by Philip Latham) however has an ulterior motive for asking them to stay as he is intent upon reviving his dead master Dracula and proceeds to do this by brutally murdering one of the male travellers and in a very controversial and bloody scene slits his throat and suspends his hanging body over Dracula's ashes to mix the two and bring Dracula back to life. This scene causes much outcry at the time of the film's release in 1965 and still packs a punch . It definately isn't for the light headed.As Dracula's actual screen time is limited the focus of the rest of the story is on the remaining travellers and their attempts to escape Dracula's clutches, in particular Diana (Suzan farmer) who Dracula in particular pursues. Andrew Keir delivers a strong performance in the second half of the story as the gruff, no nonsense Father Sandor who is determined to destroy Dracula. After Dracula pursues Diana to the father's Monastery and almost Vampires her by using Barbara Shelley's character of Helen (she has already been attacked by Dracula and turned into a Vampire)occurs the second shocking scene where Father Sandor and his monks hold Helen down and drive a stack through her heart . Once again its not for the faint hearted and is quite graphic even by Hammer standards.Dracula's demise in this production has been declared by many critics to be a major let down as he is shot at and slowly sinks under a sheet of ice in the moat of his castle. I believe it is an excellent scene and the fight between Dracula and Francis Matthews who plays Charles just prior to this happening on the ice is excellently done and one of the better death scenes for Dracula. It also once again shows Hammers clear attention to detail in these earlier years of Vampire films whereby they have used the point of running cold water as a means to despatch Dracula which is correct with all the legends of how to kill a Vampire.While "Dracula Prince of Darness" can't match "Horror of Dracula" and suffers from a lack of screen time and dialogue for Dracula it is still a very entertaining film in its own right. Hammer had a way of giving their productions a unique look which matched so well with the stories they told and this film is no exception. To see the superb Christopher Lee in his most famous screen character is reason enough to enjoy this second film based on Bram Stoker's 19th century creation. Enjoy!

$review_text.: This PBS production, Lafayette: The Lost Hero, shines the spotlight on a hero of the American Revolution sometimes forgotten in discussions of the Revolutionary War.This DVD chronicles the life of Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, Marquis de La Fayette , or simply Lafayette, beginning with his early life on his family estate. Losing his father at an early age, he was separated from his mother and his childhood seems to have been a lonely one. The movie tells the story of his coming of age, marriage, and his desire to follow the family tradition of martial glory in the king's armies.His story takes a turn when he learns of the American cause and is recruited by American diplomat Silas Deane and sent to America as a 21-year old major general! Initially, George Washington saw him as simply another foreigner seeking fame and glory but had been encouraged to accept him as someone who could help to provide support for the American cause in the French court. As time went on, as Lafayette proven himself, I think the childless Washington came to see the young Frenchman as a son even as the young Lafayette obviously looked up to Washington as the father-figure he never had.the DVD covers his exploits in the Revolutionary war as well as his involvement in the democratic movement in France. Unfortunately, Lafayette was seen by the nobility as a traitor and by the radical egalitarians as a hated aristocrat. In the end, Lafayette was run out of France and imprisoned in Austria where he was eventually joined by his beloved wife Adrienne and their two daughters.I think this is an excellent documentary recounting the life of a young French aristocrat who fought on the side of American liberty and deserves to be remembered for his contributions. I can't think of any negatives in this DVD and recommend it with five stars.

I never had a solid friendship with my father but this film shows not only the father-son relationship aspect of it, but also that special friendship that some fathers lack with their son(s). Eric Bana, my handsome giant, portrayed the father role very well and his son, whoever the actor is, is excellent.

$REVIEW.: The FilmGosford Park is a magnificent country estate owned by Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his bored trophy wife Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) they have extended a hand of hospitality to their relations and friends to join them for a shooting party weekend. People of consequences gather for a bit of sucking up, bringing their personal valets and maids behind them to jump to their every whim. For life above stairs Lords, Ladies and any other hangers on all seem locked in their own boredom flocking and circling like vultures trying to remain civil to others while flushing out their position and rank in society and excising it whenever possible. Everyone  has one mission for the weekend to see how rich they can stay, so they can remain to keep their life of boredom. Above stairs is full of talk; each eccentric visitor has their own story.....and a motive.Meanwhile in the kitchens and corridors below-stairs the servants run around for the comfort of their employees, filled to the brim with bustling mess, gossip and duties all keeping them extremely busy. While some servant's duties bring them above stairs they remain discreet and in their place, although their all eyes and ears they pretend in front of the upper curst that their antics just didn't happen. Again below stairs every servant has their own skeletons and story.Events of the weekend begin to bridge generations, class, sex and personal tragedy this finally leads to a midnight murder, the fact being it's a whodunit but the real question lingers in the whole household, Does anyone seem bothered?My Notes on the FilmDirected by Robert Altman, I love this film it's just wonderful; before I go any further into the mention of cast, I must add Gosford Park is meant to be a satirical film although I didn't realize that until I got into the film, I begun to treat it as just that, although part comedy and part murder mystery the focus of this film is based on the characters and every character has their moment in this film. It's about the goings on above and below stairs in the 1930's with many, many stories of different lives weaved into it, best thing to do would be to sit back and enjoy it, let the film and story line wash over you. Although there is a murder, let that take the back seat with so much else flowing through this film the murder takes the smallest role let it remain a piece of irony.CastWhere do I begin.... fantastic cast, a lot of British acting talent in this film, two wonderful actress really stood out, (The Two English Dames)  Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith both excelled their talents in this film Mirren portrays Mrs Wilson the perfect servant who's a respected embittered housekeeper and Maggie Smith as Constance, the cash strapped Grand Dame. From the male leads a stand out for me was Jeremy Northam portraying the suave visiting celebrity Ivor Novello his just marvellous.The rest of the cast would be either British or American, all are equally brilliant, pulling together to keep it really entertaining, some faces are more familiar than others Ryan Phillippe, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Kelly Macdonald, Richard E Grant, Clive Owen, Derek Jacobi, Emily Waston, Kirstin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, even Stephen Fry makes a small apperance, The whole cast in this film even the new I have not named would be a great talent to watch.Robert Altman I praise for doing a wonderful job to this film and Julian Fellows for the screenwriting, Sometimes with a lot of great talent in one film it doesn't always seem to work but for this film it certainly does.ExtrasThe making of Gosford Park, The Authenticity of Godford Park, Deleted Scenes, Filmmakers Q&A; Session.A.Bowhill

$REVIEW.: A lot of the criticism I've read about this movie has to do with the editing

 To which I say: did all those jump cuts make you jumpy?  Well, that's probably the point - to try and propel you the viewer into the confused and addled mindset of a fiending meth junkie


 MY only problem is - once that point is made, the rest of the movie is kind of pointless (although, maybe the other point was to make a movie that's as much of a mess as the characters it represents
 And while that wouldn't exactly be a propitious goal, at least it's a goal that they reached).Granted, some of the skittish shots are beautifully composed - clearly it was a labor of (unrequited?) love to assemble so many artful shots only to run rampant with the jump cut Ginsu knife
 And the opening title sequence is gorgeous


 I could have watched it forever (which is both good and bad, since what I'm ultimately saying is this movie would have worked better as a music video).It's a fine line (and one of the only ones that doesn't get snorted in the film), but sometimes a movie's style can get in the way of its substance


 And, in the worst cases, sometimes its style serves to mask a lack of substance

 This film suffers symptoms from both of these syndromes

 I appreciate its aim, but for me the target was never quite hit.The "comic" moments aren't that funny and the serious moments are undermined by the previous attempts at comedy

 The acting is a bit forced and tone-deaf at times (Mena Suvari is surprisingly stilted and just can't seem to be convincingly hyperactive, but Brittany Murphy is actually really good).The writing is subpar - there are no truly memorable lines that stuck in my mind (for which these kinds of movies are usually reliable)
 Plot?  Not really

 Guy drives around, leaves a girl in bed, tries to call his girlfriend


 Which would be fine, if the movie was a slice of life or a character study, but this doesn't really feel like much of either.Most of the celebrity cameos (Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Ron Jeremy of porn) are distracting and kind of useless (still, I can't bring myself to type anything mean about Debbie Harry, so I won't).And by the time Mickey Rourke gets around to telling his "old dog" tale to a sleeping Jason Schwartzman, I'm practically comatose myself

 So when the movie finally reaches its supposedly explosive climax, I'm numb


 I'm spent
 I'm spun

 I'm done

 Again, maybe that's the point
 But it ain't no fun.I'd like to give this movie 2.5 stars, but since I have to round up or down, I'll give it credit for being ambitious in what it's trying to do (as well as being so visually intoxicating) and round up to three.

They should put a no name character so no one is thinking throughout the movie that its brad pitt instead of achilles

$REVIEW.: If your local theatre group isn't doing NIGHT MUST FALL this efficient little movie will more than do. Emlyn Williams' original script is so canny that even reading it can give you goosebumps. John van Druten's screen treatment leaves it alone as much as possible. Dame May Whitty plays a hypochandriacal old lady; the kind who after a good night's sleep spends the next day telling everyone how she tossed & turned all night. Living with her in her house by a wood is her neice/companion Olivia (Rosalind Russell) and various servants. Enter a young page from a local hotel who may or may not be a psychopath (a chillingly effective Robert Montgomery). Williams' psychology really works on you. As unpleasant as the old lady is you don't want to see her 'get it' because Montgomery is so charming & persuasive you know in her place you'd be seduced too. It's like haveing a blind date with Ted Bundy. Whitty repeats her stage performace & she's honed it razor sharp. Rosalind Russell is awfully likeable & gives what is perhaps her most attractive performance. Montgomery, playing against type, keeps the shudders coming. For a sort of WHAT IF? version see THE NIGHT DIGGER (aka THE ROADBUILDER) with Patricia Neil & Nicholas Clay.

$REVIEW.: Has a very dramatic rape scene, which leaves the viewer  devastasted as Kate Bosworth gives a great performance. I think she steals the movie.Cool and educated screenwriter returns to his wife's Southern town where she was the Cheerleader and once one of "those Southerners." These townfolk exist in the minds of Hollywood, and nowhere else, but it helps all liberals feel superior if they can hang a red-herring on nearly every avenue of life. In fact, being Southern is only barely civilized (or human?). Yes, these people show their true colors: insensitivity, stupidity, raging hostility, a Christianity only Hollywood can imagine, bullying, raping and murdering.The only "lesson" this film could serve to give is the leeway the "new guy" allows these unpleasant follows to have; for example, one is a worker on the barn, yet walks into the house where Bosworth and her husband live and takes a beer from the frig. The sensitive husband does not object altho u know he would like to. If the film had played along that difficult-to-define area where one is taken advantage of, there might have been an intelligence, rather than same-ol, same-ol Black/White political dogma: "Leave Life to the Elistists." Those 'ordinary' people cant run this country....So the more intelligent but trusting husband has his hot girlfriend/wife raped by the boorish and the insensitive, with the naive heroic male betrayed. While the original showed ambivalence and complexity, there's barely any room for that "creative" stuff here. Ah, but what a comeupance for the bad guy at the end! Havent we all seen this before? I think the Nazis made the same movies about the downside of Jews that Hollywood now makes about the South, or any and all aspects of those who might vote against their Socialist Elitism.I have lived all over this country, and find the same culture saturates all the schools and all the cable-TV networks, and all DO think the same except for a few independent-minded people, which this film exaggerates, victimizes, twists and mocks.

Do the workout without the bands.There is one exerciser showing a band-less modification.  Of course, you do not get the 'fat blasting' aspect of the workout, so this is not ideal.2.  Buy some regular resistance bands and use those instead.I have been doing this a bit hap-hazardly, and have been getting some benefit, but since regular resistance bands generally aren't designed to loop around your foot, you might get a painful THWACK every now and then.3.  Order Billy Blank's Boot Camp from Amazon.The Boot Camp package contains the Billy Bands.  This is the only way that I have found been able to get the bands for a customer living outside the US and Canada.  If you want the Billy Bands but don't want Boot Camp, there's not much that I can recommend that you do other than buy it and give it to someone as a gift and run away giggling before they notice that it needs the bands.Other than that, this workout is incredible, and it is a shame that Billy Blanks has not been transparent with the equipment needed to gain all of the benefits of this workout - and that is the only reason why I have given this product 4 stars out of 5.

The &#34;bad&#34; guy is also a confusing character to me...the background did not shed any light as to why he was the way he was...I mean come on he did save your live.Like all of the movies, the effects are good and some of the supporting cast is fantastic.Make sure you watch into the credits...you know there is always a spoiler...though this one has nothing to do with shawarma!
$SUMMARY.: Marvel Movie fans will enjoy.

$review_text.: My title could apply to ALL exercise DVD's, not just Tamilee's "Best of Abs", but for me anyway exercise DVD's "audition" over the course of months or longer before I decide they're review-worthy

 While you should never confine yourself to just one workout or activity for optimal fitness, I think this collection strikes an EXCELLENT mix of variety and challenge to help keep you fit in your spare time.First let me volunteer this: I don't wish to discourage curious readers or New Year's get-in-shape folks from considering enrolling in an exercise class at a local club or other venue
 That may be the best way for you to take the plunge, and publicly commiting by signing up for a class might be necessary to get you started
 I have to tell you though--in my experience after 20+ years attending & leading various group exercise classes, most of the New Years' folks are gone by March (if not sooner)

 Let's just admit up front that gaining and maintaining fitness is HARD and it surely doesn't help that modern culture seems to tell us that unless we become preening gym rats, we're inadequate or worse.The truth is, though (and here's something to ALWAYS try to keep in mind) that fitness is for EVERYONE who has a body, and getting and staying fit certainly does not oblige you to adapt any fashion or "attitude" conceits that you're not comfortable with


 My favorite analogy is to think of fitness like brushing your teeth--you do it without considering whether or not you should make the effort

You may be best served by working out privately at home, where you won't feel self conscious of anything you might not be able to do starting out.Which brings me to Tamilee Webb and "Best of Abs": this is a compilation of seven abdominal workouts, none exceeding 15 minutes, along with a 2 minute stretch sequence


 YES the focus is on abs, but abdominals certainly don't work in isolation from the rest of your physique, so ALL the torso gets involved and worked here
 I believe this is all material drawm from original VHS productions--Tamilee occasioally closes sements by exhorting viewers to "rewind and play me again"--so the picture and sound, while adequate, sure doesn't have the snap and clarity of a digital image/sound.Between the seven workouts there is PLENTY of variety, with only a set of dumbells used in one section (optional)


 As suggested earlier, you could "mix up" the various routines daily for months before things started to become predictable
 I must say, I don't think they'll EVER become easy; once you're able to work your way through some of the more challenging moves and sequences you become more aware of your form and how it could be improved


 Straighten the leg more, squeeze out higher elevation, try for steadier balance, monitor breathing more carefully--that sort of thing.Now my "rule number one" for exercise video: I am NOT allowed to decide a DVD or instructor "sucks" because the workout annoyed me the first 3 or 4 times I attempted it
 If I indulge my frustrations that easily, EVERYTHING will "suck" and I'll never get off the sofa
 Recognize that it will take time to get on the instructors' wavelength and properly learn the exercises (equally true if you sign up for a group class somewhere)
 Of course as you blunder uphill to that harmonious state, you're gaining the benefit of actually doing the exercise, even though you're less than thrilled by the effort required


 We all have to accept that--again--fitness isn't easy

BUT who honestly doesn't want it?I had no exposure to instructor Tamilee Webb before I bought this DVD, though I understand she was in the original "Buns of Steel/Abs of Steel" workouts from back in the '90's
 She is entirely credible as an instructor; she's obviously super-fit and comfortable with her demonstrations and cueing
 To her credit she does sprinkle in (more than once) the important caveat that you're not necessarily going to wind up with "six pack abs" from doing this workout (but allow me to point out that your chances are even less if you do nothing)
And, it can't be overlooked that Tamilee's gorgeous, which we all notice whether we admit it or not
 I will assert that any person who attempts to represent themselves as an authority on fitness is going to have to meet an elevated standard of physical beauty BEFORE anyone will take them seriously or accept their coaching


Tamilee scores high on aesthetics as well as professional competency, and manages both without making you feel condescended to (AGAIN with generous allowance for my "rule number one" above).Here's what I don't like: the cardboard packaging--they're charging full price for the DVD, why can't we get a standard DVD case instead of this minimally functional, skinny thing that can easily get lost among our other DVD's?  Also, what's up with the occasional "helpers" on these exercise DVD's, demonstrating easier/harder modifications of exercises?  I understand why they're in the camera background, but do they really have to grin like "surrendered brides" as they demonstrate their moves?  Certainly this is a complaint I can make of MANY fitness videos, but to me it just feels slightly insulting to see these mute gym bunnies grinning mockingly at me as I struggle to keep up


 (Again see my rule #1--the resentment eases as familiarity increases.)If you've read this far, you're interested in fitness generally or specifically in this DVD

 Despite my quibbles I have wrung months of use and gallons of sweat out of this DVD, and I have only a few other exercise videos that have been so heavily used
 I'd NEVER say "if you buy only one exercise video"--You HAVE to be willing to try new things--but "Tamilee's Best of Abs" could be a VERY important starting point and cornerstone for either exercise newbies or for "maintenance" folks (like me) who want something new & good.

$review_text.: My first impression of this movie was that it would be simply another romantic comedy my wife would force me to endure. But being a Steve Carell fan, I agreed in hopes I could at least find a little humor. I was more than impressed. It turned out this film could be directed at the middle aged man with daughters who reluctantly admits that life revolves completely around them.Dan, of course, is an columnist for the local newspaper who rarely takes his own advice. A widower, his three daughters are his world, and the four of them pack for the annual family reunion and the host of characters they'll find there. Along the way, he meets Marie at a local bookstore, who captures his heart during the curious encounter. Turns out Marie is his brother's girlfriend, liked by all, and a majority of the movie is spent as they alternately try to avoid their attraction, deny it, and make each other jealous. There are many of the normal gags that come with family reunions, from the family competions, the numerous embarrassing moments, to quirky conversations around the piano and dinner table. Most are at worst quirky, but many heartfelt and silly.Perhaps most enlightening was Carell's performance as the unlucky Dan. More than previous movies where he was supported by an ensemble, this he carried on his own. He was able to come across as everyman, desperately wanting to please his children and convince others they were all he needed, while longing for something more. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, even a bit pathetic, but never over the top. His relationship and interactions with his daughters were just adorable, and the chemistry they displayed was greater than that he had with Marie. And the acoustic version of Pete Townsend's "Let My Love Open the Door" Carell performs may be the most memorable scene in the movie.I suppose you can be jaded enough to call this flick overly sentimental and gooey, so your experience may vary, but it did manage to touch a chord with me. I'd highly recommend it.

$review_text.: I purchased this DVD for one reason. CHANDRA WEST. I have a knack for noticing future talent. Long before everybody knew who Naomi Watts was, I was a huge fan. Long before everybody knew who Kate Beckinsale was, I was a fan.The same goes for Chandra (Puppet Master 4&5, Night Terrors, Something More & The Salton Sea). As of today, her most noteable movie was The Salton Sea, and in that, she had a tiny tiny role, delegated only to FLASHBACKS!!Finally, in WATER'S EDGE, she gets a starring role and shows how good of an actress she can be and has always been. In Water's Edge, she has some very meaty and dramatic moments. Most noteably, a very gut churning scene that involves a shotgun and a firepoker.Okay... enough about Chandra... now, what I thought about the movie.WATER'S EDGE starts out quietly when our main characters Robert (Nathan Fillion) and Molly (Chandra West) move to a quiet little town into a very modest log cabin, because they need a change of pace, to get away from the memory of their daughters drowning death, to write a book and they're broke.We quickly learn that all's not kosher in this family. Depression plagues Molly and their relationship is hanging on by a very thin emotional thread.That being said, I won't give away anything else, but I will say that the movie starts off EXCELLENTLY. Things start to happen and you don't see them coming. The events are unique, challenging and pose a very very good premise or dilemma for our characters to deal with.Our characters find themselves in a very unexpected, complex, dangerous and deadly situation. Not to mention, their harboring a young seductive girl named Rae (Emmanuelle Vaugier) from the same dangers.Everything builds as any good movie would. The tension is good. The dilemma our characters face is complex and intelligent enough to lock you in, and all of a sudden the movie sort of becomes... typical.What could have been a really really good LOW BUDGET movie, just becomes another movie because at the halfway point, the movie stopped growing, the story lost its creativity and ended the same way most movies of this sort end.So, the movie only gets 3 stars (could have been 4 stars had it finished the way it started).... ahh... you know... the casting Director did have the keen insight of casting Chandra West in a leading role.  I guess I'll throw that extra star back in for the Chandra factor.

This is standard 90's action fare very dated for today's audiences. This is a weak script with weak cliched dialogue and "plot". Wish Arnold had swung for the fences on his comeback but I get the feeling this film was nothing more than him testing the waters. Here is hoping that his next few, which I understand are already in the can, are better than this and we can see him in this a little less predictable. Anyone other than Arnold and this would have gone straight to video.

Great cast of actors

The dialogue keeps you on the edge of your seat
How true is it to the facts? Are the CIA and FBI this devious, I mean, assassinate the President of the United States? The Kennedys were a Greek tragedy
Their story is high art
This film captures their privledged world and the high stakes of the underworld as they collide into high drama
I've seen this film at least a dozen times


I feel stunned every time I see it

The assassination is one thing

The cover up, if true, implicates the whole government to some degree


If this film is only fifty percent accurate, that's more than you'll want to believe


You almost want to bury your head when this film is over, but you won't be able to

I strongly recommend this film to anyone who dares to think and be challenged.

$REVIEW.: I think I've liked the series since I first saw it in syndication on FX last fall. It has always been so much better than the 1992 movie version starring Kristy Swanson, don't let that mess put you off on watching the series which I honestly think I would've loved even if I'd never seen it on television. Every episode seems to have lots of action (the fight scenes are generally very impressive), humor (at times that can be bizarre to say the least), something for everyone. I find it most impressive that the cast is so well assembled, so perfectly matched, they do a great job on even the strangest of scripts.  The stories don't always flow directly one from another although they seem to be linked( sometimes the link can run from one season to the next, even for years)lots of little things to watch for. In 1st season #3 Witch (one of the bizarre humor stories)we first meet Amy, she shows up again in 2nd season #16 Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,and in 3rd season and beyond. Her mother ended up trapped inside a cheerleader trophy at the end of Witch, Oz mentions that trophy in #15 Phases (he likes the way the eyes seem to follow you).I'm not really bothered by the occaisional graininess in night scenes some complain about. The mini-documentaries on disc 6 are pretty good, especially the set tours. I knew that James Marsters was American although I somehow expected him to sound more like Spike. Juliet Landau, also American, is absolutely nothing like Drusilla, seemed very likeable.My only real complaint is that 7th season will soon be broadcast and we're only up to 2nd on DVD with 3rd due this winter. At Amazon.UK the British viewers can already buy up through 4th season on DVD and about 1/2 of 6th on VHS, why do we have to wait?

Also the older protagonists were a welcome change from the usual teenage/early 20's players that are the formula these days.The setting is the creepiest house you've ever seen. I was scared as soon as the main character arrives on the grounds of the old family house she has inherited.

$REVIEW.: DiPalma's riff on Vertigo?  No!  Obsession stems from the passion of a true devotee, not an imitator. As in Vertigo, there is so much more than meets the eye with repeated screenings.  DiPalma has suffered the slings and arrows of  critics and sketch comedians for his Hitchcock obsession; Obsession is sometimes put-down as little more than a spin on Vertigo.  Look again!  DiPalma's  mastery of the medium is evident in every sequence.  Though Carrie, The Untouchables, Blow-Out and Scarface garner more praise in his body of work, this may be my favorite DiPalma; it holds one of  Bernard Herrmann's most intense, evocative scores.  High marks to Arrow Video for making this available.

$review_text.: I have written elsewhere in this space that when it comes to musical influences in my youth that the Stones played a key role in developing my tastes. I have also mentioned elsewhere that my youthful alienation was reflected in the language and sound of the group. I mentioned Street Fighting Man and Tumbling Dice, as well as an earlier cover of Little Red Rooster as important. All this is by way of saying that I looked forward recently to re-watching the old Stones documentary Gimme Shelter reviewed here, despite my knowledge of the tragic incidents that occurred at Altamont and marred the whole experience.If one is to recount the high points of the too short counter cultural explosion of the 1960's one could arbitrarily assign the Summer of Love in 1967 as the height and Altamont as the start of the decline. We can argue that point endlessly but clearly something or some things happened at Altamont that exposed the ugly side of the dope/ counter cultural scene. Moreover, on reflection no one can deny the unreasonableness of having the notorious Hell's Angels, despite favorable press from Tom Wolfe in Electric Kool Aid Acid Test and Hunter Thompson in his classic study Hell's Angels, as security for a 300, 000 person event.Now, we finally get to the music and the film. And I think that this is about the right place for such comments in the scheme of things. There have been many, many Stones concerts during the past forty years but none have had the cultural significance of Altamont.  Most of the film is about how they, good-naturedly if ultimately naively, tried to put the event together. A fair portion of the film is footage of the reaction by the Stones to the events that they witnessed and interspersed in between are parts of the performance.This film has not aged well, although Mick has. His voice comes off tinny here reflecting an earlier, more primitive sound technology that does not do justice to how Mick and the boys could whip up an audience. A nice surprise though is a very sensual Tina (and Ike) Turner performance. Unfortunately, the Jefferson Airplane afternoon performance is marred by the violence that doomed the event.  But here is the skinny. If you need to look at rock and roll history watch this one and one half hour documentary. If you want to hear the Stones at their best then purchase any one of about ten greatest hits albums available. That's the ticket.

$review_text.: For me, the highlight of season 7 was the final break up between Clark and Lana. The writers took Lana's character way out of its role in the Superman universe, which was insignificant in the series to start with. Sure, she was his childhood or a highschool crush. But their constant drama, break ups and getting back together, constant appologies and mistrust made that relationship detestable. I cannot stand Lana Lang anymore. Personally, i think they should've removed her or given her a lesser role after season 4.Season 7 also has a very dark atmosphere. Lex goes through some interesting "adjustments" that make him a real villain. But Clark, unfortunatelly, doesn't turn into a potential hero. He whines and cries throughout the majority of episodes. I think i can write a thesis on how many times he appologized and said "this is all my fault". Season 8 needs to make a man out of him AND start working on the Clark/Lois relationship. They don't even look like a potential couple, more like buddies who occasionally engage in friendly rivalry. They definatelly need a lot more chemistry.

$REVIEW.: HAPPY V DAYGreat mature movie about love and sexual orientationKevin Smith is one of my favourite directors, but this time he has reached the greatest depth and maturity in his career. It's not who you love, but how. That's a truth many people should bear in mind when considering own or other people relationships and choices. Here we can see how sexual orientation is only a preference -as if you preffer chocolate or coffe -although with greater consequences for life, of course-, because when that person who enters your life and puts everything upside down and takes you to heaven appears, what matters if it is male, female, or hermaphrodite? And who cares about his/her past? A film for a new generation of people liberated from ancient prejudices. Sadly, Holden can't see that simple truth. If he could have, he would still be with Alyssa.Also Recommended: Clerks, Mallrats, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Again, Dogma

$REVIEW.: My first instinct is to report that this movie really isn't all that good, but when you think about it, how wonderful and subtle and artful could a movie called "Alien Vs. Predator" actually be?  So, I'll be charitable and say that some of the scenarios are interesting (like the continually shifting walls in the pyramid where most of the story takes place) and many of the battles between the two alien species are cleverly staged and fairly fun to watch.  Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price.  Still, I wouldn't choose watching this film over actually going out and doing something.  But, if it's raining outside and you'd be sitting home anyway, give it a whirl.  It's a respectable time-passer.

$review_text.: This movie is a big diappointment. I understand the AIP was looking for a replacement for Vincent Price and thought this would be a good vehicle for RObert Quarry.It wasn't. Although it was popular for the drive-in, this flicks lacks everything.Quarry goes through the film like a zombie instead of a vampire. His dialogue is awful and his acting terrible.THe film takes place in modern LA. Yorga is a vampire that has adjusted to modern life and uses today's denial of ampirism as a cover to hunt his victims. That is the premise.In truth, Yorga looks as out of place as Jesse Helms at a NOW convention. the characters are one dimensional and I never cared whether they lived or died. Most died, by the way, rather graphically gruesomely. The formulaic sex scenes, including a hint of lesbianism, are thrown in (it was the seventies, after all) but to no effect.Yorga dies, not throught the cunning and bravery of the hero, but rather through his own ineptness, being stabeed while trying to choke the hero. Mental note-never choke someone holding a stake, especially if you're a vampire.The lighting and scenery are dismal. Yorga supposedly lives in this gorgeous mansion which is never seen because it was filmed at night. Bad cutting and overacting round out the experience.Count Yorga may Return but I will not.

$REVIEW.: I notice most of the reviews posted here are for a different DVD, the Legacy Collection of Frankenstein movies.  But this 75th anniversary edition is only ONE movie, the original Frankenstein, along with some "making of" and interviews on the second disc.  While this is a good version of the film it only costs a few dollars more to get the Legacy collection which includes Bride of ..., Son of ..., Ghost of ..., House of ..., Frankenstein's Second Cousin, etc..  Don't make the mistake of buying this version based upon these wrong reviews, especially when you buy it new paying full price.

$review_text.: With many people who have watched this movie, they either liked it overall, or they didn't. I'm one of those people who liked it. Let's go over a few points of the movie, shall we? (Oh, and there may be some spoilers in here as well, so watch your step.)1) Animation: I think this is what people remember the most about this movie. There's always something going on in the background to make it look interesting. Whether it's people or the background moving, the little things here and there really immerse you in this world and make you feel like you're a part of it.2) Character Designs: If you read some of the 1 star reviews, a lot of people complained about the character designs, saying they were "too fat/ pudgy" or "old looking". I'll admit it took me some time to get used to them myself, but now I can appreciate them for how they look. The designs are a throwback to Osamu Tezuka, the original creator of the Metropolis manga. The character designs look and feel like his work. Yes, it is a shock, but I now think that Duke Red's nose actually suits him quite nicely. :)3) CGI: Most anime freaks, or "otaku", obsess and whine about the use of CGI in the movie and "how it doesn't fit what anime is". [Forget] that. It's brilliant and eye catching! Some of the textures are strange to the eye, but above all, it immerses you in the world of Metropolis, along with the animation of course. I gotta tell you, when I saw the blimp in the beginning, I felt like I was there!4) Voice: The voice acting for the English version was very believable, and in my opinion better than the original. The character of Kenichi was just way too young for that deep Japanese voice. All of the emotions were there, from Tima to Rock, even the robot sounded great! Sometimes Tima did sound kind of strange though...5) Music: I have to admit this is the part of the movie that I didn't like. I don't like jazz music, and I felt it didn't fit the movie at all. The city was modern, but the music was old? What? Even though it didn't fit the overall feel of the movie, though, I felt it fit some scenes well, such as the final scene where the music played "I Can't Stop Loving You". This was the part of the movie that impressed me the least, I would say.6) Story: I believe this was a major turnoff for lots of people as well. It is a little clich&eacute;, as we see lots of sci-fi stuff with robots and modern cities nowadays, but you have to remember that the original manga was written a long time ago. It's not the movie's fault, it's really Osamu's because he felt the manga wasn't worthy of the big screen. Following his death, it was finally made and released. The only part of the story that angers me is the final bit. During it's theatrical release, at the end of the credits a bonus still image was shown to put closure on the story. In the DVD version, this picture is missing. I know I can look it up on Google, but why should I have to?! It should be on the disc!7) DVD set: The DVD set here is well constructed with one normal sized DVD for the movie, and a small Gamecube sized disc for the bonus features. Also, James Cameron (director of Titanic, Avatar, etc.) compliments it with a quote on the back. You know something's good if James Cameron himself compliments it. XDOverall, I thought this movie was well made. Sure it has it's moments, but it's good parts outshine all the rest! If you're a fan of anime, you have no excuse not to watch this one! What are you waiting for? A new copy is only a dollar! Order one today, and you'll be glad you did! Overall rating: 4/5; Great! ~ Thomas' Reviews

$review_text.: I'll admit it, I decided to watch this film for the express purpose of hating it.  It just sounded so stupid and self-important, I had to check it out.  And midway thru the film I was a little concerned; it was ridiculously single-minded and repetitive and populated with shallow cardboard cutout characters, but it wasn't as offensively stupid as I'd anticipated.  It was a solid C movie at that point.  Fortunately, 'Crash' went COMPLETELY to hell in the second half with a bunch of hopelessly implausible, utterly asinine and unintentionally comic episodes.  Let me assure you, the second half of this movie is one long guffaw.  I anticipated being angry at this film, but it's almost charmingly moronic and cheap.  Almost.  I *am* angry, however, at the people who are labeling this a great film.  I particularly enjoy Roger Ebert's defense he wrote for it a while ago, where he's just short of saying that yes, it is an utterly moronic, hopelessly manipulative piece of junk, but it has GOOD INTENTIONS!!! dammit, so take your damn medicine!  I especially love the great language people use to rename the worst aspects of `Crash':  These aren't shallow, cliched characters, they're `archetypes', this movie isn't a bunch of simplistic, contrived scenarios, it's a series of `parables'. (Yeah, 20 parables, each of which has exactly the same message.  And parables aren't exactly known for their dramatic value either.  And finally, parables are at least vaguely symbolic; these scenarios aren't)  Of course, they've gotta do this, cause if they described it accurately it'd sound like a terrible film, sound like the sorta film they'd all pan if it weren't a VERY IMPORTANT FILM!!!!!  The critics are correct, however, in saying that most of the performances are excellent, but the movie is just too idiotic and manipulative allow this to really help any.  In a way it makes it worse, to see these people put the effort into such an absurd farce of a film.Yes, this movie does contain the thrilling, shocking message that RACISM IS BAD!  People think this movie is gonna reduce racial tension?  Give me a frickin' break.  First of all, no movie ever really changes anyone, and second, it doesn't even really make any sort of intelligible statement.  People are racist, the film says, and that makes bad things happen, or it at least makes bad things happen in the hilarious fantasy land of 'Crash', where everyone is a raving lunatic.  That is absolutely all their is to it.  There is no real discussion of racism in this film whatsoever.  But, surprisingly, it isn't the shallow, heavy handed message which gets to me.  It's the fact that in order to facilitate this supposed message they created some of the most dramatically lame scenes imaginable.This movie doesn't really have a plot, actually, it's mostly just a pile of random scenes and coincidences.  I don't mind this in and of itself, really, but most of the individual scenarios prove to be very stupid, and again, exactly the same.  The characters are absurdly flat and simplistic, though they do all show a tendency to behave in a manner utterly inconsistent with that which we saw earlier: The ravingly racist cop risks his life to save a black woman in a staggeringly melodramatic scene, (the scene where the movie really went to hell, by the way); the calm, arguably cowardly black man flips out and takes on a couple of armed thieves and whole pack of cops and so on.  The film has a ton of characters, so they couldn't have fleshed them out much, but Haggis doesn't even seem to try.But, again, up until the midpoint the film is just kinda stupid and simple-minded, but not really offensively bad.  It's repetitious, as it's just people being racist or complaining about racism and so on, but it's still all right.  But then when Haggis tries to make things come together, oh my god!  The second half of this film has 3 major climactic scenes which are just unbearable, the latter 2 of which are amongst the weakest scenes of all-time.  First we've got the aforementioned  racist cop and black woman whom he molested earlier scene.  This scene is just so amusing because it's unbelievably operatic, as if I care about either of these losers.  Let `em burn.  The real rock-bottom centerpiece of the film, the scene that really earns it the resounding F, is the confrontation between Daniel and the Iranian shop owner.  I don't wanna specifically spoil it, but this is by far the most manipulative scene I can think of in any film I've ever seen.  I could see where it might be going, and I thought, no, no way Haggis thinks this little of me.  No way he'd use such a low, obvious tactic, such easy, forced emotion.  And then he actually does it, and what's more he shot it in such an over the top fashion that I actually laughed aloud at the climactic, supposedly tragic moment.  And then, after all that, he uses a ridiculous cop out, unwilling to go through with the forced emotional manipulation that he just thrust on the audience.  Seriously, this scene is so bad that I wanna hit Paul Haggis in the face.  He deserves it.  And then we've got another major scene where Phillipe's character picks up a hitchhiker that is just so stupidly, contrived, and all based on the sort of bullsh*t movie miscommunication that never happens in the real world that it just really makes me angry.  (And it also involves characters behaving in a way utterly incosistent with what we've seen earlier.)  Shortly thereafter the movie just ends, kinda randomly, what with it's not having a central plot or anything, and thank god.  The rest of the film was just kind of foolish and inconsequential, but man, that stuff just really irritates me.  How about you get to work on a `Walker: Texas Ranger' film Haggis. (Which he created, amusingly enough.)  You ain't prepared to deal with serious topics.Uhh, what a pathetic joke this film is.  Just when you thought mainstream film criticism couldn't get any more ridiculous they go around declaring this laughable PC pap one of the best films of the year.  [sigh]Grade: F

$review_text.: This film recreates with terrible realism the painful reality of a woman in Germany after the allies' victory, when Berlin is taken up by the Russian troops.Based on the book Anonyma

Eine Frau in Berlin, the film is a powerful reconstruction of the hellish ambiance once the war is over.The hunger, the human misery, the nasty oppression, product of these distorted minds injured and wounded by the horrors of the War."The war change our words
Love is no longer what once it was." "The newborn babies yell for war." Our courageous protagonist is a smart journalist, whose husband is requested for going to the Warfront
Once Berlin is besieged, the Russian troops find out a refugee occupied by women of all ages


And as you may guess, the surrealistic reality, the hopeless of the next day, the will for surviving is not the same for all

Some of them will resist, others won't.Crude, frightening and excellently portrayed, supported by an admirable direction and a superb cast, the movie will leave you absolutely exhausted due its penetrating vision.Since the times of "The marriage of Maria Braun", there were many attempts for recreating the perspective of the losers, but no other film had been to convey us to the very entrails of the hell like this memorable film.A true masterwork all the way through

You've got my word
Don't miss it.

$review_text.: This movie tells the story of three aborginal children who were kidnapped from their mother and taken to a faraway school in order to be indoctrinated into white Australian culture. This was the policy of the Australian government towards "half-caste" children, meaning those born with one parent who was white and one who was aborginal. In some ways it was similar to how the United States built schools intended to assimilate American Indians into mainstream white society.The rest of the movie depicts how the three kids escape and then, with tremendous bravery and determination, make a 1,500 mile journey on foot to home. It's an extraordinary story that covers an important aspect of Australian history that remains unknown to many people. So, on that level, I enjoyed the movie.But what keeps it from reaching the highest level of cinema is that the movie is basically a simplistic "morality tale" with very little nuance or subtly. Of course, the three girls are inherently heroic. But I would have preferred that the rest of the cast were portrayed with greater depth and a wider diversity of perspectives. Instead almost all the white Australians are depicted as simplistic villans, with a few bad "sell-out" aborigines thrown in for good measure.History teaches us that the interaction of cultures involves a complex dynamic with a wide diversity of personalities and both sides generally attempting to do what is in their own self-interest. This holds true even when one side is clearly more powerful and therefore able to generally dominate and victimize the other, as was the case between whites and aborigines in Australia.I still consider this a movie worth seeing. But I do wish the movie had a bit more depth to it, particularly in terms of character development.

$REVIEW.: For anyone not aware, Season Four of HAVE GUN-WILL TRAVEL was the second best season of the series (following the superb Second Season). Frank Pierson was the producer, having recently replaced Sam Rolfe, the creator of the TV western. Rolfe came to blows with Richard Boone and conflict behind the camera led to Rolfe leaving the series and quitting on CBS. Pierson got along VERY well with Boone, allowing the actor to take control of the series (including directing a few episodes). Season Three was mildly weak as a result of Boone's insistence that each episode be filmed in two days instead of three, so he and actor Martin Gabel could play the starring leads in Norman Corwin's THE RIVALRY on Broadway. The season's filming had to conclude early in order for them to appear on schedule. With Season Four, there was no rush-job and each episode was made with care. In fact, at Boone's pleasure, the series became a text book example of how an actor can explore the character he played and you see a number of different sides of Paladin. "Love's Young Dream" is a sequel to a third-season episode, with a pre-Festus Ken Curtis as Monk, applying his real singing voice before the camera. "Out at the Old Ballpark" is perhaps the silliest episode of the series, but the fourth season brings to life some of the best episodes of the series such as "A Head of Hair," "Saturday Night," "The Poker Fiend," "The Marshal's Boy" (which dealt with mental illness, tricky subject matter for the time), the series' only two-part episode "A Quiet Night in Town" which explores a darker side of Paladin and introduces us to Sydney Pollack as an actor before he became a director, "The Princess and the Gunfighter" which was clearly a rip-off of ROMAN HOLIDAY, "El Paso Stage" (with a crooked Buddy Ebsen), and my personal favorite, "Broken Image." (Keep in mind that a couple of these episodes were in the latter half of the fourth season and will appear in volume 2.)"The Shooting of Jessie May" was the episode that brought William Talman back to Perry Mason. The actor was banned from the courtroom drama as a result of a drug charge, but after his appearance on this episode of HAVE GUN, CBS read the fan mail and reconsidered."The Long Way Home," which will probably appear in the second volume of this season, will have my interest. When Columbia House initially released the entire series on 56 VHS videos many years ago, that was the only episode that suffered damage to the original studio archival negative. The damage was during the closing credits but some speculate the closing credits had a mistake and for legal reasons the studio could not include the complete cast. So the closing credits was computerized and not the original closing credits as it aired on TV. My hope is that when this episode appears on DVD, CBS will go back to the original master and not the altered print. No one wants to see an altered version of the closing credits.This fourth season is a welcome addition to my collection. If anyone wants to know how I know so much about the series, please consult THE HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPANION by Les Rayburn and Martin Grams. The book was not released by a major publishing house, course those companies have no interest in books like these. But it's not only a wealth of information, but gives behind-the-scenes stories and details for each episode. Sydney Pollack recalled how the scene where he smashes Boone's hand was done too real and the actor had to have his hand mended. Betsy-Jones Moreland recalled how she thought she was going to die as a result of the behind-the-scenes parties. Even the musicians recalled working on the series. Lots of stories and memories and recollections. The book is available on Amazon.com (that's where I got my copy) so I recommend you get both and enjoy the fourth season.

$REVIEW.: Lawrence of Arabia reset the standard for what an epic was supposed to be. It's scope is mind-blowing, as the cinematography is crystal clear and gorgeous. David Lean's employment of the desert as a beautiful object unto itself was flawless and truly one-of-a-kind. The writing for this great film (by Robert Bolt & Michael Wilson) is also fittingly powerful and serves to emblazon in the memory the characters and their struggles. The musical score by Maurice Jarre is nothing short of brilliant and stirs the passions for adventure and heroism.What I found most impressive, was that every actor seemed to be at the absolute pinnacle of his talents in this film. Not only do Claude Rains, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and Jose Ferrer turn-in terrific performances, but Alec Guinness was flawless as Prince Feisal. Amazingly, this was Peter O'Toole's first film -- and he gave a powerful, courageous, award-worthy performance as the brave, educated and troubled T.E. Lawrence.If you haven't seen Lawrence of Arabia, you won't be disappointed. It will be one of the most powerful, encompassing films you'll ever see. It goes far beyond the simple, brutal combat of the Mid East theater of World War I. It delves into the political intricacies and shameless, power-grabbing efforts of the British government. It also exposes the vanity and self-worship T.E. Lawrence engaged in when his belief in his abilities began to go overboard. It also lays bare Lawrence's extreme suffering due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder -- and this is what truly makes Lawrence of Arabia a valuable, groundbreaking film.

$review_text.: This isn't your average Batman animated series. This one has a 70-ish Bruce Wayne mentoring a new younger Batman. I thought this series wouldn't work. However to my surprise this series even surpasses the original Batman:The Animated Series.  The new Batman is much younger and has a futuristic costume sans the cape. With all the electronic high tech devices the new dark knight still needs Bruce Wayne to guide him.What impressed me was the quality of the writing and the adult themes touched upon in this show.  It can be watched by adults as well as kids.  The music soundtrack also helps the futuristic atmosphere and moves the drama along in the show.  If you are a fan of Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns"; this is a natual progression of the story if Batman lived into old age.

$REVIEW.: RAILS & TIES, under the guidance of first time director Alison Eastwood, tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune, sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds.  It is well conceived, well written (Micky Levy), well acted and sincerely moving.Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is a train engineer, married to his job as well as being married to his nurse wife Megan (Marcia Gay Harden) who is facing the ugly fact that her breast cancer is terminal.  The cancer has spread beyond Megan's body into the tenuous space that keeps a marriage glued: Megan attempts to hide her desperate need for emotional support by continuing to work as a nurse and Tom takes on extra train runs to avoid the reality that face him at home. The other side of the story is equally sad: young Davey Danner (Miles Heizer) cares of his psychologically shattered mother (Bonnie Root) and unknowingly accompanies her on a jaunt to 'see the train'  - a ploy well planned by the suicidal mother to drive in front of an oncoming train to end her life along with Davey's.  The conductor of the train is of course Tom Stark, and when Tom first sees the car on the tracks, he keeps to company policy that recommends gradual slowing rather than the danger of an abrupt stop: the result is the death of Davey's mother  but Davey escapes the crash while trying to pull his mother from the car.  The tragedies mount: Davey is left homeless, being placed in a foster home run by the cruel 'mom' (Margo Martindale) only to  escape to find the 'killer' of his mother; Tom is put on leave for the incident; Megan gets the final word that she has very little time left and is ready to leave the distant Tom.  It is this inadvertent entrance of Davey into the lives of Tom and Megan that results in a healing of three souls who are desperate for the connection of love.While some my find the story implausible and saccharine, others will appreciate the manner in which Eastwood holds rein on the story, playing it for quiet honesty instead of explosive situations. Both Bacon and Harden deliver the quality of sophisticated performances that have marked their careers, and the remainder of the cast gives strong support - especially Eugene Byrd, Marin Hinkle, Bonnie Root, Margo Martindale, and of course Miles Heizer. This is a tough story to tell but the film holds an indelible mark on the viewer. Grady Harp, June 08

$review_text.: If so, then the man led a pretty pathetic life. If you enjoy and admire Chet's music and voice but don't know much about the man, do yourself a favor and skip this documentary.  It really left a bad taste in my mouth.  The documentary, film-wise, was fine ... typical documentary.  But the man the documentary is about is another story.  Was it the drugs?  Was it the "too much, too soon" syndrome? Was it all the adulation and fawning from his female following?  The man was a cad.  I can't believe some of the women he used kept coming back for more.  It took some time aftering viewing the documentary before I could listen to his music again.  I gave the film four stars because, again, film-wise not a bad documentary (especially if it really captured the true Chet Baker.)  The man?  I'd have to give him one star.  His voice and music?  Five Stars.

$review_text.: The is the sequel from a remake of King Kong (1975) with Linda Hamilton as the lady doctor that operate and give Kong a mechanical heart. Then, a hunter found another Kong (a female) so just in time for blood transfusion. How convenient. I would assume this movie has smaller budget than its 1975 predecessor as the special effects are really terrible and cheap looking. With today's movie technology, somebody should ressurect this series and make a 21st century version of King Kong as this 1986 feature is a complete waste of time. Bad Acting, Bad special effects and bad story. Skip it and get the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young instead.There is a Taiwan release DVD of this King KOng lives with terrible picture quality (mastered from VHS) and so-so Dolby 5.1 sound which I would recommend avoiding as well.

$REVIEW.: I'm a huge P.T. Anderson fan and, of course, was very excited when -- years after "Punch-Drunk Love" -- he reappeared with a new movie: "There Will Be Blood," a two-and-a-half hour epic about oil prospectors at the turn of the century. I saw it the day it opened.On my first viewing, though, I didn't know what I thought. I respected the film. I thought Day-Lewis was amazing. I knew it was a daring, challenging effort. But I didn't know if I actually liked it, especially that crazy ending. The whole thing seemed to contain very little of the P.T.A. that I liked so much.I was so perplexed I went back and saw it again. And that's when it really affected me. That's when certain sequences -- an oil fire, a speech about schools and bread, even just the sight of a drifting cloud shading a desert camp, a dab of oil on a baby's forehead or the shapes of oil wells sprung up on the horizon -- became profoundly, inescapably moving.This is a movie so rich and deliberate and limestone-dense that knowing what will happen in the end actually sharpens its impact. It's in a second viewing that one can fully appreciate the characterization Daniel Day-Lewis brings to the role of Plainview.But other elements are just as strong or very nearly -- young Dillon Freasier, who had not acted before, is astonishingly potent as Plainview's mostly silent son; Kevin J. O'Connor uncannily mirrors and converses Day-Lewis' characterization; Ciaran Hinds does a lot with very little as Fletcher Hamilton, Plainview's tough but watchful and subtly tender right-hand-man. And much was written about the abrasive edges of Jonny Greenwood's string-heavy score, but it's impossible to listen to a piece like, for example, "Prospector Arrives" and not be moved; he's created a rarity of a score -- music that's absolutely inseparable from the film, and almost seems to have been created simultaneously with the direction.The movie's biggest talent, however, is Anderson. Many directors have lately tried to channel Terrence Malick (for example "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" which is a beautiful, haunting movie -- but really not much more than a gorgeous ode to "Days of Heaven"). Anderson does evoke Malick, but he incorporates enough of his own style and voice that the film transcends imitation and becomes something else entirely -- possibly something greater even than Malick's own films.---The double-disk DVD is taking flack for not offering a wealth of material. But I think it's a fine, handsomely presented package. I think the extra disk offers just enough background on the film without giving away everything.A slideshow and through a 1923 documentary, "The Story of Petroleum," offers many of the sources and much of the inspiration behind much of the movie, beyond what was drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel, "Oil!"A fine deleted scene, "Fishing," shows us that -- contrary to what Plainview tells a crowd early in the film -- he occasionally DOES lose his tools down the hole and has to spend weeks fishing for them. The scene is great to see -- and sheds a lot of light on the relationship between Daniel and Eli's father -- but it would've interrupted the flow of the final narrative, and I'm glad it wasn't in the final cut.I'm also glad there's no alternate audio track. Yes, P.T.A. gives some of the most interesting commentary around, but I honestly appreciate that he's leaving hidden some of the mysteries hidden behind this strange and wonderful and beautiful film. It's not for everyone, I realize, but I think it's the best movie of this year and last year and possibly the year before that. It just took me a second viewing to figure that out.
$SUMMARY.: Didn't like it? Try it again. It really gets better.

$REVIEW.: I do consider myself liberally religious, even so, this season was almost as good as the rest. Dexter learning about religion both the good and the bad sides of it I felt was a nice touch. The only time this season angered me was when the Doomsday killer acted holier-than thou, which admittedly was throughout the whole season. I for one enjoyed the other storylines as well, it gave me a break from the excessive darkness of the season's main storyline. Now I really want to read the book series to find out how the creators strayed from them, but I still like the show either way. Bottom line: if you're deeply religious, this season may offend you, but if you got through the first five seasons without a problem, you still may be in for some surprises, hope you have a strong stomache, enjoy!
$SUMMARY.: Gruesome, but still good, with religious undertones.

$review_text.: I've seen Abhishek Bachchan in several Bollywood flicks now and, in the viewing of them, have become a fan

His father is the distinguished actor Amitabh Bachchan; his grandfather was a celebrated poet


So, Abhishek definitely has potential and has shown flashes of acting talent in several of his earlier films (Yuva,Kuch Naa Kaho (2 Disc Set),Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke)
Really, it was only a matter of time before Abhishek broke thru with a truly memorable performance, and, indeed, GURU proves to be the platform for Abhishek's best work yet.Somewhat based on the lifestory of influential Indian entrepreneur Dhirubhai Ambani (now deceased) who founded India's largest private company, GURU chronicles the decades-long story of Gurukant "Guru" Desai (Abhishek Bachchan), a man of humble beginnings, whose unquenchable drive and ambition elevate him to the forefront of India's corporate powers

But, somewhere on his path to success, Guru develops underhanded means for advancing his company
The film's conflict surfaces when Manikdas Gupta (Mithun Chakraborty), Guru's mentor and owner of an independent newspaper, finally decides to expose Guru's shady business dealings

As years pass and his empire begins to crumble from the press's onslaught and he teeters on the brink of an investigation, Guru remains outwardly cocky and defiant, even though his health shockingly declines


But, with the steadfast support of his loving wife Sujata (Aishwarya Rai), Guru perseveres...Abhishek Bachchan powers this film with his multi-layered and most mature performance
This really is the best I've seen him
Bachchan himself admits that Guru is his most challenging role yet


Abhishek is magnetic in his depiction of the bold, ferocious, and unbending Guru

But what I enjoyed most are the intimate moments Guru has with his wife Sujata and his twin daughters


In fact, in his loving and playful interactions with Sujata, Guru is at his most likable.Aishwarya Rai, whose beauty is undeniable even if her acting sometimes raises eyebrows, perfectly complements Bachchan as the willful but loyal Sujata, whom Guru initially weds for her financial dowry (and, oboy, imagine the fireworks when she finds this out)


While her scenes as a young woman shows off her looks, Aishwarya seems even more radiant when portraying Sujata as a middle aged woman


The courtroom scenes are great and very moving
I don't just mean Guru's speech, but the scenes leading up to it, wherein Sujata plays a significant role
GURU also gets noteworthy efforts from Mithun Chakraborty and Vidya Balan as the lively but wheelchaired Meenu.The musical numbers are engaging

The first one is a specialty item titled "Mayya Mayya" which guest stars the sinuous Mallika Sherawat

The playful "Barso Re Megha" introduces Aishwarya Rai's character while the gentle "Tere Bina" is a tuneful love ballad and displays more of Rai's captivating dancing

But the most touching musical moment occurs when the twin daughters sing to their bed-ridden father.This 2-disc dvd set comes with a skimpy booklet which has info on the film characters, as well as Guru's mantra


Disc 2 presents 13 minutes of deleted scenes (worth watching, but there's no sub-title option on the menu), a 20-minute-long "Making of the Movie" featurette, and the "Making of the Music" featurette, which, basically, is a promotional event moderated by Abshishek's famous dad Amitabh and containing brief cast interviews and a live performance by the music contributors.By no means is GURU a perfect film
Characters show up, only to abruptly vanish halfway thru (Guru's disapproving father and Guru's disillusioned best friend)

The fictional biographical story, while overall effective, does stumble in spots and, in fact, shines best when focusing, not on Guru's entrepreneurial conquests, but on his and Sujata's relationship

But GURU's biggest flaw may be that it chooses not to show Guru's shady business dealings on screen, making it that much harder for the viewer to emotionally connect to his more despicable side

We detachedly learn of Guru's unscrupulous acts thru the verbal spoutings of the newspaper owner and his editor and via their accusatory headlines
This doesn't work as well as if we'd seen his misdeeds firsthand.Nevertheless, I very much enjoyed GURU
This fictional biopicture of an ambitious, larger-than-life clothing and chemical magnate was a triumph in the Bollywood universe as it was received very well and drew critical acclaims for Bachchan's powerhouse depiction


Director Mani Ratnam figures to infuse an undercurrent of national relevance into his picture by juxtaposing Guru's rapid escalation to success with India's progression as a power in its own right, both of which take place in the same time span (from the 1950s to the '80s and beyond)

Guru himself touches on this parallel in his bravura courtroom speech


Make of that what you will; certainly, it'll resonate more with those of Indian heritage


Irregardless, GURU is a wonderful movie experience
With wondrous cinematography, first rate acting, a dramatic score, well executed musical numbers, and a quiet but effective love story as brought to life by two of Bollywood's royalty, there's much to revel in for fans of Bachchan and Rai.

$review_text.: I never really got Tim Burton. To me he is not much more than a populistic Fellini, a man child with an over active imagination along with the vision and skill to make it look appealing on screen. However, he is the favorite director of some of my closest friends so to say that he doesn't know how to connect with people would be off base. Here he tackles Gotham for a second time and his vision of it a quite festive. The criminals walk on stilts while juggling fire and wearing gaudy skeleton masks. The streets are filled with giant statues that invoke Ayn Rand. And the roofs are incredibly weak, which is convenient because people love crashing through them in this town. It all looks great and I did like this movie but, and forgive me for saying this, it was more of the same from Burton, too much surface.Here Batman battles Catwoman and The Penguin, two villains who really despise him although we are never really given a firm reason why. The other main player is Shreck (no relation to the ogre, played here by Christopher Walken) a Donald Trump type who has risen to the top by breaking laws and breaking necks. When he first meets up with Penguin he is called out for his corporate malfeasance so he does what any other self-respecting tycoon would do, he buys him off. From there they hatch a plan, similar to Bush's 9-11 plan, where together they screw up the city in a bid to get Penguin elected puppet Mayor of Gotham. And hey, in a world of McConnell and Lott he would hardly be the worst publicly elected official out there. This leads to some funny scenes where they try to incorporate Penguin into the world of politics, but the best he can muster is to lustfully leer at any female that walks by and to eat the nose off of his image consultant. To defeat Batman is the ultimate plan and for a while he is bested by the shapely Penguin, and when I say shapely I mean round. Time and again Batman is humiliated, his pride being a major liability, and soon it appears as though it is Batman alone who is sending the city down the tubes. So while I sat through the Wrong Man plot for the 150th time ("Batman pushed her off the roof!!"), I also had to sit through some serious fat chewing sessions between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) as they discuss the pros and cons of duality. Of course when she isn't trying to pick Bruce up she is unleashing a litany of back flips and bad double entendres ("Be gentle it's my first time") on his alter ego. I understand bad one liners are the name of the game because the average fan is 8 years old (in mind and/or body) but this script really went for the gold with them.More than anything I am recommending this film for the Penguin and all his disgusting, creepy glory. This film had you believe that he truly believed that he was a ladies man and possible mayoral candidate. The fighting is more of the bang zoom variety as opposed to the more realistic, violent kind that Christopher Nolan rolled with in "Batman Begins." So while this one is nothing special it is worth a look for its creative set design and guilty pleasure appeal. Burton never took the franchise to the heights that Nolan did, but he never sank it like Joel Schumacher did either. So while you watch be sure to count your blessings that rubber lips are nowhere to be found. ***1/4

$review_text.: Fanboy legend Mark Hamill has gathered the finest animation voice talent in Hollywood  to create a magnificent and heartfelt tribute to the comic book art form and its fans in the shape of, "Comic Book: The Movie." In the film, Mark plays high school history teacher Don Swan, a man who, like more of us than society admits, is completely obsessed with comic books and pop culture. Don's favorite character is one Commander Courage, a patriotic superhero from the 1930s that has been revamped over the years into his current incarnation, a terrorist fighting secret agent known as Codename: C.O.U.R.A.G.E., much to Don's dismay. The Commander's faithful sidekick/nephew, Liberty Lad, has been replaced with the ultra-sexy Liberty Lass, no relation, and now a movie is going to be made using this completely distorted new version of Don's heroes. It's all too much for the humble history teacher to take, but the "powers that be" seem to have given him one chance to swing things his way. The major movie studio that is planning to make the big-budget blockbuster, Codename: COURAGE, has hired Don, known as the "go-to guy" for Commander Courage, to make a brief documentary; a little something to give their film credibility with the oldschool fans, as well as a future DVD extra. Don sees this as his opportunity to convince the studio that they should change their plans completely, or at least, as much as possible.So, our hero sets forth with his new sidekick, studio provided cameraman and self-professed chick-lover Ricky, on a quest to interview anyone and everyone who MIGHT be in his corner. Don's little documentary, which was supposed to be a brief background on the roots of Codename: COURAGE , quickly becomes an all out petition to make Commander Courage: The Movie! But his first interviewee, Playboy Founder Hugh Hefner, seems to support the Codename COURAGE idea. Big surprise, what with Liberty Lass and all. He fares somewhat better with Kevin Smith, who seems to take the middle ground. And finally, Don finds a true crusader in B-Movie Legend, Bruce Campbell. Unfortunately, Bruce's choice to side in with Don only manages to get him dropped from consideration for the starring role, and also clues the studio in on the danger of Don's influence. Now, Don, Ricky, and their new pal, the clueless Leo (newly discovered grandson of the Commander's creator), must thwart the efforts of studio execs while continuing to make their documentary and spread the gospel of the Commander at the San Diego Comic-Con, the world's largest sci-fi and comic book convention. Leo doesn't turn out to be much help though. He knows absolutely nothing about comics, and didn't even know who his grandfather was! The studio execs see his weakness, and quickly attempt to turn him over to the dark side. Ricky is a little too preoccupied with chicks, and the Incredible Hulk, AND his hilarious efforts to teach Leo to be a chick-magnet like himself. And even Don's hometown friend and fellow Commander fanatic, Derek, is too busy struggling with his frustrated wife and exhausted little son, who had no idea he was dragging them out of Wisconsin just to see a comic book convention. It seems that it's all up to Don Swan to save the day, and when he gets his hands on a copy of the secret script on the eve of the studio's big Codename: COURAGE publicity launch, our hero finally snaps! Only Commander Courage can help now!Comic Book: The Movie is a wonderful gift from the mind of Mark Hamill, a true and knowledgeable fan. Filmed in mockumentary style, but without mocking the subject at all, it is a tribute to the creators and readers of this overlooked art form, as well as a showcase for some of the greatest untapped (onscreen anyway) acting talent in show business, the voice actor. Filled to the brim with legends, not just from the comic world but other areas too, emotions run from nostalgic, to hilarious, to downright tear-jerking. There's something in it for every type of comic fan. Mr. Hamill even manages to mention my personal favorite comic legend, Carl "the Duck-man" Barks, creator of Disney's Uncle Scrooge. And there's plenty of eye-candy too, not just in the form of laughter and drool inducing Donna D'errico as Liberty Lass, but also from various comic con fan-girls in even more delectable costumes.  So THIS is where you meet cute girls who actually LIKE comics and cartoons (and don't mind wearing costumes, *ahem*)! In fact, the real star of this film is the San Diego Comic Con itself, and all its participants! It definitely left me with a strong desire to visit the annual event someday! It must be great to be surrounded with so many folks, of all types (and both sexes), who are as obsessed with comics, movies, and toys as you are!This DVD is a gem for all it has on it. The audio commentary is great, especially for a wannabe voice actor and cartoonist like me, not to mention another of Hamill's Star Wars junkie fans. And the 2nd disc practically has a feature of its own in "Behind the Voices," a great interview session at the Comic Con with several current cartoon greats, from Jim Cummings to Billy West (who plays Leo). The complete interviews run the gamut from informative to hilarious! Bruce Campbell's is a real treat! Everything that supplements Comic Book: the Movie is worthy of a thorough look, and the movie itself can be rewatched over and over. In fact, I'm not even sure how many times I've seen it by now. If you love comics, collecting, or anything even vaguely associated with the subject matter in this film, do yourself a favor and pick it up! And anytime Jess Harnell's "Ricky" character is onscreen, keep your eyes and ears at attention! That guy is hilarious!

$REVIEW.: Though a bit uneven at times, this movie still packs plenty of entertainment. The songs are excellent and very memorable. With some musicals, the songs aren't very appealing when heard outside the context of the musical itself because they are theatrical by nature or they rely on the stage action for comprehension. (See "West Side Story" or "Miss Saigon") For the most part, this is not the case with "Grease," whose songs are perfectly capable of standing alone. This is also helped by the fact some songs from the stage version were dropped from the movie and additional songs were written for the movie. We all know the story by now: greaser Danny and squeaky clean Sandy meet and fall in love over the summer, then say goodbye. Both are surprised to see one another at school in the fall and try to change in order to fit the image of the other's ideal. Aside from the fantastic songs, the film is elevated by some very good, enthusiastic performances by John Travolta, the gorgeous Olivia Newton-John and Didi Conn, among others. The stage musical's youthful exuberance carries over to the film as well, even though some of the actors appear a trifle too old to play high school students. (See Michael Tucci and Stockard Channing for two examples)  This is essentially a musical for folks who don't normally like musicals. Some language and sexual references keep this film from being appropriate for children.

$review_text.: I gave this set a unfair one star review but I recently viewed the product. It's the best dvd you can get on WWF Raw during it's peak years a little 97 thru end of 99.First dvd shows all the big names of the day-Austin, Rock, D-X, Undertaker, Kane, and they even have a section dedicated to Val Venis. I like reliving the glory days of Austin when he was fighting Vinnie Mac. The feature is an hour and two minutes but well worth watching and there are some bonus matches. The matches are usually short but still entertaining. The only problem with the matches on Vol 1 and 2 is they don't say who wrestles, just a caption of something that happened in the match.Volume 2 is good and longer by almost an hour. It shows all the highlights of 99 and it has some very good matches on this set. There was a excellent I Quit Match between Triple H and The Rock but the ending really sucked. Triple H was going to pedigree The Rock thru a table but the Corportion comes down and threaten's Triple H's girlfriend at the time, Chyna and he quits. She then turns on him. A crappy finish even though I could really careless about Chyna or Triple H.Overall, a five star set all the way. It's the best overview of Raw, even if it's only a few years of a show that has been on for 16 years. A must own for fans who miss the glory days of wrestling.

$review_text.: PROLOGUE..The Tenenbaum Children Were Geniuses. This is the story of their Family...CHAPTER ONE.....It is high praise, in my world, when a DVD on Amazon yields such contrasting responses.  I think it would indeed be awful of me to try to convince the people who did not like this movie that they were wrong. ...CHAPTER 2....I loved this movie, but this is where I am at with my viewing tastes.  Give me something different, give me something unique that goes out on the edge.  From the first frame, Wes Anderson tells his story in a unique way.  Also know that the movie is not always comic.CHAPTER 3...  It is easy to look at the track suits, and the costumes and they think that this is going to be a riot.  This is a film about family and genius....eccentric, wise and true to it's world.  Yes, comic things happen(In some ways it reminded me of John Irving's Hotel New Hampshire) but they come from a character based heart. CHAPTER 4... I think alot of negative stuff comes from the fact that something happens that we have never seen before, the film isn't what we expected and so we deem it boring.  This is exactly why I loved it.  Give me the unique and interesting.....Also, with the DVD Anderson comes off extremely well.  Smart, funny, calm, really well versed in film, and completely visionary.  And it shows...CHAPTER 5...the performances are exemplary(Tell me another person who could've pulled this off like Gene Hackman.)...and the vision is uncompromising..........EPILOGUE...So, there it is.  If you want common, that is fine.  This is not it.

$review_text.: First, I will address the movie and then I will address the DVD features.I have to say that most of all, I really enjoy the message underlying X-Men

I used to read the comics when I was younger and loved them, but I didn't pick up on that theme

Perhaps, it was stronger in the very beginnings of the comics or I was just to young to pick up on it

Either way, it has been presented brilliantly here
Second, I enjoy how the story is built on the characters themselves and not just flashy special effects

I think that there is a very strong &quot;human&quot; element to the movie


An excellent example of this is the decision not to mask Wolverine


While Wolverine is a compelling character in the comics, in this medium he is noticably more engaging and real

Hugh Jackman is a National treasure (yes I know he's not American, but whatever!).Now, the features


I only have one problem with this set
The enhanced viewing mode
I don't like how you can play a deleted scene and then the version of that scene that made it into the movie plays as soon as you return to the movie

Other than that, I absolutely love the extras

Disc two is packed with documentary footage of the making of every detail of the movie
Of particular note is Hugh's first reading with Bryan Singer

Definitely interesting to watch for the large amount of dialogue cut out of the Wolverine's scene with Rogue on the train
Don't miss it

Also watch for a couple of clips of Sabretooth wearing sunglasses
Surreal and Hilarious.So in short, funny, interesting, fascinating, and moving


Worth picking up even if you already have the regular version.

The results were respectful, plus I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that I'm a slut for eye-candy -- the Special F/X were rewarding, yet not overwhelming. And the cast! Then there was the clever twist where the Government & the terrorists did something one couldn't have easily predicted.And yet, . . .It was kind of a downer.Maybe I'm not French enough. Or maybe I'll &#34;get it&#34; after I take a Cinema Appreciation course in area community college.I'm glad your financial success with &#34;The Pirates of the Caribbean&#34; franchise allows you to take chances like this one.

$review_text.: I Love this movie.

And I am so glad that it's coming out on video

You have this woman with a lot of kids(Diahann Carroll), who is on welfare and works on the side to make ends meet

She meets this garbageman(James Earl Jones) who likes her despite the kids, dates her, and despite his own problems, want to marry her

In time,he gets cold feet and runs off for a minute thinking on the committment he's about to take on, but in the end, love rules the day

This movie,which the late Diana Sands got a hold of initially, was about to star in but got sick and later died, is so realistic


You have this woman who is on welfare, but works

You have this man who loves this woman, but he got kids from another relationship, and he got to pay for that too, then marry a woman with five kids?..

That's enough to make anyone take a pause for the cause

Not to say it isn't a good idea

I have seen men do it and keep on going


But, it will make you think


A great movie by an unlikely actress


Diahann usually plays classier roles, yet she was  good in this one so much so that she was nominated for an Oscar for that role.

$review_text.: This was a surprise to me, a film about the Black Death, the plague and the "men of God" who went from place to place seeking witches thought to be the cause of the plague and doing evil in the name of "God".Taking a young monk and opening his eyes to true harsh realities, to pain, to death, to challenge his faith in ways he could never have imagined and the effect on him.The film shows fairly realistically without falling into gratuitous violence how women were treated when thought to be a "witch".  Of course there is a biased and imho unrealistic, misogynistic and somewhat heavy handed "pro" Christian message in the way women and a woman in particular was characterized and used.  My view differs from those who say there is an anti-Christian view near the end.  I see it as anti-woman, prejudiced and narrow-minded toward the Christian mindset for the time.Luckily, "witches" aren't burnt anymore, but in many cases we are also not well tolerated and face judgment by those who claim to be Christian (judge not, lest ye be judged).Very good period piece and worth watching as a dramatization/small history lesson.  Acting, costuming, scenes all well done.  Well one over the top a bit character, I'll leave who I think that one is to you to discover.

$REVIEW.: Despite being a jaded "Star Wars" fan, which basically stems from my under-enthusiasm for the previous two prequels, I still stood in line last night, with all the geeks and misfits in tow, for the midnight screening of "Revenge Of The Sith," the closing chapter that links all six movies together and gives all of us fans one last chance to enjoy ourselves watching a new "Star Wars" film

Not just that, this is also George Lucas' last chance to prove to his fans, and more importantly, his detractors, that he's still got it
Well, it's safe to say that the man has outdone himself."Revenge Of The Sith," "Star Wars III," or "Episode III," whatever you choose to call it, is one word: breath-taking
Sure, you already know how it ends


Sure, the dialogue is a bit hammy and the actors tend to overact quite a bit, but that's sort of what makes this movie so great
It feels just like watching the original "Star Wars" movies


It has that same, authentic, feel that takes you completely out of the realm of the real world and let's you get sucked into a new world where all of your skepticism is left at the door
Two hours of non-stop action and drama, little nods to future films and memorable characters materializing along the way
It's hard not to watch The Chancellor transform into the Emperor, or more importantly, Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, without a giant smile forming across your face
This is what all the build-up has been for

This more than makes up for whatever mistakes were made before it (Damn you, Jar Jar)


I really shouldn't go too much into the details of the plot, but rather, I urge any fan, die-hard or casual, give the series one last chance with this one, you simply can't be disappointed.The last half-hour of the movie is where the real meat is, and perfectly sets up "A New Hope." If that movie didn't already exist, I would be pumped for it's release

If anything though, this film just made me appreciate the "Star Wars" flicks that much more
Now I find myself with the urge to go back and study every single little piece of dialogue, just like the true fanboy I have become

"Revenge Of The Sith" is everything a monumental movie event of it's kind should be, and George Lucas finally pulled off the impossible: A prequel that actually fits thematically and stylistically with the older films that everyone knows and loves.

In this workout there is a mix of ballet and the intensity of  body sculpting.  After the warm up, you go into the dance-inspired standing toning.  The floor section is unique.  It's a blend of yoga, pilates and regular toning.  She always has great technique and that is motivating and she always tells you not to 'cheat' but to keep abs in etc.  She knows her stuff, and you are bound to get great results with this workout if you do it regularly.

$review_text.: Although it disappeared fairly quickly when it was released in 2001, David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" has grown in critical stature over the years and is now seen as one of the key films of the 2000s
Both a neo-noir and a surrealist nightmare, the film features Naomi Watts as an aspiring young Canadian actress who comes to Los Angeles hoping to break into movies and Laura Harring as a mysterious amnesiac brunette who turns up in her apartment and who might spell danger
Related (or not) to this is another story concerning an arrogant director (Justin Theroux) who imperils his film and his life after he refuses to cast an actress chosen by a mysterious power broker (or mafioso, or whomever).Lynch has consistently refused to explain what this film is about

Throughout there are asides that appear to have little relation to the main storylines - a botched hit job, a recounting of a nightmare set in a diner, an eerie club that the two women visit for reasons unknown
And, at about the two hour mark, the film pulls a dramatic shift that up-ends everything we've seen to that point


Yet the film's opacity never becomes off-putting; instead, it pulls us even further into its mysteries
As the late Roger Ebert put it, this is the one Lynch film where he doesn't overload the circuits, he maintains a smooth, assured control for all of its short 147 minutes.The film is a deserved critical darling but not really a popular favorite, unlike Lynch's "Twin Peaks" or "Blue Velvet." (And Lynch himself hasn't been too active in features lately; he's made only one film since, the maddening "Inland Empire.") But "Mulholland Drive" certainly merits a far better release than the bare-bones DVD that Universal put out twelve years ago
The transfer is good but doesn't really bring out the sumptuous color scheme that Lynch devised for the film's first part

A Criterion restoration would not only do this film justice but also increase its visibility
Some may dismiss it as pretentious drivel, but for me at least this film has a spell to it that keeps beguiling me to re-watch it
It's an epic song about the dark side of Hollywood, and Watts and Harring are its two stunning sirens

This great film deserves to stand among such other modernist masterworks as "Persona" and "Belle de Jour" in its ability to intrigue and engage us the more perplexing it gets.

$REVIEW.: I can't understand what makes this one so good. It's awful! The only thing that makes this one worth watching is the comedy in it, and the gun battle at the end. English actors protraying American cowboys? It was terrible to watch. The only actors that were any good were the regulars and the man who played Doc Holliday. This one is more of a musical than anything, and if that wasn't bad enough, the music and singing in it was terrible. It hurt may ears to listen to it. The only reason why I bought this was because it came in the "End of the Universe Collection" which has many good Dr. Who stories in it apart from this one. And I had never seen this one before, and always missed the historicals - especially when it comes to my own country's history. But it's really not worth it. It's a pitty that so many good stories from the 1960s were lost, and yet this one survived. Unless you buy the "End of the Universe Collection", which I do recommend, stay as far away from this one as possible.

$REVIEW.: Ever since Steven Speilburg (sp?), it has been rare to find a movie that achieves what "Hollywood" stood for back in Charlie Chaplin's day, then Jimmy Stewart, Bogie and Becall, etc.Gladiator isn't a gently-tugging-at-your-soul's attention kind of movie.  It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over.  Even then, I recall wandering out of the theatre, almost in a "fugue" state of mind.  THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending.  Evil vs. Honor, the "parable" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of EXHILERATION, acheived ONLY via the absorbtion of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principlied, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.)  But with Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix could not have been better chosen for the roles played.This was a movie on a scale beyondf epic...hence, no chance of a sequel.  You cannot exceed 1000% in movie calibre.

$REVIEW.: Now, you mightn't think those are particularly catchy lyrics, yet that's the song I enjoyed most from &quot;Rose Marie&quot;, this proud boast of the Canadian Mounties, led of course by Nelson Eddy. I would be remiss not to mention, however, that two other much better-known songs come from this movie, &quot;Oh Rose Marie, I Love You&quot; and the mega hit, &quot;When I'm Calling You--Indian Love Call&quot;. One time they played a bit of that number on the Oscars, and I was sad to see the audience hoot at the rendition. I guess they had gotten beyond simple love stories from a simpler time like this one.  The story line is a tad unusual: Jeanette MacDonald, a famous opera singer, races up to Canada to try to find her fugitive murdering brother--very young James Stewart--before the Mounties do (that's where their theme song comes in handy).  Well, they somehow manage to carve out a happy ending from this unlikely premise, but that's what movie magic is all about!

$review_text.: This is a quite nice little war movie about a group of American fighter pilots during Korean War. It is an adaptation of a novel, "The Hunters" by James Salter. I admit that I didn't read the book, but it has very good reviews - and most people stress the point that it is much better than the film.The story is relatively simple. A renowned fighter pilot, World War II ace and instructor (we know he spend years as member of US military mission to Greece, training local pilots), major Cleve Saville (Robert Mitchum), is affected to a squadron of F-86 Sabres in Korea. He is part of a wave of reinforcements destined to "harden" fighter units, after the Chinese send to the front improved versions of MiG-15, manned by pilots who recently underwent an intensive upgrading training in Soviet Union. Major Saville will command a flight of four F-86. His three subalterns are Lieutenant Corona (John Gabriel), an almost supernaturally calm young pilot; Lieutenant Abbott (Lee Philips), a courageous man but with quite serious issues; and finally Lieutenant Pell (Robert Wagner), an amazingly skilled and almost pathologically brave pilot, but also an absolute "pain in the neck" in every other aspect...The day of his arrival in Japan and just before being shipped to Korea, major Saville meets a somehow mysterious young Norvegian woman and becomes instantly fascinated by her - and the attraction is mutual, at least to some extent. And then, just before things go too far, he learns, that this young woman is actually the wife of his wingman, Lt. Abbott...All of that happens in the first minutes of the film - and from that moment on, the story progresses on two fronts (sorry, I couldn't resist). First, there is the war in the airs over the Yalu river, with the F-86 keeping watch over the bombing and close-support missions in support of United Nations troops in the peninsula. And then there is a much subtler (but almost as dangerous) game of attraction/rejection, suggestion/manipulation, seduction/transaction, "catch me if you can", etc., between major Saville and Kristina Abbott...The character of "Kriss" Abbott is a very, very interesting one. Swedish actress May Britt (she later married Sammy Davis Jr, after converting to Judaism) plays her with great skill - and she also gives her character a very special accent (supposedly Norvegian), which makes things even MORE interesting! It is a special charm of those older films, that women played extremely dangerous, mysterious, almost snakelike vixens, when in the same time maintaining on the surface the demeanor of perfect ladies... The tensions rising around the triangle "Saville/Abbott/his wife" are also a very interesting thing to watch.As you can see by simply looking at the cover of the DVD, things will finally have to land somewhere - and it will be a very harsh landing for some... I will not provide spoilers here, but the second part of the film is quite surprising - and no, it is not by mistake, that in a film about fighter pilots one of the characters is shown in dirty infantry winter clothing, holding a Soviet-made PPSh-41 sub-machine gun (weapon used in Korean war by many North Korean and Chinese soldiers...). The ending is not easy and not exactly as we could expect it - and I will say nothing more about it.The success of the film was probably helped by a good working relation between Mitchum and the director, Dick Powell. For most of his career an actor in musicals, he started directing only in the middle of the 50s and in 1957 he and Robert Mitchum made together "The enemy below", one of the best and most tense war films about submarines. This complicity certainly helped them to make "The hunters" into a fairly good film. Sadly, their cooperation ended soon after, as Powell felt grievously ill and finally after a courageous battle died from cancer in 1963.A special mention goes to the images of air combats - they are quite well done, for a film made in 1958. For lack of genuine MiG-15 fighters, the director used Republic F-84 Thunderstreaks, American fighters looking a little like those famous Soviet planes, which missed the Korean War by a couple of months. Multinational character of United Nations troops is underlined - and the images of Japan in the Year of Grace 1953 are also quite interesting.So all in all, although not really an immortal masterpiece, this is a very honest, quite interesting war film. I spend a nice evening watching it - and it is a MUST for all fans of Robert Mitchum! Enjoy!

His hero is the late, great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and thanks to his TV show and cookbook, Remy has the knowledge to be one of the best chefs in the world.  The only problem?  Remy's a rat.When Remy's family is forced to evacuate their home, Remy gets separated from them.  He winds up in Paris just outside of Gusteau's restaurant.  Since he can't resist seeing where his idol once worked, Remy sneaks inside.And that's how Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano).  Linguini is the new garbage boy at the restaurant, and he's something of a klutz.  When Linguini accidentally ruins a soup, Remy can't help but fix it.  The new recipe is a huge success, but only Linguini knows that a rat made it.And so beings their partnership.  Remy provides the cooking knowledge and Linguini provides the human form.  Together, they begin to turn the reputation of the restaurant around.  But can they keep their secret hidden?I have been a Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, but this was the first one I didn't love.  Maybe it's director Brad Bird since I didn't like his The Iron Giant, and I had to watch The Incredibles a couple times before I truly enjoyed it.Maybe I'll enjoy this one more after I see it a few more times because there are lots of things to recommend it.  There are some truly funny parts, especially the scenes where Remy is trying to control Linguini.  And their first scene working together is a riot as well.  The animation is wonderful with a few breath taking shots of Paris.  And I liked the fact that Remy could only talk to other rats.  The fact that the humans and animals couldn't talk is a nice twist on the standard animated film.  And the animators do a great job of using body language to convey their characters every thought and feeling.  And the voice cast of well knowns and unknowns does an excellent job.So where exactly did the movie fall apart?  It was just too busy.  Remy has a storyline with a couple plots.  Linguini has his own issues.  And neither one is really given time to develop fully.  We focus on one issue for a while, then move on to something else.  Item three gets resolved, then we get item four before going back to two, then five, then....  You get the idea.  If they had taken out one of the sub-plots, anyone of them, it would have allowed more time to better develop the plots that remained and even develop the characters better.Then there's the fact that the movie really isn't aimed at kids.  I'm not arguing with the G rating.  There just isn't that much action to hold their interest.  Elementary age and above should be able to track the story, so they will enjoy it more.This is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing.  Just don't go expecting the great story telling that Pixar usually provides.

They do attempt to do a few things differently, such as having a school of sharks, as opposed to one shark.  There is also a subplot involving the Russian Mafia searching for diamonds on a sunken pirate ship which I found to be pretty well-done.  If you can get past the stiff acting by some of the stars and sit back to enjoy the movie, you might enjoy it.  However, with no extras, it's hardly worth the cost to purchase it.  I'd recommend rental instead.

$review_text.: The Nemuri Kyoshiro films just get better and better.  Not only are they incredibly well shot for 60s jidaigeki, they also feature one of the most interesting central characters.  Others have gone on and on about the individual features so I won't rehash that here, but suffice it to say that if you like samurai movies, all twelve of these are must-haves.

$REVIEW.: This was a just a plain, nice story, one of those kind I tend to favor simply because there are no "bad guys" yet the story is still interesting.  Sometimes that's nice to see.I expected Ingrid Bergman's character, "Sister Mary," from what the liner notes on the video box said, to be a sort-of villain portraying a hard-line rigid nun but that wasn't the case at all. In fact, in her several philosophical disputes with "Father Chuck O'Malley" (Bing Crosby) I sided with her because she made more sense than the too-Liberal priest who never wanted any misbehaving kid to be disciplined.The story is a little unrealistic in that a strong-willed business tycoon would not abandon all his business plans and hand over a brand-new million-dollar (today it would be many millions) building to a church. However, it's nice to see!These kind of old-fashioned films are almost collector's items today.

$REVIEW.: Love these old mysteries.  I never knew about Michael Shayne mysteries until I saw one on Netflix.  And then I was hooked.  I went to Amazon and I found this box set. Only draw back is they recorded the DVDs on both sides of the DVD.  It plays well but I prefer separate DVDs instead of flipping them over.  Quality is pretty good but it is not HD.  But shows are a must see for mystery buffs.  They are witty and fun.  Fun for the whole family.  Well worth the money for the price.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like this movie, but it falls flat in most respects
 The costumes are great

 DiCaprio is pretty good, but Toby McGuire, about ten years too old, is miscast and doesn't read well enough for the voice-over


 The photography, direction and script are mediocre.

$REVIEW.: I bought this having never seen it before. I thought the interviews with professionals treating individuals with eating disorders, and the interviews with the people with eating disorders were well done. I enjoyed the focus on recovery, treatment and consequences of eating disorders. This documentary does a good job of driving home the serious consequences of this illness. However I felt that it could have focused on how eating disorders are present around the world, not just in industrialized countries and America in particular. Also this documentary focused on ballerinas and teenage girls with anorexia nervosa, so I think it might have been interesting to interview individuals from other walks of life, particularly a males about their experiences. I did like that it brushed quickly on the history of eating disorders, but I think an entire documentary could be done on that subject alone. Finally while they discussed medical characteristics of eating disorders, and how they appear to run in familys they did not mention the studies that show a genetic predisposition may be passed down through families which can increase an individual's risk of developing an eating disorder.

$REVIEW.: Beowulf is certainly a landmark in animation movies
The animators have succeeded in a near perfect resemblance to not only the way the leading actors look but talk and act also


Now that was something
Another landmark aspect was the use of motion capture which is not new and a similar technique was used in The Polar Express but Beowulf takes it one step further

Some of the incredible action scenes are almost impossible to create without computer animation

The colors used in Beowulf were good too


Apart from the technology here is an animation movie for adults

This is certainly not a 3D movie for kids as there is violence, blood and gore in good measure


There is some nudity too

Somewhere after the half of the movie the plot gives away after Beowulf's meets with the monster's mother, Angelina Jolie who is animated to sheer brilliance, and you get a feeling that the story is almost over and by the time more action is seen our hero has turned an old man.The soft acoustic songs the queen sings are lovely and I wish I could get longer versions of the same.Four stars.

$REVIEW.: This film is your typical, low budget, Syfy Channel movie. It had an interesting concept and a whole lot of eye candy, but due to it's budget, the effects and cast needed to make it work are seriously lacking. The year is 2048 and thanks to global warming, 90% of the world is underwater. Most people make a living by either exploiting the troubled people or by raiding the lost cities for valuables. The Kubiak family run one of these salvage operations and are asked by the Vatican to try and locate a scepter, one that legend says can reduce the water levels. The skeptical family agrees to the mission, only to find that they have competition from a familiar source. As I said, the story is a little out there, but it was fairly interesting. If this film had any kind of budget what-so-ever it may have worked, but it didn't. James Brolin stars in a role that he was too old for twenty-five years ago. The leader of the Kubiak family, a master salvager and adventurer is played by James Brolin?! That alone should have turned me off to this film. The other star is his troubled son, played by Ian Somerhalder of the Vampire Diaries, and while he was a little more charismatic than the rest of the cast, he can't do much to save this film. A strange thinly veiled story needs to have something besides beautiful people to back it up. If there had been some cool special effects or a more established supporting cast, this film could have been interesting. Instead it ends up being cheesy, and not the good kind of cheesy. At least films like Sharknado are good for a laugh, this is basically just another Waterworld, with less talent and an even lamer story. Unless you're a die hard fan of these Syfy channel movies, I'd say you could defiantly skip this one.

$review_text.: I had been waiting for this title to come out in widesceen for some time. This film's greatest asset is its beautifully photographed landscapes. This DVD delivers these vivid images very strikingly and makes the film very  enjoyable to view.  This is not such a bad sequel as I thought when I first  saw it on its original theatrical release. It is almost not a true sequel  since characters and events referred to in "The Guns of Navarone" have  either been altered or did not exist in the original. However, it still  follows thematically with the original: a small band of Allied soldiers in  W.W.II, penetrate a Nazi stronghold with the odds against them on an  improbable mission. The score by Ron Goodwin is in the same vein as his  "Where Eagles Dare" masterpiece. One interesting note about this DVD is  that it offers both widescreen and Pan &amp; Scan versions of the film.  However, I believe the widescreen version to be from a British print, while  the Pan &amp; Scan version is the American version. There is different  dialog between the two prints. That was an added bonus.
$SUMMARY.: Force 10 From Navarone ..

A Beautiful Print!

$review_text.: No disrespect to the decades before (which has more ups than downs compared to now) & after (which arguably have more downs right now or at least in the middle compared to the decades before)
But MO, the BEST decade in wrestling & the BEST time to be a wrestling fan was the 90's


So many things were done in this decade that will probably never be done again

And should it be duplicated, it wouldn't match how it was done in the 90s

Highlighted here are the wrestlers who made the 90s what it was
The 90s had things that are missing now


Among them, time for matches, less ppvs, more Title value, the different territories where wrestlers wrestled in & learned their craft while they were at it before hitting the big time, better & fresh storylines & angles, The Attitude Era, Monday Night Wars, and stiff competition between 3 different companies where wrestlers could really shoot on other companies & speak their mind, unscripted promos, and much more


This set lets old fans relived just some of the great times while watching a profile on one of their favorite wrestlers
At the same time, new fans will get a glimpse & why these stars are known for whatever they're known for & just a little bitty taste at why the 90s was THE BEST DECADE IN WRESTLING HISTORY!Disc 1The host for this set is Tazz & he did a great job
He was a good candidate as he was in 2 different companies (ECW & WWE) during his ring days
I won't go into detail about what was said about teach individual.Shawn Michaels - I vividly remember Bobby Heenan saying "This is the star of the 90s, Monsoon." I don't know if he was THE STAR of the 90s


Maybe mid to late 90s, most definitely


I liked Shawn
He was a great heel

But a great face too

He shined during his Rocker & post-Rocker days in the early 90s


His best years to me however were his mid to late 90s days where he beat Bret Hart in the Iron Man match that many said could not be done at WM12 in 96 along with his Mind Games match with Mankind & his SSlam 96 match with Vader (who should be on this set IMO), his feud with Taker in 97 (the year that also saw the birth of the original DX) that saw the infamous birth of the HIAC (and the memorable debut of Kane who IMO should've also been on this set)


His unfortunate back injury in early 98 hindered what could have been a great 1998 & 1999 for HBK as a wrestler
But the fact that he was able to make a comeback from a career ending injury is a testament to him.From the Smallest Champion to the LargestYokozuna - The big man
I remember him well
His matches with Taker
Bret, Hogan, and later on, Vader all stand out for me.Samoan CultureThe Rock - While his matches were really something, his strengths I believe showed more in his promos


All his memorable lines & catchphrases


What's not to love about Rock in the 90s?Drawing the Casual FanWomen of the 90s - View for yourself & have your opinion

A shocking moment was when Alundra dumped the WWF Women's Title in the trash on a LIVE edition of Nitro.Tough and SexyKevin Nash - From 93-96, known as Big Daddy Cool, Diesel

He's had memorable times as Diesel

Being a bodygaurd for HBK, his Royal Rumble 1994 run, turning face at the 1994 SSeries, beating Backlund at a record time in MSG first his first & I believe only WWF Championship, his series of matches with Bret, costing Taker the win at Royal Rumble 96 & on RAW (only because he taunted & middle fingered Taker, something never done before to my knowledge prior to this) being dragged underneath the ring by Taker, his match with Taker at WM12 (I personally enjoyed this considering it was 2 big men, which usually aren't as good as this was), and his famous No Holds Barred match with HBK (this was where the prosthetic leg was at)


There are other memorable monets as Diesel
Those were just some of the ones I remember
I also remember his & Scott's debut at WCW

Back then, I found it shocking

I liked his WCW run but loved his run as Diesel more.Battle for SuperstardomOwen Hart - Worthy of being on here


1994 was his definitely the year of The Rocket turned King Of Harts


I hope a dvd sert with as detailed a documentary as HBK's Heartbreak & Triumpth & Bret's Best There Is, Was, Ever Will be dvd sets are
Hopefully, Bret & Shawn (among others) give comments as Shawn was one of Owen's best rivals & Bret (as well as Jim Neidhart, who along with Owen formed The New Hart Foundation in the early 90s after Bret's singles push) is family
This should be done after Jarrett retires from wrestling so he can be free to comment because he was one of Owen's best tag partners if not his best (outside of The Hart Foundation of course)


Also, HHH was one of his great rivals as was SCSA & Ken Shamrock so they should have comments too.Fun Filled MemoriesRic Flair - Sorry for this but a long rant is coming: He was in the Greatest Stars Of The 80's because he had a right to be
But by the 90s, I was getting tired of seeing the same chops, falling down after being chopped in the corner, stomping & elbow dropping his jacket, the robe, the music, the Wooo, etc all the time


Same routine for decades


With that said, I don't know how long he's lasted & why he's still in the business as an active wrestler (especially after WWE's epic sendoff)


Look, I've got no problems with him joining TNA (though if I were him, I'd stay in WWE in some non wrestling capacity)
But he should not be wrestling

He's long past an active wrestle's age/prime & long past his own prime


I lost all respect for him after he tarnished his legacy (and he's continuing to do so) by competing in TNA despite his HOF Induction, epic WM match with HBK & as even more epic RETIREMENT sendoff


However, no denying the man's legacy (or the legacy he had anyway)


Only part of his legacy that's left is his longevity
I believe he was remembered for other things too
But enough ranting
Let's move on to the next individual.Infamous FigureMick Foley - Oh


Another rant

Sorry lol


Another man who really tarnished his legacy once he become a TNA wrestler

However, while I lost a large portion of it, I haven't lost all respect for him


He is The Hardcore Legend & the things he has done to himself are things the human anatomy is not built to take nor should it have to

He wrestled in WCW, ECW & WWF
IMO, he should have retired as an active wrestler after No Way Out 2000 though.The Quest for SuccessNot So Great Stars of the 90sThe ReinventionHulk Hogan - The man who put wrestling on the map


Pretty much same thoughts as Mick Foley though at least he's not wrestling now

Got a feeling it's only a matter of time though
Seems like they're building towards Sting vs Hogan or Sting & Hogan vs ???? or Hogan vs someone from Immortal
If he is gonna wrestle & I don't think he should, it should be against Sting, who is a very respected in ring veteran so Hogan won't have to worry about really anything

While I still to this day have never completely hated the man, I did lose a bit of my Hulkamaniac-ness so to speak once he lost to Taker at SSeries 91 because it was then that I realized he was the The Immortal he claimed to be

Now, I know immortals can lose, but they never die
But how Hogan said it in his promos, he made it seem (at least to me) that he was unbeatable yet SSeries 91 really proved to me that he wasn't as he was clearly dominated that night

I was also uncomfortable with his (and Warrior's) feud with Slaughter in early 91


But otherwise, he was great in the WWF in the 90s

But as far as this decade goes, I think he was more known for his WCW run


He debuted at Bash At The Beach in 96 in his Hulkamania red & yellow colors only to turn heel & along with Hall & Hash form "The New World Order of wrestling." That was very memorable

After years of being a true strong babyface, turning heel was one of, probably the best thing WCW did with him, more so since it wasn't expected & it gave them a chance to as Hogan put it his 2002 Hulk Still Rules documentary (but I'm saying it in different words) temporarily shut down the goody too shoe Hogan before he was completely hated by all.Attitude and ControversyTriple H - From Blue Blood to The Game


I remember his Blue Blood persona well


It's amazing because on Photoshop, I had on the left, a picture of his Blue Blood day & on the right, his current look & man, what a transformation! It's like two different people


Yet it's the same guy except then, he was much younger & not a main eventer unlike now
His fist WWF Title came at the end of 99 just a mere few months away from the year 2000

But I'll remember him most from the time I liked him most (even more than now), his DX days
The things he did like the famous WCW take over stunt angle, getting women or a woman from the crowd every monday night to expose themselves, among other things


While they were some things the DX of the 90s did that I didn ot like, I can't deny that they were still memorable.Technical SavvyBret Hart - The Excellence Of Execution
The Best There Is, The Best There Was And The Best There Ever Will Be
The Hitman

The 90s started as a great decade


But it did not end well

I'm gonna start with the bad

The infamous Montreal Incident, the tragic loss of Owen, his WCW run (except for the Owen Hart tribute match against Chris Benoit)

But like I said, it started out very well
The Hart Foundation run, I.C


Title matches/reigns (matches with Roddy Piper, Perfect, Lawler, Bulldog), singles push continued as he went on to become the WWF Champion (matches with HBK, Taker, SCSA, Owen Hart, Diesel)


He was loved & idolized
I love his trademark thing of giving his shades to a fan
It really was special to each fan who got them

Wish I was one of those lucky ones lol

I'd still have them today
You should watch who he gives the shades to at WM12


I think he was his son, Blade

What's funny though is he took off the kid's cap & just let it out of his hand like he didn't care about it, put the shades on him, but didn't give his hat back lol


Probably someone caught it & put it back on him as Bret's opponent was waiting for him in the ring so....Pop Culture PhenomenonVince McMahon / Eric Bischoff / Paul Heyman - Ok


So they mentioned the promoters
And they should

But what about the refs, ring announcers, managers/valets, and commentators/backstage interviews? If you're gonna add non wrestling individuals, might as well include them all.The Total PackageLex Luger - I only remember a few things about Lex


His entrance as The Narcissist

In particular, how Bobby Heenan hyped him at WM8 & for some reason, he wasn't seen again till the 1993 Royal Rumble where he was unveiled by Bobby


I remember his entrance because he had women hold giant sized mirrors for him while he flexed his muscles for the crowd

I thought/looked at him as a modern day Rick Rude since he used to pose for the ladies too
But the real modern day Rick Rude had to be Val Venis

Anyway, the other things I remember about Luger is the Lex Express, the slam on Yokozuna aboard a ship or something & his debut at WCW


In WCW, he was known as The Total Package & had quite a career there.The IT FactorSting - A man who as Mene Gene put it, "Pretty much covered the 90s from top to bottom." He did just that
From his blonde surfer days, his feuds with Ric Flair, Vader & Muta stand out as well as his partnership & friendship with Luger

From his Wolfpac days, he had a great match on Nitro for the WCW Title against Goldberg (till the ending) & a fantastic match at Halloween Havoc 98 with Bret Hart, which is featured on this set so watch it

But Sting is most remembered for his Crow days


In an interview with IGN.com which took place before he joined TNA, he said the Crow days were the favorite of his career & he also revealed that he had creative control over his character during that time


I'm referring to his original Crow days as the silent, mysterious figure who was in the rafters or crowd if not in the ring and who didn't speak till AFTER he was the WCW Title at Starrcade 97, a match that I'm surprised isn't on this set
It is THAT Sting along with the current on in TNA that are my most favorite incarnations of the man now known as THE Icon

Now, along with Taker, he's my all time favorite (in addition to some others) While I would love to see him at WM (and I believe it's only a matter of time), I respect this man for keeping his word of not going to WWE for years & years now because (1) Every other big name has and (2) Wrestlers aren't known for keeping their word


The subject if retirement is a prime example & Hogan, Flair, Foley are prime examples

Who knows? HBK may follow suit though so far he hasn't & I hope he doesn't as he's done more than enough as it is

I respect Sting so much for keeping his word (among other reasons) that if he did eventually go to WM, my respect for him would not be lost even at the absolute slightest.The Bad GuyRazor Ramon - The Bad Guy oozing machismo


Scott Hall had a great run in WWF as Razor Ramon
His promos were good


His vignettes were good (one of them is on this set as an extra)

He was a multi-time I.C
Champion & I think he was Tag Team Champion too

He had a Championship match with Bret at Royal Rumble 1993 where he did very well but didn't win


IMO, he should have feuded & faced off with Taker at WM9 & have a rematch at SSlam in the R.I.P
match where he'd take time off afterwards to sell the R.I.P


thing & then return thus turning face (of course he'd have to do something other than return to initiate a face turn)

I did not watch a lot of WCW but what I did see of Scott there, I liked

It's unfortunate where he is now in life & I hope and pray he overcomes his demons.RespectThe Undertaker - Man, what can I say that I haven't said before or that hasn't been said before by anyone period? You wanna talk covering the 90s from top to bottom, Sting did it in WCW but this man, this Phenom did it in WWF


He's seen all the greats come & go


SC, Rock, HBK, Bret, Warrior, Hogan, Savage, Flair, they're all gone in some form or another


Yet, Taker remains doing what he started at SSeries 90: wrestle, entertain, you can now include elevating new guys to that


He's pretty much done everything there is
Granted, he never won KOTR or the I.C

Title


But he didn't need those accolades
He bat Hogan for his first World Title a year after his debut at the same event he debuted in at a time where Hogan was virtually unbeatable

TO me, half of the Bret/Austin Wm13 magic happened during the Taker/Hogan match


Going into it, Taker was booed


He was a heel


During the match & more noticeably after it, he was cheered but still a heel while Hogan was still a face
Taker turned face officially on an episode of SNME where he saved Randy & Elizabeth from Jake Roberts, who waited backstage with a chair in hand to strike one of them

What got me was how cheered & loved he was depite the fact that he hadn't changed a thing about him


They just got into that character

The Undertaker as a character is a myth, a legend, the longest running & most popular gimmick in the history of the wrestling industry

As a man, his legacy, presence are untouchable
A WM 19-0 (soon to be 20-0) streak, defeating names like Snuka, Roberts, Diesel, Sid, Kane twice, Boss Man, HHh twice, Flair, Batista, Edge, HBK twice


A 7x World Champion, Hardcore Champion, he's a multi-time Tag team Champion


He;s feuded with & beat every big name if his generation except for Goldberg & Sting


Call me crazy but I believe a UT/Goldberg showdown HAS TO HAPPEN & a UT/Sting showdown MOST DEFINITELY WILL HAPPEN someday


I mean, who thought we'd see Sting/Bret? We saw it


Sting/RVD? We saw it
UT/Sting? We will see it


In every interview I've read of heard of when Sting was being interviewed & the subject of WWE came up, he always said each time, he was closer especially this past January being the closest, yet he hasn't yet to sign
And when asked about how he'd like to face but never did, what's the one thing left to or questions like that, is one answer is: The Undertaker

Look, entrance, mannerisms, everything worked & still does
He is very similar to both Sting & Austin

But for different reasons
He & Sting are loyal to their respective companies where they became household names (Sting in WCW, Taker in WWE)
Both are dedicated to the business, very reliable, have been in the game for over 20 years now I think & are future HOFers

And both had a streak (Sting at BFG, Taker at WM) but while Sting's ended, Taker's, which started first, still lives


Similarities between him & Austin: fired by the same company, told they'd never get anywhere in the business, but both went to WWE & did just that, and as on screen personas, Taker's biker days are similar to the SCSA of the 90s as the were rebellious badasses who lived by their own rules & spit in the face of authorities
Actually, Taker was always like that
It just started to show in 98 & really showed in 2000 - 2003
As far as respect goes, in & out of the ring/the industry, I don't know as the respect this man has


Probably SC & Sting come close but I don't know if thir level of respect matches Taker's
I certainly don't believe their level of respect tops his

You ask anyone in WWE, not in WWE, someone who worked for a promotion but no longer does, ask them about Taker & they'll have nothing but good things to say


I believe the same can be said about Sting, SC & even Kane among others
But no one has the respect of the locker room Taker does & I doubt anyone ever will

I do think that after his career officially ends which many feel will happen at or after WM28, he will continue to appear & wrestle at WM only to defend his Streak against new guys like Sheamus, Miz, Del Rio, at hopefully at WM30 at MSG, Sting

Undertaker IS the 90's of the wrestling & IS the heart, soul & conscience of WWE & WM

He is the true Mr

WM as well.A RebelStone Cold Steve Austin - Many say he revolutionized the business


He sure did it in one way
But I think others have done it too in other ways
SCSA was the man everyone tuned in to see & the man everyone wanted to be


He lived many people's dreams - beat the holy high living hell out your boss (also his former bosses, Bishoff & Heyman), flip him the bird, etc every night & get paid for it and get paid a lot of money at that!! Without question, he was THE rebel we all wanted to be


It sucks that an unfortunate accident occured at SSlam 97 that cut his career short


Had that not happened, I believe he'd still be competing....well, maybe he'd leave WWE or ask for a UT/HBK/HHH like part time schedule once WWE went PG as it eliminated like 90% of what made SCSA who he is - flipping birds, beating up your boss, and pretty much everything else he did in the 90s that made him popular
But I don't think he'd leave over the PG rating as he knows he became a star in WWE


WCW fired him which turned out to be a big mistake


So had he not been in WWE, who knows where he'd end up after ECW went down? Indies? possible but I doubt he'd be the star he was or make the money he made in WWE so a sense of loyalty would have had to be there whether he likes the PG rating or not.Tazz - CloseNow, for the extras:Razor Ramon - Restaurant VignetteJuly 11, 1992 - Entertaining

$review_text.: ***SPOILER ALERT***Unlike a lot of people, I actually liked American Pie 2 more than the original American Pie (although the original is what brought the word "milf" into the American lexicon). But American Wedding was pretty okay; not only had most of the jokes already run their course (especially the scenes with Stifler's mom or ANYthing Stifler-related), but most of the main cast weren't even in the movie. The latter aspect is also evident in the straight-to-video release Band Camp.I see where other reviewers are coming from when they say that this movie feels more like a spin-off (or maybe a crossover) than a sequel, and I also think that Sarah Borkowski's review is pretty on-point. This movie introduces Tad Hilgenbrinck as Steve Stifler's younger brother Matt Stifler, and that alone shows a continuity errors: in the first two movies, Steve's brother's name was never mentioned; plus, he was played by Eli Marienthal. I think Tad only got the job because he looks so much like Seann William Scott. Before I forget, though, here's a forewarning to the guys: if all you're looking for in this movie is gratuitous nudity, you won't find it here. In fact, you see more of Tad's a** than anything else.Anyway, on to the movie. Matt and his pals are planning to prank the band geeks at his high school because Matt wants badly to follow in his brother's footsteps. The latest prank has him sent to see the guidance counselor, who turns out to be Chuck "The Shermanator" Sherman (Chris Owen). You can tell that that role was meant to give a "my, how the tables have turned" appeal, but I don't know; it just didn't do anything for me. Anyway, Sherman sends Matt to band camp for the summer.Upon arriving at band camp, we meet the only real saving grace to this movie: Jim's dad, Mr. Levinstein, as the head counselor (Eugene Levy is ALWAYS funny, so that's no surprise). Matt also meets his childhood crush, Elyse Houston (played by Arielle Kebbel -- quite a step up from Soul Plane, isn't it?), and she reminds him that he was a sweet guy until he started trying to be like his brother.After, say, halfway into the movie, it seems like things will get better, but then everything plays out almost exactly like what happened in American Wedding. Stifler's annoying pranks are good for a few laughs, but then he screws up so bad that even the audience at home thinks he's a jerk; then he finally realizes the error of his ways and fixes things up for the girl of his dreams just before the credits roll.Even a veteran porn star (Ginger Lynn Allen) and a pair of Playboy Playmates (Rachel Veltri and Angela Little) do little to add interest to this movie. Like the case with American Wedding, Band Camp is only worth buying to complete your American Pie collection.Anthony Rupert

$REVIEW.: I adore the way in which Lynch leads you into his own microcosm, each screen is more intriguing than the previous and you become involved with the characters. Blue Velvet is no exception: a simple town boy is intrigued by a woman, and following his curiosity gets drawn into her web, only to inadvertently uncover dark mysteries.  We take this genuinely and often weirdly funny walk with him, a walk that'll cling to your thoughts long after the credits have rolled.I don't idolize Lynch as many reviewers do (although I admired his work in The Straight Story) and I believe he has too often pursued weirdness for the sake of weirdness. But at his best he has produced marvels of film making. Blue Velvet is one of the latter as it doozily exposes the hidden dark underbelly of small towns, and of people that are seldom what they seem on the surface.More than one viewing of this film is probably necessary if you really want to get it. The first time round, I ended up thinking that this was simply a noir-ish attempt at vulgar violence. The second viewing actually made me see some of the things Lynch wanted us to see without the shock factor.Even so, this one may not be for everyone, but a must for Lynch fans.

$REVIEW.: By the time Demons was released Italian horror cinema was heading towards the end of its amazing run. While there were still classics coming out of Italy it seemed to be less frequent as it once was. I enjoyed Demons, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed by it simply for the talent that was involved. By no means would I say Demons is a bad movie. It's a splatter flick and nothing more. It does deliver in some areas, but lacks in others.The screenplay was written by Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini and Dardano Sacchetti as well as also being produced by Dario Argento. The script lacks and none of the characters have much depth. Simply put almost all of them serve to purpose, but to add to the body count. That is very common in the horror genre, but I think they over-did it with all the characters. There were just too many to keep track of. With Dario Argento and Dardano Sacchetti involved I guess I just expected a lot more. Sacchetti wrote or co-wrote many cult classics in the 70s and 80s with his most notable movies being made with Lucio Fulci.Personally I was never really the biggest fan of Lamberto Bava; while he has made some enjoyable flicks he has also made some bad flicks. His career seems to be very hit or miss and with Demons it's a little bit of both. Demons takes a little while to get going, but once it does Demons does have a pretty good run before running out of gas despite only being about 90-minutes. The biggest problem as I stated earlier is just too many characters. After a while seeing them run away from Demons gets a little tiring.People often confuse demonic flicks with zombie flicks; while they might follow a similar structure they are also very different as well. Even though Demons is a demonic flick it does follow the basic concept of a zombie movie. It seems to me to almost be sort of a demon version of Night of the Living Dead structure wise. I always like movies where the characters are isolated and have no way of getting to safety. The main characters are trapped in a movie theater with no way out.Problem is despite that Demons lacks any real tension. I never really felt that there was any suspense or tension. Maybe that wasn't the point, but running away from demons just becomes tiring. The setting was perfect, but I just never felt the isolation. Lamberto Bava is able though to create some really excellent murder scenes, but unable to bring much suspense or tension. The first half of Demons can be quite gory. We have throats being ripped a part, eyes being pulled out; some really great stuff to be found.The 2nd half though begins to slump at times; it's pretty much a repeat of the first half only this time less gore. We might see the demons lunge, but there is a cutaway. Demons ripping at people, but we don't get to see the good stuff. The final act has a guy on a motorcycle with a sword and surrounded by demons and I was expecting some major carnage, but while there is action there obviously, it didn't really deliver the gore. Demons is a splatter flick and I just felt there wasn't enough splatter.Despite the flaws Demons was a fun movie and something I would watch again, but I just felt the movie could have been a little better. Fans of Italian horror cinema should enjoy.

The plot is a bit wacky and insane but the outcome is heartwarming and wonderful. A simple, young, brilliant girl in many ways, Amelie knows just enough how to meddle in the lives of others to make a difference, and all for the better. The challenge for her, of course, is to be able to help herself. She seems really good at running away until the end-alas,a nice ending. Oh, and the scenes with the gnome are an absolute scream!

$review_text.: Life certainly seems a bit more fair when quality television shows like MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE come to the surface. When the writing is fresh, the cast scores 110 %, and the humor is @ the top of it's game you just can't go wrong. When I was growing up I lived a simular life sorta like Malcolm's only minus the 165 I.Q., I'm no where close to genius. What I did have was 3 siblings I had to share everything with, the oldest was my sister who was never home (much like Malcolm's oldest brother Francis) and my two brothers whom loved to aggravate one another, punch and brake each others toys on purpose. When I say sharing I mean we all shared the same bedroom at one time. It was no party, but I wouldn't go back in time and change anything. Well, maybe somethings. ..You might be asking yourself why is this guy telling his life story. Well I'm only trying to say that this show is the closest thing to my life in the sitcom world and after I watched a few episodes I was hooked. But why is FOX taking their sweet time releasing the 2nd season?? It would have made a great 2004 Christmas gift. By the way don't get me wrong, you don't have to have lived a poor life to appreciate MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. This show is great for all walks of life, even you.

It is futuristic and yet very much in the present.  The most virtuous aspect of this series is that I can be sure to be spared foul language, unnecessary sex, and brutal violence.  The viewer always knows that the contentious situation will be resolved, that humor will be laced throughout, and that romance and intrigue will be handled gracefully.

Turns out, everyone gets infected except for that one dude in the end- Which was the funniest part in the movie.They overdid the blood and gore- Come on! Don't exaggerate! Getting hit by a guitar doesn't cause you to spit out gallons of blood.The only gruesome scene I could say in the whole movie is the dog chewing up that one fine brunette chick leaving her into pieces-That you could put a Beware Of Dog sign anyday.I didn't get the part of the deer getting run over- What was the point? Just blood and gore splattering on the dude's face.&quot;Hey it's the party man!&quot; Some cheap skit, he must've felt really special. How about a nice cold bottle of &quot;Shut the he11 up and work on your acting skills!&quot;Overall, the movie is not scary and totally lame.

Gambon was much better in &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; which is not to say that these storys are &quot;bad&quot;-but when compared to other crime/detective shows like Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lynley, Inspector Morse or a Touch of Frost the episodes here are inferior.

$review_text.: Phenomeonon was advertised as a sci-fi movie, and whilke it has a sci-fi sort of theme at its core, anyone going to see the movie based on that was sorely disappointed.What this movie is, actually, is a story about a man learning to cope with something that he can't understand, and how it brings him closer to his friends and his community, and how it allows him to understand and deal with his own fate.Yes, it's a bit sappy at times, but it also contains some really excellent performances

Travolta delivers what it certainly his most authentic and touching portrayal of a real human being yet seen in his post-Tarantino career


Forrest Whittaker and Robert Duvall likewise contribute first-rate performances
A wonderful contemporary soundtrack ties it all together.

$REVIEW.: The goofy writer/director James Gunn, who wrote the well-received remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), dearly longed to hearken back to the '80s horror flicks and their over-the-top gory sensibilities. Thus, SLITHER. So if this modest horror offering reminds you somewhat of RE-ANIMATOR, THE FLY, THE BLOB, THE EVIL DEAD trilogy, and John Carpenter's THE THING, then Mr. Gunn considers his task gleefully accomplished. SLITHER, a film about alien invasion of the slimiest ilk, is ickily grotesque, somewhat terrifying, and very tongue-in-cheek. The make-up, puppeteering, prosthetics, and CGI are very, very nice and the horror sequences will sometimes make you jump, but, honestly, the modern horror audience is by now so de-sensitized by the proliferation of cinematic shockfests that it's gonna take a lot more to elicit honest, startled gasps of fright. But, having said that, SLITHER will make the viewer appreciate its efforts.The humor is, of course, the movie's saving grace, is what makes SLITHER stand out from other, more solemn splatter-flicks. The comedy meshes nicely with the storyline, is never forced, but surfaces naturally thru the situations that arise. Of course, it helps that Nathan Fillion, with his mastery of the tight-lipped one-liners, and Gregg Henry, here with his verbal diarrhea of profanity, seem to be naturally funny people. You could tell, in the special features segments, how much these cats, as well as the rest of the cast, liked to laugh.SPOILERS RIGHT HERE!! Plot breakdown: The outskirts of hicksville Wheelsy is the site of a meteorite crash one quiet evening, an event which somehow goes unnoticed by the redneck citizenry. Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), after being spurned by his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) for the night, goes into the woods with a chippie he picks up at a bar. But Grant Grant's devotion to his wife makes him have second thoughts about cheating on Starla, and, instead, he is diverted by an icky thing he espies on the ground. Of course, the usual happens and Grant Grant becomes infected and soon is hungering for MEAT and undergoing some pretty gruesome changes. In due time, the Grant monster feels the need to procreate and impregnates a woman, who later spews out a crapload of moist, speedy, little red slugs, who, in turn, slurp into the mouths of the Wheelsy denizens and zombiefy them. These slugs have a direct connection to Grant Grant; thus, whatever they and their hosts see is channeled right back to the Grant monster. Anyways, it's ultimately left up to four people to save the world: Sheriff Bill Pardy (the great Nathan Fillion), Starla Grant (who Pardy has been crushing on for years), the vulgarian mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry), and teenager Kylie (Tania Saulnier).Because this is supposed to be a B-movie homage, director James Gunn didn't want any A-listers in the cast (besides, it was doubtful if he could've gotten any). The complement of actors he handpicks, while falling somewhere in the B-list category, is energetic, committed, and, dare I say, perfectly cast. Nathan Fillion, who I hope will do more movies, eschews his wry, no-nonsense Firefly hero/captain, Mal Reynolds, and signs on here as a less competent, but still wry, small-town sheriff who, while out of his depth, nevertheless, attempts to do the right thing. Sexy Elizabeth Banks (SEABISCUIT, SPIDER-MAN films) is lovely and sweet and you could see why a cavalcade of one-minded zombies in love, instead of craving her flesh as a snack, would rather play footsies with her. Michael Rooker is here and I chuckle at the making-of segment, wherein it's revealed that the writer/director fawns on Rooker and thinks of him as some kind of an acting demi-god (please, it's Michael Rooker! He's the guy that takes the roles Michael Madsen's turned down). Lastly, Gregg Henry, Gregg Henry, Gregg Henry! I laughed my you-know-what off every time this scene-stealing guy opened his mouth. Please, someone just hand him a Mr. Pibb already.The pleasingly loaded and profanity-laced (but hilarious) dvd special features offer up:- a robust Feature Commentary by director James Gunn and actor Nathan Fillion- "The Sick Minds and Slimy Days of SLITHER": the behind-the-scenes featurette- Gag Reel- "Who is Bill Pardy?": a wink-in-the-eye segment on Nathan Fillion- Extended Scenes: with optional commentary by James Gunn- Deleted Scenes - with optional commentary by James Gunn- "Slithery Set Tour with Nathan Fillion" - they gave Fillion a camera and let him run loose on the set- "Visual Effects: Step by Step" - progression of several special effects scenes shown in stages- "Bringing SLITHER's Creatures to Life" - 18-minute segment about the monster f/x- "The King of Cult: Lloyd Kaufman's Video Diary" - a few minutes spent with the president of Troma Entertainment and director of TOXIC AVENGER- "The Gorehound Grill: Brewin' the Blood" - an f/x mini-course on how to make fake blood, using home ingredients.In addition to the 1980s horror films, there's also a touch of KING KONG here, manifested in the doomed love story of Starla and the lonely billions-of-years-old monster. So, really, there's nothing new in SLITHER. All the token horror criterias are met, the usual cliched sequences touched upon. But, here, it's not a bad thing. When comfortable derivativeness is partnered with panache, competent f/x, a decent plot, and earthy humor, well, it becomes very palatable, indeed. Three and a half stars for this very fun ickfest.

$REVIEW.: As I was critiquing a lot of the slasher series that have been made over the years, the one movie that jump started this trend, &quot;Halloween&quot;, has produced some of the lamest slasher sequels since the last four &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;'s. This fifth sequel is no exception.Jamie Lloyd, now a grown woman and still Michael Myers' niece, is still being stalked by her Uncle but this time she has a baby and Michael can't have visitation rights (so to speak). Also, a family has moved into Michael's old home and he isn't pleased about that either. Donald Pleasance returns for the final time, as Dr. Loomis.There is also the mention of a cult, the tall man with the cowboy boots get explained, etc. This film sucked. Pleasance (who has done better acting in the past) looks like he is there for his big paycheck (I hope it was a big paycheck!). Rumor has it there is a Directors Cut of the film somewhere because, for reasons I'm not sure of, &quot;Dimension Films&quot; cut down the films run time. To &quot;Dimension Films&quot;, all I can say is.... THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!

$review_text.: The stories are timeless and still relevant, even though one takes place in 1954, one in 1974, and the last in 2000. It is a similar format to "If These Walls Could Talk 2" in which there are three stories from three different generations. The 1954 sequence hits home, in spite of a "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy within the armed services, because even now, a military career can still be irreparably damaged if a soldier or officer is outed. Gay youths can relate to the 1974 story, seeing minimal progress from 1974 to the present with the way GLBT young people are treated by their peers. All one has to do is watch "The Matthew Shepard Story" or  "Boys Don't Cry" to witness recent cruelty against GLBT youth.The three stories could have easily been made into full-length movies. I especially wanted to learn more about the characters from "A Friend of Dorothy's." That story has a lot of potential, and Brittany Murphy was quite effective in her sad, wide-eyed  portrayal of Dorothy Nelson. The phrase, "A friend of Dorothy's" was a bit overused in the script; I'm sure gays and lesbians back in 1954 had other code words to communicate their homosexuality other than just proclaiming "I'm a friend of Dorothy's." At times the gay cliches became a bit much, which diluted the realism and authenticity of the stories.What  I liked about the film was its positive ending and overall of message of hope and acceptance, in spite of what happened to some of the main characters in the three stories. It is a visually beautiful film and captures the small town feeling.  And the stories are compelling enough to make this an interesting film to purchase and watch. I hope it comes out on DVD with Director's and Screenwriters' commentary.

$review_text.: I can't tell you how much I was disappointed of the picture quality of this DVD.  But, I can see what they are doing.  I just rented this DVD of "Mission Impossible III" and I know that they actually made a depreciating effort to reduce the video quality of this DVD. The picture quality of this DVD is a great deal less in quality than it easily could be.  And I've got a fantastic Samsung 32" LCD TV.  I know they made sure the picture quality of this DVD would be sub-par so that they can try to push the Blue-Ray DVD version to try and get people to start buying Blue-Ray DVD's.  I have many high quality High-Definition DVD's, so I know that it is possible to give us standard DVD player owners, a High Definition DVD of this film, but they won't.I started to pay attention to this when I saw "War of the Worlds" on DVD.  I thought that the picture quality of that DVD was sub-par, too.  But, the DVD of "Terminator III: Rise of the Machines", "Monsters, Inc", many of my films from the eighties, and even 1963's "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", all appear to be a High Definition (simulated) mastered release on a standard DVD.  Blue-Ray is the next new expense of getting you to keep spending your money on the same movies that you already have.Well, if you let yourself fall into that trap of replacing all your favorite DVD's with Blue-Ray DVD's, you're looking at an expensive future of buying all your favorite movies all over again.And you know what?  I'll bet, within 5 years or so from now, they'll say they've come out with something better than Blue-Ray DVD's, and you'll be suckered into replacing all your favorite DVD's once again.This is a never ending cycle of making sure that you keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.And then over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and then you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and so on and so on.....If you start to invest in Blue Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.

$review_text.: Once again, I had decided to watch a movie that featured the lovely if not charming Renee Zellweger. It is a fun movie about about the life of Bridget Jones. A 30's single woman who is secretly terrified as to why she has not found the right man. The tough call is trying to decide which man she is destined to be with: the-all-too-good-to-be-true Hugh Grant, or the very handsome but only slightly boring Colin Firth. Tough call indeed! Renee is totally believable in the role, and she does truly stand out in this movie. The problem's I slightly had the most with were the content of coarse, but the most was the scene where Bridget finds an unexpected visitor in Daniel's (Hugh Grant) apartment. That scene made me very upset. The character of Bridget is indeed a lady you can fall in love with because I do have an ex-girlfriend who is like her in some ways. Personally, I would not mind dating her myself. Renee indeed had put almost a lot of herself into this character, and she should have the Academy Award for this performance. Bottom line: A good movie, but it could have been slightly better.

$REVIEW.: Pork Chop Hill along with Twelve O'Clock High showcases Gregory Peck's immense talent in portraying men dealing with the extreme stress of making life and death decisions.  Instead of just your typical &#34;war&#34; films, they center on the almost impossible difficulty of making decisions that will result in men's deaths during the stress of combat.  Few actors are capable of doing this believably but Gregory Peck is outstanding in these roles.Pork Chop HIll is a true story and Peck is playing a real combat commander caught in an impossible situation in trying to re-take a hill in Korea that was over-run by the Chinese right at the end of the war.  It is a hill that on the surface is worth nothing, especially dying for.  How do you lead men effectively under these difficult circumstances.  Gregory Peck and the real soldier he plays provide the answer better than almost any other combat film made.  In much more recent combat films, Saving Private Ryan and Tom Hanks well acted role probably come closets to capturing this difficult dilemma of leadership.

$review_text.: Some studios or directors sometimes takes awhile before they perfect the formula

Knowing what works and what doesn't, they eventually will start to settle into that comfort zone where the films are really great, although they may not be as innovative

With Miyazaki you'll always find great animation and a really imaginative world but certain flaws that existed before still exist now
While it probably won't beat Totoro or Spirited Away as the better film, it's certainly an enjoyable film to watch.Young Sophie works at a hat shop and feels like she isn't beautiful


She has a chance encounter with a likable man with some magical powers
Later on, she has an unfortunate meeting with the Witch of the Waste(wish I wasn't kidding about the name) which turns her into an old woman

Looking for a way to break the spell, she runs into a big castle with legs, run by a kid named Markl and a fire demon that runs the castle


The master of the place is the man she met earlier, a wizard named Howl


Will Sophie break the spell?Like I said about certain things getting perfected, this film is probably some of the best animation that Studio Ghibli has done


The colors are so vivid, sharp and colorful and one scene involving a flower garden late in the film was quite striking

And unlike other releases, the CG never becomes obvious where you can easily tell where it took over

It's of course got the weird characters and neat concepts and what more would you want?Well, maybe a better written plot? The premise is great, it's just the execution falls apart slightly


Certain elements are never explained and we seem to jump from one thing to the next


The other problem is what plagued other Miyazaki films: it's a bit too long

Now one of my favorite films is JFK, 3 hour 15 at least in the Director's Cut and I didn't even minded however Howl clocks in at a few minutes shy of 2 hours and it feels like certain things could've been chopped off(one weird subplot involving Howl's hair just seems completely out of place and unnecessary).If you've had Miyazaki films before, you know how skimpy they are on extras(then again, what anime film isn't?) It's disappointing but at the same time the film does speak for itself but considering the guys at Pixar are huge Miyazaki fans, you would maybe thought they'd record a commentary on his film, making comments about the story and animation etc.It's certainly a recommendable film but if this is your first, well go for Totoro or Spirited Away but if you're already a fan, must give this a go.

$REVIEW.: How do you get a bunch of A and near A-list actors to star in a small-budget film such as "The Way Way Back"?  Well, you offer them a summer vacation in the Hamptons, or at least a location that looks a lot like the Hamptons.  That might do.But then again, maybe a better way would be to write a way, way good screenplay, and then throw that screenplay to your actor candidates. or at least their agents.  After they nearly pass on the project because of the low salaries, they might read it and then nearly beg to take a pay cut to just be part of it all.Well, I'm assuming that this is kind of how it went with really top-notch acting talent such as Toni Collette and Sam Rockwell, but I'm just guessing.  But I'm not guessing that this film was made for a mere five million dollars, which is an unbelievable steal nowadays.  Heck, you could barely cover just the cost of their summer rental for that.  Even in a place that just looks like it's in the Hamptons.I can't say that I liked this film as much as "Little Miss Sunshine" or even "The Descendants," but it is really close.  The writing was terrific in all three, the directing was terrific in all three, and the acting was terrific in all three.  What else could you ask for really?It seems that the theme of this film is "Settling."  The workers at the water park have settled for their "measly" jobs for longer than they'd care to discuss.  The water park itself has even settled for a manager that might be out of his mind -- a really funny Sam Rockwell that sure tries to steal the show.  The mother settles for a boyfriend who might have a few skeletons in his closet (I won't say what those skeletons are as that might be a spoiler).  But I guess the title "The Way Way Back" has something to do with the very back seats in station wagons.  I had never heard the phrase until today, outside of perhaps in baseball.  Perhaps it is a metaphor for being able to get away from your problems?  Or maybe even take control of them when you decide to by going to your happy place?  And our protagonist finds out that sometimes, while it might be best to be alone, it might be best to be alone together.I just watched a film called "Lincoln" this week, which was beyond a snooze-fest.  Many critics have complained about that film's historical inaccuracies that were completely unnecessary as well, but I'm not a history buff so I can't say.  And that film was made for $65 million, which is 13 times the cost of this little gem.  Which producer do you think got the better deal?  While I may not be a history buff, my math skills aren't too bad.I say, "Why settle for a lousy, overblown film such as Lincoln?" at 65 mil when you can sit back and truly enjoy yourself for a mere 5?  Take control, and don't be willing to settle for anything less.

$review_text.: I'm not going to talk about the plot because it is something that needs to be watched and will be better with the less you know.I thought it was an absolutely fascinating supernatural thriller. It is very complicated and doesn't make much sense at first and will leave you wondering long after the credits roll.The look of the film is great and directed very well. I was very surprised that the cast were not horrible actors. Usually films like these fall burden too the fact that only the lead and maybe main supporting role put on good performances but I thought everyone did a great job, especially the lead.The dialogue isn't amazing but it is made up by most of the brains of the script being put towards its complex and twisted structure.It isn't overly gory yet the violence is still incredibly shocking.I really liked the ending, it still leaves me wondering how some things happened and I really think it needs to be watched more than once. But I don't think the questions are enough to take away from the whole experience of the film.Overall I thought it was an incredibly unique, complex, thoroughly entertaining, and a clever and very well made film. Unlike many horror films I didn't think this one feel apart at the final act and continued to surprise me right until the credits rolled. I think I would consider this one of my favorites which is saying a lot when considering how many horror films I actually like. Now I may not have found this to be as scary as Paranormal Activity I think all together it is a much better film and my favorite horror film of 2009, if it can even really be considered one. 8.5/10

$REVIEW.: "Don't Say a Word" is a sleek, engrossing suspense thriller starring Michael Douglas as a top Manhattan psychiatrist who has everything: a beautiful wife (Famke Janssen), an adorable daughter (Skye McCole Bartusiak) and a spacious apartment in the fabulous Ansonia, a Beaux Arts landmark on the Upper West Side.On the day before Thanksgiving, Douglas' Dr
Nathan Conrad is in an accommodating mood when pressed by a former colleague (Oliver Platt) at a psychiatric hospital (modeled on New York's famed Bellevue) to try to break through to a bedraggled, self-destructive 18-year-old (Brittany Murphy).Without help, Platt's Dr
Jerald Sachs argues, in a couple of days, the girl could end up chained to a bed at a mental institution for the rest of her life.Conrad doesn't know that soon he'll have to persuade Murphy's mute Elisabeth to reveal a six-digit number if he's to rescue his daughter, Jessie, kidnapped by thieves led by the brutal Patrick Coster (Sean Bean), a safecracker fresh out of prison


In the meantime, Jennifer Esposito's tenacious NYPD detective is investigating two ostensibly unrelated murders.Director Gary Fleder and writers Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly, in adapting Andrew Klavan's novel, tell the story with dispatch and conviction
At the heart of the matter are Conrad's grueling sessions with Elisabeth, during which Douglas draws on his star authority while Murphy reveals Elisabeth as a young woman in the grip of paralyzing fear.The film stretches credibility in demanding Douglas to come across as a potential miracle-worker and two-fisted hero--a man of brilliance, strength and daring


With a terrific assist from Murphy's equally commanding portrayal, Douglas pulls it off.The great-looking "Don't Say a Word," wide-ranging in locations, moves between past and present, presses forward toward the kidnappers' deadline and is heightened by Mark Isham's score


The film's intricate, ingenious structure reveals twists and turns of the human psyche


It demands as much of editors William Steinkamp, Armen Minasian and cinematographer Amir Mokri as it does of the actors.Visual and kinetic, "Don't Say a Word" moves like a bullet train through settings actual and constructed, blended seamlessly by production designer Nelson Coates and his staff

"Don't Say a Word" is smart, stylish and, most important, satisfying.Basic fact, Douglas doesn't accept any role unless it holds a LOT of meaning...

$review_text.: I love the classics, but I never pass up looking at the remakes. Sometimes they are not as good as the originals. In this case I think I like the remake just a little better. The reason is that the original used some angle shots that made the cast look unworldly and to me that detracted from it. The cast to me only had 3 people that stood out, Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Joseph Sweeney. Don't get me wrong the first one has some strong acting, but the remake seems like more of the cast is what I would really expect. Jack Lemmon, George C. Scott, Hume Cronyn, William Petersen, Edward Olmos, Ossie Davis, and the rest the cast left more of an impression on me. The original did not impress me with people I knew on the street in the 1950s. The remake though did seem to have people I could meet in a court room in the 1990s. As for one person commentng on the lack of forensics for the time, I hate to tell you not every city has a CSI team as good as the TV shows. I thought the evidence presented was believable, certainly as much so as the original.

Shamed and dissapointed, he finds peace at a modest farm of his daughter, who lives alone from the crowding world, until a tragic event will interrupt the pastoral idyll between nature and them. Hereupon, Lurie experiments a complex journey of introspection and redemption, returning to Melissa' parents to apologize himslef for alll the bitter consequences of his unforgiven act.This tragic portrait works out during the modern South Africa with its political, economic and social implications. The way of reacting of his own daughter respect this awful incident reveals she is well aware about the rules of game, and in this sense he barely knows how thwe system works out in this side of world.John Malkovich makes a towering performance as well as Jessica Haine in this powerful and haunting episode of the human life where you and me as spectators cannot be remain indifferent at all.Magisterial direction and well depicted script make of this film certainly one of the top 10 films of the year.

I will admit that some of films [mainly ones based on video games{but not all of those}] are not that great. But with that said he has made some really good ones. Films like &#8220;Postal&#8221; which is based on a game and &#8220;Rampage&#8221; among others come to mind. Luckily when this one was released it turned out to be a really good one.Tom and Gillian Grady is a couple who live outside a small town on a farm that Tom&#8217;s dad once owned with their son. They are a nice and keep to themselves type of people trying to make their new situation work. As luck would have it there is a storm that rolls in that lasts forever it seems. During this storm a man wanders onto their land and eventually to them, they help the man out. Once he is awake the man starts speaking of the end of the world and terrible things happening in the town. Things seem to be going like the man is saying as the Grady&#8217;s neighbors seem to be missing along with other things out of place. So is this man right about everything and could he be the help they need, or is there a much darker side to this guy, a murderous side?I have to say that I really enjoyed this little thriller here from Boll and writer Tim McGregor. This end of the world flick is a cool little low budget affair with strong performances from its cast. Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Cole Heppell are great as the Grady family and seem very natural together. Luke Perry is great as well as the stranger that wanders into these people&#8217;s lives. It is a very small cast but that is what makes it work.Now I have read reviews in which people say the vanishings and apocalypse thing are never explained but that is not true. If you pay attention it is clear as day and makes perfect sense, all I will say is know your Bible. If you know anything that Perry&#8217;s character is talking about here then you will get that ending. So with that said I really did enjoy this film even though I am sure some will disagree with me on it. You get a really informative commentary from Boll here in which I think he is a little too hard on his own film. Also an alternate ending that zombie fans might like, I prefer the one they went with.
$SUMMARY.: IT DOES MAKE SENSE, JUST PAY ATTENTION

$REVIEW.: &quot;Tarzan&quot; is a great film for both kids and adults to see. It was very humorus and entertaining. The music is great, too. You will remember the music for years to come, and the movie, too.The movie  &quot;Tarzan&quot; starts out when Tarzan is just a baby and his parents  are on the boat in the ocean during a storm. Tarzan and his parents make it  to the jungle, and they make a home in the jungle. But then, the tiger (I  think it's a tiger) kills Tarzan's parents and Tarzan is the only survival  in the attack.Anyway, a couple months later, a mother ape who lost her  own baby to the same tiger strolls into the old, deserted home of Tarzan.  She finds Tarzan and takes him home. She wants to be Tarzan's mother so she  takes care of him.The ape's husband doesn't like the idea that she is  taking care of a human baby. He doesn't like Tarzan and during the movie,  Tarzan grows up into a man.Years later, a young woman named Jane, her  father, and this guy who comes with them to protect them, comes to the  jungle to for research. They are from Londan, England.Jane meets Tarzan  while running away from the tiger, he saves her (of course), and they end  up falling in love. The guy who is supposed to be precticing Jane and her  father find out about the apes and try to kill them - he also trys to kill  Tarzan. Well, then the tiger comes and trys to destroy them.From the  middle to the end of &quot;Tarzan&quot;, it's the typical animated Walt  Disney movie, still, it's really good. The animation is incriedble. What I  like about the animated Disney movies is that the the animation just keeps  getting better and better each year, so does the quailty of the  film.This is a definite must-buy Disney for the entire family! It's on  the top of my list for &quot;Must-see&quot;!  Go out and buy it, and you  won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: This film rates up there with the Pink Panther films.  It is one of Peter Sellers' best. Even though the love interest in the film is a person that I believe got away with murder.  Spider Sabich was the impacted person in question.  However, she is quite beautiful in the film and reminds me a great deal of Jane Fonda as far as her looks are concerned.  it is a film that I recommend to anybody with a funnybone that needs a good jolt.  The print is excellent.Chuk

$review_text.: Every time I see this movie have the same feeling: if the Devil will reign, it will be this way!Opera lovers knows that one of the worst things ever is the fact that Maria Callas never recorded a full version of Verdi's Macbeth; luckyly, the olympic talent of Laurence Olivier created this jewel.For me, it goes ahead even before Olivier's Hamlet: this very personal approach of the Duke of Gloucester goes surrealistic enough to be modern. I saw it first when I was a child and I will never forget the impression that Olivier's eyes caused.Cast, with Gielgud, Richardson, Bloom and Hardwicke among others, supports Olivier's experiment transforming the text of Shakespeare almost in a modern thriller about the corruption of a soul obsessed with power beyond all limits.It was necessary the maturity of another great stage and cinema actor (Al Pacino) to almost reach Olivier, but this one is still a landmark.

$review_text.: Sometimes the old classics are just the absolute best!  This movie was made way before any computer enhancements or multi-million dollar production costs, but it still came off really well done and acted
In this story, a man and his son share a deep and loving bond as they struggle to make a living with their old country store


Being way out in the boonies this is no easy thing

But they are happy, and get by the best that they can.And then tragedy comes into their life in the form of a couple of carloads of spoiled rich kids pulling dirt bikes behind that they plan on riding in the woody hills


With no respect for anybody, let alone the poor people of the area.Not wanting to wait as the cars gas up, and the girls check out the 'quaint' old country store, the leader of the crew unloads his bike and decides to do some ripping  around while they wait
Driving recklessly over the hills nearby, the brainless, arrogant biker runs over the little boy! They panic
And quickly they load up and leave the boy for dead.The father returns from a delivery to find his son, the thing the poor widowed father loves beyond any and all else, crushed

His last words are 'daddy?' as if he can't quite understand what's happened to him


Needless to say, the grieving of the father instantly ignites a fury for vengeance that knows no bounds


And he will do anything to get it! Even seek out the old witch deep in the woods to call upon ultimate retribution...Pumkinhead...But there's a price

The grief stricken father will of course pay..

not with money, but with bis very soul!

$review_text.: I was glad to see this series finally released on DVD.  I really enjoyed the film when it came out, and was an avid fan of the show in the late 70's when it was released.  The DVD set looks nice, and the menu's and packaging are first rate.  I was disappointed with the lack of extras though, as there are no deleted scenes or alternate scenes, or bloopers, and very few commentaries.  In spite of this I think the overall packaging and picture quality is excellent.But, and there is a "but" here, the show simply has not held up well.  As a big Sci-Fi fan, I can appreciate and accept the "orange sky, three fake rocks" sets of Star Trek, or the overly slow and BBC-like cerebral and 60's counter-culture inspired Space 1999, or the "we only have the budget for 5 special effects" repetition of Battlestar Galactica, and yes, these shows are dated and often a bit silly.  However, they held up well from a story line, and character development standpoint.  They are fun to watch again, even years later.  Sadly, this Buck Rogers series is more like a campy space version of the "Love Boat", or some other bad 1970's TV show, and many of these episodes are actually painful to sit through.Given that, I am still glad I have the set, and there are a few gems here.  Some of the more serious episodes are worth seeing again, in some cases for the first time in decades for me.  So, if you are a true fan of the show, it is worth the investment.  Besides, it is better than the bootlegged "sci-fi channel" copies that were the only thing available previously.  While this show is certainly not one of the classics of the genre, it is nonetheless a set worth having.  Why not five stars?  Well, minus one for some of the horrible episodes (Space Olympics?, Space Rock Stars??) and minus another for the lack of extras, so overall a three star rating.  Not bad, not great.

$review_text.: The name "Bruce Willis" usually means it is going to be an excellent film.  This time Bruce Willis tries a CGI-effects science fiction film.  This is his 30th film.In "Languages", you must press on "English 5.1" to get sound for the film.You may choose "Fact Track" to receive facts about the film in English or Spanish while film is playing.  It will replace subtitles.Bruce Willis plays "Korben Dallas", your typical alpha-male who wakes up with a cigarette, stereo playing and television on.  He also owns a white pussycat that keeps coming back home.It's the year 2214.  Willis drives a mid-air taxi-cab (remember the Jetson's airship?) where on this day he picks up Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil [2002], Resident Evil: Apocalypse [2004]).  It guess orange hair is still in style.  She was just re-created and talks in babbling.McDonald's Restaurant is still around on the 25th floor with a whole new meaning to "drive-in".Disc 2 includes the "Special Features".  Too many to list, but some highlights are:The Star Element: Interviews with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.The Diva featurette includes interview with Maiwenn who played the Diva Plavalaguna.  This will also include the entire performance of Maiwenn against green screen.Note: Maiwenn played the Diva Plavalaguna, but was lip-syncing the opera.  It is soprano, Inva Mula's voice doing the aria.

$review_text.: With all due respect to the media reporting on this major art film I was surprised to find myself witnessing a movie that simply obliterated the `gore' boundaries set by horror classics such as "Last House on the Left", "Dead Alive/Brain Dead", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Cannibal Holocaust", "Cannibal Ferox", "Faces of Death" and "Men Behind the Sun". Next to "Irreversible" this film is probably the only real shocker to come out in years. If the subject matter had been anything other than the trial and execution of Jesus Christ it would hard to image this getting a release in most countries. In fact Sunday school is about to take a very brutal twist that even the most seasoned of "gore-hounds" will have trouble stomaching.Here, in The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson gives us 127 minutes of non-stop graphic and violent torture sequences. Once the screaming starts it DOES NOT STOP! It has been a long time since cinema has driven home such powerful and disturbing imagery. In one sequence a huge visible chunk of Jesus' chest is torn away by a clawed cat-o-nine tails to reveal his ribs underneath. By the end of the movie Jesus is virtually half a skeleton with most of his body tissue removed and bone chipped away. It is the first time many of us have seen these images outside of a "Slayer" album cover and Gibson has turned the tables on what we could conventionally conceive in our minds as the murder of Christ. Nowhere in cinema has this subject be treated with the absolutely truthfulness and respect that it deserved. The actual term for these proceedings (the last twelve hours of Christ) is called - "Deicide" (The act of killing a being of a divine nature; particularly, the putting to death of Jesus Christ). The Passion of the Christ in wholly and indisputably a hell of a cinematic challenge for a rendition of "Decide" as it has never been seen before. You will not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. When you come out of the cinema it is probably best if you take a lie down somewhere and contemplate what you have just witnessed. You have NEVER seen anything like this before... nor will you want to again.The Passion of the Christ does not go into much detail about the life of Jesus or anything much biblical. In fact it is more akin to watching "No Comment" on Euro News (basically news reports with just video images) and letting you make up your own mind. For those of you who are not informed about what the life of Jesus was before he was crucified then you would do well to watch some early Hollywood production of the man's life (even though The Passion of the Christ is NOTHING like anything Hollywood has put out before). Jesus does say the odd line now and again but mostly this is a story about physical and mental suffering and there is no shortage of that as the film descends into depths that cinema has not treaded on before and where angles would fear to go. The film starts in the Garden of Olives following the Last Supper and Jesus' encounter with Satan (the only flaw in the film was Gibson's overuse of these pantomime type evil characters and their satanic servants, rendered needlessly in CGI and do not really fit this picture that much in the same way that Jar Jar Binks did fit well with Star Wars Episode1.). Judas Iscariot cuts a deal with the Pharisees, who then pick Jesus up, torture him and humiliate him, before sending Jesus to a Roman trial to face charges of blasphemy. There are many moments of absolute unflinching horror throughout the ordeal even before the first whip is unleashed, however these are cleanly swept aside by the little miracles that occur along the way but it would only spoil it for you to tell you what these are (a scene involving the cross being turned over is one of the most startling shots ever committed to celluloid and is sure to raise a few hairs). These little miracle moments are extremely powerful and are captured wonderfully by the glorious cinematography (The Passion of the Christ looks simply divine).All in all it is hard to call this film a movie or an art-film. It is more akin to an `out of control' dramatic crime scene recreation that we see on true life law enforcement television programs, but here it is all uncut and does not shy away from exposing us to unrestrained, raw and unlimited amounts of human hatred and aggression. Forget the whole "Anti-Semitic" lark that the media went on about. The film clearly explains that Jesus, the son of God, was God, and chose his own fate. The fact that Jews or Roman's where involved is only incidental to them being there. They are the same as anyone else who could not see with open eyes! In fact under all the blood, bruises, bone and bumps Gibson manages to leave Christ's right eye intact. He highlights this eye at times with a subtle illumination that carries an `all seeing' message with it and is another strong imagery device that is used in this production. It is the little things like this that make the film ingenious in a `clever' Spielberg sort of way. However when all is said and done Martin Scorsese' The Last Temptation of Christ can still hold its own against this offering, however this one is certainly eons more disturbing.This is not a film you will enjoy but you will be damn glad that you went to see it and certainly since the original Matrix there has not been a good soul shaker doing the rounds in a long time. Thank God for Gibson! This is Hollywood doing what it should be doing. More like this please!

$REVIEW.: The Christopher Nolan Director's Collection is one of those fabulous Blu-ray sets that very few people will actually need
 Nolan is a genius to be sure, but it's hard to imagine that most DVD collectors don't already have one or more of these terrific films


 All of the Blu-ray releases in this set are just repackaged versions of what has been available previously, there is NO new actual disc content

 Due to licensing reasons, the collection does NOT include Nolan's first film "Following" (rumored to be a potential Criterion release) or "The Prestige."  This is still an awesome group of five films, all of which look great in Blu-ray

 All of the Bonus Features are from the original releases, but I'll include them here as a reference point.1) Memento (2000):  Here you get the more comprehensive release that was put out for the film's tenth anniversary


 Bonus Features include "Remembering Memento" (a 10-year anniversary look back on the making of the film),  "Anatomy of a Scene," IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan, Audio Commentary with Director Christopher Nolan, "Memento Mori" (Short Story by Jonathan Nolan), Feature Script, Tattoo Gallery, and Leonard's Journal.2) Insomnia (2002): Bonus Features include an additional scene, Commentary by Nolan, Commentary by Hilary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematographer Wally Pfister and screenwriter Hillary Seitz
 There are four featurettes: Day for Night: Making The Movie, 180 Degrees: A Conversation with Nolan and Al Pacino, In the Fog: Cinematography and Production Design, and Eyes Wide Open: The Insomniac's World.3) Batman Begins (2005):  Bonus Features that include MTV's Tankman Begins spoof, The Journey Begins: Creative Concepts, Story Development and Casting, Shaping Mind and Body: Christian Bale's Transformation into Batman, The Tumbler: Reinvention of the Batmobile, Gotham City Rises: Production Design of Gotham City, the Batcave,  and Wayne Manor, Saving Gotham City: Development of Miniatures, CGI, and Effects, Genesis of the Bat, Confidential Files, Cape and Cowl: The New Batsuit, Path to Discovery: Filming in Iceland, and Character/Weaponry gallery.4) The Dark Knight (2008):  This is two discs with Bonus Features that include Gotham Uncovered: Creation of a Scene, BD-Live: An Interactive Gateway to Exclusive Content, Batman Tech: Gadgets and Tools, Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of The Dark Knight, Gotham Tonight: 6 episodes of Gotham Cable's premier news program, and the Galleries: The Joker Cards, Concept Art, Poster Art, Production Stills, Trailers and TV Spots.5) Inception (2010): This is two discs with Bonus Features that include an Extraction Mode Describing The Film's Signature Moments, Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious, The Cobol Job: Comic Prologue in full animation and motion, 5.1 soundtrack selections from Hans Zimmer's score, Conceptual Art, Promotional Art, and Trailer/TV Spot Galleries

I never knew any of this stuff about the things she did during WWII. She was a great patriot for sure. We weep for her love for her homeland and it's rape by the Nazis. Who cares that this film doesn't go into every single love affair she ever had or show scenes from every movie. This is the real woman beautifully presented. I wasn't even a fan till I ordered and saw "Golden Earrings" after not having seen it for many years. AND, THANKS AMAZON.  I fell in love with her and started wanting to know all I could about her. I know now that some of the "bomb" movies she made were not her choice but all Hollywood was offering her at one period of time. I know she lived in seclusion in Paris for the last l6 years of her life but the film of her last show proves that she stayed beautiful well into her 70s. You'll see in this documentary that she makes every other female movie star of her time look like a pale nothing at all. She was a better patriot than any of them born in this country and her "boys" never forgot her because of it.  This is not to be missed. I absolutely loved it.

$review_text.: Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist received a musical adaptation in 1968 by Sir Carol Reed, and who would not be better than Reed to shoot this film.  A man with films such as Fallen Idol (1948), The Third Man (1949) and Our Man in Havana (1959) on his repertoire could generate the essential gloominess of Oliver Twist.  After all, visually he displayed his cinematic eye in The Third Man where he captured the dark and ominous atmosphere of Vienna's black market and underworld.  However, musicals tend to be perky and upbeat and this would be a sacrilegious illustration of Oliver Twist, as the story highlights the unjust social system under which many children were crushed under the advancement of the Industrial Revolution.  Thus, Reed faced a predicament, as he set out to make a musical based on one of the darker pieces of classic British literature.Oliver!, as Reed's cinematic version was titled, keeps close to the original tale of the orphan Oliver Twist who grew up under the abusive circumstances at a workhouse.  Workhouses were created to handle people with minor law violations, but also destitute and orphaned children.  Within these workhouses the conditions were often harsh and brutal while the inhabitants were forced into labor, as the managers ran the workhouses as they saw fit without consideration of humanity and compassion.  The film opens with a sketch that fades into motion where a small group of young orphans tread a crude machine into movement.  The first thought that strikes the audience is slavery, which is shortly followed by the dangers of the work environment.  Oliver is one of the kids that works on the wooden grinder that processes corn by striding the machine into movement.  To fully understand the situation of Oliver Twist, one must contemplate the historical, political and religious climate of the time, as the story presents a strong social criticism concealed under the fictitious tale of Oliver.Born in the workhouse as an illegitimate child, Oliver was placed on the fringe of society due to Christian values imposed by the leaders of the Church. In the workhouse, as we already know, he was forced into labor as a youngster while the common uneducated notion was that Oliver and kids alike were a bunch of freeloaders. In addition, some decades before Oliver Twist was written, more precisely 1815, the Corn Laws were introduced into the British Commonwealth. The Corn Laws implied that until the cost of corn reached a specific amount, no foreign corn could be imported onto British soil. Consequently, the price of food went up and the people were forced to spend most of their money on food while other merchandise became unessential, as food is a requirement for survival. Thus, in the light of this information, the audience can get a more accurate view of the opening and the desperation in which many characters lived.It is a rather grim historical and political perspective that Dickens presented to the public, and in the light of the governmental abuses of children, it might be rather distressing to hear that a musical was to be made of this tragic story.  Nonetheless, Reed approached the material with tactfulness while remaining true to the darker elements of the story.  For example, shortly after the scene of the kids treading on the machine, a group of wealthy and obese gentle men inspect the Workhouse.  However, instead of joining the orphans in their meal of gruel (made by the rest of the products that they cannot sell after having ground the corn) they enter a secluded area where a feast of meat, poultry, and other delicacies awaits.  This simple presentation of the socioeconomic levels offers a direct and transparent view of how the old British society oppressed most innocents - the children - for financial gain.The story continues with Oliver meeting the Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), Fagin (Ron Moody), Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed), and many others when he escapes his socially accepted bully and owner.  Through these characters, Reed captures Dickens socioeconomic status of the environment where the children act like miniature adults, as they smoke, steal, and dress like adults.  In addition, Reed displays the darkness of the environment in an authentic manner, as everything seems to be covered by soot generated by an overpopulated London and the Industrial Revolution's wonders.  The soot also presents a symbolic analogy to the political and economical situation, as the future seems oppressively bleak due to restrictive societal rights and an increasing poverty that no one can escape.  Thus, an emerging understanding for the desperation of many surfaces, as theft, exploitation of youth, and other illegal acts are committed.  Despite an increasing understanding for the desperate, both Dickens and Reed agree in their illustrations of Oliver Twist that certain behaviors are undesirable, which come to life through the character Bill Sikes.The knighted film director Sir Carol Reed took on Charles Dickens' majestic literary piece Oliver Twist and created a musical to which many might initially have had raised their objections.  However, Reed presents a tasteful adaptation that portrays the hopelessness, desperation, and a time of need for social change through the innocent child Oliver Twist. Song and music become an additional tool for Reed to display the miserable conditions of the people of the time.  Songs like "You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two" and "Food, Glorious Food" help enhance the visual experience, as the songs provide a new perspective on the socioeconomic setting.  Ultimately, the film offers an innovative viewpoint of a serious tale that will help others to open their minds and begin to contemplate the unjust world and its many transgressions against children and others less fortunate.Oliver! was a hit when it arrived to the Oscars in 1969, as it was nominated for 11 Oscars and brought home six of them such as Best Picture and Best Director.  These Oscars by themselves should tell the audience that this film is worth seeing, but if the viewers still are hesitant about this film, I must say that Oliver! offers a terrific cinematic experience.  Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is brilliant, he did not win the Oscar for this art, as it went to Cliff Robertson in Charly (1968), but it is a performance worth experiencing.  Personally, I thought Oliver Twist (1948) by David Lean was a straw better, but then again I am not partial to musicals.  Nonetheless, Oliver! is a worthy film that is a must for any film aficionado.

$REVIEW.: This is probably going to be the strangest write up I've done. I wasn't sure what to rate the movie because I didn't care for it. While I can acknowledge the talent of the director and the actors involved (all of which deserved the awards they have recieved for this film) that doesn't make it something I would ever want to watch again and I was never once moved emotionally by this film the way I was Titanic or Forrest Gump.I still must give A Beautiful Mind high marks for being an original movie, with excellent acting and directing, but at the same time I wonder why the movie was made. The script content is average at best, focusing on a portion of John Nash's life and his single contribution to Science and Economics. Nash is an awkward person, often rude and unfriendly (I could never connect with his character), though the film his condition never changes, he just learns how to deal with it.The film fails to go into any great detail about what makes John Nash's publication signifigant enough to recieve a Nobel prize. I'm really left not knowing much of anything about Nash's contribution at the end, and that's a shame.

Because it was taped on one cassette on slow speed, I could not adjust the tracking to get decent picture quality.

$REVIEW.: First off, when you watch a film don't nitpick if it can hold a  convention, go to nitpickers.com and criticize to your heart's content. The  important thing in a film is its message, and Oliver Stone despite not  liking Nixon explains why he is actually a hero. Stone told in an interview  that he saw Nixon like he was his father.Nixon grows up and wants to  be loved, he wants to succeed, and every time he is kicked down he comes  back again. He does care about people---as his impromptu midnight visit to  the Vietnam war protestors shows. He marries an extraordinarily loving  woman in Pat Nixon, who stands by him through the years. Both are exhausted  over the years campaigning, trying to become President, yet they try one  more time and win. Where do we get such people? Do we deserve such people?  Nixon ponders as he re-enters his limo from visiting the protestotrs---was  he a part of the dragon or was the dragon using him? Certainly the latter.Stone has it right, the bottom line is that someone had to be crucified  for Vietnam.Someone had to pay. Yet, during this dark time, Nixon was  THE right man to hold our country together and masterfully pull out from  Vietnam and outflank the Soviets with opening talks with the Red Chinese.  Only Cold Warrior Nixon could have pulled it off. And Stone definately  anti-Nixon has to show this, because Stone has integrity. And this is  really what happened to Nixon, he took &quot;the fall&quot; for Vietnam,  and its the American people who are to blame for this. Just as they let  their President get killed (JFK) and the guilty getting away, they let the  mob mentality ruin Nixon.The scene where Nixon asks Kissinger to come  and pray with him is phenomenal and shows the humanity of Nixon who I think  God rewarded for this.As the film is ending, I wish Stone would let  Nixon finish his farewell speech where he admits that if you hate you only  destroy yourself and that he has seen many deep valleys but you never know  the true value of the highpoints without the humility of the low points;  beautiful stuff, should be left as is.Anyway---the Nixon story does NOT  end! Nixon recovers, writes books, helps craft foreign policy ideas for  making Russia democratic---did America deserve such a great leader like  Nixon? He gave his all, warts and all for us, and our &quot;thank-you&quot;  is to make him the fall guy for our war. I'm not sure if Nixon fessed up to  Watergate up front that the American people would have forgiven him, as  Stone alludes with the character played by James Woods because they wanted  someone to pay publicly for Vietnam. Interesting idea, though.Get this  video, watch it as a human being and not a nitpicker, put yourself in his  shoes, empathize with the Nixon's and you will see that true greatness is  who you are when you have fallen and what you do NEXT. An inspiring film.

$REVIEW.: If I'm doing a chore that I don't really want to devote my mind to or if I'm just looking for a pleasant way to spend a rather boring afternoon, &quot;Soapdish,&quot; with its endless cast of Oscar winners and nominees, is the movie I watch.Now, when I first saw it in theaters when I was around 14 or so, I was not as big a fan of it because I wasn't as big of a soap watcher. As I've seen more of the soaps and their surrounding culture that this film lampoons so closely, I find the humor to be spot on.At this point, I've seen the film so many times that I can recite Celeste's speech about giving up her baby by heart. I know how many people Montana Moorehead attempts to seduce and how many she succeeds in seducing. I know that the producer David is a sniveling pig opportunist who embraces every twist that manages to work in his favor.The script is hysterical. Line after line is quotable. And though I wouldn't call it a great movie, it's certainly an immense amount of good fun.And the cast is top-notch, as well. At this point, the Oscar nominees and winners in the cast are:  Cathy Moriarty, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Kline and Sally Field. The film also features funny appearances from notables like Garry Marshall, Teri Hatcher, Costas Mandylor and Carrie Fisher. Oh, and to show its daytime TV savvy, Finola Hughes (&quot;All My Children&quot;), Stephen Nichols (&quot;General Hospital&quot;), John Tesh (late of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;) and Leeza Gibbons also make appearances.

$REVIEW.: This movie rips into you (if you are one of those people that cries easily). I loved the artistic qualities (her paintings coming to life). This movie had all the makings of being perfect, until the end. I think someone got confused about how it should end. Or maybe they decided to lighten it up and give it a happier ending. The main character was meant to be a tragic person. It didn't make sense that she should try life again. Overall, the movie was pretty good and I recommend owning it.

$review_text.: Comparisons and contrasts with the 1957 film version of the Elmore Leonard short story are probably inevitable but I prefer to focus entirely on this film co-starring Christian Bale (as Dan Evans in the Van Heflin role, for those who remember) and Russell Crowe (as Ben Wade in the Glenn Ford role).  Their acting is superb throughout the film and special note should also be made of Ben Foster's brilliant portrayal of Charlie Prince, the evil and violent second-in-command of Wade's gang that, in recent years, has robbed several dozen trains and Butterfield Line stagecoaches that the Pinkerton Company has been paid substantial fees to protect. Also noteworthy are Logan Lerman's portrayal of Evans' older son, William, and Peter Fonda's portrayal of Byron McElroy who seeks personal vengeance for reasons best revealed in the film.As it begins, Evans, his wife, and two sons are struggling to survive. He has a permanent disability from his service in the Union army during the Civil War and is destitute...and desperate to save his small ranch as well as regain the respect of his sons, especially William's.Others have their reasons for admiring this film. Here are a few of mine. First, none of the frequent, extensive, and often sudden violence is gratuitous.  For the Wade gang and their Pinkerton adversaries, violence is a career; for most of the other characters, it is a given in their way of life. Whatever the situation, violence is seamlessly integrated within the development of the plot, as are the cinematography and the musical score. I also appreciate the fact that director James Mangold makes no effort to idealize the "Old West" by including church socials, ballads sung around a camp fire, buying "sody pop" and gingham dresses for adorable children, etc.  He leaves no doubt that the world portrayed in this film is harsh, often brutal, and a challenge to survive that many cannot overcome.Finally, I admire how Mangold works with this cast to suggest at least some degree of complexity in the character and personalities of the main characters. Ben Wade is a case in point, killing whenever he sees the purpose or is so inclined but he also has impressive knowledge of the Holy Scripture and displays artistic talent; he also has a sharp wit and a playful sense of humor. Over time, Dan Evans proves to be far more thoughtful and sensitive than he first seems. He will kill Wade if he must but prefers to earn his fee for keeping him alive and then getting him on the 3:10 the train. His is a journey of self-discovery while being abandoned by everyone except his son William. He eventually realizes that his leg can never he healed but his self-respect can be restored. As I observed the interaction between Wade and Evans, I recalled other Elmore Leonard characters who also remind us that human beings are never as pure or as evil as they may seem.More quibbles than complaints, I think that Gretchen Mol (portraying Dan Evans' wife Alice) adds little to the plot's development because the character herself is so under-developed in the few scenes in which she appears. That is not true of comparable spouses in High Noon (Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane) and Shane (Jean Arthur as Marian Starrett). Also, I don't know what to make of Emmy Nelson, a bartending prostitute with whom Wade has a brief reunion. As portrayed by the exceptionally lovely and stylishly dressed Vinessa Shaw, she seems totally out-of-place in such a hellhole western town. In a dramatic film such as this, plausibility of resolution is imperative. In my opinion, the final scenes after the train to Yuma  arrives are facile but not entirely believable. That's all I care to say about them. Let those who have yet to see the film decide for themselves.Because of the quibbles cited, I do not consider this film a "classic" western  (e.g. the aforementioned High Noon and Shane as well as My Darling Clementine, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider, The Stalking Moon, Unforgiven, The Virginian, and The Wild Bunch) but it is certainly well-constructed and consistently engaging. With few exceptions, the acting is crisp and nuanced. I look forward to purchasing the DVD as soon as one is available and seeing it again from time to time, as I now do with several other personal favorites.

$REVIEW.: Really enjoyed this movie overall, telling a tale of the United States Coast Guard was enlightening.  They expose much in the way of the life of a rescue swimmer, and really what the USCG is all about.  Ashton Kutcher is well-chosen in the role he plays as the competitive young adult just beginning in his training and career as a rescue swimmer.  Special Features on this flick are great to watch, educational.  Alternate ending is available in the special features, which I must admit I preferred over the one they chose for the big screen.  Very Kevin Costner-ish.  Though he is a superb actor, there is a certain hero-like quality that he always wants to impress upon you in his movies, which I don't care for.  Regardless, I still recommend this movie, well-made and obvious that there was a lot put into the authenticity of it.  Watch it at least once.

$REVIEW.: No one really thought Terminator 3 would be made. Sure, the title &quot;Rise of the Machines&quot; has been tossed around since at least 1997, but with Cameron's near-perfect T2 and the franchise being more than a decade old, most fans didn't give any serious consideration to a third installment. But someone decided to go ahead and make T3 anyway.I went into T3 with low expectations. All the comments I'd heard on the movie pinned it as average to slightly above-average at best. The director was so-so, the running time was way under T2, only Arnold chose to return, and the box office reciepts weren't that great. And sure enough most of the movie matched those expectations. Fun action, but a lot of re-hashing of what had been done in the first two movies. Minimal character development, just enough to make the viewer give a damn about the heroes. Competent direction, but everything seemed to operate on such a small scale, considering that this was supposed to be the last hours before judgement day.So far, the movie was a decent popcorn flick that was worth my money and thankfully didn't manage to embarass the legacy of the movies before it.Then the final few minutes of the movie rolled, and everything changed. I don't know how I managed to not spoil the ending for myself, considering all the reviews I read, but I was totally blown away. Yeah, I heard they were leaving room for a Terminator 4, but I didn't expect it to happen this way. Suddenly, the small scale of the movie seems to make sense, as if it's all clever misdirection of some sort. T3 could've worked a lot better with a more stylistic director and a slightly longer running time, but as it stands, its ending makes it a more-than-worthy entry in the franchise. Before, I dreaded another installment. Now, I'm looking forward to it.WB's treatment of T3 on DVD is something of a disappointment. Audio/visual is very good, and thankfully the movie comes in a keepcase instead of a snapper, but the supplements are just there to take up space. There's a good deleted scene that must be watched by all fans, and a few decent featurettes, but most of the bonus material is promotional in nature. Given how loaded the past Terminator discs have been, T3 simply doesn't compare.T3 is a great popcorn movie with a jaw-dropping ending. WB needs to learn how to make a decent 2-disc special edition of its summer movies. 4 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Wow...just, Wow

$REVIEW.: This Blu-ray played great (in 2D) in my PC. So, if you do not have a 3D system, you'll still be able to watch it in 2D. The resolution is much clearer than DVD, but not as detailed as full 1080P hi-def. Overall, most girls are fairly attractive amateur models. You'll make your own choice of which model is the most attractive. The models are the Real Deal! Some models have a slightly flabby tummy. Some have stretch marks and surgical scars. Some have noticeable cellulite on thighs and buttocks. They are as Real as the girls that you might see (glance or Stare) in bikinis in your real life. The Blu-ray is Rated PG, so most bikinis are not as revealing as you might expect or want. The bikini tops adequately cover the breasts. So, don't expect to see any nipple slips. The bikini bottoms adequately cover from front to back. The most revealing bikini bottoms are the G-string/thong type. But, they are not the very thin (butt floss) string type. They are the much wider string type that covers much more. So, when the models are posing and leaning backward or forward, you do not see their &#34;where the sun don't shine&#34; parts. Plus, when the camera has zoomed extremely close to the model's &#34;privates&#34;, the scene is cut to another scene. Maybe they did this to keep the PG Rating. Overall, this Blu-ray disc is great to watch. There'll be at least one girl that you are going to like! I have bought 3D Bikini Beach Babes Issue 2 to Issue 5 Blu-rays each for about $7 shipping included. At that price, I'll buy Issue 1 so that I can complete the entire 5 Issue Collection.

 Still, it is a very satisfying movie, especially knowing that it is based on a real group of South Bronx grade school kids


 On the other hand, if after watching the movie you learn that the kids are still losers, you would feel cheated, so being predictable isn't really that bad.The unusual quality of the movie is that it is focused on chess, somewhat unusual for a movie


 [See also the Wonderworks program, 'The Mighty Pawns,' 'The Luzhin Defence,' and the comedy, 'Hatley High,']  We graded the movie down slightly because there are a few swear words, once by the teacher, but otherwise only from the junkies and losers with whom the kids have to deal
 If you like chess, you'll probably like this movie
 Even if you don't understand chess, you'll be glad you watched it, especially when reading the things the kids wrote about how chess changed their lives.

$review_text.: FIVE EASY PIECES is a magnificent film that is extremely moving
 While it might be considered a "road film" of the 1970s, it is anything but a typical one


 For starters, the story begins long after Bobby Dupea (Jack Nicholson) set out on the road from home
 The audience, thus, is unsure from the beginning how (and why) Dupea has ended up where he is


 We find him "settled" in a hick town, working in an oil field, in a relationship with an ignorant waitress, spending most of his time drinking, gambling, and sleeping around

 He does not love his girlfriend and the audience wonders why he is with her, as we see him oscillate between abusively insulting her and running back to her

 He later tells her, "You know...If you wouldn't open your mouth, everything would be just fine."  This telling comment, while delivered as a casual joke, cuts right to the heart of Dupea's emotions


 We can tell that his girlfriend, despite his abuse and drinking, is not "good enough" for him, though we don't know why.Slowly, we begin to see Dupea's background unfold


 In a memorable scene during a traffic jam, Dupea jumps up into the back of a truck, pulls some covers away from a piano, and begins to play classical music

 We learn that Dupea was once a talented pianist, a man who has left his lifestyle, training, and cultural background behind and traded it in for his life of loose women, his clingy girlfriend, and booze

 Upon finding out that his father is sick and dying, the true "road movie" portion of the film begins

 But unlike the story of a man running from his past, Dupea is forced to run back home after several years of wandering.I don't want to spoil the film or tell you too much about the emotional final half of the film, spent at home reconnecting with Dupea's family and former life

 I will simply say that we finally get to see Dupea's character unfold, revealing answers to his apparent disgust at himself, his life, and his pregnant girlfriend
 His pilgrimage in the film forces him to confront his past in a way that he probably never has

 There are a few heart-wrenching scenes, in particular, in which Dupea is forced to confront his father and his girlfriend (and his feelings towards both of them)

 These scenes alone make FIVE EASY PIECES worth watching.Jack Nicholson's performance is simply amazing in this film
 In 1970, he was definitely at the height of his game, and his game is very good
 Nicholson manages to breathe life and complexity into Dupea, a character who does not come of with our full approval, nor our total disapproval
 Ultimately, we get the perfect portrait of a man who is on the run from his past

 But, unlike most other characters that "light out for the West," Dupea is not searching for anything-he's just running from things that are getting bad


 I highly recommend FIVE EASY PIECES to anyone, particularly to those who enjoy 1970s film as much as I do

 Dupea (and Jack Nicholson's performance) is one of the most memorable characters ever brought to film and one that you just have to meet for yourself.

Run, no wait..

get in a car, a fast car, and drive as fast as you can- ignoring all traffic signs and signals- away from this movie

It's terrible mix of pure treacle and bitter hostility
Julianne Moore plays a saint -nay- A GOD, who takes care of, I dunno, 100 kids? And she's as warm and kind and intelligent and loving and patient, etc., as any ascended being would be

Woody Harrelson plays..


I don't even know


Knowing one of the kids wrote this is creepy because Woody's character, the father, is an angry, bitter drunk who is about as emotionally mature as your average 10 year old, and all the kids hate him


But then occasionally he has to come groveling for forgiveness and I think it's intended to elicit some sympathy, but it's so slapped on it seems pretty clear the author would have just preferred to damn the father altogether


Cree-py.And that's the thing, this movie isn't even honest


Moore's character at some point says "I'm not a saint"


Yeah, right! That's just bad filmmaking


This movie is nothing but the 90 minute beatification of Moore's character (with some serious damning of the father thrown in), and rather than show the character as a real person, the character has to tell us she's a real person
Show, don't tell


Every second the woman is on screen she's second only to Jesus

When she said that "saint" line I laughed out loud because it was so ridiculous.This is a lousy movie


It's gonna appeal to anyone who loves blunt treacle, but if you're a fan of realistic characters, effective pacing and plotting, stay away.

$REVIEW.: This movie is ridiculous beyong words.  To begin with, the plot might justify a brief hour and a half to 2 hour film, but nothing like this  15 hour (feels like it, really) snooze-fest.  It's very simple, and has been done thousands of times much better.  Two people fall in love but for some reason they can't get together or they wouldn't still be in love if they did (I only saw it two weeks ago and already I can't remember).  Then there is the dialogue, which is mostly schmaltzy and overly melodramatic, and is completely mangled by most of the actors.  Especially annoying is Joanne Woodwards voice-over narration, which chirps up whenever the music swells to tell you a) what just happened (which you know if you've been paying attention at all) b) what everyone's thinking about (which you know because most of the performances are so cartoonish) and c) what the fallout will be (which you don't need to know because they'll show you the scene about it later).  Daniel Day-Lewis looks grumpy most of the time, whereas Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably radiant, but says most of her lines in a breathless whisper with her eyes unfocused, gazing dreamily at the wall.  In the supporting cast, Scorcese has a miniature stable of British actors in near-cameos.  Unlike their American counterparts, they look comfortable and relaxed doing a period peice, but the dialect coach seems to have them all doing ridiculously exagerrated American accents.  Basically, had the Brits made this movie, it might have been a lot better, because they do enough costume dramas to know not to get caught up lingering on the pretty sets.  So I'm giving the film one star for itself, and one for Winona Ryder, as the only cast member who doesn't look like a rank amateur, despite being the youngest person there.

$review_text.: For me, each genre of film has its own rating scale, so when I see a film like this "teen school romance comedy", I already know how it's going to begin and end. 'Sorority Boys' will not win points for originality, but the cast's enthusiasm more than makes up for it. Harland Williams is just funny to look at and while the film loses steam halfway through, it is very funny for the first hour and finishes the way we expect it to.The film gets a boost from some cameos by Animal House Alumni and Bosom Buddies cast members too. The guys in drag are funny to look at and they pull it off despite their odd appearance. If you like these types of films this is certainly worth seeing and if you are not into this stuff, why are you reading this? ;-D

$review_text.: This is a thriller that has an intriguing plot. A beautiful fiddler, Emma Brody, blind since the age of eight, gets a corneal transplant twenty years after the domestic tragedy that robbed her of her eyesight. She then regains her eyesight, in a manner of speaking. It is a work in progress, and she is only able to see shadowy or distorted images. She also suffers from some sort of delayed or retrograde reaction to what she sees. So, images she sees today are really things that she may have seen the day before. This becomes particularly problematic or  disconcerting when she becomes the only witness to have seen a killer shortly after a murder took place in her apartment building.Naturally, the police are a little skeptical about her value as a witness. Having been blind for so long, however, her olfactory ability is heightened, and she is able to provide another valuable clue as to the killer. This becomes important, as the killer strikes again and again. The Detective assigned to the case, John Hallstrom, the precinct's self-proclaimed lady killer, becomes smitten with her, much to his surprise, as he has tended to be a love 'em and leave 'em type of guy. She, in turn, bitter because it was her mother who had blinded her, is initially unreceptive to his charms. When each is willing to drop their cynical, public personas, they find that their inner selves mesh, and they fall in love. Unfortunately, Emma is in acute danger, as the killer has a definite agenda, and Emma appears to be at the top of his list.Madeleine Stowe is excellent as the beautiful Emma, giving her a hard-edged exterior while not losing her vulnerability. Aidan Quinn seems a little bit like a fish out of water as the rude, crude, and lewd Detective Hallstrom. It is only when  his character falls in love with Emma, that Quinn seems to come alive in the part and feel comfortable. It is then that he hits his stride. The love scenes are passionate and inspired.The rest of the cast gives competent performances, but the film never hits the level of suspense that one anticipates. The serial killer is a murky character whose raison d'etre is ultimately skimmed over. The sub-plot involving a potential romance between Emma and her eye surgeon sort of collapses onto itself, leaving the viewer to wonder why it was interjected into the story in the first place. Moreover, it is a major ethical breach for a detective to become intimately involved in a love affair with a witness in a case being investigated by that detective. Notwithstanding some of these short comings, however, it is still interesting enough film to warrant a rental, if not an actual purchase.

$REVIEW.: In this installment of the Jesse Stone series, Tom Selleck reprises his role as the multi-faceted Police Chief of the small town of Paradise, MA. This time around, Stone is visiting his pal, State Homicide Commander Healy [Stephen McHattie] and whilst on a sort of stakeout, both are shot. Stone later investigates whilst Healy recuperates in hospital, and finds that the shooting and the stakeout are not connected. As is typical in the Jesse Stone series, there is more than one story arc. Stone returns to Paradise to find his position as Police Chief threatened by a town councilman.My favorite in the series is Stone Cold, but the other stories are just as engaging, and what elevates this series from the average made-for-TV movie is the intelligent writing, beautiful cinematography and of course, Tom Selleck's charismatic portrayal of the tormented Police Chief. Recommended to fans of Selleck, mysteries, and police procedurals.
$review_summary.: A highly-addictive series!

$REVIEW.: Nothing can match 70's horror; the US & the rest of the world gave birth to some of the best horror films ever produced during the era of LSD, Charles Manson, and disco.  Brilliant films such as "The Omen", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and international contributions from mastermind Argento such as "Deep Red" and "The Bird With The Crystal Plumage" really defined and shaped horror movies for years to come. Many of these terrifying films remain unprecedented.  "Who Can Kill A Child" may not be an absolute masterpiece, but for anyone looking to discover a terrific gem of a thriller, this one definitely is worth a look.  Well photographed, nicely scored, and well acted, "Child" avoids many of the "evil child" pitfalls that often plague the genre; mainly bad child actors with too much screen time.  The film is smart to focus on heavy atmosphere and mood and the story itself intrigues without giving too much away. There's some true nastiness to the film, great settings, and a genuine eeriness and sense of dread pervasive through out.  Check it out.

$REVIEW.: To me, this basically seemed like a film contrived to showcase a nude Elizabeth Berkley to sell tickets and DVDs. I guess it worked with me, as I could not resist seeing the class president from Saved By The Bell in her birthday suit. There was some plot beyond that, but I think that, for men at least, the only real memories of this will be the showgirls. To be fair, that is the title of it, and that is what it is about.

$REVIEW.: The Passport editions of ten of the East Side Kids movies is a cheap way to get to know one of the fun series of the early 1940's.  Cheap is in both senses.I had already collected a set of Alpha Video and Platinum Disc Corporation editions but had hoped to find editions with better picture and sound quality.  Passport didn't do it.Only occasionally would the quality even equal that of Alpha or Platinum.  Usually the quality was markedly worse.  There was even missing footage.  For example, the opening scene of "Bowery Blitzkrieg" on Alpha and Platinum has Danny (Bobby Jordan) drilling his economics lesson while using a punching bag.  Passport starts the movie from a later scene, Muggs (Leo Gorcey) bullying the bad guy.Passport puts a faint "Bowery Boys / East Side Kids" logo in the lower-right corner throughout.  The other two editions do not do this.No edition has any meaningful extras.  I have little hope these films will be cleaned up, Criterion style.Alpha Video tends to have the best quality on its single-film DVD's, but Platinum's four-paks come close and are more cost-effective.  Passport runs last on all counts.

$REVIEW.: After waiting for months for the DVD to be released, I finally got it. It pails in comparesion to the first Shrek DVD.The movie is still good. Hence the two stars. It's a great fairytale, lots of laughs and impressive drawing and sceneries.But the ONE DVD (so used to an additional DVD with extras and lots of details) looks like sub-par work. It's clearly mainly there for merchendising - not for us collectors.1) The DVD locks the first 5-10 minutes with previews. For this ONE reason I'm returning the disk. I do not wish to own nor pay to watch commercials. This might be ok for rentals (I usually return them too if I cannot skip it) but not for collector buy DVDs.2) The main menu is 9 little pictures. The original DVD had donkey jumping around, sound bites and funny things going on, nomatter what page you were on. That's all gone.3) The Tech of Shrek is a promotional video for Dreamworks. There's NOTHING that goes behind how they did any scene or the general process of going from idea to the final rendering. The "tech" is the use of a few buzz-words.4) The "goofs" are not commented. It would be nice to know what happend, and why this particular error is funny. Some of them are just not funny in my oppinion.5) The Kid section is for larger kids. Be ware!  No 8 year old is going to be able to "save fiona" as she'll have to read at a 5th grade level to be able to understand and comprehend.6) The juke-box is really badly implemented. You basicly just index into a given bookmark on the DVD, and have to push menu to get back to the jukebox. If you don't, the movie just continues as normal.7) Where's the interviews or other funny stuff that in #1 made kids really like the characters?In general not even close to the experience we were given with the original DVDs.  The shrek2.com is much better though. If you have kids, let them play around there - it's going to give them more fun than anything on the DVD.Dreamworks - I'm very disappointed.

$REVIEW.: READY is pure entertainment with lots of fun, comedy and action. Salman Khan is effortless in his role as Prem and he looked like he was having fun making this movie as there was a classic scene( plucked out of his other blockbuster movie) done tongue-in-cheek! All the songs were fabulous and absolutely addictive, especially Character Deela and Dinka Chika. The rest of the cast were great in their respective roles but I think this movie sells by the sheer force of Salman Khan's name alone,never mind his superb acting and charm! While I find this movie wasn't as great as DABANGG,which I think it's pretty hard to beat,it's still a very enjoyable and watchable movie and definitely worth adding to your collection. Some jokes could go over your head if you're not familiar with some past Bollywood movies or the Indian culture for that matter as I was with a particular scene, with Prem making reference to almond tea??? in context with his bride to his father - just couldn't get that one! Anyway, enjoy this movie with some tandoori chicken.....

$review_text.: In 1994, three teenagers in West Memphis, Arkansas were accused and convicted of murdering three 8-year-old boys. These events were captured from the beginning by documentary filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky and released in 1996 as Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. The documentary and the 2000 follow-up Paradise Lost 2: Revelations made a compelling case that they were innocent and fifteen years since the story was told, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory brings a bittersweet close to the saga.Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley (known collectively as the West Memphis Three) spent over 18 years in prison for murdering Steve Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore, a crime they claim they didn't commit. The "Free the West Memphis 3" movement enjoyed celebrity support, with some actually paying for the three's legal proceedings. Berlinger and Sinofsky initially travelled to West Memphis to follow the trial, believing the three were guilty. What they caught on film stunned them and that first documentary is credited with getting people involved in helping free the three men. This is the third and final (?) film in the series. It was already completed when the three men were surprisingly freed last August and the directors quickly returned to the editing room to give the film an ending with more finality. This surprising epilogue added 12 minutes or so.The doc is separated into three chapters (Past is Prologue, What's Old is New, and All Means All) and an epilogue. If you have not seen the previous two, there is no need, but it does make the end of the journey seem more extraordinary. Aside from bringing to light all of the newfound information, there's a recap of the entire case. The horrifying opening is set to Metallica's atmospheric "Sanitarium," while it goes over the crime scene video and summarizes the case, mixing old and new interviews. This includes previously unseen courtroom footage and depositions, as well as major details like Misskelley's controversial confession that provided the first link in a chain of events leading to their conviction.The chief investigator of the case disputes their innocence and offers those who believe in it to look at what wasn't shown in the documentaries. He begrudgingly admits that it's all public record, but seems to assume that all opinions are based solely on the films. We're also shown footage of celebrities like Johnny Depp, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks voicing their support.Most importantly, the film continues its investigation into whether the three received a fair trial, as well as the bias that may have hindered their release. The judge who heard their appeals and denied all of them presided over their original trials. During the original trial, a defense lawyer pointed out that a testifying occult expert lacked the education necessary to be labeled an "expert." The judge's response, few would argue, is ridiculous.There are new interviews with the victims' families, some of whom are still skeptical about the public support and believe, without a doubt, that the right men are in prison. In fact, Todd and Dana Moore wrote a letter to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to request the film be removed from consideration. One parent isn't skeptical however and that may be the documentary's biggest surprise.In the two previous docs, one man was honed in on and became a prime suspect in the court of public opinion. His passionate, over-the-top declarations of hatred for the three men and the mysterious coincidences in his life around the time of the murders didn't help. This man is John Mark Byers, who now has "Free WM3" stickers adorning his truck and admits he "lead the bandwagon" when it came to believing the three boys were guilty. I was aware of Byers' newfound convictions, but to actually see him proclaim their innocence and read a letter he received from Damien Echols (who publicly stated that he believed Byers to be the killer) is quite surreal. He's much more sedate now too, but no less passionate about their innocence than he was their guilt. Thankfully, he's less over-the-top. The negative focus on a parent has not ended with Byers, but instead directed its gaze towards another stepfather.The center of attention is now Terry Hobbs, whom Natalie Maines publicly accused of murdering the three boys. Hobbs sued Maines and videos of his deposition are included here. Hobbs is a man of contradictions. His alibi for the night the three children disappeared has been disputed, he claims not to be violent but it's revealed that he hit his wife and shot her brother. He claims not to have seen his son that fateful day, but a neighbor, who was never questioned by police and was unaware of his claims, says she saw him with the three boys on the day they went missing. Most damning is that a hair was found on one of the shoelaces used to tie the boys and it could match Hobbs.Certainly, the documentary railroads Hobbs in the same way West Memphis railroaded the WM3 and the previous documentaries railroaded Byers. It paints Hobbs in an unfavorable, dishonest light and many will walk away with the belief of his guilt...Just as they did Byers. In his interview footage he often seems weary and cynical of the situation, making this whole ordeal unfortunate if he's truly innocent.John Mark Byers certainly believes he may be guilty and in a display that suggests more intelligence than we've seen before, he holds up a homemade sign presenting evidence of Hobbs' guilt and his innocence. The former side is much heavier on facts than the latter. He explains his case with passion and (maybe unintentional) humor, but it's an undeniably strong, but mostly circumstantial, case.While, arguably, more people believe the West Memphis Three are innocent than guilty, there have been complaints that these documentaries are biased in their favor. Berlinger and Sinofsky deny the notion, saying they began the project convinced of their guilt. Almost any documentary will contain bias, so it's certainly possible that these films pass over certain information. With all of the facts a matter of public record, you should certainly form an educated opinion by doing some reading instead of basing all your views on what you see here. However, with this closing chapter in the saga, it's clear that these documentaries make a more compelling case than one based on simple guilt or innocence.In the United States, anyone accused of a crime must be given the right to a fair trial. In some situations, killers with strong DNA evidence implicating them have been released on the basis of a mistrial. No one likes seeing a killer walk, but it's great that we live in a country that affords us the privilege of proving our case without bias and beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley are innocent becomes irrelevant in light of the facts.Regardless of their guilt or innocence, these men should never have been imprisoned based on the juror misconduct, unreliable witnesses', shoddy detective work, misinterpretation of evidence, and witch-hunt climate that took place at their trials. Three months before new evidentiary hearings were to begin; the state of Arkansas released these men by allowing them to enter Alford pleas, a rare legal move where the accused maintains their innocence while entering a guilty plea.This freed the three after 18 years of imprisonment, while freeing the state of Arkansas from admitting they were wrong, behind held responsible in court, or delivering the real killer. Baldwin claims he didn't want to accept the deal and did so only because of Echols' death sentence. The film closes with Baldwin saying "this isn't justice."During the press conference immediately following their release, Echols' lawyer says that the state of Arkansas admitted the WM3 were innocent by allowing them to Alford pleas. Three months before an evidentiary hearing (that would be the men's last legal option), they allowed them to walk in a way that kept them from being sanctioned. It's hard not to buy into this; why would Arkansas let three men walk if they were so convinced that they were guilty of brutally murdering three children?These films were paramount in gaining attention and support for the West Memphis 3 and are evidence of what a powerful medium the documentary can be. This makes Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory a powerful cinematic statement and a triumphant, but imperfect end to the trilogy. The documentary is just as fascinating and enlightening as the previous two, only growing dull when the film begins covering information you may already be aware of. The triumph and imperfection also applies to the true end to their story, although if whoever is responsible for the murders is caught, there may be more to look at.This may be the most poignant and, ultimately powerful documentary in the trilogy because it finally concludes a story many have followed for sixteen years or more. I'd make a case that the Paradise Lost trilogy as a whole makes for one of the most compelling and important documents in cinematic history. These films changed everything for these three men. Those few still convinced of their guilt won't find much to enjoy here, but those who have followed this story for years will rejoice and perhaps even shed a tear. This is a phenomenal closing chapter and a terrific documentary, one of the best documentaries and one of the best films of last year.GRADE: A-

Nonetheless, the film is still incredible and very incredible. Angelina Joie received an Academy Award for her performance, well deserved.The events took place in Wineville, CA. (later renamed Mira Loma to escape the notoriety that ensued) and involved three proven murders by a Canadian family led by a child abuser, possibly as many as 20. Christine Collins' son was one of the three. The perpetrators were from Canada, and all caught. The LAPD mistakenly asserted that a runaway found in Iowa was her son - Collins vehemently protested, noting important physical differences. LAPD Captain Jones responds by having her committed to a mental hospital; after her release Collins wins a lawsuit against Jones and is awarded $10,800, but he never pays. The adult male perpetrator is executed.

$REVIEW.: I had very low expectations of this one, but it managed to surprise with me reasonably good acting.This film features your stock megalomanic somewhere out in the desert, in a Victorian house (naturally), who has plans to take over the world by means of an invisible army.  How he wants to get the army to do his bidding is anybody's guess.  The megalomanic guy's crew is:  a beautiful assistant, the scientist, a guard, and the safe-cracker who they just sprung from prison (he looks and sounds a bit like Humphrey Bogart at times).  The madman is blackmailing a scientist (who incidentally used to work for the Third Reich) by holding his daughter hostage.The prison escape scene when they are stopped by the cops at a road block is hilarious.  "Oh your husband has no ID?  No problem, m'am, we surely wouldn't want to wake up your intoxicated husband, that would be very rude of us.  We'll just go on looking for the escaped convict.  Have a nice day. "There are a few things that don't add up, such as why this sizzling hot lady is working for an evil mastermind out in the countryside?  Can't she find a modeling job in the city somewhere?  And why does she fall for the thuggish safe-cracker who is never nice to her at all?As someone else pointed out, the fight scene is truly laughable.  It looks like a couple of teenage girls fighting.  Also, when the whole place blows up and supposedly takes half the county with it, how does the professor manage to survive even though he was just outside the house at the time?I loved the 'special effects' of invisibility when the ray starts to wear off.  The safe-crackers body appears, then just his head, then his whole body. Embarrassing, especially since he's in the process of robbing a bank.Okay, I've told you mostly about the funny stuff, but it's really not bad at all.  If you're a fan of B-movies, you'll find this one entertaining.  And if you don't like it, then you have wasted nothing more than a mere 58 minutes of your time.

This movie is worth seeing just for the beautiful scenes of the islands...But the performances of Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski turns this into a fabulous song fest.Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are hilarious as contenders for "father", along with Stellan Skarsgard.While the story may seem trite -- love wins out, etc. -- the gorgeous ABBA tunes sweep across the beautiful settings, creating a crescendo of glory as the characters bask in the beauty of life and nature.

$REVIEW.: At this point, there is not much of a difference between Eli Roth and Hot Topic: one is hawking contrived fashions for delusional mall-walkers to look 'cool' in; the other is hawking contrived 'horror' said mall-walkers can brag to their friends about 'enduring.' Few things made me feel as good as watching the internet-leaked workprint of this dud before I blindly went to waste my money on it in theaters. I hated the original "Hostel" (as well as Roth's maiden excretory voyage, "Cabin Fever"), but being optimistic about a director's ability to hone/improve his craft over time (heck, Rob Zombie is a testament to this), decided to give "Part II" a shot...unfortunely, even 'stealing' a screening of the movie made me seethe with anger. A carbon copy of the original "Hostel," this follow-up is just more of the same, inducing more yawns than scares; even the scattered handful of violent moments are really only 'shocking' within the context of the film's R rating (and honestly, decades-old stuff like "The New York Ripper" and "Salo" goes MUCH further in bloodshed than this washout). The characters (oooo, GIRLS this time!) and pacing couldn't be less interesting; the writing is abysmal--Roth must have been as bored scripting this as I was watching it, with the sole intention of redeeming the whole thing through his prissy display of gore. The whole "Hostel" enterprise has rightly become a laughingstock among in-the-know horror fans, with Roth the Clown Prince of the genre.

$review_text.: In Body Double, director Brian DePalma pays homage to the Alfred Hitchcock movies Vertigo and Rear Window, adding a few grotesque touches all his own. Craig Wasson plays Jake, a struggling actor who keeps losing jobs because of his claustrophobia. To make matters worse, his girlfriend has walked out on him, so he has no place to sleep. His pal offers him the use of his apartment for the evening. The apartment happens to be equipped with a huge picture window and telescope, enabling him to spy on his beautiful neighbor Gloria (Deborah Shelton) while she undresses. Jake then meets a porn star (Melanie Griffith) who is enmeshed in the unfolding mystery.Body Double is a great &#34;Peeping Tom&#34; film starring Craig Wasson (Nightmare on Elm Street 3). There is roughly an hour of bonus content (almost all from the DVD release). However, there are no audio commentaries or deleted scenes. The only new extra here is the isolated score by Pino Donaggio. An eight-page booklet is also included. This is the limited edition Blu-ray (3000 units) that is now out of print. It is pricey at $50 (though it has sold for up to $100) so I must rate the film 4 stars but this package only 3 stars. Despite no remastering being performed, this Blu-ray is the best Body Double has ever looked or sounded although neither the picture or audio quality is superb.Twilight Time 2013 Press Release: &#34;Sony's technical services and mastering department have informed us that the stunning new transfer of Brian De Palma's BODY DOUBLE (1984) has been completed, and has been personally supervised by veteran cinematographer Stephen H. Burum. However, Mr. Burum has apparently revisited the color timing of certain scenes, so sections of the film may look different to previous home-video incarnations.&#34;Video Codec: MPEG-4 AVC/1080p | Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0Subtitles: English SDHSpecial Features: &#34;The Seduction&#34; featurette, &#34;The Setup&#34; featurette, &#34;The Mystery&#34; featurette, &#34;The Controversy&#34; featurette, Isolated Score

$review_text.: Everybody is familiar with John Wayne's 1969 "True Grit" and people may be tempted to compare the Jeff Bridges/Coen Brothers/new "True Grit" but you can't say one version is better than the other, they're different, different visions for different times."True Grit" (either version of the movie) follows Charles Portis'True Gritnovel pretty closely. It's still the story of 14 year old Mattie Ross who's father was murdered and she hires federal marshall, Rooster Cogburn to bring the man who murdered her father to justice. And make no mistake about it, Mattie is out for vengeance against Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), given her choice of marshalls she chooses the one most likely to kill, Cogburn only brings his man in alive accidentally.In the 1969 version you were aware you were watching a John Wayne movie, this "True Grit" is a western. Jeff Bridges submerges into Cogburn, his hair is dirty, he has the broken blood vessels in his face of a man who's drunk too much whisky, and Cogburn not only has trail dust on him, he's caked in the mud and blood of the trail. Hailee Steinfeld looks every bit of Mattie's 14 years and while her acumen about business matters is present we also see a girl thrown into a violent world she's not used to, Steinfeld's reactions are authentic to a 14 year old. Steinfeld's Mattie is more intense, and more realistic than Kim Darby's Mattie. The one question you have of Mattie though is, despite her precocity and determinedness to go with Cogburn into Indian Country would a men like Cogburn or Texas Ranger LeBeouf  (Matt Damon) allow her? Or would they be more likely to box her ears and send her on her way? I don't know if that question is answered in the movie."True Grit" does stray a little from Portis' novel especially with LaBoeuf. The Coen's, for some reason don't have LaBoeuf coming along with Mattie and Cogburn for the entire journey and when they need him back it takes a little plot wrangling to get him back into the story where Portis had him all along. Some of the humor is also stripped out or subdued. I think that takes away some of the camaraderie present in Portis' novel (and Wayne's 1969 version) and leaves some doubt as to why Cogburn would allow Mattie to come along. In fact he does try to leave her behind but she catches up with Cogburn and LaBoeuf, who have struck up a deal of their own. The moment Cogburn agrees to take Mattie along is when LaBoeuf is spanking her with a switch. We also see Cogburn stop two boys from teasing a mule, is it compassion? We're not sure, it's never commented on and Cogburn doesn't show compassion in any other area of his life."True Grit" is different from the 1969 version and hardcore fans of Wayne may not like this version, but the Coen Brother vision of "True Grit" is darker, grittier, and has a great sense of style of the tone of the movie with the cinematography. The Coen's "True Grit" is more realistic to the era; it's the flip side of Wayne's version but no less enjoyable a movie or story.

$REVIEW.: What a fantastic thriller.  This is the kind of plot I adore; the rich woman who finds love in middle age with a handsome lothario, only to come upon something terrifying in her blissful marriage to him.  This amazing movie showcases Joan Crawford's ability to personify the most extreme human emotions so that I can almost feel them myself.  She is never over the top with her acting, but just right, clearly conveying the love, passion, delight and then horror she finds in her life.  When it comes to a story with lots of raw, heavy emotions, Joan Crawford could top them all for her ability to put it across perfectly.  She's a pleasure to watch, the master of her craft, clearly loving what she does as an actress and doing it to perfection.  She was no great beauty, and yet her features were perfect to display her work.  I loved every minute of this and couldn't help applauding her for another great performance at the end.  I only wish they still made movies like this, full of a great story and drama, and also wish there were still great actresses of Miss Crawford's caliber.

No. Is it a great movie? No. Sure, it's decent. The original '32 "Scarface" was definitely great, and I might even add influencial.

Now don't get me wrong, I am very open minded and I am not like a D&D version of a Trekker. I didn't look for nor care to see accuracies in the movie adaptation of the game. I just wanted to see a good fantasy adventure movie... The acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was bad, the story was illogical and generic, and EVEN the special effects were bad. Yes, the one thing you usually can count on in a movie these days, good SFX. But no... Even the LIGHTING was bad in this movie. Sometimes you just had a hard time getting a good glimpse of things...

$REVIEW.: Typically wartime films focus on the soldier, encampments, transport, combat and the like with but the occasional homefront scene to provide context.  Such juxtapositioning, however, rarely does justice to the trials of life experienced by civilians as battles take place far afield.  That's why Hope & Glory is such a unique piece of moviemaking.  In it we are taken along bombed streets; to charitable shops for clothing; into air raid shelters; to the cinema to escape the war; to neighbors homes to embrace a sense of community.  Hope & Glory is a "wartime" film wherein we see almost none of war's fare; as we are made to feel a part of it as viewers, knowing---from history---what is happening further afield without having to see any of it ourselves.  Life is indomitable & goes on as surely during difficult times as carefree ones.  It is the "Hope" in Hope & Glory and this film's accomplishment is its effectiveness in conveying such.  If you want to feel something of the time that was wartime as Hitlerite Germany ran amok in Europe then do view this fine film.  Along with "The Gathering Storm" starring Albert Finney & "Life is Beautiful", "Hope & Glory" is one of several films that brings the era of the Second World War to life; and makes the great combat films (such as "The Longest day", "Patton", et al) resonate even more with repeated viewings.  If interested in other suggestions, see my "Viscerally experience WWII" Amazon guide (just click on my name & then side left, to "So you'd like to..."). Incidentially, for those considering viewing this film as a family, I'd suggest you choose "Mrs. Miniver" for that instead, & save this film (with has some sexual issues) for the adults. Cheers!

The lead male character is a doofus (probably why they had to recruit the male lead from England, when everyone else turned the role down).  And the kid was a little too much the mouthy know-it-all, who bonds more with the 'bots than with his hapless father.  The idea of "boxing being outlawed in the future" was never really explored. But buying/fixing-up monster boxing-robots was fun to watch, especially with the Wii-type controller that melds man-and-machine in the ring.

$REVIEW.: Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm.Bobby Fischer began to play chess at the age of 7.  His meteoric rise to winning the national Championship in his early teens and then going on to defeat the World, is the Highlight of US Chess History.Chess, like Soccer, is much bigger in the rest of the world than it is in the US.  Fischer caused a blip in the radar screen that elevated Chess in the US.  The Chess community has since then been on the look-out for the next prodigy in hopes of repeating the same event.That's really not the main thrust of the movie, however.  It creates the context in which the relationship between Josh and his Father is explored.  In that regard, the movie is superior and excels.Bobby Fischer represents the megelomaniac for whom Chess is everything to the exclusion of family, friends and relationships.  (That's really a pretty accurate picture of Fischer the man, by the way.)  Josh rejects that path and chooses instead to retain his humanity, and tender conscience, despite the forces battling for him and his future.A Father who is tempted to live vicariously through his son's gift is all too common and present in sports and other areas as well.  A coach, who has his own ghosts and demons and recognizes the potential in Josh, who is unable to release him, for fear that he will leave the path of greatness.  Vinnie, the park speed chess player who represents the joy and fun of chess and rails against the establishment who wants to suck the life out of Josh to be their messiah.It's all there.  The chess provides the back-drop to it all.Many who have shied away from this movie imagining it to be a dull movie about Chess will be pleasantly surprised when they see it.Simply an outstanding film and well worth viewing, even if you don't know a bishop from a pawn!

$REVIEW.: The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. The movie JFK is critical of this book's findings, because of its omissions. This is what the movie JFK hopes to explore.The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. We see these in the movie. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswald's background, Oswald's detention, the media, Oswald's murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The film is mostly about dealing with investigating a possible conspiracy, challenging the Warren report in-depth with expert witness testimony, with the big court room showdown that in the end leaves you feeling that Oswald did not do it.Great movie, through and through. Hard not to love it. Why only 4 stars?Oswald was involved in the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit and this is a clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. The movie really does bend the reality of this problem by saying that it was a number of agents pretending to be Oswald.He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there is too much doubt at large to deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.But in closing I will say this. Go try the real world simulation run of  JFKreloaded and you will see that it might be possible to actually reproduce the magic bullet. You can actually hit the President 3 times no problem, including the fatal headshot. Oswald could have done it. The simulation clearly shows that you can do it also.

$review_text.: I watched Iron Man 1 two nights ago and Iron Man 2 last night with my two teenage boys


I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good
I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr


even better.In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons


He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying
He uses this magnet in an invention, an "Iron Man suit", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them
When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm

He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool
Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man

I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff
And really really cool cars.In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head

The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death

Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh

and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark


But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend


I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard


Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life
And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first


A good family movie though and funny.

$review_text.: The next volume of the dark knight's finest adaption, & it's better than the first.  Here's a graded review of every episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.29.  Eternal Youth:  Several rich industrialists are invited to the Eternal Youth Health Spa, and that's where they are last seen before disappearing.  The only connection: they had something to do with the death of plants.  Bruce Wayne also receives an invitation but Alfred and his "lady friend" Maggie, go in his place.  When they do not return, Batman is forced to investigate, discovering that the spa is run by Poison Ivy, and that she has been using a formula to turn the industrialists into humanoid trees.  B30.  Perchance To Dream:  Bruce Wayne wakes up one morning to find that his life is completely upside-down: his parents are alive, the Batcave does not exist, Alfred does not remember Robin, and he is engaged to Selina Kyle.  However, it doesn't mean that Batman isn't still around, and Bruce starts to wonder what has happened.  A+31. The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy:  Baron Jozek, furious at Batman for humiliating him at a dinner party (over Jozek's underworld connections), hires Josiah Wormwood, a master in setting traps for his victims, to hunt down Batman and bring back the hero's cape and cowl.  B+32-33.  Robin's Reckoning:  During a fight with some gangsters at a construction yard, Batman and Robin learn the name of their boss: Billy Marin.  While Robin looks forward to going up against Marin, Batman becomes distant, and after a falling out at the Batcave, Batman doesn't allow Robin to accompany him on the search for Marin.  Robin investigates on the Batcomputer, and soon realises that Billy Marin is not the boss' real name.  Rather, it is an alias of Tony Zucco, the man who killed his parents.  A34.  The Laughing Fish:  Joker creates a toxin that affects only fish, mutating them into Joker fish.  Then, he targets innocent men who refuse to copyright his Joker fish.  The Joker also captures Harvey Bullock and Batman must rescue him and foil the Clown Prince of Crime's insane scheme.  A+35.  Night of the Ninja:  A mysterious ninja is robbing Wayne Enterprises subsidiaries, and Batman discovers that the ninja is actually his equal in combat.  A grudge against Bruce Wayne and skills to match him can only mean one person: Kyodai Ken, an old rival of Wayne's from his days in Japan, and who was thrown out of the dojo after attempting to rob it, only to be stopped by Wayne.  Ken, it turns out, wants revenge.  B36.  Cat Scratch Fever:  Batman must stop Roland Daggett's plan to release a viral plague designed by Professor Milo into Gotham by way of its stray cat population.  The case gains new urgency when Catwoman becomes infected with the virus during her search for her missing cat, Isis.  Now, Batman must find an antidote to save the woman who loves him most.  C37.  The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne:  After a prominent judge is injured during a struggle with some thugs demanding money from her in exchange for a strange tape, Bruce Wayne decides to take a trip to Yucca Springs, a resort where the judge had vacationed, and consult Dr. Hugo Strange, a psychiatrist.  Bruce soon learns that Strange has invented a machine that extracts people's darkest secrets from their minds and transfers them to videotape -- and now Strange has proof of Bruce's secret identity as Batman and plans to auction it to three of Gotham's prominent crime bosses.  A+38-39.  Heart of Steel:  Several robberies take place at major companies, including Wayne Enterprises, and Bruce Wayne, as Batman, discovers the thief to be a mechanical briefcase.  Bruce meets with his old friend, Karl Rossum, an expert in robotics who lost his daughter to a vehicle accident years ago.  He also meets Rossum's assistant, Randa Duane, and Rossum's ultimate creation: a prototype A.I. known as Holographic Analytical Reciprocating Digital Computer (H.A.R.D.A.C.) Bruce invites Duane to dinner, and around the same time, certain civilians start acting strangely.  A40.  If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?:  Edward Nygma creates the game The Riddle of the Minotaur and makes millions for the company Competitron.  He is then fired by his superior, Daniel Mockridge, who wants the profits for himself.  Nygma vows revenge, and two years later, he takes up the mantle of the Riddler and traps Mockridge inside a life-sized version of the Minotaur maze.  Batman's sympathy is with Nygma, but he and Robin have to stop him before he kills Mockridge, despite the fact that Mockridge cannot legally be brought to justice.  A-41.  Joker's Wild:  Cameron Kaiser builds a casino hotel modeled after the Joker, called The Joker's Wild.  The Joker sees this on the news and, enraged, escapes from Arkham again, with one thought on his mind: destroying the casino, unaware that this is exactly what Kaiser wants him to do as part of an insurance claim.  A+42.  Tyger, Tyger:  Selina Kyle is kidnapped by the villainous genetic engineer Dr. Emile Dorian and becomes his latest experiment to provide his man-cat hybrid named Tygrus with a mate. Batman learns of this and comes to the island to rescue Selina.  He is captured and forced into a deadly game of cat-and-flying mouse as Tygrus hunts Batman through the island's jungles.  A+43.  Moon of the Wolf:  Batman investigates the appearance of a werewolf-like creature in Gotham, not realizing that the monster happens to be one of Bruce Wayne's associates -- Anthony Romulus, ex-Olympic champion.  Behind the scheme is twisted chemist Professor Milo.  C44.  Day of the Samurai:  Kyodai Ken kidnaps Kairi, star pupil of Yoru Sensei, the martial arts instructor who taught both Kyodai and Bruce.  The ninja's ransom for her is a scroll that teaches the location of the fabled Death Touch.  A45.  Terror In The Sky:  When a man-sized bat ransacks Gotham harbor, Batman suspects that Dr. Kirk Langstrom is up to his old tricks, taking the Man-Bat formula again.  Batman isn't the only one.  Kirk's wife, Francine, is so distrustful of her husband that she decides to leave him.  After further investigation, Batman discovers that this Man-Bat is not Kirk, but someone else.  A-46.  Almost Got `Im:  Joker, Killer Croc, Penguin, Two-Face, and Poison Ivy all meet at a poker table, each telling a tale of times when they almost defeated Batman.  At the same time, Harley Quinn is about to kill Catwoman.  Will Batman be able to save her?  A+47.  Birds of a Feather:  Veronica Vreeland is looking for a way to create a splash with her next party and arrives at the idea of having a former criminal in attendance -- especially if there is one whose manners would create a stir.  The Penguin, who has recently reformed, fits the bill perfectly.  In the process of convincing the Penguin to come to her party, Veronica finds she likes the corpulent little guy.  For his part, the Penguin begins to fall in love with her, until he overhears that he is merely being used...  A+48.  What Is Reality?:  Seeking to prove once and for all that his is the superior mind, the Riddler lures Batman into a riddle-solving contest inside the virtual reality of a computer game in order to save Jim Gordon's life.  In the course of solving the riddles and escaping the Riddler's traps, Batman learns that he is able to manipulate the virtual reality landscape much like the Riddler does.  B49.  I Am the Night:  On the anniversary of the death of Bruce's parents, Batman accompanies Leslie Thompkins to Crime Alley to place roses on the spot where they were gunned down. Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon is on stakeout to arrest James "The Jazzman" Peake during a drug smuggling ring.  Batman had promised to be there, but arrives late to find a gun battle going on.  He helps defeat the gangsters and arrest the Jazzman, but at a high cost--Gordon is severely wounded.  The incident traumatizes Batman, and he decides to give up crime-fighting, despite the Jazzman escaping prison to carry out his personal vendetta against Gordon (who had sent him to prison six years before).  A-50.  Off Balance:  While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows, who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole.  But after his identity is mistakenly revealed to Talia, Batman remains off-balance as to where her true loyalties lie.  A51.  The Man Who Killed Batman:  When a small time gang member seemingly kills Batman by accident, he gets involved with gangs all over Gotham, as well as the Joker and Rupert Thorne, none of whom believe his story that everything that is happening is by preposterous happenstance.  A+52.  Mudslide:  Clayface is falling apart, literally.  His clay-like body is disintegrating. Fortunately, a scientist he knew from his movie star days is working on a remedy.  However, Hagen is forced to steal money to pay for the expensive components of the remedy. That is until one of his targets is Wayne Biomedical Labs...  A53. Paging the Crime Doctor:  Dr. Matthew Thorne, losing his medical license and forced into becoming the crime doctor by his younger brother, crime boss Rupert Thorne, must perform delicate surgery on Rupert.  He can't do it alone, and kidnaps Dr. Leslie Thompkins to assist. Batman discovers Leslie's disappearance, and rushes to track her down - and has an additional interest in Matthew, because he was a medical school classmate of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas.  A-54.  Zatanna:  When the glamorous magician Zatanna is framed for a robbery during her act, Batman swings to her defense.  Zatanna is grateful though a little puzzled by the Dark Knight's commitment to prove her innocence, but the two heroes unite and use the skills her father, Zatara, taught them to expose and combat the culprit: an evil illusionist named Montague Kane.  B+55.  The Mechanic:  Thanks to a freak accident during a high-speed chase, the Batmobile is virtually demolished.  After Batman takes the car to his personal mechanic, Earl Cooper, the Penguin makes his move and tampers with the Batmobile, putting it under his control.  B+56.  Harley and Ivy:  When the Joker fires Harley, she tries going on a crime spree of her own, joining up with Poison Ivy, and the two become Gotham's Queens of Crime, much to Joker's fury.  A+Another must-buy.

$REVIEW.: I must confess. I don't actually own this DVD set. I have been renting them one by one from a local video store. This is a pretty interesting show about an individual named Bill Henrickson (played by Bill Paxton) who has three spouses and seven children, all whom live in the same household. However, very few in the outside world seem to know of this and Bill and his family are hoping to keep it that way. Will they succeed?There is probably a very good chance that this show will raise eyebrows with individuals who are strongly adversed to polygamy. I personally could care less one way or the other, but so far, the show has won me over for the following reasons: a) I couldn't help but notice the presence of Amanda Seyfried, who I had seen and liked in a couple of movies a while back, and only wish would appear in more things. In Season One of "Big Love," the performer plays Bill Henrickson's eldest daughter Sarah, who seems to have her own opinions regarding polygamy; b) there is a scene where a couple of employees in a fast food restaurant are discussing their music interests and one of them says something about liking jazz, and (having a strong attachment to the genre myself) that sort of thing will make or break a TV show, movie, cartoon, or soap opera for me; and c) one is treated to some particularly amusing lines by the performers. I don't know why, but a close friend of mine and I just couldn't help but cackle like a couple of chickens at the part where one of the restaurant workers says... well, unfortunately, I can't write it here word-for-word, but it is the kind of line that one doesn't forget anytime soon. Despite the humor of what is said, there is a message behind it, which if taken seriously could cut down on the number of undesired pregnancies and STIs dominating the country as of this moment.The only thing for which I would subtract points is the episode consisting of an elderly man ejecting bodily fluids into a sink, the same one that is supposed to have no other use besides washing dishes. They actually show this and it just seemed somewhat unsanitary. Other than that, I would say give this TV show a try, unless of course you have strong beliefs against polygamy. One thing that would be better, though, is if there were a little more than just 12 episodes. It is hoped that there will be a Season Two of "Big Love."
$SUMMARY.: This is an interesting television program.

$review_text.: RED TAILS is a riveting war film that's based on the true story of the 332nd Fighter Group (Tuskegee Airmen) who, though one of the finest groups of fighter pilots in WWII, faced enormous discrimination and denigration simply because they were African-American.Much of the acting--with special mention going to Ne-Yo as Andrew "Smokey" Salem --is excellent


Some of the script is a bit staid and corny, and a few plot details are a little hard to buy, e.g., a P-40 coming out unscathed after single-handedly destroying a German warship? Still, even the blatantly inaccurate parts of the film are very gripping, a quality that most of us want, right?RED TAILS is carefully and expertly filmed but has a sort of 70ish war thriller ambiance to it

Yet, with a few exceptions, the animation is pretty convincing
Anyone who simply enjoys watching aerial combat will not be disappointed
The 15-minute Double Victory Highlights Featurette is definitely worth watching, either before or after you watch the film itself.I would also recommendThe Tuskegee Airmen, which, though not as action-packed as RED TAILS, tells parts of the story that this film does not, is more accurate historically speaking, and has an immediacy to it that RED TAILS does not quite reach.

$REVIEW.: This film is underrated by both regular movie goers and Argetno fans, usually it is panned because of how bizzare it is, but the thing about an Argento film is that he has never been good at writing a narrative . For him the important thing is to affect you emotionally and psychologically, not in an intellectual way. This is probably his most bizzare and his most beautiful film. It is about a girl named Jennifer Corvino(Jennifer Connelly) who enrolls in a Swiss boarding school and her classmates are being murdered by a mysterious killer. She has a gift of being able to communicate telepathically with insects and with the help of an entomologist(Donald Pleasence) she tracks down the killer using her power. While i admit some of the narrative seems somewhat ridiculous it is a lush and beautiful film which has the feeling of a dream and Jennifer Connelly who has also starred in DARK CITY and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is good enough in her first leading role. It also features a great musical score by Goblin and Bill Wyman. It also features the director's wife, Daria Nicolodi, and his one of his daughters, Fiore Argento. Watch for her in the impressive and scary opening sequence. You will notice this film is similar in many ways to SUSPIRIA but it manages to stand on it's own. In what other film will you see a monkey running wild with a razor blade!

$REVIEW.: ...but someone is watching.  And they're not human.  If you thought the NSA was bad...One of OL's few truly evil E.T. entries, a murder mystery performed as a courtroom drama.  The script is highly literate, but the suspense is half-shot from the beginning by showing too much.  It's still worth it for the opening murder scene and the dramatic finale alone, though the interesting analysis of intrusive government spying on its own citizenry along the way is quite good, too (and, for the time, eye-opening, as well).Typically great OL cinematography, one of the creepier and more memorable monsters, and good performances all around, especially by Jeff Corey.

$REVIEW.: I disagree with the reviews that characterize the movie as boring. It is not boring. At the same time, it isn't really plausible, either - though that is not necessary to make an enjoyable movie. The acting in the first half of the movie is underwhelming, but things improve about half through the second act. There is a lot of overlap in the storyline with Crimson Tide. So, all in all, it's okay - not great, not terrible, just okay.

$review_text.: No... they didn`t give us a fourth outing of the That`s Entertainment-series. Instead they gave us this... a bio of Cole Porter. MGM follows the old tradition from the 40s(Till the Clouds Roll by, Words and Music etc) and gives us a two hour traffic of drama and music.However! Kline`s Porter is much closer to Noel Coward than Porter... Yes... Porter and his mates are portrayed like British performers.... Ashley Judd IS a STANDOUT as Linda... But u do get the feeling that we are in the rush-hour of a life here...(as intended without giving away the plot hehehe)... It is a dream to see new versions of Be a Clown, Well Did You Evah? and Gabriel.Unfortunately the musical numbers are not allowed to stand on its own feet and is much too often just a bridge and commentary on Porter`s life. Sometimes it work, sometimes it doesn`t....  The guest appearances of contemperary singing stars are variable... Sometimes it`s on the target, sometimes not... Alanis Morisette and Robbie Williams do excell. Elvis Costello???? Let there be silence.It is as the producers wanna say; "Hey look who we got to this picture..."...All in all... it`s good that MGM with its musical history made this film and although it is a great experience, it fails to be a great film... It suffers from trying to reach too many ingredients in 120 minutes.

$review_text.: Clearly one of director Tamra Davis early efforts.  Made in 1993 after she was fresh out of the music video scene.  I thought this had all the hallmarks of an amateurish quickie (and probably low budget, too)Rap music culture is a rich vein of over-the-top personalities and quirky business dealings that obviously has the potential for some knockout satirical fun and to wrap it up in a fake documentary like CB4 was the best way to go, but to work well it needs creative talent in writing and direction that is so lacking here.  Best bits, for me, were the songs and these worked because all that was required were the lyrics from well known rap hits and then change the words.  Making a movie though is a lot more effort.A year after CB4 was released 'Fear of a black hat' came out.  Exactly the same premise but I thought it was so much better.  All the usual suspects were included but it actually hung together as a movie rather than a series of potentially funny vignettes which is CB4.

I would definitely watch this again.That said, I don't really consider it a kids' movie. The frequently displayed voluptuous bosom of the bad guy's girlfriend, some jokes clearly targeted for the adult population, and things like the rabbit chewing off his own feet added to up a total package a little outside what I'd be comfortable showing children.

$REVIEW.: Ignore the naysayers here and watch this movie on a big screen, with a good surround sound system cranked up nice and loud. This is a full-on modern cinematic rollercoaster ride, made purely for fun, and it delivers in spades.Essentially a melange of Dracula, Frankenstein, and James Bond, with occasional soupcons of various and sundry genre touches, Van Helsing is a feast for the eyes and ears, and damn funny to boot. I came in expecting nothing, and was well and truly blown away.The effects are flawless, the story quite hilarious, and the overall tone suggests Raiders of the Lost Ark of Transylvania. Jackman and Beckinsale are tailor-made and work well together. Roxburgh gives one of the most hilarious villain performances in screen history, perfectly over the top; his moments alone are worth seeing the film for. I rarely watch recent movies more than once; I've seen this four times in a year and it keeps getting more impressive with each viewing.This is a superb piece of craftsmanship that never takes itself too seriously, and delivers massive doses of fun and many thrilling moments. A better flick for a cold and snowy Saturday's eve would be hard to find.Give it some time; Van Helsing will be a cult classic yet.

$REVIEW.: There should be no mention of Curb Your Enthusiasm in the description. It simply misleads.This film is something of a people-watcher's goldmine. Very tightly composed, it nevertheless gives one the sense of a natural rhythm. There are several laugh-out-loud moments and equally enough geeky, goofy, awkward and sad moments to make the film reflective of life.The leads are pleasant. Although there are a few expletives, they are scant and natural. They don't reduce the likability of either of the main characters. The theme is subtle, just as the theme of one's life usually would be. As subtle as the theme are the character's varying joy and disappointment. The two actors are average men, insecure, grounded, flailing, fulfilled...laugh. sigh. wonder. when does success equal failure?In short, the film could be characterized as a re-worked, natural progression on the French Nouvelle Vague documentary format. Here, they leave out the slow, omit pointless frames and focus on personality. The question of personal & professional struggle, understated social method (social application), flaws and longing was beautifully treated.Well done. Beautifully done. "The Trip" was just right. I am very happy to have seen it.
$SUMMARY.: Average and pleasantly awkward...

$REVIEW.: If you think "Joshua" is a horror movie, I suggest you always carry a spare pair of trousers with you in case you accidentally look down and see your own shadow.  This movie (hilariously described as "Hitchcockian") has no idea what it wants to do--except be scary, which director/writer George Ratliff and co-writer David Gilbert pursue with all the fumbling gusto of screaming teenage fans waiting in line for a pop concert.The story--what little there is--centers around the parents of Joshua, a supposedly brilliant nine-year-old devil-child, and how everything basically goes to hell once Joshua's baby sister is born.  OK, stop.  Let's take this one step at a time.How do we know that Joshua is brilliant?  Um... because he talks about what he learned in school and wears his shirts buttoned all the way up to the top.How do we know he's evil?  Well, because he looks hard at things and doesn't blink.But more importantly, WHY is he evil?  In other words, why is he trying to drive his poor parents nuts?  Well... the filmmakers would like us to believe that it's because he's jealous of the attention his baby sister gets.One problem: his parents are clearly making a strong effort to shower him with attention, affection, and encouragement, so the emotional catalyst just isn't there.  Nor do we have any real clue as to whether Joshua is inherently sadistic, or just acting out of desperation.Likewise, the various "twists" aren't really twists at all, since this movie ends pretty much exactly the way you think it would--but, oddly, in a much less plausible way.About three-fourths of the way through this stumbling, seemingly made-for-TV film, the filmmakers try to trick us by implying that someone/something else is the villain--as though the audience were just that stupid!  But they take this too far, meaning the villain COULDN'T be the villain after all!  In other words, the filmmakers contradict themselves.Spoiler warning: there's no way Joshua could be at fault for everything that happened, since it's never addressed if/how he could have tampered with his mom's medication (what, does he have a secret chemistry lab somewhere that he also uses to poison animals?), nor is it addressed what he was doing to make his sister cry all the time.  If he was just wandering into her room all the time and shaking her awake, wouldn't the parents eventually catch him?  Why would she keep crying in the afternoons?  And come to think of it, what parents keep their crying newborn in a separate room down the hall?This movie also asks us to make some huge leaps of faith, like: 1) no one else saw Joshua push a certain character down the stairs of a crowded public place and kill her... in the middle of the afternoon! 2) that the father, upon discovering a very disturbing home movie filmed by his son, showed it to... absolutely no one! 3) that child psychologists see a child scribble a scary picture and IMMEDIATELY conclude that a child has definitely been abused (hey, I drew scary pictures, too; I just thought they were cool!), and finally, 4) that a nine-year-old boy sitting at a piano and singing a god-awful adult contemporary song is scary... well, actually, that IS pretty horrifying!

$review_text.: I have never been a huge KISS fan from the get go, but I've learned to respect them for what they've done and who they are. In and about the time I was really starting to get into listening and playing music, I though that they sucked for the most part. I was into bands like the Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden etc and Kiss never really did anything for me back then. However looking back, I probably never really gave them a chance. As time passed I began to revisit their older stuff and to my surprise, I really liked what I heard coming from my speakers. The 80's and 90's had some high points, but it's the early years that really paint the true picture of what these guys were about and I personally found this out some 20 years later. I guess you could say the their first full reunion tour was a coming out party for me *lol*.Sure Gene and Paul are businessmen and yes they looked at this as both being a way to get rich and a way to express themselves both musically and lyrically. From the moment they started out, they had a plan and followed it with the a passion. No one should ever say anything bad about that as they had a dream and they've lived that dream. They were at one time basically laughed at, however they had a vision and they worked at their craft and took on the world and it's would be critics. KISS is or was one of the worlds biggest bands and most recognizable names. They had achieved what they sought out to do and I see nothing wrong with that. They worked their butts off to show the world and probably themselves just what they could do or become. They delivered live shows that absolutely blew their audience away and their reputation and following, insert KISS ARMY here, was built on that. Make no mistake here, KISS was never the most talented band in the world, nor the best selling act ever, however they were not as untalented or as crappy as some people would have you believe. The musicianship is pretty darn good all around here so they get props from me.KISS are what they are and they are masters at what they do. They deliver great live shows time after time and they have a very good collection of albums that contain some really good tunes that have stood the test of time. They are business men who in the end have given us a good days work for many years!This DVD contains what really is KISS at it's zenith. The first disc shows us just how raw they really were when they started out. It has lots of bad notes and really funny imagery that is somewhat hilarious at times. As the disc gets further in, you can see that they are indeed getting better and are really starting to define who they are and what they could be. The second disc is really KISS at it's best!! They had found their way and were working it for all it was worth. All in all great stuff for any KISS  fan or even the casual fan like myself who over time has grown to respect what these guys were all about!Easily a 5 star rating here!!

$review_text.: It's 1999

 The worls is about to experience an event that will in many ways, determine the parameters of popular art within the realm of the most popular and influential of the popular arts, the world of Commercial Film
 With THE MATRIX the Wachowski brothers create and present a perfect example of what the Sci-Fi Adventure film of the hypothetical future would be in the actual future


 THE MATRIX, though perfectly self-contained, and received with enthusiasm by the public, would demand a sequel

 The Wachowskis would quickly provide two of them, and these subsequent films would amaze audiences by not only fulfilling the plot and motivatIon factors of the original story, but by becoming in unforseen ways, movies deeper, more profound and intellectually demanding; in other words, superior to the template from which they sprang.It all begins with the pulsing of a cursor light on an unattended computer monitor screen.Question:  What if you woke one day to find and to follow a sequence of remarkale evnts that led to the realizaion that the world around you, including all your most intimate associations, those given to you by your senses, was merely an illusion, a construct desined to control you, subliminally, for the beneift of un-alive, half-beings fundamenally unlike yourelf?  What would you do?  What could you do?  What if all this were "a world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."  What then?(1)  Would you quit your Programmer job?(2)  Would you Join a band of cyber-space rebels?  What if you were invited into it by someone irresistably attractive?(3)  What if the doping, pleasure-driven Web rebels knew you only  by your Net pseudonym, and accepted  you totally for what you only partly believed yourself to be?  Could you accept them?(4)  What if the leader of the Web rebels believed in you and your destiny, devoutly, and showed you that he'd been for most of his life dedicated to your appearance, and what if he were able to show you both your orignis and your destiny?  Would you believe and follow him?(5)  And what if this man, this dangerous outlaw,  believed you were the savior of "the world" or, of Humanity?(6)  And what if he were able to show you in a convincing way, what reality was, and how you were trapped in the lie of it?(7) And what if he were to introduce you to a clairvoyant who, though socially inappropriate, read the future?  Would you accept her message?(8)  Would you, as one of the fugitive band of time-travellers beyond the Matrix, join in a battle with the mechanized forces of the Matrix itself?  Would you confront it's terrifying and powerful agents?  At he risk of your life?(9)  Braving discomfort, bad food, and sensual deprivation, would you risk your identity and your ideal self to battle against the authoritarian agents of the Matrix?(10)  And would you risk everything for someone who believed in you absoluely, and loved you beyond anything you'd peviously imagined?(11)  And betrayal?  It is inevitable
 Will you be able to face it and survive?Phrophecy is funny:  People only talk about it, when they talk about it, to show they don't believe in it


 Mark of a decadent age
 A lack of moral imagination is the hallmark of decay
 Weep, my friends

 But, a voice speaks through the modem
 It says, "I know you are out there

 I can feel you now

 I know that  you're afraid

 You're afrid of us; afraid of change


 I don't know the future

 I didn't come here to tell you how this will end

 I came here to tell you how this is going to begin


 I'm going to hang up this phone and I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see


 I'm gong to show them a world without rules or conrols; without boundaries; a world where anything is possible


 Where we go from there is up to you."'The Wachowski brothers who produced this film are said to hail from Chicago

 In that city adults tell children that the (arctic) climate builds character

 Perhaps it may

 Adversity has strange offspring
 Who knows what may, or may not have come out of that brutally cold, utterly corrupt but quintessentially American city?

$review_text.: I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Normally, movies based on video games end up being pretty bad, but that is not the case with Silent Hill. From my limited knowledge of the game, this movie follows the plot fairly well, there are some obvious differences (like the main lead being a woman instead of a man), but overall it's decently faithful, and that's a good thing! It succeeded in creating a suspensful, chilling atmosphere, and some of it was genuinely creepy and unnerving. The acting was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, in fact I'd say the acting was pretty good! I won't spoil what happens in the end, but I will say that I didn't care for it too much, it didn't seem like it offered enough closure, and it was a little confusing, but luckily this is not one of those cases where the ending makes or breaks the whole movie. I'd recommend this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare

$review_text.: "Green Street Hooligans" is one of the Best Bad Movies Ever Made. It is to football hooligans whatGlitteris to the music industry. In "Glitter", Mariah Carey is the outsider who finds her voice despite trying circumstances. In "Green", Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is wrongly framed for drug possession whilst attending Harvard. This movie is to represent the departure of Wood from the Shire's innocence to the rough, tough life of hooligans.After crossing the Pond, Wood meets the leader of the West Ham elite (Charlie Hunnam,Sons of Anarchy: Season One) West Ham is ironically, the favorite club of Michael Caine. One wonders what he'd make of this movie. The West Ham Elite spend a lot of time beating each other up, and running away... then singing and dancing hobbit-like atop tables. There are enough song and dance numbers one would expect to see Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera. Halfway through the movie, there's an obligatory voice-over by Wood. He gives the Moral of the Story at the end ofThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King [Blu-ray] andThe Faculty, so I was not surprised. By then, I was halfway asleep. But I perked up when Elijah gets his bare chest tattooed. That's as excited as got throughout the whole movie (it also explains my bestowal of 3 stars instead of 2)"Green Street" has some unexplained questions. Why doesn't Matt represent his sister (Claire Forlani)? Alien abduction? Adoption? Artificial insemination? When he meets his father, again, zero family resemblance. That, or family resemblance is overrated."Green Street" along withGreen Dolphin Street [VHS], is marvelous movie cheese.

He plays a guy who for whatever reason never learned how to act appropriately. The only thing he seems to know how to do well is "eliminate" people.Great chemistry between Brosnan and Kinnear and a funny script that kept surprising me.There were moments I found myself saying, "No, that couldn't be Pierce Brosnan."Definitely a QUIRKY film. Eccentric. Not too violent. Best of all, not a Hollywood formula film. BRAVO...!!!Oh, and I really liked the woman who played Kinnear's wife "Bean" as well.

$review_text.: As others have said, Bambi II was pretty good

 Considering its budget, it matched the look of the original fairly well, and the voices were pretty good too


 A couple of scenes had some dialog that was much too modern though and was a jarring contrast to the rest of the film (for example, one scene where Thumper taunts Bambi to be more brave).But the worst thing about the film, and it was bad enough to practically ruin everything that they got right, was the songs

 The background score was quite good, but the songs were just awful


 They didn't fit with the original AT ALL, and there's no reason they couldn't have

 Since this movie takes place in the middle of the original, it was, to me, stupid to have such a drastic change in the type of songs

 Even when taken on their own merit the new songs weren't very good


 They were way too obvious and on-the-nose; no subtlety, no cleverness, no class.And the shame is that its target audience (kids) would be fine with the style of songs in the original-- they're not about to turn off the TV if a song isn't a drippy, syrupy pop song like the newer Disney films are so full of

 If that were the case they wouldn't watch the original Bambi, would they?And I do wish they kept the original title, "Bambi & The Great Prince of the Forest" instead of "Bambi II"
 Yes, I know the original title was longer, but it was more interesting than "Bambi II" (it could have been shortened to "Bambi & The Great Prince")


 Plus, this isn't really a sequel, so the "II" isn't really correct
 A minor quibble, I know.SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD...Lastly, I thought it ended abruptly


 Yes, I know it had to lead into the original, but what they had didn't feel (to me) like an an adequate resolution for all of the characters


 For example, there was no resolution to the sub-plot with Ronno, Bambi's rival, and no real resolution to the relationship between Bambi and his father


 (It would have been nice, since the film's main audience will be young children, to see either some negative consequences for Ronno, or have him see the error of his ways and even apologize.)

$REVIEW.: This recent movie adaptation of Jane Austin's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is just marvelous.  Emma Thompson's enchanting screenplay is so close to the novel, and that's such a rare treat in a movie version.  Yes, Emma Thompson is a bit old for the part of older sister Elinor but,  she's so endearing, I'm willing to let it go.  The supporting cast is  very powerful, with performances by Kate Winslet, Greg Wise, Imogen Stubbs,  Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant toping off a fabulous ensemble.  Winslet is  especially wonderful as the younger Dashwood sister.  She's completely  sweet, young and innocent.  Her heartbreak at the hands of handsome and  dashing  Willoughby is extremely powerful and emotional.  It's an all  around well acted movie.  Lots of wondeful performances. This is acutally a  very funny movie and so beautifully shot by Director Ang Lee.  Every  aspect of the movie is wonderful.  It's treat for all Austin fans and an  all around wonderful film.

$REVIEW.: Well i am pretty excited to watch ppv live


Now even though rock and cm punk 2 is gonna be predictable its gonna be interesting to see how these two guys work together

From what ive heard their match at the royal rumble was great, so it should be entertaining to see live on ppv


Besides that i would prefer this ppv over wm 29 bc i dont want to see cena vs rock 2, it was called once in a life time match for a reason! But i will buy wm 29 on dvd bc cena and rock was fun to watch but not for another $60 when i can get it cheaper on dvd and see the same match as much as i want! Lol

$REVIEW.: This is one of the better Marvel adaptations from comic book to the big screen

Nowhere near as good as SPIDERMAN but it does draw heavily and satisfyingly from its comic book roots


Most of the changes to the character are improvements

Frank Castle is an ex-FBI agent.When Frank Castle's entire family is wiped out by a crime lord, Castle dons the skull and becomes the Punisher

 This Punisher is firmly grounded in reality with none of the superhero trappings of his early Spiderman appearance in issue 139
 With appearances by The Russian and Harry Heck, comic book fans will not be disappointed.The violence is rough and graphic and Tom Jane keeps the character real


 But the real treat in this DVD comes in the extras
 There is a fantastic short on the origin of the Punisher as told by the creator, writers, and artists who brought him to life

 Watching those men lovingly tell how the Punisher came to be is almost better than the film.Next is the interview with the cover artist, called Drawing Blood: Bradstreet Style

 It is clear from the film visuals that the director went out of his way to incorporate the grittiness of the controversial comic about the hero that kills people
 Fascinating.For the music fan there is a bonus CD containing three cuts from the soundtrack: Drowning Pool - Step Up; Seven Wiser - Sick; and Edgewater - Eyes Wired Shut.For the comic book fan, there is a small comic book prequel, specifically created for the DVD release.Just an awesome value.

$REVIEW.: Samuel L


Jackson is like a whirlwind unto himself, and it's hard too deny his presence in any movie he's in -- even when he's playing an understated, "quiet" role such as that of Jedi Master Mace Windu in "Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.""Coach Carter" would be your typical, run-of-the-mill movie, except this one had Jackson in the lead role
No, the movie doesn't rise much above elements you've seen in other school sports movies -- "Friday Night Lights," "Stand and Deliver," and even parts that reminded me of "Lean on Me" and "Remember the Titans." And as a whole, it's simply yet another feel-good, popcorn flick.But it's still fun to watch, and it's hard to deny the movie's basic message -- that an education is more important than sports in that it carries you into the future, whereas sports is more often than but an unlikely "hoop dream."So, anyone who hasn't seen this yet, see it for Samuel L


Jackson's powerful, charismatic performance.As a big Jackson fan, this one will likely be finding its way into my collection, if only to skip ahead to see SLJ once again show the undeniable force of nature that he is.

$REVIEW.: This movie is so much fun
Back in the 70s, when I was the only geek girl in high school reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS and all titles by Jane Austen, little did I suspect that anyone would ever make hugely popular movies out of what (at that time) was fare for only the most devoted of bookworms.The adaptation of this classic author by actor/screenwriter Emma Thompson is superb


However, many of the other reviewers have praised Thompson's brilliance in detail, so instead I'll touch on another favorite feature of mine: the supporting cast.Remember Siegfried Farnon, the older, robust vet from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL? His name is Robert Hardy and here he plays the kindly but rambunctious uncle
Somehow, somewhere they found an actress to play his mother who is so like Robert Hardy in looks and personality, you'd swear they were blood relatives
This lively, raucous pair gift the Dashwood sisters and their bereaved mother with a humble cottage when they're left homeless (or, rather, mansionless) by the death of their father

Generous deeds aside, if there's juicy gossip to be had, these two will be sure to "winkle it out of you."There are too many wonderful supporting roles in this movie filled by excellent actors, so I'll mention just one more

Harriet Walter plays Fanny Dashwood to perfection - the stingy in-law who's gone power-drunk now that her husband has inherited the home and wealth his sisters have just lost

In one pivotal scene, Fanny coaxes the secretly engaged Lucy Steele to spill her romantic secret


"I'm as silent as the grave," says the horrible Fanny, leaning in close to the unsuspecting girl


As she leans, you get the distinct impression she *is* the grave
And all from one look


Harriet Walter plays the villain with a sense of humor about herself that can only be described as delicious.The title of this story refers to the dispositions of the two older Dashwood sisters

"Sense" is the practical and commonsense Elinor, played by Emma Thompson - the ultra-responsible elder sister who appears not to give in to the longings of her heart
"Sensibility" refers to the demonstrative Miss Marianne, played by Kate Winslet, who wears her heart on her sleeve and pooh-poohs anyone who doesn't


Through a series of misunderstandings, plus a fine collection of hilarious and dramatic incidents, the tables are turned and the sisters walk a mile in one another's shoes.My husband enjoyed this one as much as I did
And I'm pleased to report that the movie is 100% worthy of the book.

$review_text.: "The Sixth Sense" (1999) is generally regarded as a ghost story and that is what it seems to be during the first viewing. There is also an obvious subtext about the nature of our fears as well as themes concerning courage and communication; elements often incorporated into the genre. Most viewers will be conscious of this stuff during the first viewing but will mostly be focused on sorting out the story and processing the intriguing conclusion.But with subsequent viewing(s) the fear factor diminishes and you become aware that this is not a ghost story so much as it is a film about grief; particularly the grief than comes from regret. With this realization comes the awareness that the real power of the film comes from a viewer's subconscious connection with this underlying theme. The object of the film is far more than just giving the audience a scare although it does a first-class job of doing just that. It can also alter your perception of the process of both living and dying.The spirits that seek out young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) do so because there is something they regret doing or not doing during their lives; something that will ease the grief of their passing (for both them and their loved ones). You have Krya's little sister asking Cole if Krya will come back and Cole answering "not anymore", after he has helped Krya.And then you have the grieving Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his grieving wife Anna (Olivia Williams): "Once upon a time there was this person named Malcolm. He worked with children. He loved it. He loved it more than anything else. And then one night, he found out that he made a mistake with one of them. He couldn't help that one. And he can't stop thinking about it, he can't forget. Ever since then, things have been different. He's not the same person that he used to be. And his wife doesn't like the person that he's become. They barely speak anymore, they're like strangers. And then one day Malcolm meets this wonderful little boy, a really cool little boy. Reminds him a lot of the other one. And Malcolm decides to try and help this new boy. 'Cause he feels that if he can help this new boy, it would be like helping that other one too."The climatic scene in the car between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) ranks up with cinema's all-time best.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

$review_text.: Following in the footsteps of Tales of Tomorrow, the original The Outer Limits was a landmark show.  Many years later a creative team decided to resurrect the feel of the show and this is the result.  As pointed out in one of the many extras, this is not The Twilight Zone.  That show relied heavily on fantasy while this one would be grounded in science.Aliens are a favorite in this season as is man's need to tinker with the universe.  We even get a robot.  Some of the stories are based on classic science fiction like Sandkings (George R.R. Martin) and I, Robot (Eando Binder).  Others are fresh and new.  I was a big fan of the original series and have fully enjoyed this new one.  At its heart, this is the same series.There are several superficial differences between the old series and the new.  The new series is in color.  The new series includes harsher language.  The new series even include nudity up to full-frontal.  The new series can take advantage of slicker special effects.  But all of these things are minor.  Both series use quality actors and writers.  It is the intelligent stories that make the series and not the window dressing.  A great series that should be seen by all science fiction fans.This season includes the following episodes:SandkingsValerie 23Blood BrothersThe Second SoulWhite Light FeverThe ChoiceVirtual FutureLiving HellCorner of the EyeUnder the BedDark MattersThe ConversionQuality of MercyCaught in the ActThe Voyage HomeThe New BreedThe MessageI, RobotIf These Walls Could TalkBirthrightThe Voice of Reason (the only first-season flashback show)

$REVIEW.: This is the third Korean drama that I watched on Netflix with English subtitles


There are 25 episodes, and each episode is just over an hour long.Lee Min Ho stars as the arrogant, wealthy King bee at an exclusive high school


 He and his 3 friends (the &#34;F4&#34;) rule the school with cruel ruthlessness


 The heroine is a poor commoner who is given a scholarship to the high school for an act of bravery
She is subjected to relentless bullying instigated by the F4 boys

Over time, they realize that she has a heart of gold and they become her staunchest supporters.The hero gets 5 stars for his acting in this 25-episode series
He is perfect as the teenage high school king bee, sneering and snobby and filthy rich


He was very charming and endearing as he learned the pleasures of commoner food such as ramen.The heroine's acting in the first 7 episodes was hard to watch


She has a very narrow face which was usually scrunched up in pouts, sneers, and snivelling expressions that caused her chin and cheeks to have dimples and lines

Combined with the bags under her eyes, her slapstick overacting, her bowl cut hair with straight cut bangs, and deliberate stomping, clumpy gait, she overdid the petulent, childish, ugly duckling part and looked like a 35 year old in a bad wig with bad acting, rather than a spunky but sweet 16 or 17 year old.The initial episodes are about her difficulties fitting in at the new rich school

 As the plot progresses, the characters slowly mature

 As the heroine endures hardship after hardship, her character learns wisdom, stops pouting and snivelling, and as she becomes more reflective, serene, and wise, her acting improves immeasurably.The plot is like a teenage fantasy, a cross between Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling


Poor girl, neither smart or pretty, goes to rich school full of pretty rich people, ends up with the friendship of the four most swoon-worthy guys, and falls in love.Unfortunately, there are many, many, problems with the plot
It jumps from location to location without much explanation
The heroine keeps on starting new jobs, but there is no explanation about what happens to those jobs later on


Does she keep all 5-7 (I lost count) jobs until the end? There are many plots and it's hard to know which character knows what's really going on


 Does the hero know half of what his mother is doing to the heroine? Most of the misunderstandings could have been avoided if the main couple just talked to each other like normal people or friends

 Instead, it takes a very long time for the heroine to finally tell the hero what she decides to do after high school, or for the hero to tell her the problem with his mother
Even the last hour of the series was hard to believe

In the real world, you need ongoing communication to have a decent relationship.The first half of the series, every 1-2 episodes the heroine would fall unconscious (from beating, drowning, being drugged, exhaustion, etc.) or would need otherwise need rescuing from the F4


 Really? How much of a damsel in distress can she be? The only time she stands up for herself is if she is protecting someone else

Otherwise, she just stands there and waits to be hurt

 It helps that one of the F4 has an internal emergency bell that alerts him to go to her whenever she needs rescuing

 No, really, he says that in the story.The first half of the series, the hero is the absolute ruler of his little world


 The latter half he becomes a helpless victim, which was hard to believe

 Also hard to believe is that just having graduated from high school, with no further education, at the age of 19 or 20, he is appointed managing director of the most powerful Korean conglomerate? Really?Initially, the heroine's family was very vulgar, low class, and social climbing in intent


 They were also badly overacting


 It's only as the story unfolds that I could appreciate their love, bonding and generosity with each other

As they endure poverty, starvation and hardship, they became a prime example of what a family should be.I toughed it out and watched all 25 episodes

 It was worth it to watch Lee Min Ho, but the storyline and plot were hard to swallow
I liked that the heroine learned wisdom, acted kindly under fire, and brought a lot of happiness to other people

 The storyline is pretty unrealistic though.For a better series, I'd recommend Secret Garden

Even though it has a body swap premise, it is more realistic and better acted than Boys Over Flowers.

$review_text.: This isn't an easy film to watch but it is one of the year's stunners and I am shocked that it didn't get more attention when it came to the Oscar nominations. While I loved it for many reasons, not the least of which was a breakout performance by Casey Affleck, I'd have to say one of the most powerful aspects of this movie may be exactly the thing that turns so many viewers off- it takes a long, hard look at the moral complexities of life and the difficulty in doing the "right" thing and making the best choice, especially when it comes to children and their rights.Some people think that Casey Affleck, playing a young private investigator, comes across as rigidly moral and ethical, especially towards the end of the film. I think differently. All though the film, you can see him struggling with his anger, which threatens to overwhelm him (and does, at points) and his conscience as well as his religious values. More than once, he brings up what his priest would say about certain situations. Some things don't "rest easy" with him. And yet he has trouble figuring out why and how best to address his ambivalence. He can't seem to fathom the deepest ramifications of his decisions, to see clearly the potential for harm even when one is trying to do good.The movie revolves around the kidnapping of a child, her drug-addicted and inattentive mother and some private investigators who work with the police to try and find the child.Affleck's on-screen partner and lover, played by Angela Monaghan, almost steals the show and I think she was an important counterpart to Affleck's role, even though he is clearly meant to be the lead actor.Where he is often rigid in his opinions, she relates to people on a gut level and senses what is truly right and what could lead to more serious consequences. I found her compassion, heart and way of relating to people to be very compelling and moving.There is a key part of the movie where she doesn't hesitate to risk her life, leaving the men around her stunned at her nerve - and leaving me awed as well.The message I got? When one's beliefs are truly integrated with one's heart, then there is no hesitation during even life-threatening moments. Monaghan was willing to put her life on the line to try and save a child. At the end of the film, I believe she still felt that way and had come to a very different conclusion about how to do that than her partner. Watch it and see what you think - and why the lead characters made the choices they did.There are some parts of the film that may confuse and baffle viewers so I'll warn you right now about those:1. THe language and plot. Graphic, often bloody, full of every curse word you could imagine. Not one for the kids to watch. The dirty and seamier side of life is shown, in all its ugliness. People in this one are hard and some are permanently ungrounded.2. The mumbling and often inarticulate accents of the characters. This was not a distraction for me but it was for some of our friends. Those with even minor hearing issues may have a problem.3. The confusing plot line. It was NOT confusing for me to follow but I did watch the film three times. I'd also read the book. There are a lot of twists and turns in this film. Viewers have to stay alert and need to care about hanging in there. The film can drag in some parts.Even with all the potential pitfalls for viewers, I highly recommend Gone, Baby, Gone. It pushes viewers to think about what they'd do in a difficult situation. It raises questions and inspires debate. Finally, it reveals what brings couples together and the types of issues that can separate them irrevocably, based on one decision. The decision, of course, is not a minor one.

$REVIEW.: This United Artists release stars Francis Lederer as the Count coming to the United States using the identity of an artist he killed en route to visit his aunt
 The setting is a small, folksy town with good people

 The aunt, his female cousin and all around are fooled by the Count, whom while thought to be eccentric due to odd sleeping habits, maintains an aura of fascination due to his artistic temperment


 Problems begin when the young son in the family comes home with the news that his pet cat has been killed

 Then a female family friend is mysteriously anemic and proceeds to die

 The Count has begun his rampage


 Next, an investigator is killed by a dog (the Count)


 Suspicions grow as the female cousin discovers horrible paintings done by the Count showing her in a coffin
 The female friend is staked (a brief color shot in a b/w movie-quite shocking for a 50's movie) and the Count is finally cornered in his cave when he tries for the last time to victimize the niece

 Her boyfriend arrives to save her and drives the Count back with a cross, the latter loses his footing and well, you know, falls into a pit with a you know what at the bottom

 I highly recommend this 50's flick with a good cast and excellent creepy atmosphere

 Fangs for the memories.

$REVIEW.: SPIN takes a road much traveled - the coming of age tale of a child whose parents are suddenly absent - but the result is much stronger a story than most in this genre.  Based on the novel by Donald Everett Axinn and adapted for the screen by writer/director James Redford (yes, son of Robert Redford, but strong enough a talent not to need to depend on shadows!), SPIN is an evocative moment in history (the 1950s) when the world was more quiet and young people would work their ways through the maze of adolescence without clouds of outside threats. This, then, becomes more poignant and sensitive a study of one lad's growing up to become an adult facing mirrors of those faces from the past and the present.Eddie Haley (Max Madore) is very young when his parents die in a plane crash and is placed in the care of his parent's workers Margaret and Ernesto Bejarano (Dana Delaney and Rub&eacute;n Blades) at the decision of his pilot uncle Major Haley (Stanley Tucci) - a man whose own demons have left him seemingly invulnerable to intimacy and family, electing to move away from the Haley ranch and its responsibilities rather than raising Eddie.  Eddie's companion as a child is Francesca (Marissa Baca) who, while not an orphan, is motherless and living with a cruel father. They bond and in addition to the very supportive Bejaranos provide Eddie with as much footing as he is able to manage.Move forward to Eddie as a teenager (Ryan Merriman) and he has become a mild punk, floundering around seeking meaning to life and afraid of relationships - fearing he will be ultimately deserted.  Francesca (Paula Garc&eacute;s) moves back into town from Mexico and gradually the two become close and involved: Eddie's demons and issues riddle him while Francesca's equally brittle demons seem to make her stronger.  Major Haley returns, is at first greatly resented by Eddie until the Major teaches Eddie to fly a plane left to him by his departed father.  The relationship that develops between the two is as strong as it is difficult.  A tragedy involving Francesca and her father occurs resulting finally in Eddie's ability to feel mature emotions and follows his courage and his heart to change his and Francesca's lives.Redford keeps this potentially saccharine story in tight reins, never allowing bathos but always sharing a view that each of us is human and capable of errors, but equally capable of recovering and resolving  consequences.  The cast is uniformly strong with Tucci giving one of his finest and most subtle performances to date.  Merriman is young and shows great promise: Blades and Delany are seasoned veterans and bring a realistic rapport that adds to the credibility of a story also dealing with ethnic prejudice.  The cinematography by Paul Ryan is excellent - some of the best aerial photography outside of the usual war scenes on film.  Recommended, not because it is a great movie, but because it is an honest one and the first example of James Redford's seemingly generous talent.  Grady Harp, August 05

$REVIEW.: She's still upset that Fox cancelled it
Me, too, but I'm more used to idiocy in high places.But now we have the DVD set--and it's gorgeous


You have not seen "Firefly" until you have seen it in widescreen and real sound on a large screen (in my case, 42" plasma HD) TV

The images are sharp, the effects hold up very well, and the cast is as quirky as ever


Heck, the pilot episode alone is probably better than 90% of all SF films ever released

And, as my wife says, "No commercials."Firefly was intelligent, witty, a bit goofy, character-driven, and a lot of fun
Also had one of the best theme songs of any show of recent memory

So, of course, the network executives moved it around, forced the episodes to be shown out of order, then cancelled it abruptly.Imagine if those same executives had been running Fox when The X-Files started a decade ago
All we'd have would be a VHS set of a dozen or so episodes of Scully and Mulder


Bozos


All I can hope is that Joss Whedon succeeds in bringing "Firefly" to the big screen--and then back to the small one

$REVIEW.: I don't know why this film has such a terrible rep, it is actually the best thing Argento has done in ages

Other films like The Card Player and Do You Like Hitchcock are quite wobbly, whereas here the script and direction are well in hand

My main gripe would be that at times the pacing and actions of characters seem to be a little off, but nothing as bad as in  'Hitchcock'

And once again he manages to find the best looking women - the lady playing Brody's mother is ridiculous
This is easily worth a watch, but more as a conventional cop movie with the occasional over the top bit of gore.

$REVIEW.: The Bottom Line:Required viewing for fans of Rod Serling, Patterns is a sharp drama about the cutthroat practices of the modern (at the time) business world; its ending didn't sit well with me but I was mostly pleased by the film as a whole and if you're a big Twilight Zone nut you probably will be too.

$review_text.: ***** = the episodes*** = the DVDsDon't get me wrong, these are GREAT EPISODES, but for those of us who bought the 31 disc set from Columbia House 10 years ago in 2002, we have them all.It is disappointing that Carol Burnette & Time Life sprinkled some 10 new episodes in another 22-disc mega-set (NOT THIS 6 DVD SET) forcing us to re-buy most of what we already have, just to get 10 new episodes.  And I repeat, those 10 new episodes are NOT on this shorter 6 DVD set! You have to get the 22 Disc set.  I would quickly buy this set if it had the 10 new episodes.To top off the insult, if you buy the new 22-disc set to get the 10 new episodes not previously available, you still have to look for the old 31 disc set from 2002 because 22 episodes from that set have been left off of the new 22-disc set.If I sound cranky it is because I do not want to buy 15 discs of shows that I already have just to get 4 discs of new shows & 3 discs of bonus material. I would still have to keep the old set for the missing 22 episodes.This 6-disc set is just for those casual fans who either have not bought the previous 2002 31 disc set from Columbia House, or do not want to buy the mega-22 disc set currently being offered from Time-Life.

$review_text.: I purchased this DVD based on glowing recommendations from Amazon customers and Entertainment Weekly magazine.  Sadly, my husband and I don't share their enthusiasm.  The film is dark, crude, and crass: with torture cruelty, lots of cursing, and low-brow "humor".  In the first half-hour I think we possibly chuckled twice -- it fell that flat for us.  We gave up a bit before the halfway mark because we just weren't having any fun.Maybe we're just the wrong audience, though we have other Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn movies that we enjoy, and we like quirky humor.  However, we have a limited tolerance for cursing and very low threshold for cruelty and darkness.We recommend "The Maiden Heist" as a good alternative to "Safe Men".  "The Maiden Heist" has quirky humor and fine character actors (Christopher Walken, William H. Macy, and Morgan Freeman) and an enjoyable, and off-beat, heist premise.  It has a few curse words, but not many, and the three characters are quite endearing.

$review_text.: I would like this Blu-Ray release if the video wasn't missing a lot of the top and bottom of the original picture. It's been forced into widescreen by cropping/cutting picture off of the top and bottom of the video and then they added black bars to the sides so it didn't look stretched and set it to play as widescreen.I want the original 1:33 aspect ratio with all of the picture there and the top and bottom not being cut off of the original image.Other than that, the release is nice and so is its features.

$review_text.: I enjoy good historical films on most any topic, particularly one which promises adventure.  I purchased Arn, based on some of the reviews in this section.I was very much disappointed.  The film is poorly edited and rather tedious.  It looks and plays out much for what it is, a television production (although many made for tv films can be excellent).Anyone interested in the Crusades period would be well advised to buy or rent Kingdom of Heaven which is immensely entertaining and very well done.Arn, on the other hand, looks like a budget film, and its story could be told in half the time.Best performance in the Mother Abbess--the onkly good thing to look for in this film.Like I say, save your money--Arn is not worth buying.  I would never watch it again, so it will collect dust in my dvd library.One very excellent historical film made in 2010 is worth mentioning--Agora---by all means watch or buy that one, not Arn.

$review_text.: I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid betweenOn Golden PondandThe Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall's sentimental direction and Mark Andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005's execrableMonster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the nave Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending.There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly's former flame and Rachel's new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon's sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall.

$REVIEW.: I had not watched the film in years until I bought this DVD.Watched it on 9-11-10 so when you see the twin towers at the beginning of the film.A film for it's time & it is Michael's movie for his Best Actor winner role.  His 2cd Oscar.I am NOT a fan of Charlie Sheen never have been so of course I did not like him in this film.Sean Young & Daryl Hannah after "Blade Runner" working together again, this time in the same scene.Sean's character was a spoiled I do nothing let the servants do it trophy wife.  Hannah's character WAS NOT NEEDED IN THE FILM.What was the point of this character?  To design Bud's new apartment with UGLY ART WORK & BAD COLOR PAINT.  Time could have been saved in NOT having this character in here-WAS NOT NEEDED.  DID NOTHING TO THE STORY.And, of course, Sean & Daryl's movie career was pretty much over when the 1980's ended.James Spader doing a James Spader role-done this bit how many times James?Rereleased to promote the 2cd film.  Now Gordon is supposed to have a daughter in the new film, looks like a guy in a dress.  In this original film they have a son & the KID LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THEM.  Both of them were fit, the kid over weight.  Oliver Stone let this gaffe in the 2cd film to happen.  Bad job Oliver.I like the film but this DVD is POOR.Extras, what extras?  Where is a making of the film?  The extras are a joke but as long as they get to promote the new film....And, no chapter list & IT HAS ONE OF THESE CHEAP PLASTIC DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  THESE ARE CHEAP & CAN DAMAGE THE DVD'S.WHOEVER DESIGNED THESE IS AN IDIOT & WHATEVER DVD DESIGNER WHO USES THEM IS AN IDIOT AS WELL.Review for film NOT DVD package  That would be a 0 if they had that rating.

$REVIEW.: I'm even now, a week after screening the film, still trying to process it.This has the look and feel of a very low budget independent. But despite the simple stages and unfinished facade, I can discern a much more polished and sophisticated hand in the craftsmanship. The depth of story presented in this movie is difficult to categorize. And that particular kind of difficulty, to me, speaks of a visionary talent.Tells the tale of two very offbeat people and their circle of equally odd family and friends. Although these characters seem much more than the usual motley group of shy wallflowers and social outcasts. My understanding of high-functioning autistics is limited - but many of the characters, especially the principals, seem to exhibit behaviors that I associate with such individuals.Lily is a wonderfully sweet and unassuming young woman who works the counter at a burger joint. A pariah among her fellow workers, she's constantly dismissed, disrespected and generally treated very poorly. Her only perk - the daily lunch visit by a video sales clerk in a neighboring business. He's the male Yin to her Yang. Not just emotionally, but physically, as she feels connected by virtue of a shared facial beauty mark. She's obviously smitten, but the object of her affection is unaware; completely oblivious to the signals being sent. We soon find out why.The bespectacled video store employee is Jarrod, a strange young man who only makes intermitent eye contact and communicates in terse, brittle statements of fact. No inflection, pitch or verse - just a monotone drone of transmitted information. Unless he's upset, which is often. And importantly, doesn't seem to appreciate the rather intense amorous attention being pointed in his direction.Sadly, Lily's odd behavior and inability to socialize with her fellow co-workers has created tension perceived too difficult to manage, and a staged bogus reduction-in-force is enacted; essentially firing her under a false pretext. But this cowardly act is actually a blessing in disguise, freeing her to take action on her feelings. She picks up a tossed invitation from the garbage, originally intended for a co-worker, to a costume party being thrown by Jarrod and his friends. So begins the tale of The Eagle and The Shark, as Lily discovers that her new beau is a man on a very unusual, almost quixotic, mission.These two misfits somehow, almost magically, manage to find one another along the rough back roads of life. In exploring this fascinating mating dance, the cast reveals a completely oblique love story that's both tender and uncomfortable.Very reminiscent of the documentary 'Crumb', though thankfully benign and less tragic.Movie Note:- What I mean by visionary: The intensely subtle nuance crafted by Director Taika Waititi. If you look closely at Jarrod's bedroom, every single item is a powerful description of just who and what he is. The obsessive/compulsive need to outline tools on a work board, fastidiously detailed model airplanes, superhero figurines, crude drawings of himself as a 'man/bear' and warrior, mounted martial arts weapons on the wall, and a puma lion drawing over his bedboard - taken collectively scream volumes that he's only an adult by virtue of chronological date, a boy in a man's body. Yet that scene is less than 30 seconds of the film; you actually have to freeze-frame it in order to grasp the amazing attention to detail.And later, we learn that his creativity is born less from a desire for personal expression and more a reflection of his jealousy - a dead older brother that had accomplished all the feats that he cannot quite grasp. Where Jarrod puts up martial art posters and hangs asian weapons on the wall - his brother earned a black belt in karate. Sketches that Jarrod attempts are a pale reflection of his late brother's ability to paint. And so on.It's a profound moment when Lily enters both bedrooms and grasps the source of Jarrod's conflicted passions and sense of impotence.Again, to me, speaks volumes of a sublime filmmaker and his craft.

$REVIEW.: If this wasn't a book, I wouldn't believe it. If this wasn't a movie, It would have to be a book, and I still wouldn't believe it. This is how incredible, under-rated and underlooked Terry Gilliam's &quot;Brazil&quot; is. And no amount of verbosity can measure up to what this film is. The zany, off-beat, and sometimes blunt and sadistic humor of Pythoner Terry Gilliam is mixed with the undertones of a all-knowing, &quot;Big Brother&quot; government, Central Services and the Minstry of Information in post-modern society fraught with over commercialism, strict conformity, swift yet undemocratic justice, a common interest in the greater good, an over reliance on facts and figures, in short, a world defunct of dreams and imagination. Enter Sam Lowry, a person like any other, an employee of the Ministry of Information, who kindles his imagination and love interest in an environment that enforces the opposite of that. Ultimately, through a series of events and complications between his friends, mother, and a conspicuous revelutionaire played excellently by Robert DeNiro, who specializes in sabotaging the handiwork of Central Services, Sam must face the reality of his world versus his own dreams and hopes. The Criterion Collection edition of Brazil is absolutely splendid! Remastered and re-edited, Gilliam presents &quot;Brazil&quot; in its final cut. The second disc provides plenty of behind the scenes insight with pictures, documentaries, and commentaries that go in depth into the creation of &quot;Brazil&quot;. The third disc is not incredibly wonderful, but worth checking out as it is the re-cut of the original made into the &quot;Love Conquers All&quot; version of &quot;Brazil&quot; for all you optimists. &quot;Brazil&quot; is Gilliam at his best, a true masterpiece of the imagination! &quot;Brazil&quot; excels on many levels, and it's all captured here on this remarkable 3 DVD set!

This Bond does offer a few more twists than the previous helpings but still keeping to the old Bond formula which as been of great success.  The Bond girls sexy as ever, but I did have a problem with Denise  Richards(Dr Christmas) as a Doctor(she just doesn't look the part), but who  cares its Bond. The action is quick, lines funny(the ones about Dr.  Christmas are the best yet) and the best open scene of all the Bonds. One  of my favourite Bonds, but maybe not as good as Goldeneye. This will be a  great DVD to have. If you don't like Bond, you won't like it, if you do  you'll love it.

$review_text.: SLEEPSTALKER surprised me.  It's an effective, chilling, if flawed, horror movie.  Give Michael Harris credit for a chilling portrayal of the Sandman, both before and after his sandy transition.  Kathryn Morris (who now has a hit series, WITHOUT A TRACE) has one of her early roles as Megan, the heroine.  Jay Underwood gets a little histrionic, but at least he puts everything into his role as Griffin, the young man who saw his parents murdered by the Sandman seventeen years earlier.  The direction is good and the cinematography very atmospheric.  Teresa Straley's haunting rendition of SLEEP BABY SLEEP sent chills up my spine for its sweet, yet ominous, overtones.Effectively haunting, not gory, but spooky all the same.

$review_text.: Due South followed the misguided adventures of Benton Fraser, a constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as he tracked his father's killers to Chicago. After closing the case, his Canadian superiors advised him to lie low, so he remains in Chicago as a liaison at the Canadian consulate and works cases with Ray Vecchio, Chicago cop. The Canadian/American and wilderness/city culture clash leads to some humorous moments along the way.The picture quality is noticeably grainy since it was taken from videotape rather than the masters, but for the great price (I now have all the seasons for less than one season of the Canadian box set), it's a compromise that was worth it. Like the Canadian set, there are no extras, also no closed captioning. Menus are bare bones and include episodes and chapter menus (hardly "interactive" menus as stated on the box). The packaging is a big step from the clunky Canadian design, featuring an attractive foldout cardboard case with large photos of Ray, Benton, and Dief. The DVDs are single sided, meaning easier handling.And all 18 second season episodes are here, including the supposed series finale "Flashback" (the show was resurrected from the dead for the third season, when they were already destroying sets and many of the original cast had other work). Second season standouts include Juliet is Bleeding, One Good Man a.k.a. Thank You Kindly, Mr. Capra, Some Like It Red (Benny in drag!), and All the Queen's Horses (the funniest episode on record -- singing Mounties!).Although the picture quality is less than stellar, it certainly beats my old videotaped copies that were rapidly deteriorating, and it's wonderful to reconnect with the excellent scripts, jokes, and friendly jabs at Canadian culture (curling, hockey, bilingualism, politeness, etc.).

$REVIEW.: Greetings;Nothing new mind you, Rowan Atkinson felt that he was being typecasted with acting in parts much like Bean

But he had a good run, several movies, several seasons in BBC terms as well as the animated series and a Wii video game based on the animated episodes
The physical aspects that would often go into his playing the part was probably also getting to be a bit too much, especially when expected to act like a child
But enough about that.Been a big fan since I was much much younger

Used to have a couple of the episodes on VHS, the movie, the best bits of bean-which is what this review is really about mind you-as well as several tapes to the Thin Blue Line show which when I was much much younger, I couldn't understand what they had to do with Mr
Bean-which is to say they have nothing to do with each other, just a few actors here and there
I upgraded to dvd over the years and for some time had the 'complete' series which included the tv show and nothing else
I also bought the best of Mr
Bean Vol

1 which I thought was what this was supposed to be but in fact, it isn't
My main point in all this is that while the Best bits of Mr
Bean is a flashback episode as many have been quick to point out, it is still an episode


I don't care for the snippets so much since there is a lot left out of some of them-the crushed car scene-he falls to his knees and the scene ends, as though he were more upset by the whole thing but the scene would contine in the show to reveal him pulling the deadbolt off his driver side door and acting as though everything were fine


Makes the scene more dramatic but still

I wanted it for the element that strung it all together
Him digging around his attic as it gives you even more of a glimpse into his flat


How he lives not that much else is revealed but still-all of the other things he has stored away in there, so many other unaddressed stories.They did return to the attic a bit in the animated series but still


Just fun to see something more of Bean


Even if some of his bits are things he had done before apart from bean, elements from his stand-up and sketches
But it is all in good fun

Oh, but do see his one man show
Loved him as the headmaster and as the Devil-Toby.Thank you and take care...

$SUMMARY.: Too bad that he's retired now...

$review_text.: Okay, it was a nice story. It seemed like the film people who want to preserve film took up residency in my living room.  I agree that film and art should be preserved.  So why can't the studios that make hundreds of millions of dollars on modern movies kick back a little to the preservation of their art.  The movie Hugo was just a tad bit too long.  I think it was trying to become lengthier than the movie Ghandi.  The special effects were fantastic, and the music soundtracks were pleasant.  There is a lot of good things to say about the movie, but at the same time it was like watching a political push for movie preservation or an all day Jerry Lewis telethon.  I get the impression that all of the academy awards were given to this movie because of what it promoted, and not for being the best in each of the categories - very transparent.  I like buying girl scout cookies, but I don't have to have the girl scouts come into my living room to sell their cookies or their cause - I just want to enjoy the cookies.  Either make a movie or hold a telethon.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone but those who enjoy good music and special effects.  The story could have been told in a short half-hour movie, not three hours.  See for yourself, and prepare to be bored.I recommend buying a box of girl scout cookies instead - They taste good and won't take three hours to digest.

$review_text.: Shaun Cassidy, former star of the Hardy Boys and singer of such pop hits as "Da Doo Run Run" and "That's Rock And Roll" grows up to be a writer/producer. He overcame the critics of the 70s who tried to pass him off as a clone of his brother, David and carved a niche of his own in the pop world, rather successfully, I may add. Unfortunately, though through no fault of his own, Shaun has never had a bonafide hit in the television field with his written masterpieces. American Gothic was one of these gems. Invasion was the most recent casualty of a network's mishandling of the sci-fi or horror fantasy genre.American Gothic was the tale of Trinity, South Carolina and its strange happenings. Run by Sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole), the Devil incarnate, it is the tale of his coming to terms with his illegitimate son, Caleb Temple (Lucas Black) whom he wants to follow in his footsteps with the interference of returning prodigal cousin, reporter Gail Emory (Rescue Me's Paige Turco) and the town doctor Matt Crower (Medium's Jake Weber)as well as the supernatural influence of Caleb's dead sister, Merlyn. Produced by Shaun Cassidy and Evil Dead's Sam Raimi, American Gothic is a veritable classic tale of good vs. evil it's release marking it's 10th anniversary of broadcast including all 22 episodes, four of which were only broadcast on the Sci-Fi network. Trinity is a town, once visited, you will never forget....a town where there are skeletons in every closet. Sad to say, but Universal screwed up the true order of the episodes, but they are all here, and as one great reviewer here noted already, the true order as they should be viewed. This is the only thing that prevents me from giving this great set the five stars the package richly deserves.

$REVIEW.: Though one of director John Woo's cult favourites, Hard Boiled actually ranks on my list as his worst post-1986 Hong Kong film, even after the farcical Once a Thief.Overlength is Hard Boiled's chief weakness.  After  spending over an hour in that hospital with flames all around and  innumberable men in suits getting shot, it starts to get tiring.  Chow  Yun-fat is impeccable in the lead and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is excellent,  though versatile actress Teresa Mo is wasted in a skin-deep supporting  role.The biggest thing to commend on this video release, however, is the  dubbing.  I speak both Cantonese and English, personally, and I can tell  American viewers that the dubbed script is even better than the original,  which sounded stilted (Philip Chan Yan-kin's lines were especially forced  in the original).  The dubbed voices were acting, not just translating (as  in dubbed Jackie Chan movies such as the U.S. release Operation Condor, for  example).  This was one marvelous dubbing job, and a rare instance in which  I would almost prefer the dubbed version to the subtitled. Kudos to Orion  for doing the movie justice.

$REVIEW.: John Huston's film of MOBY DICK is perhaps a rare exception

It's a great film in its own right, apart from the great novel upon which it is based
The case can easily be made that this film does not 'do justice' to the book, if only for the reason that it does not cover every aspect of Melville's original
But this film proves that a slavish literary imitation is not necessary for a great film.Huston also fought with Ray Bradbury over the screenplay


The great science fiction author was literally reduced to tears by the gruff director, and he wrote a book about the experience


There was also some conflict over the casting of Gregory Peck as Ahab

Some say Orson Welles or Leo Genn (Starbuck) would have been a better choice


This may well be, but it should be admitted that Peck rises to the occasion when it's called for

The great scene with the Spanish doubloon and the great scene with Starbuck on the bridge, where Ahab explains his obsession

Few other actors are likely to have surpassed these moments.According to IMDb, MOBY DICK was shot in 1.66:1 aspect ratio


This DVD does not present the film in that ratio, yet it does not appear to be a pan & scan transfer

The film looks very good and and nothing appears to have been done to tamper with the color
This is most likely how it should look


The director fought with the studio over the color process used in MOBY DICK: it's intentional


He and the cinematographer were trying to capture a visual style that would be evocative of a period style of painting that would contribute to the mood of the story.Anyone interested in background on this film should read THE HUSTONS by Lawrence Grobel


The harrowing production is detailed, with plenty of attention given to the above-mentioned conflicts and also to the shooting of the INCREDIBLE final sequence.Some extras would have been welcome, but this DVD is more than worth owning by any fan of Melville, Huston or American film.

$review_text.: My initial resistance to this film was it's length and the subtitles.  Once this superb thriller sinks it's claws into you those concerns go out with the bathwater.  This film works on two levels.  Primarily as a labarynthine mystery surrounding the disappearance of a sixteen year old girl in 1966.  Secondly it's a character study of the film's title character, Elsbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).  As layers of Salander's past are revealed her mystique multiplies.  I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy but after seeing Rapace's account of Salander I'm salivating at the mouth.  Currently they're prepping American versions of Stieg Larrson's novels from which these films are based.  That brings to my mind "La Femme Nikita" and it's lame American photocopy, "Point of No Return".  I hope when they translate these works for U.S. audiences they bring a little inspiration to the table and not money grubbing cynicism.

$REVIEW.: It helps that Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best films, period, running a close second behind City Lights (I hope that's next on the re-release list).  And happily, unlike The Gold Rush, which was ruined by awful sound choices, the Modern Times DVD offers a clean transfer of the film with all the beloved original elements intact as far as I could see and hear, plus a host of extras.The film itself is the most briskly paced of Chaplin's feature-length films.  And his writing is sharp, unhindered by the sermonizing which permeates his last works.  The dilemma facing our Little Tramp this time is something all of us can relate to:  For the first time, we see him thinking ahead, wanting to have a future, to form a family, and working towards that end.  Chaplin's physical-comedy skills are at their peak:  Witness the extended takes of the rollerskate scene, and the factory assembly line.  Even if the 18fps (sometimes 16fps) film speed made everything look faster than it really was, it's still impressive physical co-ordination requiring flawless execution, since Chaplin rarely edits using coverage.In Modern Times we see one of the first truly well-rounded Chaplin heroines.  The radiant Paulette Goddard was Chaplin's best leading lady, her high spirits and lively presence being a much better foil for Chaplin than the starry-eyed icons of perfection that were Georgia Hale, Edna Purviance, or Virginia Cherrill.  She just has more star quality and brings a quirkier, more animated personality to Chaplin's films, balancing them nicely.And the gags -- some of the best in the Chaplin canon.  The eating machine always has me rolling on the floor; the nonsense song is terrific (the DVD offers a &quot;karaoke&quot; version which, though a novelty, does tell us finally what the lyrics actually are); and all the machine gags are fast-moving gems.The bonus materials include a long outtake and several documentaries.  &quot;Chaplin Today&quot; features guests Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, the French filmmakers behind the film Rosetta, and though their film-historian banter is not entirely to my taste, they do bring up some insights that I hadn't observed about Modern Times.In all, a great release, and a great DVD to have for movie nights.  It's a wonderful presentation of a comedy classic.

$review_text.: I truly loved, strike that, really liked this flick. To love this movie is perhaps an obsession saved for the pages of a Stephen King novel or a sign that I need help. This movie is very, very violent both overtly and passively. You are left with a sense that New York is nothing but a cesspool. While many non-New Yorkers might agree, I think its gritty cinematography and dialogue, really work to amplify the murderer's personality. Not only is he deadly insane, but also he is the deadliest in a world filled with violence.In addition, I think the movie has an originality that makes you smack your forehead and wonder why you hadn't written it first. It is the perfect tale where we all already understand the symbols and the motivations, but they are turned on their head. It was as if Hieronymus Bosch was the writer and we are looking at the modern day incarnation of the last panel of the Garden of Earthly Delights. In essence, the grotesque is used to shock, but also to teach us. The lesson could be religious or the fact great horrors have been committed under religion's banner. Or, which is most likely, that films are simply to make money.This movie has great acting beyond its violent and disturbing story. It is so good I don't think there is a movie studio that could afford to ever reassemble the four key actors to make another movie-Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, &amp; Gwenyth Paltrow. This power pack puts the story beyond other disturbing tales like Kubrick's Clockwork Orange into a lasting package that, had it been a more tame topic, would be a standard on television for years. This movie belongs only a notch bellow the pinnacle of serial killer movies, Silence of the Lambs, and light years beyond such utterly awful attempts like Hannibal &amp; Copy Cats. This is a great movie, but definitely not for children or the faith of heart.

$review_text.: This is a great movie about a kid named Spencer Griffith. He is a pretty normal 12-year-old who gets bullied around a lot. He's into comic books. He wants to be friends with a certain girl in his class but whenever he tries to talk to her he goes mute.One day while he was sitting in his room alone he sees something fall from the sky and land in the local junkyard. He goes to investigate and finds an a capsule. He throws a rock at it. Nothing happens, so he touches it. It opens up to reveal an alien suit that asks him if he needs transport. He says yes and goes inside. Spencer then proceeds to go around town having fun in his suit and getting back at his bullies. But a bigger evil is lurking around and soon he needs to decide the fate of mankind.This is an excellent movie, it is a bit cheesy at times but I like it. Joseph Mazzello is superb as Spencer. This is also the first movie where he was the biggest name. I give this great movie 5 stars. But I don't recommend it to anyone who is not a child at heart or you'll just shrug it off as a bad cheesy movie.PS: Is it just me, or does every Joseph Mazzello movie have things thrown? Especially rocks. Jurassic Park, Radio Flyer, Simon Birch, Three Wishes, and The Cure all have things thrown. It's a Joseph Mazzello movie trademark.

$review_text.: I allways wished someone would make a movie that really reflects what life is about ; life does not come with a senario or background music or a convenient ending, it ends abruptly, in the middle of a ''scene''.  After seeing ''The Widow of Saint-Pierre''  I wished someone would make another movie with Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche.  Well someone did but shouldn't have.  The relationship between the two caracters does not, as mentionned elswhere, deteriorate ; it is rotten from the start and just stays that way, everything in this movie just ''stays that way'' save for a sensationnalist scene which is poorly brought about and which I will not describe should you choose to put yourself through the ordeal of watching this pseudo-intellectual, amateurish flic.  I did not find Daniel Auteuil's acting up to his usual standards, not very convincing, perhaps he was also bored...Juliette Binoche had it easy, she just kept that blaz&eacute; expression through the entire movie...Maybe she was bored too.  This director should certainly not be compared to Bergman, Hitchcock or Antonioni.  I truly got nothing from watching this movie but I guess I asked for it, spare yourself the ordeal.

$REVIEW.: I have a Cinemascope screen to correctly show the movie without black bars, the on and off insertion of IMAX squarish shots ruins the presentation because I have to constantly put the projector out of its Cinemascope setting for each shot otherwise the taller IMAX images spill over the top and bottom of the screen.To avoid that I was forced to see the whole movie with black bars just because of the continuos IMAX tall shots inserted throughout the entire movie. I know that most people have HDTV sets that are 16x9 and will see the black bars anyway and the IMAX shots would use the whole screen, but not for Cinemascope home theaters projecting a movie that supose to be Cinemascope.When I saw the movie at the local theater I do not remember if the IMAX shots forced the aspect ratio of the projection to be adjusted, I believe the image used the whole width of the screen all the time. Perhaps the IMAX theaters showed it the way the Bluray is, but there should be two versions of discs then.Consideration should be given also to newer HDTV sets that are Cinemascope 2.35:1 aspect ratio that show widescreen movies without black bars, these TVs were specifically designed to do so and they would show most of this movie correctly, but would cut the top/bottom of all the IMAX shots.The Bluray should either have a menu to choose for either aspect ratio to display constantly, rather than switching between formats on its own, or two discs should have been offered for the consumer to choose depending on the display device they have.

$REVIEW.: I have the Classic Albums video of &quot;Aja&quot; by Steely Dan, so I expected the Elton John DVD to stick to the same formula - which it did
 Contemporary interviews are interspersed with archival footage of the recording sessions
 Elton discusses various aspects of the songwriting process, and which songs should or should not have been released as singles


 At the time, he fought against &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot; being released as a single, but thankfully the record company prevailed and it became a #1 hit

 He regrets that by the time &quot;Harmony&quot; would have been issued as a 45, &quot;Caribou&quot; had been released and &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot; was issued as the next single to promote that album

 Bernie Taupin talks about the inspiration and meaning of his lyrics

 He reveals that &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; wasn't just about Marilyn Monroe but is representative of anyone who dies young and at the peak of their career, mentioning James Dean and Jim Morrison as examples

 The core Elton John band members finally get their due


 Nigel Olsson discusses not only his drumming duties but his background singing as well
 As he admits, his voice was so loud that he sometimes had to sing with his back to the microphone!  Davey Johnstone demonstrates some excellent guitar riffs

 He mentions that he came up with the classic, rocking intro to &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting.&quot; Dee Murray, Elton's bass player, unfortunately passed away, but is fondly remembered
 It's interesting to examine all of the elements that went into the making of &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; one of the few double albums to reach number one in both the American and English charts.

You think the movie will be about the kipnapper and him bonding. It ends earlier however and the kidnapper has to flee to England. FW has asked him to take care of his 'girlfriend' which he does.

$review_text.: I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie; it was much darker than I had thought it would be and the ending was really sad (to me at least)


 Very hard to describe this but I guess I would call it a Rock n Roll Cyberpunk Action Thriller Drama

 This is definately not for young children but teenagers and adults that enjoy edgy movies will find this a winner.

$review_text.: When this film first hit theaters back in 2007, it spawned a whole collection of "Bucket Lists" (a list of things to do before you "kick the bucket", as the saying goes).  It seemed a little sappy and contrived ("can those two old goats really carry a film these days?" was one of my mindsets), so it took me until now to see it.  I wish I would have "relented" sooner!Basically, the plot of this film centers on two characters: the filthy-rich, uptight Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and the family-loving, laid-back Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  The two happen to meet while sharing a hospital bed, and (though grudgingly at first) begin to form a bond over their advancing ages.  When Cole notices a strange "Bucket List" scrawled out on a napkin by Chambers, he decides to make the list a reality.  The two gallivant around the country together, embarking on such journeys as skydiving, seeing the Pyramids, and climbing a mountain (to name a few).In terms of evaluating the overall plot of the movie, it is always sincere, bordering on downright sappiness or pure cheese.  If you can get past the idea that the two "old codgers" are doing things that would completely tax men half their age, the story will suck you in.  If not, you won't buy in and thus miss the emotional payoff in the final scenes.However, whatever credibility issues arise from the plot, the film is so superbly acted that it almost doesn't even matter.  The chance to watch such legends as Nicholson and Freeman work their magic together is an opportunity that should not be missed.  These men, contrary to the "pretty boys" and "sex symbols" of the current generation, are the cream of the crop in terms of dramatics and emotional performances.  So, even if the plot doesn't hook you in, just watching those two stalwarts act will provide much enjoyment!Thus, though not an instant classic or anything like that, "The Bucket List" is a charming little film that will make you laugh, perhaps even shed a tear at the end, and leave you contemplating your own life and relationship with those around you.

$REVIEW.: This is the best action movie I have seen since "The Matrix." I liked Matt Damon's character. He was very human and believable. I like the story, even though, at the end, you realize there is no story. But I liked how the movie leads you the finale, with a crescendo of suspense and chilling action. I liked the acting. I liked the Matrix-like fighting scenes; they were done soberly, and not over-applied like in most recent movies. I liked especially the European setting of the whole story. As I said to a friend after watching the movie, this is a cheap way to see Paris.

$review_text.: It is very odd that we can just lose parts of films into the ether. People who have nobley gone out and done their research, seeking out Passollini with a sincere curiosity are being rewarded with a misleading, partial work, presented as the whole. Is this the work of the prudish puritans, insensitive capitalists or a natural disaster? Who knows.What we do know is that the DECAMERON was clearly based on the number ten, not eight. Ten stories, as the original book has ten narrators, each telling ten stories. Passollinni even divided the film up three and seven to relflect the three men and seven women who told the stories in the book. Important? Maybe not.What is significant is that part of the movie is missing! and Passollini's statement, and of course he was making a statement, is incomplete.

I would not recommend this to young viewers that are getting started on the Monkees. Seeing Howard Coasell and Terri Garr was a real treat! Even seeing Micky blow up that Coke machine was really cool! If the creators wanted to kill the Monkees project in a big way, they almost did it in one film. The best thing about the Movie was the DANDRUFF sequence... The bad thing is that Davy managed to escape and got to dance with Toni Basel, who would go on to do the chearleader video &quot;MICKY...&quot; other then that it was a miserable attempt of a film......

$REVIEW.: All the actors were planning for the fourth season, so it just ended with no closure

 In the last season there were more boob shots of Ginger and Maryanne that kept you watching and trying to decide who you like more, and for me it was .....Well needless to say, the program was entering into the challenge of social norms just as all the shows of the tlme like Beverly Hillbillies, Pettycoat Junction, I Dream of Jeanie, and Get Smart, etc


because pretty girls sell the show more than content
 The exceptions being All in the Family and The Jeffersons which were just straight funny


 Gilligan's Island just needed more time
 I do think the role of Gilligan did degrade a little in some episodes.

$REVIEW.: This is probably the best season of "Tales from The Crypt" in my opinion! you have it all here: vampires, gore, lust, revenge, zombies, and all the just desserts


Like usual, there is the all-star cast such as the late William Hickey, Lance Henriksen,Kelly Preston, Jeffery Tambor from "Terminator 1 & 2", Demi Moore, Michael Ironside, Don Rickles, Sam Kinison, Miguel Ferrer, Bobcat Goldthwait, Patrica Arquette, Morton Downey Jr., Jessica Harper, Teri Hatcher, Iggy Pop, Kathy Seagall ( Futurama and Married with Children), and Larry Drake especially a directorial debut of Arnold Schwartzenger who even does an appearence.The following stories are "Dead Right" which deals with a lovely woman who visits a fortune teller as her fortune is true as now she must marry a obese man but it might be a disaster
Next is "The Switch" which is about a old man who is obsessed with a beautiful girl as he begins to sell his body with his fortune to a mad doctor for a new young body in order to impress her but finds more than he bargained for

"Cutting Cards" is about a gambler who plays a game of literally loosing a limb in a game, then with " Till Death" has a yuppie land owner who's girlfriend buys a special potion from a island voodoo lady as she won't literally stay dead
"Three's a Crowd" about a husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him but on their anniversary he goes insane, " The Thing from The Grave" is about a model's fiancee who abuses her as she falls for her photographer as he kills him but unfortunately revenge from beyond the grave starts

In "Judy, You're Not Yourself Today" is about a married woman who tries on a magic necklace that switches her soul to a witch's body, next is " Fitting punishment" has a urban feel to it as the story is about a orphan who works with his unkind mortician uncle who cripples, cuts off his feet and kills him as later he seeks revenge from the grave

"Korman's Kalamity" is a strange but interesting story about an artist who is married to a rotten wife but his creations literally come to life causing murders and falls for a beautiful cop, "Lower Birth" is the origin story of the Cryptkeeper and a story of a two-faced sideshow freak falls for a new carnival attraction which is a buried alive ancient mummy

"Mute Witness" is about a woman who witness the murder of a neighbor done by a man as it traumatizes her as her doctor maybe behind this, "Television Terror" deals with a tabloid television who takes his crew to film inside a haunted house, next is " My Brother's Keeper" is about Siamese twins when one of them falls for a woman but the other goes completely mad to kill and finally the last story is " The Secret" is about a 12 year old orphan that has been picked up by a rich couple that feeds him whatever he wants and befriends a kind butler, but later he will find what their secret is.The extras are preety good like the behind the scenes of season 2 documentary and a look at the Tales from The Crypt radio program! a must have set if you love the show.

$review_text.: I read lots of ultra-hype about this movie before seeing it in the theater, which raised my expectations
I am guilty of reading what the critics print


It seems there must have been some kind of "love this movie, it's great" plague when reviewing this movie
On Rotten Tomatoes, it rated at around 90% positive, which is stellar on that site


Yes, my expectations were very high.***SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD, READ WITH CAUTION:***I just felt that there were too many "mini-situations" thrown into the mix


Some worked and some did not
The police station incident seemed overly predictable, Jackass-like, and thrown in for filler.Tigers are endangered, so I hate seeing real tigers used in movies


I could not find any humor in the use of the tiger for gags.The baby! It's not funny to leave your baby with a group of total strangers who are drunk and drugged
He was found in the closet! I know it is only a movie, but I could not find that humorous.I laughed in the theater and had fun, but at the same time I left thinking I had seen a comedy that "tried too hard with as many failures as successes" to get the laughs

I still recommend it as a rental

$REVIEW.: I don't know why this DVD is so hard to get. Can it be that the subject matter is still too sensitive? This was a truly groundbreaking film in 1951, tackling the evils of the KKK, with strong performances from Ginger Rogers, Doris Day and Steve Cochran. Ronald Reagan is wooden as usual, and the role certainly should have been given to a stronger actor. Despite Reagan, this is an absorbing and compelling film that deserves rediscovery.

$REVIEW.: Being of the adventurous sort, I tend to like to try new things now and then


 When Happy Hell Night (1992) appeared on my radar, I thought, "What the heck?"  I mean, it does list Darrin McGavin and Sam Rockwell in its' credits, and I usually enjoy those two actors


 Well, color me a sucker, because that's what I felt like after spending a grueling 87 minutes on this abominable turkey
 It's funny, the blurb on the back of the DVD case touts how this `rarely-seen' film was re-mastered from original vault elements and presented totally uncut and uncensored, like the company that released this to DVD found some kind of lost cinematic gem

 Well, after watching it, the reason why this movie was rarely seen became painfully apparent...it stinks...Written and directed by someone named Brian Owens (his only directing credit), this Yugoslavian/Canadian production suffers from a great many problems

 The story is mostly set in a frat house, and centers on some kind of competition between the fraternities with regards to who can pull off the greatest Hell Night (Halloween) prank and win whatever honors that entails


 The boys at Phi Delta Kappa have come up with an idea based on an event that happened twenty-five years earlier, involving some kind of black ritual that occurred in a graveyard mausoleum which led to the massacre of like seven people, many of them members of the same fraternity
 Incorporating the customary hazing ritual for new members into the prank, the frat decide to send a couple of pledges to the state insane asylum to try and get a photograph of the killer who has been locked away for so many years
 The pledges manage to break in, but end up releasing an incomprehensible horror in the form of a killer ghoul and the massacre begins anew, with the fraternity being the focal point


 What's the big secret behind the atrocities that happened so many years ago?Okay, so what did I like about this film?  Well, some of the scenes shot on location were pretty good...and that's about it...seriously

 I came into this thing expecting so little and I couldn't even get that


 The film began with a promising start, but the downhill slide was fast and furious

 First, the plot made little sense, and even when I knew what was going on, it still made no sense

 There were a few flashbacks in the movie, but the time line was seriously screwy as Sam Rockwell (who was 23 when the film came out) appeared briefly in the film, in the flashbacks, which were supposed to be twenty-five years previous, putting the character's age at about 20

 Now Darren McGavin (in his late 60's at the time the film was released) played Rockwell's character in the present day, twenty-five years later


 This is about the right amount of suspension of disbelief the makers of this film expect from the audience, a nearly 70 year old man is supposed to represent a 20 year old man after 25 years have past?  I didn't even realize the two characters were supposed to be the same guy until the film beat me over the head with the concept.The killer started out kind of creepy, a small, bald-headed man with lots of white make-up, but any creepiness derived from his appearance was quickly shot as he was given really lame dialogue to speak after each time he murdered someone


 The scripter was obviously trying to emulate Freddy Kreuger, and his tongue in cheek quips, but failed miserably

 The actual killings themselves were pathetic to say the least, the main weapon being a specialized pick ax climbers use to climb ice

 How do you, with surgical accuracy, remove someone's head with a pick ax?  And have absolutely no blood whatsoever?  And the blood there was looked extremely cheap and was splattered around with no eye for effect, just gratuitous gore
 Also, the killer moved around like the laws of physics didn't apply


 One minute he'd be in a closet, and then the next scene he is in the basement...it doesn't figure


 Something else I found very annoying...characters we met early on would consistently pop up in other scenes already dead

 When were they killed?  How?  There is some nekkidness in the film, but it seems very pointless and apparently present because the director liked looking at nekkid girlies.The acting ranged from very poor to somewhat capable, but given the garbage script, they all came off looking like morons
 And the complete lack of continuity between scenes certainly didn't help, along with one of the more convoluted plots I've seen in a long time


 The whole movie seemed like someone filmed a bunch of scenes, and then crammed them together, expecting them to fit

 If you can comprehend more than ten minutes of this movie at a time, I'd be surprised

 The influences on the director were very obvious, as he completely copied scenes from much better movies, including Halloween (see the scene where the killer gets knocked out a 2nd floor window with a spear gun, seems dead, and then disappears shortly afterwards...Dr

Loomis is rolling over in his grave), Friday the 13th, Phantasm, and Nightmare on Elm Street, to name a few
 I am sure if you backed the director in a corner, he'd claim this thievery to be homage, but I just call it complete laziness and lack of originality.I don't normally like to trash a movie as much as I did here (okay, maybe a little), but when it offers so little (remember, my expectations were low to begin with) and wastes my time in the manner this film did, I feel I have no choice


 Anchor Bay does provide a nice looking wide screen anamorphic print, along with an original theatrical trailer for the film, but that's it...if you feel you have to see this film, get it used...I'll sell you my copy.Cookieman108

$REVIEW.: If you're a fan of MGM theatrical cartoons,this item is for you. Tom and Jerry has audiences,young and old,cracking up with their hilarious hijinks. Tom meets a pretty girl cat on the beach in SALT WATER TABBY. Jerry takes interest in the girl cat. The same girl cat is seen in SOLID SERENADE. Tom musically woos her via bass fiddle,disturbing Jerry's sleep. Jerry is automatically bounced out of bed on his face and stomach and the rhythm of the bass keeps bouncing Jerry. Tom impresses another female cat(not a glamourous one,though) wearing a "zoot suit" in THE ZOOT CAT. The usually totally silent Jerry speaks one line in the cartoon,"What's cooking,toots?". Tom spoke in the cartoon also,a little more than Jerry. Tom's suit shrinks to the point where it now fits Jerry! Jerry is off to Manhattan in MOUSE IN MANHATTAN,only to be met with disappointment. Jerry was used to apply shoe polish(he ends up in blackface,a scene never seen on some TV stations including Cartoon Network). He even felt light friction of the heavy New York City traffic. So,he's back home with Tom and again in his hole in the wall. TEE FOR TWO features a lawnmower-shorn Tom and his bee-stung mouth(courtesy of angry,intimidated bees). THE YANKEE DOODLE MOUSE was excellent. If I'm not mistaking,it was at least an Academy Award nominee. Tom is a concert pianist in the Oscar-winning THE CAT CONCERTO. Jerry is asleep inside the grand piano Tom is playing on stage and the striking hammers inside awake Jerry. Jerry,angry with Tom,finishes the performance himself and dons a tuxedo in the final scene with the spotlight shining on him. THE LITTLE ORPHAN,another Academy Award nominee,features Tom,Jerry and Jerry's visiting nephew Nibbles playing Thanksgiving scenes and in the final scene,praying before consuming the Thanksgiving dinner. Nibbles eats all of the turkey like a termite! He appears rotund in the final scene. In KITTY FOILED,there's Tom,Jerry and an unnamed canary riding a train set on the living room floor. In the final scene,Jerry and the canary are happily whistling away in the canary's cage. An excerpt of this cartoon became stock footage for LIFE WITH TOM(not seen on this DVD). JERRY'S DIARY contains stock footage from previous cartoons(released before that one). Tom was so furious about many of the statements Jerry wrote about him in his diary. Jerry comes along only to meet Tom who splatters a pie all over Jerry and his hole in the wall. The other cartoons are awesome. I loved them as a kid over two decades ago.

$REVIEW.: Particularly interesting about this DVD was the special feature showing all the effort that went into making "Ink". The director made a great effort to make this film within his budget and wound up producing a very visually stunning film filled with interesting characters and scenery.The main story is a fantasy about a young girl and her father interacting with creatures that inhabit a dream-like world. One set of beings are responsible for dreams while others generate nightmares. The story takes off when the girl's "soul" is snatched up by the character named "Ink", for some nefarious purpose. This action causes a related series of events revolving around the estranged father and the girl, the battle between the dream and nightmare people and the father's sense of guilt, regret, loss and redemption.Despite the small budget, Ink is a remarkable film that is visually appealing with a great ending. I especially liked the way the "cause and effect" theme was explored in this film. Its good to see that this was not another quickie horror/sex comedy/slasher flick - which is usually the kind of small budget film that I see stocked at the local video store. Ink is worth finding and watching.

$REVIEW.: "An old-fashioned adventure yarn" is the best description of this modern-day comic book-hero-come to life-story. This is almost like one of those early Tim Burton directed-Batman type adventures without all the darkness. The language is mild, the special-effects are decent and the sound is good. Best of all is the scenery, some beautiful landscapes filmed in Thailand and Australia.Instead of the city being where our comic book hero performs his heroics, this is out in the jungle, more like an Indiana Jones-type story. It's fast-moving, it's hokey, it's unrealistic but its generally fun to watch. Even the villain ("Xander Drax" played by Treat Williams) isn't really all nasty."The Phantom" (Billy Zane) has the normal off-and-on corny romance situation with feminist-journalist  "Diana Palmer" (Kristy Swanson) and the film gives you an entertaining 100 minutes. It's no award-winner but at least it's something you watch with your kids.

Taking a cue from the The Exorcist, the story revolves mostly around Kato's repented efforts to pocesses Yukari and later her daughter Yukiko (who may or may not be the offspring of Kato himself). He is temporarily successful each time; head-spinning and vomiting up strange phallic creatures are only some of the joys Yukari experiences time and again, and she is quickly reduced to a raving madwoman.

$review_text.: When "Matlock" arrived on the scene back in 1987 I was a demographic anomaly.  I was in my mid 30's at the time and I counted "Murder, She Wrote" and "Matlock" as among my favorite shows.  I had a friend in the advertising business in New York City at the time and he would just shake his head and chuckle when I told him what I liked to watch.  In any event several months ago I purchased "Matlock:  The First Season". I have just now completed viewing all 24 episodes.  Simply marvelous!Without a doubt Andy Griffith had the Ben Matlock character down pat from the get-go. He is certainly the guy I would want defending me should the need ever arise.  I love the Tyler Hudson character played by Kene Holliday as well.  He sure gets himself into a lot of interesting scrapes during the inaugural season. I guess if you are a private investigator it just goes with the territory.  Meanwhile, Linda Purl proves to be nothing special as Ben's daughter Charlene and it easy to see why the character was dropped after season one. She is seen less and less as the season wears on.  But having said that I enjoyed each and every one of these 24 episodes.  My favorite?  You guessed it......"The Judge" with special guest star Dick Van Dyke.  Am I still stuck in the Sixties or what???  Among my other favorite episodes from Matlock:  The First Season" are "The Sisters", "The Professor" and most especially "The People vs. Matlock".What is so great about "Matlock" is that you can enjoy the program with your wife, your children, friends or with your elderly parents.  There is minimal violence and lots of humor and language is never an issue.  For me the bottom line is that "Matlock:  The First Season" is great family entertainment.  I have since purchased "Matlock: The Second Season" and "Matlock: The Fourth Season" and intend to buy several more seasons.  The price is right and I will continue to enjoy this series for many years to come.  Very highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Every bit as engaging as when I enjoyed them a quarter century ago!

$REVIEW.: I suspect that those giving this five stars were part of the production team.  There is nothing about "Murder Loves Killers Too" to make it something to seek out or to avoid.  A group of us made pretty much this same slasher flick back in 2004 as part of a 48-hour film competition; where we wrote, shot, and edited everything in just 48 hours.  So I could relate to the lameness; I could realize just how fortunate it was that we did not have the time to put together a lot of embarrassing special features like the ones on this DVD; and I could be thankful that we had someone on the team who grasped that production design could be more than mixing up a lot of fake blood and a personalized birthday cake.  And given the audio quality I would have scrapped those special features in favor of a captioning option."Murder Loves Killers Too" (2009) demonstrates the old movie maker adage that you can't find a really good looking girl willing to take off her top in your movie, unless she is being paid.  As the three unpaid females prance around early in the movie, it quickly becomes obvious that Lindy (Kat Szumski) is the keeper (the hot one with the great body), who should get the most screen time and should wear the least clothes; assuming the director has a clue about his target demographic.  That Aggie (Christine Haeberman) fills out her jeans quite nicely and has an interesting face.  And that Tamra (Mary LeGault) has a body that would benefit from more clothes and maybe a little liposuction.  So guess who takes off her clothes?  And guess who gets killed off almost immediately.  And they wonder why these things can't find much of an audience.There were two cool cuts to look for, one where Tamra lies down and the other where Stevie lies down; both of which then cut forward to the same shot, illustrating a passage of time without any sort of transition. Very nice.The movie has good intentions and the cast and crew appear to have had a lot of fun making it, but it is student film quality without the strange quirks that make some of those films interesting. While the movie has some elements of obvious self-parody and is generally fun viewing, the overall production quality (from the staggeringly lame acting to the awkward and cheap staging) makes it hard to determine what is deliberate parody and what is just a mockfest moment.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

$review_text.: To me, Saw III is more epic because it's longer and has more soap opera elements to Amanda and Jigsaw's character


Tobin Bell does another awesome job as Jigsaw, who is now on his death bed
Jigsaw has Lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if Jeff makes it through his test


Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young


Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child

My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines
I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain

Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out! If you love Jigsaw and the Saw movies, you'll love SAW 3!!!

$REVIEW.: Why did I watch this?  Because I wanted to see a gritty Jason Statham kick some heads.  Did I get this?  Yeah.Statham is after a criminal and the police are busters because they don't really have any leads.  But as the investigation unfolds and we find actor Aidan Gillen (whom I recognized but couldn't place--when I was able to place him I realized it was he in the lead villain role in Jackie Chan's Shanghai Knights--he was short of stature but played smug and slightly imperious very well) as the homicidal cop killer, all crick-necked and off-kilter demented, he seems both less than a match for Statham's thuggish cop and his well-coiffed partner who is supposed to make Statham's character a little uncomfortable because he's homosexual (though never aggressively so).  As the film plays the partnership out the truth for both of them is that they're a bit of outside within their own policing world but they make a good team as they are determined to catch the killer.  You know how it ends.Along the way we get a sub-story of a multi-faceted junkie cop that the film helps us develop a really sympathy for and this gives the film more emotional depth.  Of course the criminal has past unexpected ties to Statham's character.  Part of the fun is seeing what this was and how it plays out in his character but...he ends up being pretty one-note.  Still, an enjoyable film and a good (though not great) vehicle for Statham, Gillen, and Zawe Ashton (the junkie cop).

$REVIEW.: What separates MI2 from any of a handful of latter-day generic James Bond films?  Not much, really.The concept of the Mission Impossible Force as a a TEAM of members, as in the original series and the first MI film, has given way to creating just another star vehicle for actor/producer Tom Cruise.  This movie exists SOLELY to present a buff Cruise as Mr. Action-Movie Hero, a territory he is relatively new to. As with many movies like this, plot and plausibility are secondary to whiz-bang effects and stunts.  A good script is the foundation that any good movie with staying-power is built upon.  Instead, MI2 is built AROUND something.  It is just an action showcase, that's all.  That this movie topped the box office in 2000 is testament only to the drawing power of Mr. Cruise and the public's diminishing discriminatory taste in intelligent script fare.  The popular media will have you believe that moviegoers' tastes are becoming more demanding and sophisticated, but you'd be hard-pressed to find evidence of that in this latest stunt-fest. But is the DVD worth renting?  Sure, for the DVD extras, behind the scenes technical goodies, and the MTV spoof.  But the movie lacks any elements to warrant ownership's repeat viewings.  Sure, the stunt setpieces are over-the-top and fun, but the minute a new movie can top it (and rest assured one will) MI2 will be just another discarded excess of its time.Lump this movie in the same category as the insulting INDEPENDENCE DAY --  all style, no substance.

$REVIEW.: The blind poet Homer wrote down the lives of Achilles and Hector, the two bravest warriors to come out of the Trojan War.  They were men who knew honor and wanted a lot out of life.  Achilles wanted ever-lasting fame.  Hector wanted his family, his people, and his country kept safe.  Ultimately, these two men came to deathblows.  Hector's brother, Paris, kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, from the Greeks.  This provided all the excuse Agamemnon needed to crush the Trojans and add them to his list of conquered people.  The Greeks sailed to Troy to reclaim their lost queen, but the war lasted a long time and proved more costly than anyone would have believed.  But Achilles and Hector were at the eye of that storm.Brad Pitt stars as Achilles and does a good job in the physical and emotional sense of the character.  Eric Bana plays Hector, and comes across as a noble champion.  The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a director noted for his attention to detail and willingness to get the scene no matter what it takes.TROY is a throwback to old Hollywood style filmmaking.  With a cast of thousands.  Of course, most of them are really computer animation, so the numbers are actually in the hundreds.  But the movie is just BIG.  The HD DVD version features beautiful imagery and Lossless sound that really makes you glad you bought the surround sound system.  The story is so big that even when it finishes two hours and forty-plus minutes later, you scarcely notice the time.  Something is always going on.  Some character is always in trouble (or dying or grieving).I was familiar with the story from high school as well as college, but the two characters never touched me so much before.  Maybe it's because I'm older and realize now how much was truly at stake and how different things might have been.  But I choose to believe it's because the story was present so well, visually as well as emotionally.  The suspense was great, because you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.  TROY is a great addition to the home library whether you're a fan of one of the actors or big period movies.  Get it or rent it and you're in for a treat.

$REVIEW.: Dragonaut: Part 1 is one of those anime series that presents itself with some epic action & lots of dull moments


The storyline consists of an organization developing outer space weapons in response to a growing threat from an unknown celestial entity

Tied within this storyline are two lovers attempting to prosper their love during a time of conflict between the Earth & this unknown celestial entity

The plot is somewhat interesting with epic battle scenes & cool out of this world combat powers but still has a lot of dull moments that are reserved for fan service; lots of fan service.The voice acting is pretty good in portraying the personalities of the characters

The dialogue is somewhat confusing due to the lack of details given about this unknown celestial entity & this organization's involvement with a developing weapon called "Dragons".I will make this anime series optional for all anime fans.Thanks.

I didn't miss  one episode. When I found out I could order it in VHS, I was on the verge of doing so when I thought: &quot;Well, it's going to be  one heavy item in my collection&quot;, so I started putting up votes in order to get it released on DVD. Thanks to whoever did it, I must say!  This is by far THE BEST summary of all things Beatles. I particularly enjoyed the Special features DVD with the reunion of the last remaining members of the most famous band in the universe!.  Just being able to hear the intro to &quot;Raunchy&quot; played by George and Paul and Ringo hitting away in the drums was pure heaven.  Anyway, I highly reccomend this item to everyone, and I am sure you will enjoy it!.SaluteRodolfo Mendoza

The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's "Chinatown" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation ("L.A. Confidential"), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more.  The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself.

After setting the story for Frankie and pretending for years, which include fake letters detailing adventures and destinations, the make-believe story comes to a crashing end when Frankie learns that the ship has docked near their new home and Liz must find a man who is willing to pretend he is Frankie's dad.

The great title sequence of "Saw" is about the extent of the creative, adventurous juices on view in this film. And the actual director of this film, James Wan (what an appropriate name!) didn't have anything to do with the title sequence: a company that specializes in title sequences always does this.The plot as concocted by Wan and Leigh Whannel (who also plays Adam) is a cat and mouse contraption with so many inconsistencies that we soon lose interest in trying to figure it out. I mean: two men are chained to drain pipes in an abandoned sewage plant for reasons only their captor can fathom. To top that off there is a dead man on the floor surrounding by a huge pool of blood.The acting is grade school by Whannell (he had to have gotten this part by way of his deal with the studio) and Cary Elwes (remember when he was actually good?). And the big denouement is silly.I saw "Saw" and now I have indigestion.

$REVIEW.: The DVD was one of the strangest ones I've ever seen.  There was NO menu at all. The movie simply started and ended.  You had to use your DVD player's options to determine the actual length (I didn't see it on the packaging).  The quality of the movie was fine.  Full-screen was expected since it was a made-for-TV movie.I had forgotten much of the story since I had not seen the movie in years but it was still AWESOME!  In some ways, it's even better than the original.  Different kids, different culture, but same basic solution - show the kids respect and insist on respect from them!  The depth of development of the kids was a bit better here than the original which is a bit surprising since the story itself was shorter.It was, in many ways, a typical Sidney Poitier movie - good drama without resorting to a lot of unnecessary violence.  Yes, there was some scuffling and even a gang fight and some shooting (no one was hit) but the impact was the drama and acting.It's a perfect extension of the original movie and the touch of the two "kids" from the original appearing at Mr. Thackery's retirement dinner was a very touching moment.  I cried when "Miss Peg" (Lulu) sang the original theme.There is only one question - why did this take so long to appear in a DVD format?

Hands down, IMHO, Derek is well ahead of the pack of the great young guitar players out there today. Everyone marvels at his slide work, as they should, but he has shown that he can use his fingers on his fret board as well. He will only improve with age and that could be scary to the competition.Eric Clapton agrees with me too. He expressed that, (paraphrased) "Derek Trucks has more licks and slide moves than most people who have had played for 5 times as long as he has", in an interview with a local radio station, when he appeared here last fall. Coming from Mr. Clapton, it speaks volumes of Derek's potential.Buy this DVD...you won't be disappointed!

$review_text.: i saw this show for the first time a couple of months ago. it is so witty. the detective cases are interesting and sometimes, well most of the time, bizarre. it is fun trying to figure out who is the real murderer. the actors seem to have a good time with each other and the burgeoning romance is fun to watch, right from the first episode.

$REVIEW.: I heard rave reviews about this, but couldn't get into it that much myself
 Denzel Washington seems to just be himself, the same guy he is in every movie, which is fine, but doesn't really pull me into the character he is supposed to portray


 John Goodman's goofy cameos are entertaining but distracting and overall it feels like a very serious and deep story that is obscured by some hollywood nonsense.

$REVIEW.: First, I don't like that Amazon integrates all the various formats into one review section.Second, as a movie review, I really like this movie
I know a lot is unbelievable and even impossible


I like the basic storyline and the intense action

It also hits on a real life issue of human trafficking
Exposing issues like this may help make people be more aware and help to stop such heinous acts

Again, as a movie, I think some people are reading too much into it giving it undo lowered ratings

Movies are for entertainment and this movie is entertaining

I  think Shrek is an entertaining movie and I don't expect to see a large green ogre appearing around the corner.Third, as a bluray DVD which I purchased, I am very disappointed


The quality of the picture is only about equivalent to a standard DVD and the dark scenes are very grainy looking worse than VHS if any of you out there even remember VHS
Some good with the DVD format is the extra scenes and a cool death/injured counter throughout the movie


Again, all for your entertainment.Overall, I give the movie a strong 4.5 stars and the bluray disc only 3 stars giving a total of 3.75 stars for the bluray movie of Taken.

$review_text.: Are you tired of reenactments that aren't faithful to scripture?  Then the Visual Bible is for you.  This entire four hour video is word-for-word from the NIV.  No subtractions or deletions.  It is beautifully filmed and would  be great for group study.  You can even follow along with the verses  because they are placed at the bottom of the screen.  The Jesus of this  video is amazing.  He's full of life and happy.  Yes, I said,  &quot;happy&quot;.  If you're used to the older videos such as &quot;Jesus  of Nazereth&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; then this  portrayal of Jesus may be a bit of a shock.  I'm not down-playing these  videos, I think they're great.  However, the &quot;Visual Bible&quot; seems  to better portray Jesus as the scriptures do.  By the end of this video you  truly see the bond between Jesus and the apostles.  You will also see the  most gruesome crucifixion scene that I've ever seen done.  You can almost  feel His pain.  I would definitely recommend this video to anyone wishing  to enrich his or her spiritual life through the powerful medium of video.

$REVIEW.: ...Quotation by Nina, my favorite character. Such great memories of watching this - feminist Maya was forever trying to intellectualize the magazine,Blush, but with few results to her liking.  Self-absorbed Nina and midgetish Finch hardly worked. Balding Elliot had amazing luck with models. Jack was ditzy...I could go on and on describing these people.Inspiring Nina quotes (hopefully these will spark some interest, although they're not all from the first 2 seasons):"Never mention that show [The View] again!  I was this close to being the 20-something Asian woman!""Well, dear, people say a lot of things when they're lying.""What is truth?  A lie, wrapped in a riddle, dipped in a dream? Oh wait, that's nostalgia.""A bird in the hand is worth 2 if by sea."[To Maya] "It's your fault!  You  made me donate my zebra-skin jacket!  I had it especially made for earth day!""That girl is wasting her youth at a place like college.""Honesty is one of those things people say they want, but they really don't, like education or children."One of the best sitcoms ever (but where's the other seasons?).Nice dvd set - includes a little booklet with an episode guide.

$review_text.: This is a slickly produced, moderately tense but ultimately unsuccessful movie.Its downfall is its preposterous story, obviously the creation of a second-rate writer in whose fantasy a second-rate writer becomes an international power-broker and unravels a diabolical 40-year-old CIA plot at the very highest level (the Prime Minister of the UK) with TWO (count them) Google searches! It's absurd.It also assumes without question that any European leader who cooperates with the United States in its war against terrorism is guilty of war crimes. Evidently in Polanski's world mistreating a terrorist is a high crime but raping a child is okay. It's stupid, it's immoral, and it's naive as only myopic Ameriphobic European intellectuals can be.But no movie starring Ewan McGregor can be bad. He's the most appealing, attractive actor in the world - attractive in every way I can think of - but completely unselfconscious, marvelously free of the vanity that afflicts every other male in his profession (the contrast with Brosnan in this movie is interesting). McGregor is endlessly fascinating, and I could watch him do anything for hours and hours without ever getting bored.It doesn't matter that McGregor always plays himself - playing any other character BESIDES himself would be a waste. That cannot be said of any other actor. If it weren't for him, this movie would be worthless. He makes it fascinating, but only because he is fascinating.

$REVIEW.: A decent two pack of one really fun haunted house movie that takes changes the locale to a submarine in the atlantic during WWII and a movie I saw once a decade ago and have absolutely no desire to watch again, even when its on an affordable two pack blu-ray.Below if you haven't seen it is one of those rare beasts mixing horror storytelling to a war setting directed by David Twhoy and starring among others a young Zach Galifinakis. Its set up as a really well done chiller mixing a submarine thriller a murder mystery plot, and its ghost story into a movie that comes together in a satisfying conclusion. I could do without the abundance of jump scares but the unique setting and some really atmospheric moments make it good.Darkness was my first run in with Juame Balagureo who went on to more impressive feats with REC. Darkness itself was an atmospherically drenched horror film that never really comes together in a satisfying film marred further by a terrible ending.For ten bucks the package is decent. As another reviewer stated the audio is only 2.0 which really hurts when concerning Below but the picture quality is nice on both films and unlike another Mill Creek double pack I purchased the inclusion of special features is nice.For Ten bucks- and cheaper if you buy on the Marketplace, Below makes this a must buy in my opinion.

$REVIEW.: Upfront, it should be noted that "102 Dalmatians" is far darker and more violent than the original - either the live action or animated versions


 That said, this is one of those rare sequels that actually surpasses the first film in a number of ways
 First, the story is less ingrained in our heads, so its fresher and unexpectedly more effective

 Second, there are plot twists to rival a gangster flick, with Cruella DeVil first framed as a puppy lover, and then as the nasty character we all love to hate

 Third - and most impressive - is Glenn Close, who chews up every scene here in a Golden Globe nominated performance that makes her far scarier and more effective as a villain


 She's almost channeling the spirit of Alex in "Fatal Attraction" with her vile manner and spitted dialogue


 This is an actress at the top of her form - part Alex and part Norma Desmond (who she played to raves, and a Tony Award, in "Sunset Boulvard.)  Bluntly said, Close gives a tremendous performance as the puppy-coat wearing diva - it's high camp at its best, and she makes the film soar in unexpected, hystrionic ways

 This Ella-Cruella is one of a kind.

A friend would pretty much blow his E-1 paycheck on RANMA 1/2 video cassettes, and we would all gather around in the barracks to watch.  Finally,  after 20 some years, I can revist that wonderful nostalgia in a fantastic Blu-Ray package... without blowing a paycheck.The aspect I particularly appreciate is the full selection of Language/Subtitle options the set gives, including turning on/off the Japanese Signs translations.  Also, when I bought this, I hadn't realized at the time the set came with a glossy RANMA 1/2 magna reproduction.  That was a nice suprise!

$REVIEW.: This movie debuted in 1990 during the height of the AIDS crisis. Plagued by 10 years of Republican leadership, our country was still not dealing with this disease head-on. The story, while fictional, is factual in it's  portrayal of the horror of AIDS. This was one of the first feature length  films to bring the crisis to the big movie screen. The story leads us from  the early 80's to the present day, telling the story of a mysterious  disease striking hundreds, then thousands. Interwoven are the stories of  &quot;real&quot; people, friends and love lost, the painful echo of cries.  Very haunting, well done movie.  With Bruce Davison (&quot;At First  Sight&quot;) and an excellent supporting cast.  Buy it used, rent it or  urge the studio's to re-release it.  We need movies like this  until,...until there is a cure...

$review_text.: Rigoletto is the first of the "Tutto ( Complete) Verdi" operas I have listened to. I was unfamiliar with the Teatro Regio di Parma where this DVD was recorded. I wondered what the other twenty-five Verdi operas produced in commemoration of Verdi's 200th birthday would sound like.Based on this DVD of Rigoletto, I believe that the "Tutto Verdi" opera series will prove to be a magnificent tribute to the great Verdi. The production is at once powerful and beautiful. Leo Nucci's performance as Rigoletto is astounding. The rest of the cast, as well as the orchestra, are excellent. I look forward to experiencing more of the Tutto Verdi series in the future. I give this DVD five stars.

$review_text.: It is this pre-quel "Amityville II: The Possession" from 1982 that outclasses its original 1979's cheesy success.  Producer Dino De Laurentiis was smart to hire Damiano Damiani to direct (this is his only Hollywood production) and Damiani wisely uses Franco DiGiacomo as director of photography and production designer Pierluigi Basile who effectively present along with Special Make-up by John Caglione, Jr. and special effects supervisor, Glen Robinson, a believable aura of evil that makes the entire film satisfying in itself.  Tommy Lee Wallace based his script on the book, "Murder in Amityville" by Hans Holzer, a different book than what the 1979 film was based which was co-written by members of the Lutz family, who escaped from the house.  The Holzer book and "Amityville II" is concerned with how the horrible murders that happened prior to the Lutz family's occupation of the house, and reasons for the evil that causes one member of the Montelli family to become possessed.  The fact that the film dwells on the possession and some of its concerns rightly conjure up association with "The Exorcist" (as sometimes the oldest son, "Sonny" played by Jack Magner often looks like Linda Blair in "The Exorcist" but Damiani relies on his make-up and special effects people who outwit these potentially deadly flaws in the script.  Even the religious detail in the film seems well researched.  One aspect unique about the film and demonic possession has the boy's defense in court use "demonic possession" and further heads down slippery avenues when the priest (played by top-billed James Olson) is given an attempt to exorcize the boy with unofficial "consent" from law enforcement.  Burt Young, Rutanya Alda (who I have never before seen star in anything (she played "Caroline the maid" in "Mommie Dearest") are the parents and Diane Franklin effectively portrays the teen-age daughter, "Patricia."  Damiani tastefully handles the incest aspect and the other abuses the family inflicts upon themselves making them qualifiers for the evil in the house and our sympathies.  Lalo Schifrin (music) and Sam O'Steen (editor) are Hollywood pros on hand.  The film can stand alone apart from the original or any other "Amityville."  In Technicolor, the MGM disc is in full screen on one side, widescreen on the other and comes with a theatrical trailer.  Definitely top-drawer given the original was not.  These derivative aspects, like those of "The Exorcist," are skillfully handled.  The Cadillac of "Amityville."  Goes where other films never do, and never fails to deliver.  An impressive achievement.

$review_text.: This is one of my favorite films. It seems more allegorical than realistic, and yet, mirrors real life situations in which people come together and inexplicably become more than the sum of their parts.**SPOILER ALERT** The catalyst for this change arrives in the person of a German tourist, stranded in the Nevada desert (I lived in such places- anyone who's been to Burning Man can tell you the desert is indeed magic, not as far-fetched as you'd think). She has no clothes, no prospects, and is initially shunned by the odd assemblage of characters who populate the rundown motel and truck stop- and yet, she blossoms, prevails, and alchemically alters everyone around her.A delightful reworking of Pollyanna, perhaps, quirky and unpredictable in the extreme. Lovely Marianne S&auml;gebrecht, an eventually incandescent C.C.H. Pounder (who played Moat, Neytiri's mother in Avatar), Jack Palance, George Aguilar, Apesanahkwat as Navajo Sheriff Arnie- all are inspired.There's LIFE, magic to be found, even in the most remote and seemingly hopeless of places, one need only look for it.

$review_text.: The plot of &quot;The Gift&quot; is a curiously compelling mixture of human pathos and paranormality, albeit admittedly somewhat predictable. What makes this film interesting and noteworthy is: the beautiful southern backdrop, abrim with spanish moss and full moons and photogenic bayous; the quietly matter-of-fact handling of one woman's extrasensory abilities; a sterling cast rising to the occasion by instilling a level of truth and integrity to their performances. Cate Blanchett, at the helm of this remarkable ensemble, is soft-spoken and restrained as Annie, whose `gift' suddenly immerses her into the vortex of a dark and dangerous place, which she confronts with rectitude, compassion, and courage (arguably foolishly or not). Keanu Reeves is appropriately menacing and despicable as the villain of the piece (I'd be surprised if he didn't base his character on DeNiro in `Cape Fear'), unleashing his rage most frequently on his hapless wife, portrayed by Hillary Swank with wide-eyed, bayou-backward conviction. Greg Kinnear, quickly becoming one of my favorite actors of this era, professionally fleshes out a somewhat thankless role with warmth and sad-eyed sincerity. That the victim of the story (lustily played by Katie Holmes) is a debutante-harlot seems somewhat misogynistic (the implication being that she got what she deserved), and it is my only real qualm with the movie. Most astonishing, however, is Giovanni Ribisi's amazing portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Buddy, who seeks advice and redemption from Annie, and whose torment and anguish in the face of his inner demons is palpable. It is a richly textured and heartbreaking performance, and should have certainly earned Ribisi an Oscar nomination. Mostly because of the script, `The Gift' is not a great film, but earns high marks for sharp direction, superb acting, and lovely cinematography. And, oh yes . . . there are genuinely creepy moments that will chill and startle and leave your heart racing. But, significantly, those moments are not gratuitous, and are for the most part necessary to the story line. My rating--8 out of 10.

Now, many years and hundreds, if not thousands, of movies later, I still find it hilarious.Knotts is one of the funniest comics of all time (it's not for nothing that he won 5 Emmys for "The Andy Griffith Show"), and he's at his best here.  He also recieves terrific support from a fine cast of familiar character actors.  In some ways, I could even identify with the hapless hero.  Like him, I, too, ate my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from the inside out, avoiding and throwing out the crust (now my favorite part, but you probably don't care about that)."The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" even manages to be genuinely spooky at times (that organ music - yikes!). Knotts made quite a few movies after this, but none approach the silly charm of this comedy classic."Attaboy, Luther!"

A choice of events of WW II are the stage for this documentary about a young British soldier, who was captivated and transported to Italy during the war, and the family who protects him from the Germans for as long as they possibly can. The communist Italians start a man hunt. The people willing to hide him in their houses are a heart warming confirmation that the people were not enemies, their governments were. The events making this story so remarkable are tumbling quickly from one scene to another, never boring and educational at the same time.

$REVIEW.: Watching this film about two relaxed and matter-of-fact hit men named Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is likely to be a confusing experience, but one that becomes rewarding for those patient enough to learn why Quentin Tarantino's efforts to make it an outrageously violent and hilarious success won for him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.  Confusion comes from superimposing forward and backward time shifts on the events that take place within three different plots.  Some viewers might be annoyed when they see likeable hit man Vincent Vega brutally murdered, then alive and well later in the movie.  Events like this are not accidents.  They come together in a surprise ending that would not be a surprise if viewers knew exactly what was going on throughout this unusual and memorable film.  It cannot be described well in words and must be seen to be believed.

I DO NOT think of it as a comedy

It had it's funny moments, but I was not feeling jovial or even entertained by the end...more gripped and pulled into the story

$review_text.: I saw this movie in the theater, loved it, and made a note to buy it when it came out on DVD.  I had to wait more than a year for the DVD, but it was worth the wait.  This film is very well done, moves briskly, tells the story it needs to tell, never gets boring or talky, and is just very entertaining.  This isn't just for Lutherans, but for everyone interested in church history or, for that matter, the history of western civilization.This is probably the best version of Luther's life available.  There was a 1975 film starring Stacy Keach (who did an excellent job), but that was a transcription of a stage play by John Osborne, and thus feels very stage-bound and non-cinematic.  The 1953 version I've never seen and thus cannot comment on.  But this latest version, with Joseph Fiennes, Alfred Molina, Jonathan Firth, Claire Cox, and the late Sir Peter Ustinov, I can recommend very highly.

$REVIEW.: Errol Flynn takes Ward Bond for the heavyweight championship. The amazing thing is how the character of Errol Flynn wins our sympathy little by little, despite his huge ego and conceit. The same way he finally wins the rich girl. Great characterizations, wonderful direction by Raoul Walsh (one of his best films), fantastic sets. There's not a dull moment in its 2 hours of film. Ward Bond does a great performance too as the final rival for the title. It has all the ingredients of a truly great classic. But best of all is the role of Corbett (Flynn), it just suits him perfect. One more masterpiece for the collection.

$review_text.: For the first 15 minutes of so of watching this new French film, starring the incomparable actress Isabelle Huppert I was wondering what I was getting into

The frenetic pacing and the obnoxious character played by actor Benoit Poelvoorde was making me nuts and I was ready to quit

But then things changed and, all of a sudden, I was drawn in and really cared for the characters


And, if you like offbeat French comedies - or independent films (both are the type coming from Strand Releasing) I think you'll like this one two

Huppert is not known for comedy but she has fun here
The story is basically how two individuals who have virtually nothing in common (he's a loud mouth slob; she an art dealer who is "cold as ice") find something in common


I won't reveal more of the plot - and I hope other reviewers refrain from this too - as it will spoil the fun.The 100 minute 2011 film is the kind that the French do best

It's in French of course and the subtitles - while in white - are still pretty easy to read
The dialogue, especially in that first 15 minutes, is hectic so you may need the pause button here

But generally you should have no problem.The DVD contains the original theatrical trailer - which, oddly enough, has subtitles twice the size of those in the film - and other Strand trailers

That's it for bonuses.The supporting actors are also wonderful and I liked how the story took directions you don't expect.Another small "gem" that I'm glad I discovered - and didn't give up on

Consider those 15 minutes a "set up" and then enjoy the ride.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"

$SUMMARY.: Don't let the first 15 minutes turn you off.

It's a delightfully quirky French comedy.

$review_text.: Reviewing this movie is like reviewing Shakespeare . . . what can I really say about it?Orson Welles, a genius of the craft, portrays Kane in all of his emotions and all of his incarnations over the years.  I can just listen to his voice all day, even reading the ingredients to ice cream.  Watch for scenes where he limps, since he broke his leg during the filming of the movie.  And the scene where he goes postal in the room?  That was filmed with a broken leg.The cinematography is eye candy.  Will all the advantages we have today, why aren't we resurrecting the angles and framing that Welles or Fritz Lang used?  All we are getting is rehash of the Matrix for the umpteenth time.  Can we return to beauty?  Or do we get glitzed by computer generated effects at the expense of art and story?The story is a jigsaw puzzle, with each interviewee providing a piece.  But putting the perspectives together we get an external view of a man.  But externally, we just see what a man does.  We read his journals, and see what he thinks and feels.  But what is a man really???

$REVIEW.: And those Englishmen that I speak of are Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, and Keith Moon, better known to the rock world and their fans as The Who
 In this 1979 rockumentary directed by Jeff Stein, the band is shown in classic clips performing some of their best songs
 When it opens, we see them performing "My Generation" on "The Smothers Brothers Show"

 After the documentary's titles are shown, we cut to a clip of them singing "I Can't Explain" on what would be the last broadcast of "Shindig", ABC's evening answer to their ever-popular "American Bandstand"


 About a half-hour or so into the movie, we're treated to their electrifying performance of "See Me, Feel Me/Listening to You" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival

 In between these rocking performances, we get to see the four men reveal their true selves during interviews, such as the one done by English TV show host Russell Harty
 Here, you get to see them display their sense of humor, with Harty not batting an eye


 They are also asked, by various fans, questions on topics ranging from drugs to looks


 Although all four members are interviewed, none is interviewed more often than Pete Townshend, who presents a thoughtful, serious side of himself

 Of course, no Who documentary would be complete without clips of him destroying his guitar during concerts, for which he is legendary

 During the "Smothers Brothers" segment, after Tom watches Townshend destroy his guitar, he tells his brother Dick to bring his guitar (so that Townshend could destroy it!)


 We also get to see drummer Keith Moon during his crazy, maniacal moments and on the drums

 I would say he was The Who's equivalent of The Beatles's Ringo Starr, who, by the way, we see talking to Moon
 Throughout this whole movie, we hear the best that these guys had to offer, including the aforementioned "My Generation" (we also get treated to a clip of them singing it at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), "I Can't Explain", "Teenage Wasteland", "Happy Jack", "Tommy", "Pinball Wizard", "Won't Get Fooled Again", "Magic Bus", and at the end, "Long Live Rock".These men knew how to rock; their music defined a generation

 If you're a fan and think that they rock, like I do, then you should no doubt love this showcase of one of the best rock bands of all time.

$REVIEW.: Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something:  Todays moviegoers want mass market drivel.  This is art.  But at the same time it's an exciting, action-packed, plot AND character driven story during which any viewer with a heart and a soul will be on the edge of his or her seat.  JIM CAVAZIEL, if there is justice in this world, will become a HUGE A-list leading man as a result of his BRILLIANT performance. No other actor out there could have played the Count in this movie; he was made for this, his role of a lifetime, and he deserves an OSCAR FOR IT.  Guy Pearce, so sexy and sympathetic in his previous roles, is so believable as a villain in this movie, that one walks out of the theatre despising his fictional self - sorry Guy this just means that you are a GREAT ACTOR - and big things are waiting for him as well - all actors in this movie are extremely talented and are irreplaceable.PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE, ONE AND ALL - ITS OSCAR CALIBER,CLASSIC STUFF**DO NOT BE DISCONCERTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THE STORY - IT'S A NEW, MODERN, ORIGINAL TWIST - IT'S EVEN GOT SOME COMEDY - A MUST - SEE!!!!!AND I'VE SEEN EM ALL........I WILL PAY TO SEE IT AGAIN.  AS ABOVE, AN AUDIENCE FULL OF MANY JADED PROFESSIONAL MOVIE CRITICS GAVE IT A STANDING OVATION AT CLOSING CREDITS...

$review_text.: Unless you have the IQ of a turnip, you already know this series is fake. However, the producers in their wisdom have decided if they can cut off more heads with bad camera angles and implore worse sound they might still convince us of the reality of this film. If you go on U-Tube or watch the amateur submissions to some America's video TV show, you will see that we are better photographers than this series makes us out to be.In the beginning, Hunter is kidnapped as an infant. We then jump to 5 years later. The film starts out mostly of a young male filming a teen female (Kathryn Newton). She has a younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). When Robbie (Brady Allen)the creepy young boy next door shows up with his imaginary friend weird things begin to happen. Alex, our teen girl allows the young man (Matt Shively) to set up cameras around the house to film the weird things that are going on and to cut off everyone's head. While weird things were caught on camera, they never went back to view the films which was the whole purpose of setting up the cameras in the first place.Special effects, and by by "special" I mean ride the short bus special, included the chandelier moving, doors opening, chairs moving, covers coming off, and a bad levitation scene. No pool crawler getting out of the pool by itself.This was by far the least of the series. If you were a big fan of the other three, you might find enjoyment in this one as this is upgraded to color. These films are cheap to make and pay for themselves in the opening weekend. Don't expect the franchise to go away anytime soon. Kathryn Newton did a good job in spite of the script and horrible camera shooting.Parental Guide: F-bomb, C-blocking. No sex or nudity.

Hopefully, Warner Bros. will decide to release all the episodes for us Diehard Scoob fans so we can have our collections complete.At any rate, even though things are the way they are--I still love this collection. It does have some pretty good episodes in it. My favorites being the Batman and Robin episodes, the Don Knotts episodes and the Speed Buggy episodes.

$review_text.: Hua Mulan, the latest take on the Mulan legend, finally gives the subject the treatment it deserves.  It's a gritty, stark film that chronicles the well known story of a woman who defies both convention and the law by disguising herself as a man to fight in the campaign against the Rouran Confederation, an earlier version of the classic Mongolian raiders.Not much is known about the Mulan fable other than the basics.  Here it opens in the Rouran camp as Mendu (Hu Jun), son of the Danyou- leader of the tribes- is executing prisoners instead of releasing them as his father wished.  The looming presence of the Rouran forces a nationwide conscription to repel the invaders.  Already a veteran, Mulan's ailing father is called to serve again, but she steals his armor and sword and reports in his place.  She meets new comrades as well as reuniting with a friend from her village, Tiger (Jaycee Chan), who agrees to help her.  She also befriends Wentai (Chen Kun) a lieutenant in their unit who also uncovers her secret but agrees to maintain the deception, seeing no real value in outing her.  When the Rourans invade their camp Mulan distinguishes herself; with the commander killed in the battle she and Wentai earn promotions.  They achieve an impressive record, fueling some jealousy among their superiors.  As the war continues and many of her friends fall, Mulan tires of it all and admits her feelings for Wentai, who though he feels the same, is forced to teach her some severe lessons about what it means be in command as well as the dangers of having personal attachments during war.  In response to Mulan's string of victories Mendu seizes control of the Rouran tribes from his father and pushes north.  A war council forms a plan to bait the Rouran into a canyon to destroy them and Mulan volunteers to draw them in. This confrontation leads to developments that will affect the course of the war and change the lives of the survivors in unforeseen ways, even as it draws their destinies together.The strongest part of the movie is script.  It's engaging with lots of little touches, rooted in themes of love, honor, loyalty and patriotism- starting with her father's desire to serve beyond his capabilities and the love and respect for him that drives Mulan.  Even the idea that a woman could serve in the military for twelve years, rising to the rank of a senior commanding officer and no one noticing anything gets a little of this treatment.  You get the impression the troops know but she's long since earned their respect and admiration.  The most sentimental moments are a recurring ideal of the stars as spirits looking down upon their loved ones.  Unfortunately all the good stuff is saved for Mulan and the fellas; the Rouran characters are all second-stringers, though Mendu has a couple of good lines.Zhao Wei as Mulan demands your attention and not because she's the star of the movie.  She has a great dramatic presence and portrays Mulan's personal struggles and conflicts with conviction through her expressions and small gestures- in short, good acting.  From the horror of her first kill to wondering about the reasons why they fight, Mulan is a person questioning herself and searching for answers... and like anyone else doesn't always receive them well.  Her best scene comes when a soldier's jade pendant goes missing and his uncle, the commander, orders everyone strip-searched to find it.  The tension plays out well and as she's forced to make a decision her eyes and facial expressions say it all.  Many of the more dramatic scenes evolve this way, and no one in the cast is ashamed to shed a few tears to show how much they care.  Jaycee Chan- Jackie's son- is a standout in his supporting role, with some truly poignant moments in the desert sequence.Another strength of the film lies in its production.  The cinematography plays up the contrast between the slight dullness of the colors in military life to the crisper tones and gleaming trinkets under the high sun for the Rouran nomads as well as the bleakness of the desert before and after a devastating sandstorm.  Like all sweeping dramas the pacing gets a little slow sometimes, but the editing is excellent.  Fadeout transitions occur at just the right moments and like with all well-told stories, you understand what's happening without having it all spelled out for you- something Hollywood studios should keep in mind.  Though the film sort of rushes through its final scenes, you won't feel too cheated by it.  Even the soundtrack works- it's evocative, moody and boosts the melodrama even higher.Hua Mulan is a well-crafted, well-acted film that's absolutely worthy of your time and attention.  And being so reasonably priced on dvd and blu-ray there's no reason not to give it.

$REVIEW.: This history-making zombie film from 1968 is incredibly atmospheric and disturbing in its nature. After Barbra's brother, Johnny, is killed by a zombie loose in her father's cemetery, she seeks shelter in an abandoned house nearby. She soon discovers that other people are in the house as well, and have been in similar situations as Barbra. As the group of people begin finding more resources during this trauma, they discover that the zombies lurking outside are not just desiring their deaths...they are planning the menu for their next meal!Extremely graphic for its time, "Night of the Living Dead" is a classic of the genre, and anyone seriously interested in the genre should find something great about it. Even if you're not usually interested in horror, you should still watch it. A masterpiece of terror and suspense.

 But those that are awake, and aware will see the parallel to today's issues

 Ok...., so maybe people haven't been dumbed down exactly the same

Today we have our own government high jacking our constitutional rights, and killing us through our food, drink, meds, vaccines, and Chemtrails.It's sure is coming closer to IDIOCRACY as the days go by


All seriousness aside, I thoroughly enjoy this fun movie


It tickles my funny bone!! Luke Wilson does a great job playing the straight man, surrounded by nothing but weirdness!! If you can get past the cheesiness, this is a fun movie to watch

And honestly...., I haven't stopped thinking about its messages since the first time I saw it

$review_text.: Great setting throughout, beautiful woodland, or so it seems, apparently it was just a thicket, as explained on the extras on the dvd, which is kind of sad really, making it seem as though nowhere in the UK can you find a really secluded woodland that is actually far away from a road! Anyhow, to get to the movie's story, it was a shame they deleted the scene showing the woman driving her car with her daughter present also, and the man turning up in the middle of the road, making her stop the car, as it is it makes it seem as though she must have gone to bed and woken up in a box in the woods. It's only when watching the documentary on the dvd that one realises what actually happened.I would have preferred it if the story had been centred around the first woman, rather than the character of Hope, I found her intensely irritating in the scenes in the restaurant with her 'date' where she was acting in a cringe-making coquettish manner, and even worse back in her home with her tell-all mentality giggling with her girlfriend who had babysat her kid. Her character started off by being such an irritating, silly woman, that it was hard to feel any sympathy for her character or to care much about what happened to her. As the movie progressed though, I did warm to her a little more, but not much, her acting seemed rather contrived and not exactly believable, but apart from that, I very much enjoyed the movie, I thought the hiding of a certain object inside people's bodies (which they have to dig out to enable escape) was similar to in the "Saw" movie, but this film was way, way better than "Saw" in my opinion, far more entertaining, and unlike "Saw", this was very visually beautiful to look at, owing to the lovely woodland setting.According to the interview on the extras, they made the movie for somewhere between eight and ten thousand pounds. Incredibly low budget and therefore all the more praise necessary to the cast and crew and makers for achieving such a good piece of work but I guess having such a beautiful setting helped a lot here!I was absorbed all through, even allowing for Hope's annoying behaviour in the restaurant. The movie had such great atmosphere, and I loved the touch of showing the delightful little robin singing on his branch!Great movie. Well done to all concerned!Oh, and I loved the ending. She didn't see that one coming! Way cool.
$SUMMARY.: Brilliant movie!

$review_text.: PHONE BOOTH is the second pairing of director Joel Schumacher and star Collin Farrell; unfortunately it is a disappointment compared to their first collaboration, &quot;Tigerland.&quot;  Farrell playes a sleazy, small-time New York press agent.  He lies to his clients, the press, and anyone else he can use.  This situation comes to a head when he is pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper.Schmuacher can be a good action director, so I was expecting much more from this movie.  Even though the movie is short (my DVD counter said 89 minutes), it really drags at times.  Farrell is pretty good, but we don't get to know much about his character before the sniper incident, so I really didn't care much about what happened to him.  The characters also tend to be a bit over-the-top, expecially the three prostitutes, who add some unintentional (?) humor.  Also, PHONE BOOTH is ultimately too preachy and moralistic for it's own good; it's simply too shallow of a movie to pull it off well.Perhaps the best part is Schumacher's director's commentary; Schumacher is a solid director and he knows the kind of information that will be of interest to the audience.  Too bad he didn't have as much sense when he was making the movie.

$REVIEW.: Let's be honest Stallone's last outing (Rambo 3) as the all-action hero was below par, I did enjoy it but no-where as much as Rambo 1 or 2. So onto Rambo 4.Rambo 4 is set in Burma, it's a very good movie with a LOT of graphic violence. Anyone who is familiar with the franchise should know what to expect but in this one the graphic violence is upped and each slaying of the bad guys results in a blood splattering unseen in any previous Rambo movies. Not to say it's not welcome though! The movie benefits from this, I think.I didn't go into this film with high expectations due to the lackluster number 3 in this franchise but i'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. If you liked Rambo 1+2 you should like this installment.Rambo is back!

$REVIEW.: I was very excited for this film.  Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses, and I was impressed with the rest of the cast.  The story was interesting, however this film fell flat.  It was nonengaging and left the viewer with a lot to be desired.While the cast is excellent, each character seems emotionless and the viewer feels very disconnected.  A lot happens in the story, yet none of the characters seem to care.  Greit has a relationship with a butcher, but it is difficult to tell if she even likes him.  She is expressionless around him, and does not seem at all in love at any point in the film.  At first I had the impression she only wanted to avoid him.  This was changed when we see a breif smile when she is with him deep into the film.The rest of the relationships, as well, seem uninspired and flat.  Vermeer and Greit seemed to not care at all about each other.  There was no tension between them.  It felt empty.  The same was with all the characters, none of them seemed to care.  By the end, it felt as if nothing had happened between any of them.Another big disappointment was the way the characters handled issues.  A lot happens that people would normally not take lightly, but nothing that occurs in this film seems to affect the characters later in the movie.I found this movie, in short, completely unmoving and boring.  I felt disconnected and uninterested the whole way through.  The two stars come from my appreciation for the historical accuracy, sets, costumes and beautiful cinematography.  As for the movie itself, it falls flat.

$REVIEW.: I will provide this review in two parts; the first for the movie and the second for the DVD.First, the movie itself.  The first three Star Wars (SW) movies were some of the most amazing, popular, and incredible movies ever made; so it would be hard for anyone to match them, even George Lucas himself.  Yet after the disappointment with Episodes I and II, many were hoping for a much better III.  Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed.  Episode III does tie up all the loose strings and story lines, and is an entertaining movie, but overall is still quite disappointing, even in comparison with Episodes I and II.  The plot was disappointing, the acting was disappointing, the dialogue was disappointing, and even the musical score was not as awesome as the previous five movies.  Lets address each disappointment separately.Of all the SW movies, this by far had the most plot holes in it.  Too many things occurred that did not make sense, and I will list them here.A) Why is it that whenever multiple Jedi face a lone Sith Lord, the latter usually wins, but when one Jedi faces one Sith Lord, the Jedi wins, or at least does not lose?  Opening fight scene; Obi-wan and Anakin versus Count Dooku results in Dooku knocking out Obi-wan.  Yet Anakin by himself beats Dooku.  When the Jedi Masters arrive to arrest Palpatine, he kills three of them quickly, yet Mace Windu by himself can stop him.  Anaking enters the Jedi Temple and kills scores of Jedi Knights, yet Obi-wan beats him in one-on-one combat.  None of this make sense; do the Jedi NOT learn how to fight in teams as part of their training?  This nonsensical trend is actually found in Episodes I and II.  In Episode I, Qui-Gon and Obi-wan cannot defeat Darth Maul together, but Obi-wan by himself kills Maul.  In Episode II, Anakin and Obi-wan each do better fighting Count Dooku individually than they do together.B) Why did Yoda and Obi-wan split up to take on Palpatine and Anakin separately?  Common sense would have dictated that they both went after Palpatine together, retake the Republic and command of the Clone Troopers from Palpatine, and then worried about Anakin.  Do the Jedi NOT learn military strategy as part of their training?C) How did Mace Windu defeat Palpatine yet Yoda could not?  After all, by the time Palpatine met Yoda, he had already fought four Jedi Masters, and been burnt by his own force lightning.  If anything, Palpatine should have been weary, tired, and be an easy match for Yoda.D) How is it that General Grievous can kill all those Jedi Knights (as proven by his lightsaber trophies) yet quickly get two hands cut of by Obi-Wan, and is eventually killed by him?  Obi-wan is a Jedi Master, but he does not even have the use of force lightning yet...E) How could Anakin not sense that Padme was carrying twins?  If Obi-wan could sense that Padme was pregnant in just 5 minutes with her (when he asks her of Anakin's whereabouts), then Anakin surely should have been able to sense twins in all that time with her both in and out of bed.F) Why, when Mace Windu is about to kill Palpatine does Anakin cut his hands off?  Why didn't Anakin just knock his lightsaber upwards?G) Why does General Grievous have a consistent cough?  For a creature that has been technologically enhanced in every conceivable way, why didn't he do something to fix that cough?  More importantly, why does a creature that does not breathe cough?  When Grievous escapes in the beginning of the movie, he goes outside his own spaceship, and clearly is not wearing any breathing suit during his spacewalk.  Ergo, he does not breathe, yet he coughs as though he has trouble breathing.Next, the acting.  This is probably the biggest complaint people have for Episodes I-III with respect to the original three; the acting is horrible in the new trilogy.  There are many instances of this.a.  Throughout the movie, Palpatine just oozes distrust and suspicion.  In his facial expressions, words, walk, and everything else, it was obvious he was evil.  Did Lucas plan it this way?  I hope not; Palpatine was supposed to pass as a good guy until he reveals himself.b.  Mace Windu's character is like the Al Gore of Jedi Knights; boring like a lump on a log.  Great leaders in general, and great military leaders in particular, tend to have livelier, often magnetic personalities.  Did Lucas intend to portray Mace as uptight?  Or was it just bad acting?c.  Like Episode II, the romance scenes between Anakin and Padme were so fake.  Even first loves between little kids are more interesting than this one between a politician and a whiz-kid soldier.  Lucas set up a unique romance; one that has never been seen before in a major movie; a woman of high birth and great potential who loses it all to a guy who goes bad because he loves her too much to let go of her.  Hollywood has lots of movies about bad guys turning good for the nice girl (e.g. As Good as it gets), or bad girls turning good for the nice guy (e.g. Pretty Woman), but there has never been a movie about a good guy turning bad because of the good girl.  Lucas had a totally original romance going, and he screwed it up, both in the beginning (Episode II) and in the end (Episode III).Now the dialogue.  Lots of complaints here.I. The romance dialogue was horrible.  The dialogue between two people in love has comedy, surprises, half-vieled threats, hints of jealousy, spontaneity, occasional insults, snide comments and everything else possible flowing thru it.  None of this was seen in the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie, making it even worse than the romance scenes in Attack of the Clones.II. For all the great wisdom of the Jedi Masters, they seem to talk very little.  Decisions seem to be made pretty quickly; e.g. the discussion that sent Yoda to the wookies took one minute!III.  Too many one-liners.  This was fine in the opening scenes when Anakin and Obi-wan banter at each other as they make their way thru the General's flagship.  But it was very insufficient for the rest of the movie.IV.  Why does everyone, except R2 and the Wookies talk in English?  One of the great things of Episodes IV, V, and VI was the various languages the different creatures used, even those in the same side (e.g. Lando and his co-pilot on the Falcon in Return of the Jedi).  Yet in this movie, everyone except the Wookies speak in English!V.  Why does Palpatine tell Anakin to leave Obi-wan in the opening sequence?  If anything, this should have tipped Anakin of towards Palpatine's true self and bred a solid mistrust of him.  Palpatine himself should have known better than to say something so strident and flippant.Overall, the dialogue lacked in both quantity and quality.Last, the music.  Episodes IV, V, and VI were remarkable in the various musical themes they introduced.  Episodes I and II each had some new themes, though nothing astounding.  I heard nothing new for this episode; only a rehash of the music I heard in the other five movies.  Musically, this was the most disappointing of all six SW movies.So overall, the music, the dialogue, the acting and the plot was disappointing.  The entire movie was disappointing.  Now to the DVD.  One of the first, very successful DVD's to be ever released was the Phantom Menace DVD in 2000.  Containing all sorts of "cookies" and special features, this DVD is found in many collections.  All these bells and whistles are found in the DVDs of Episode II and now Episode III.  Yet there is one thing that all three lack; they leave the extended / deleted scenes removed from the movie...  Why is this?  One of the main selling points of the LOTR DVD's is that all the extended scenes are fit seamlessly into the movie itself.  I wish George Lucas had did this also, or least offer a DVD version that did.  In this respect, I also find the DVD's disappointing.  Overall, disappointing end to a great epic.

$REVIEW.: Fred Haines' 1974 film version of this Hermann Hesse novel appears to have been heavily influenced by the psychedelica very much in vogue in the swingin' sixties and the early seventies

Replete with color negative footage, Czech-style animation, wacky over the top music, all kinds of disjunctive jump cuts, a blatant anti-war sequence, sensual sex that winds up meaning very little, and a whole heck of a lot of European-style psychobabble dialogue, it nevertheless conveys the spirit of the novel on which it was based.The character referred to in the title, Harry Haller, played by Max von Sydow, is a dissolute writer unsure of all aspects of his life, and it's this uncertainty that attracts him to--and/or that brings to him two entities: 1) Hermine, his "muse", played by Dominique Sanda, and 2) the Magic Theater, of which she is, in fact, a part, but which is also frequented by Pablo, the saxophone-playing sensualist and Maria, the ultra-sexy woman who obviously symbolizes--more than Pablo or Hermine--pure sensuality.But essentially, says Hesse--channeled through Fred Haines--none of these entities are real


In fact, it's tough to tell who or what is real and that is the real point of the film, it seems

We live and eventually die and go through life as participants in a play whose meaning is lost to us
All kinds of psychological symbolism and related stuff is in this film, but rather than trying to interpret it all--or any of it, for that matter--better perhaps to say that here's an oddity, a curio, a semi-fascinating period piece that smacks of its time and gives the viewer--along with concert footage of the Grateful Dead, for example--a snapshot of what the early seventies were all about.Worth seeing for this reason, Steppenwolf is a film that may not necessarily be remembered easily but on the other hand is not necessarily forgotten right away either

Somewhere in between...

First, it is filled with relevant information regarding the formation, leadership and activities of the Hitler Youth. Second, the film clips directly support the points the narrator is making. And these are film clips that you don't see in every WW2 documentary.However, I can only comment on the first 48 minutes of the documentary. At that point, my DVD player could no longer read the disc. That's why I'm giving it only four stars instead of five. I wonder what the documentary said in its last 12 minutes. . . .

$review_text.: For this genre,this was one of the best. So many werewolf/monster movies have been made around the kids in the cabin, but this one was not. Had it been I would have loved for the makers to have explored the tension between Alex, the proverbial sex-crazed, in-crowd jock and Sam, the outsider, who does not care what anyone else thinks and has a defensive guard up so others cannot get close to her. That kind of mutual contempt usually leads to a good romantic storyline, even inthe middle of a horror movie. There are no other movies like this one, with the talking , very cognative  werewolf, who acts more than just on his animal instincts. All of the kids at the cabin were the usual; the witch of a beauty queen, the jock, the drunk, the nerd and the outcast. The storyline was not usual at all. The abusive stepfather/werewolf only made you want to see him get his that much more in the end. Derek was perfect as the nerd/hero. Throughout the movie you could see and feel his transformation from nerd to hero out of necessity.The sex scenes make this movie not for children, but for your average horror fan, this is a must see and must buy. Derek's uncle Charlie kind of died without too much of a heros' demise; punch, scratch, intestine,open head. There was always the hope that he and Derek's mom would end up together at the end, but if he had to be killed by the werewolf, he should have died putting up more of a fight, perhaps beating Derek's stepdad , fist to fist, before he turned into a werewolf and did the above. His death did add to the wanting for retribution, but some reconnection between Charlie and Dereks' mother should have happened.  I always like the nerd to hero movies. Usually, I would say that there was too much killing in such a movie, but everything was done so well, with the killing being wrapped around the other stories; abusive  husband and steupfather, nerd gets the girl, etc, etc.For years, "The Howling" was the greatest werewold movie I had ever seen. Then technolgy advanced, but the stories got worse. Along came "Dog Soldiers" which surpassed "The Howling". Big Bad Wolf equals and maybe supasses "Dog Sodiers". All in all, "Big Bad Wolf" is one big, bad movie.

$review_text.: Considering the many Hollywood adaptions from novels, plays and what have you, this really struck me as particularly well done. The early part of the film ( the murder)faithfully based on Hemingways short story, and then the entire rest of the movie which flashes back on the long line of events leading to the murder was written from scratch. It works.Great story, full of the 1940s city ambiance: prize fighters, femme fatales, professional crooks, cops, tough people from tough neighborhoods trying to get ahead. Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner in their first starring roles ( in fact it is one of Lancaster's first credited appearances in film) showing some of the essential personality, and of course good looks that would make them famous.And as with many of these great classic films the supporting roles are played by solid character actors and played exceptionally well.I dont know how many people remember William Conrad, but he does a short, but effective turn as one of the hitmen.

$REVIEW.: This is a true clasic. It was this film which set the table for all the great slasher-movies from the golden '80's. It was also the brekthrough for actor Jamie Lee Curtis and director John Carpenter. The movie starts with  Dr.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who is going to his work-place on a mental  hospital. But when he gets there a man with the name of Michael Myers  escapes. Michael had killed his sister when he was 6 years old, and hav  been locked up since then. Now he goes hunting for his little sister  Laurie.  This movie is scary and at the same time entertaining. On the  older copies, the colors feel very blue, but if you buy the restored DVD  edition, it feels like the movie has been made all over again, and the  soundtrack is also remastered. ENJOY!

$review_text.: This review is from the double-sided one-disc package, not the 70th anniversary two-disc package, which I have not seen. Apparently little restoration had been done for this edition. Frequently the colors looked faded, the images looked blurred, and the soundtrack was inaudible, even allowing for the fact that most of the actors were talking pretty fast as they raced through a long, long story.Back in 1939 when Gone with the Wind came out, the TV mini-series did not exist (of course not, as TV was still very much experimental), and the idea of making a multi-part film out of a long best-selling novel must not have been something the studios would have considered. As a result, even at almost 4 hours of screen time, you end up with a sort of Reader's Digest Condensed/Greatest Hits version of Margaret Mitchell's novel. Since I read the book before I saw the movie, I can't objectively say how coherent the film would appear to someone who did not already know the story--but I suspect it could be somewhat confusing.On the positive side:I can't imagine better casting of the two leads. Vivien Leigh is perhaps a little too lovely as protagonist Scarlett O'Hara (described in Mitchell's novel as "not beautiful, but men seldom noticed when caught by her charm"), but she otherwise nails the character's appearance and spirit with her black hair, spellbinding green eyes, pale skin and sparkling vivacious energy. I hadn't seen a Clark Gable movie in years and I'd forgotten what an utter movie star he is. Mitchell could practically have written her Rhett Butler character with him in mind, with his swarthy good looks, intelligence, humor, cynicism and vulnerability.  Gable's even the right age for the character, who is supposed to be 17 years older than Scarlett. Most of the supporting cast is stellar, with Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen unforgettable in their stereotyped roles of the slaves Mammy and Prissy.Although it's a studio back lot production--nobody was about to go film on location in northern Georgia back then--the producers, directors (several worked on the film in addition to the credited Victor Fleming) and other technical people did an outstanding job with the settings, costumes, action and special effects. I had no trouble at all feeling like I was in Georgia during and after the Civil War. The siege and burning of Atlanta are very impressive, especially considering how limited special effects technology was back in those days.On the less positive side:Because they're trying to cover so much material, every scene races along at breakneck speed. That's probably better than being too boring, but it would be nice if once in a while, they slowed down a little bit. Even a deathbed scene and the big denouement feel rushed. It's a bit wearying, like a concert where the band only plays really fast songs instead of mixing in some ballads and mid-tempo numbers.Leslie Howard is miscast as Ashley Wilkes, the man with whom Scarlett is obsessed. In his mid-40s, he's simply too old and jaded to play the golden young knight of Clayton County. If the audience can't at least get a sense of what Scarlett sees in him, deluded though she may have been, it throws the story off balance. Olivia de Havilland captures Melanie's combination of gentility and strength well but is far too healthy-looking. Instead of looking frail and "as narrow-hipped as a young boy," de Havilland looks like she could have 10 children without batting an eye.Other than Vivien Leigh and the African-American actors, nobody even tries to speak with a southern accent, marring the filmmaker's efforts to create an authentic atmosphere. From what I've read, actors seldom attempted accent work when this movie was made.Like the source material, the films paints an overly romantic picture of the antebellum south, though some of the worst offenses of Mitchell's novel are toned down. The Ku Klux Klan is not mentioned by name, and the most racist language is revised or omitted.It's sort of fun to think about how one would re-film the story in a different format that would allow the story to proceed at a more leisurely pace so more of the book's richness of incident and characterization could come out, but it's hard to think who you could cast as Rhett and Scarlett--Leigh and Gable are just so darned perfect for their roles. GWTW was quite a feat of film-making in its day, winning all the major awards, and it's still interesting to watch today.

But this movie focused on Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII and his relationship with both her and her sister, Mary.  The acting wasn't that great, and if you want to see a truly OUTSTANDING Anne Boleyn performance, check out Natalie Dormer in Showtime's The Tudors!!!  They should have picked HER for the role in this movie!!  I went to see it because I love anything to do with the Tudor period, especially Henry VIII. But it is certainly not the best I've ever seen.

$review_text.: Denzel Washington brings his A Game to every role, and THE BOOK OF ELI is no exception; in fact, this might be one of the actor's finest performances, as Washington plays Eli, a quiet, peace-loving man--yet peace rarely finds him--on a mission of destiny in a post-apocalyptic world.  By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.  Annoying to be sure, but not annoying enough to take enjoyment away from a commanding performance and a very moving film.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

$REVIEW.: There are two words that describe this dvd: bittersweet. While it's a joyous occasion to see the band onstage again, it's sad knowing this would be one of the last times the group would be performing onstage in the UK.There's an extremely high level of emotion on this dvd, as well as some tension. Mike Love takes over most of the show, making the rest of the group seem like a backing band. Dennis Wilson is good here but his use of drugs becomes increasingly evident with each performance. Al and Carl give the best performances. Al dlievers strong renditions of &quot;Cottonfields&quot;, &quot;Heroes And Villains&quot; and &quot;Help Me Rhonda, and Carl's heavenly voice shines above the rest on &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. Bruce Johnston remains hidden for the most of the show, but this would change later in the tour when he got his own solo spot. Brian Wilson, overweight to the nines at this point, sits perched behind a piano for most of the show, contributing a few lines on &quot;Sloop John B&quot; and &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. The main complaint I have is the sound. The band's backing vocals on &quot;God Only Knows&quot; seem to be buried in the mix. These differences aside, this makes for a very good dvd.

$review_text.: I will admit that I was a little surprised to find out that most of the talking with the band members throughout this DVD was done during the tunage parts
However unlike most, I really liked the way this DVD flows together


Yes the music is interrupted in mid song from time to time, but the way they've done it, truly ads something to the very tune that's being presented at that time

To hear these guys sitting back and discussing what they were/are thinking about each song is truly amazing

To hear the heartfelt laughs from all the members again after years of issues between them is great


They are obviously very happy about the chance to play together again and this show tells you that
The song selection is great and the sound is better than average, but not outstanding.This DVD is more of a documentary style look at a truly iconic band than  true concert footage
The concert footage, which is great by the way is just the topping to this reunion cake


I unlike many others here, loved to hear from each members of this great band


The tunes only add to the experience.Well Done boys, you've brought us a new understanding of what those early daze must have been like.Sabbath Rulz!

$REVIEW.: I have read other reviewers say &#34;you either love or hate this film&#34;.  There is plenty of both in this film.  This film is presented in 4:3 aspect ratio not 16:9.  The worst part of this film is the music.  1980's synthesizer junk just does not belong in this film.  There are several big name stars in this film, God they look so young.  It is easy to miss them.  The acting is pretty good but is a little stiff and forced at times.  The directing or flow of the film is a little choppy, the scenes do not flow seamless together but instead appear as individual scenes, but it does effectively tell the story.  Speaking of which, the story is very good with grand themes of good vs evil mixed in with personal choices of good and evil and how they effect each other.  Where this film really shines in in the visuals, just creepy and foreboding from the first scene to the last.  There is no blood and gore and no CG, just a creepy, suspenseful atmosphere.It is for the films visuals alone that I would recommend it to a friend (with the a grain of salt.)

$REVIEW.: If you can get past the 3 hour running time then go see Lord of the Rings. One of the most visually stunning, powerful films ever made. I have never read the book and was only interested in the film because of all the hype surrounding it. It is a masterpiece. Filled with riveting performances from Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchet, and most notabley Sir Ian Mckellan, as well as the rest of the mostly unknown cast. It's exciting, intense, and beautiful to watch. Yes, it is a long long movie, but barely noticable. Well worth it, and the only thing that makes me mad is that we all have to wait a whole year for the sequel.

$review_text.: Let's say, hypothetically, you're sitting around with a bunch of your friends and all of you decide that you're going to purposefully make the absolute worst movie ever


 You would probably start with a weak opener like some married guy drives a sedan out into the desert to pick up a hooker with a heart of gold and then decides to drive said hooker back to his house and move the hooker into the guest room
 You would probably drop some gem of dialogue early in the movie to keep the audience guessing for about three seconds as to what the predictable plot twist is going to be


 Just for good measure you would probably use incredibly tired camera tricks like soft focus to let the audience know a character is good at heart but misunderstood or blue lighting to let the audience know there's a dream sequence featuring a flowy white dress or a gratuitous butt shot complete with a half profile of a guy looking over his shoulder in the moonlight all but saying "come hither"


 You and your friends might also decide to have every character cry and embrace at the drop of a hat

 And finally, just to make sure your audience is completely disappointed, you'd make sure the cast doesn't even offer a decent contribution for the spank bank


 The movie that you and your friends would create would still be an Oscar winner compared to Cowboy Junction.I put the movie in and started watching it


 Within the first minute there's an awkwardly staged fight in the desert between all the rent boys that are waiting for johns on a dirt road (not quite sure how that was supposed to work)
 I nearly stopped the movie there, but decided to give it five more minutes
 During that five minutes, a john magically shows, picks up one of the guys, somehow manages to engage in a sexual act (I'm not sure which one), embraces the boy during his emotional breakdown, and drives the boy back to his home and casually introduces him to his wife as the new "handyman".I just kept sitting there watching as the horrible-ness continued unfolding and promising myself I would only watch five more minutes
 Just when I thought "this is as bad as it's going to get", it would get worse

 I couldn't turn it off
 The whole time I was thinking, "Surely, they meant for it to be this bad because there's no way they could have done this much wrong on accident."I wish everyone in the world would watch the movie because I don't think you can fully appreciate how bad it is just by reading a review


 You need to experience it for yourself.My only reason for giving it three stars is I wish the distributors would rename the movie "Cowboy Junction: The worst gay movie ever" and market it as a parody of gay romance movies.

$review_text.: This is one of those series that you're almost embarrassed to admit that you like. The packaging leads you to believe it's another cutesy anime, until you open it and find a few...er, revealing drawings on the insert. The packaging is more ecchi than the series, although the series does have its moments (some of which give the old Gainax bounce a run for its money). Once you actually start watching the series, though, you're likely to become addicted to it very quickly. Sure, the genre's been done before, but not to my knowledge with a 1/6th human sized &quot;cyberdoll&quot; as the star. You really start caring about May, Kazuya, and Kasumi as the series progresses. Even the 'bad guys' are fun, especially given their high rate of defection to May's/Kazuya's side (Sara is one of my all-time favorite 'nemesis' characters now - watch the series and you'll see why). This DVD wraps up the series with 3 regular episodes and a special bonus that was only included on the original Japanese DVD set. If you enjoyed the drama of the middle episodes, you'll really love the way the series ends - while it's no dramatic masterpiece, it's extremely well done for a show of this type. You'll also love the bonus episode, which is arguably the funniest one of the series. All in all, it's a show worth your time - as long as you can see past the gratuitous panty shots, that is. ;-)

Forget all the hoopla about Streep and DeCaprio...this is Keaton's movie from beginning to end.While Streep  and DiCaprio are chewing up the scenery, Keaton steals the show as the  unselfish sister tending to her invalid father and squirrely aunt (a fine  performance by Gwen Verdon).This is not a film to see for laughs or  yuks.  It's a film about the complications of family, aging, coming of age,  and illness....in other words, it's a very intimate look at real life.Keaton left her Annie Hall ticks/wardrobe/affectations at home and  turned in a great performance.

$REVIEW.: Lisa (Reese Witherspoon), a pro softball player, gets dropped from her team and is devastated about it. But she's spent her whole life being a tough gal who refuses to let anything get her down, and she refuses to give into her anger and grief at a major life setback. She sees doing so as self-indulgent and weak.At the same time all of this drama is going on with her life, Lisa has a chance to go out with two very different guys. Matty (Owen Wilson), is a wealthy, major-league pitcher, who beds endless women whom he never gets attached to. He has only one preference: he thinks that fit, young, female athletes make the best bed partners. Matty's empty-headed but cheery and light-hearted approach to life fulfills Lisa's wish that neither she nor anyone else discuss her pain and grief. Matty is more than happy to be an insensitive clod in service of her desire. It's his preferred way of interacting with everyone in his life.George (Paul Rudd), is Lisa's other romantic opportunity. He is currently the fall guy at his father's firm in Washington, D.C. for fraud that he didn't commit. His legal problems lead to getting dumped by his cold-hearted professor girlfriend and fired from his executive job at the family firm. George is perfectly willing to discuss his and Lisa's mutual problems on their first date, which is a blind date set up through one of Lisa's friends. It's a good offer, but Lisa stops him flat. She informs him that her idea of the perfect date is for the two of them to eat in complete silence, which George good-naturedly agrees to do. Amazingly, George, who is a sentimental, idealistic softie, finds Lisa's brusqueness comforting, and he falls hard for her. The only conclusion one can draw given the string of awful people in George's life is that apparently he is a sucker for punishment.Thus begins a long, rather boring odyssey that, in my humble opinion, can only be enjoyed by someone who doesn't particularly like or respect romantic comedy--or popular films in general. The film alternates between presenting George's life and Lisa's, which through most of the film rarely intersects. George wanders from scene to scene, at the mercy of a string of users in his life, most notably (and the obvious progenitor for all of them), his father (Jack Nicholson). Lisa also wanders from scene to scene, at the mercy of her need to avoid feeling disempowered, in the process subjecting herself to a dead-end romantic entanglement with Matty, whom she moves in with not because they are compatible, but simply to use him as an emotional drug to deaden her feelings of loss and despair. In her case as well, the link to how she was raised--and probably coached in a harsh world of sports--has created her tough, warrior persona.I don't have anything against psychological dramas, but I prefer they admit to being dramas, not falsely bill themselves as "comedy," as this film has been marketed. There is barely a moment of comedy in it. There is no witty repartee, no comic surprise, no comic misunderstandings. The only pseudo-comic moment is one, lone pratfall when George slides down the stairs, but that's about it.I am a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon, Jack Nicholson, and Paul Rudd. I've even enjoyed some of Owen Wilson's comedies. But unfortunately, I found this movie a sad waste of their considerable talents and a strong disappointment to me as a lover of romantic comedy.

$REVIEW.: Normally I'm not much of a one for priest and nun humor--unless, of course, they're walking into a bar with a rabbi and an imam. But Bless Me Father is an exception. A gently humorous little Britcom that follows a puffed-up rotund little Irish priest in England, along with his frequently baffled young assistant priest and a formidable old housekeeper who takes no guff--even from the pope's representative in the parish. A gem. Especially recommended for those who like their TV humor family-rated.

$REVIEW.: Did this movie really need to be made? The first movie was fresh, funny and cute.  The sequel however, is annoying, not funny and lacks charm.  No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots.To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film.Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed. He was annoying in this film because he didn't fit in this time around.Overall, 2004's most eagerly awaited film turned out to be 2004's most disappointing film.  Please, do not make a third installment.

This puzzles me, the footage on the dvd is good, but there should be more.  The sequences on the italian campaign were very good.  Although I don't think these two battles really belong together.

$REVIEW.: I had never seen The Artist and eagerly anticipated its release on DVD and Blu-Ray.  When Amazon offered a pre-release purchase, I went ahead and ordered the Blu-Ray version.  Well, playing it is sheer agony.  I own three Blu-Ray players, all high end.  On one player, it played the movie without sound (yes, I know it's a mostly-silent film, but it wouldn't play any of the background music at all).  The extras, however, played perfectly well.  Player #2 simply wouldn't read the disc and ejected it after repeated tries.  Player #3 played the disc.  However, getting to the movie is an ordeal.  First of all, the upload time is maddening and then moving through two separate sets of previews is frustrating.  Finally, when the movie was ready to play, it took what seemed like forever to begin.  And then when you stop, it doesn't remember where you left off (as it does with DVD's) -- you have to go through the entire nightmare again.  So, the movie is wonderful, but the Blu-Ray is terrible.  (There has happened before with Blu-Rays.  It's not worth what they say is a better picture.  I'm sticking to DVD's next time.)  Hence, my single star rating.

A nightmare fantasy that I could get lost in, like going into a variety of dimensions, in your wall, behind your radiator, in your light bulb, etc

This film has true substance and allows you to understand that negative space is more important than positive space or just as important
The atomsphere is thick with dimension, sometimes we forget about that, it holds together all that is and not was isn't

$review_text.: This is a beautifully filmed story set in Montana about horse rustlers and a regulator hired to essentially assasinate them. Jack Nicholson gives a very understated and solid performance as the leader of the rustlers who sets up as a farmer near the ranch of the intended victim. Marlon Brando is irresistably quirky as the Irish-accented regulator. He, in my opinion, was brilliant in this.The story can be a bit slow at times and the conclusion is less than satisfying but along the way the film is extremely entertaining and watchable.

$review_text.: Featuring a number of surprising and deft, if slightly theatrical performances, JEFFREY is a winning movie that confronts the issue of a gay man who has developed a fear of sex.  Frank, sexy and funny, this adaptation of Paul Rudnick's play moves at a brisk pace, and is nicely opened up for the movie screen.  Stephen Weber is adorable as Jeffrey, and Patrick Stewart, Christine Baranski and Sigourney Weaver have funny, funny cameos.  While the subject matter seems slightly dated today, given the advances in AIDS drug therapy, the soul and heart of Jeffrey's dilemma is as true today as it was back in the distant late-80s/early-90s.  By the final moments, you will find the romance at this movie's heart moving and sweetly real.

$review_text.: Dark City has become a sort of near-classic with fans of Sci-Fi and fantasy. It's based on a fairly common premise- and I'm not really giving anything away by saying it's a premise used later by &quot;The Matrix&quot; and films going back as far the the 1960s 3D classic &quot;The Bubble&quot;- and for the most part, it delivers.Visually it's an absolute stunner, and it's worth watching for that alone. The pacing is good, and plot development proceeds nicely for the most part, although the end may not be terribly satisfying to fans of films like Blade Runner, with which Dark City has been compared.The acting is really the one glaring weakness of the film, and it's not the overall level of acting, but the stark contrast between the best of the cast and the worst. William Hurt and Ian Richardson are the real standout players, and Richardson in particular does a brilliant job of delivering some pretty silly lines and making them sound not only serious, but dark and forboding. Most of the supporting cast deliver similarly strong performances.But two of the leads rather pale in comparison. Rufus Sewell is a classic Hollywood pretty face- he reminds me of a young Victor Mature- but the depth and range of his acting just doesn't match up with Richardson and Hurt. Sewell does a fine job for the most part, but when teamed up with Hurt or Richardson in a scene he seems to fade into the background. Keifer Sutherland is another problem. His overly-affected performance reminds me of a high school student attempting to play  someone in their 70s. It's just too affected, too gimmicky.And yet despite my complaints I think it's still well worth seeing. A good choice to round out an evening of noir Sci-Fi viewing on a more upbeat note.

At three years old, my young daughter is enamored of all things princess, and Cinderella is clearly the most beloved princess of all.  We recently were lucky enough to take a fabulous Disney cruise.  When my daughter actually got to meet Cinderella, to hug her and to talk to her, she was quite literally quivering.  I truly thought she might faint from the excitement.  It was her dream come true.Disney's classic masterpiece brings Cinderella's story to life, in full, rich, beautiful color, with familiar, catchy, adored songs, and gorgeous, detailed, vivid animation.  This tale is endearing to princesses of all ages, young and old alike.  We watch Disney's CINDERELLA several times a week in our house, and every time, my daughter watches straight through from beginning to end, completely enchanted.  Heck, I am still completely enchanted, even after all these years.  It is lovely, charming, sweet, and happy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all princesses everywhere.

$review_text.: Jacques Perrin's filmmaking team spent four years creating a masterpiece out of one of the most basic elements of our natural world - the seasonal migration of birds.  The result is nothing short of a riveting film.Cynics might ask how anyone can be spellbound by watching the simple act of birds flying from one place to another.  The answer is that sometimes the simplest, most basic art is the most enjoyable.  Just as a great artist or sculptor can make a masterpiece out of the basic human form, a film can become great just by focusing on what we see everyday and making us appreciate it in an entirely new way.Suffice it to say that any viewer of this movie will never look at birds the same way again.Tracking various species of migratory birds across each continent, "Winged Migration" uses revolutionary camera work and understated narration/exposition to achieve wondrous effects.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to fly in formation with migrating geese, go fishing like a pelican, or soar with bald eagles, "WM" will give you the answer.  Using a self-invented flying contraption, the cameramen were able to get right into birds flying in formation in dizzying shots.  This is tremendous work.With "March of the Penguins" and "Planet Earth," we are in a golden age of nature-documentaries. "Winged Migration" belongs in the top-tier of this fascinating genre.Full disclosure - a couple of scenes will be tough for kids (e.g., crabs hunting down a bird with a broken wing, a baby penguin getting munched by other birds, etc.).  These scenes are handled tastefully, but might require some comforting of the youngsters.

I agree with the concept of needing both cardio fat burning and ab work to get yourself a happy midsection, but the problem is that it's just not that intense and does both part way.  I think that if you are just getting back into shape it would be good, but if you want the intensity one needs to get anywhere close to the stomach that the instructor has, you are going to need another video.

$REVIEW.: Deadwood is nothing short of a revelation. The show captures the grittiest, grimiest aspects of life in and around the Gold Rush era through the happenings of a small mining town. Deadwood is unflinching and uncompromising, which is what makes it easily the best show on television today. Timothy Olyphant plays Seth Bullock, a man of means and morality. He anchors the show from the chaos and anarchy around him. The show's true star is Ian McShane's Al Swearengen. He is complex and dark but you can also see a bit of good in him behind the tough talking facade. Swearengen runs the Gem Saloon, a brothel and for all intensive purposes runs the daily operations of the camp. What amazed me the most was the audacity of the producers to introduce a core character, Wild Bill Hickock, and then kill him off in the middle of the first season. Hickock's death signified to me, a show that holds nothing sacred, it is truly television without rules, outlaw television and you have to admire it. Each character in Deadwood is fascinating in their own way, from E.B. Farnham's deceptive nature to Cy Tolliver's mean streak, the show always brings you the unexpected and keeps you on your toes. Some people will complain about the coarse language and graphic violence but Deadwood is closer to "reality tv" than any of these other so called "reality" shows eventhough its fiction. Overall, fans of westerns and just good acting, directing and mainly writing should buy this soon to be classic first season on DVD and cherish it. Kudos to HBO for producing a tough, unfiltered nor dumbed down look at the wild west. Highest Recommendation.

$REVIEW.: I had so much excitement about getting this show once is was released in the summer. Having never seen it before and loving Smallville, a show by the same producers, I was really eager to love this short-lived show based on the three heroines fighting crime in a Batmanless New Gotham City. I watched the pilot with a few other people. They absolutely hated it, and I decided it was okay and I would continue to watch. The acting was not that hot, even if the main girl, played by Ashley Scott, was, and the visual effects were pretty crappy considering the time. The overall production values weren't horrible but the overlooking shots of New Gotham City looked corny, even though I liked and appreciated the flying, whizzing shots twisting around the buildings and zooming in on an over the top New Gotham Police Department. The writing was shaky, but the overall plotlines of each episode were adequate. I particularly loved the episode called Slick, about the water Metahuman  who drowns people on dry land. Some good effects were used well in this one. But that's the only episode I REALLY liked. The thing is with this show, everything in it is used, nothing really new going on. Metahumans in this. Meteor Freaks and aliens in Smallville. Three strong female heroines, been done in Charmed and countless others. I was really looking forward to this because I love Batman stuff and basically anything superheroish and this show fell considerably short for me. This show is NOT for people who like Batman. I'd recommend this to the younger crowd who aren't as experience in shows like this. Anyone who has seen Buffy, Angel, Charmed, Dark Angel, Batman, Smallville (that mostly) will most likely be rolling their eyes at this even though it does offer small doses of fun, silly action with some fun comic book style production values. Unfortunately, the content of the show doesn't have much value in it. Maybe if it had run a full season or more it would have found a good footing.

$review_text.: Is it indeed possible to remain neutral in a world that demands we take sides?  The Jimmy Stewart character in this movie attempts to do just that and in the end pays the same price as if he had chosen sides
 Perhaps the cost is the same whether we choose or not

 Or, perhaps the moral cost is greater when choosing sides

 Is it better, after all, to choose the lesser of two evils?  As many reviewers have already noted, this is not Mr
Stewart's best but the questions it raises about the relative morality of war and our obligation to the state are interesting ones indeed

 Mr
Stewart takes the libertarian road less traveled until circumstances force his intervention

 And perhaps that is why, despite lacklustre reviews, this movie remains a classic for so many.

$REVIEW.: If you like to see crude men get slapped in the face as only Barbara Stanwyck can do it, this movie is the one for you. Clash By Night is a noir-ish film filled with snappy repartee. Urban girl, Mae Doyle (BS) returns to the lazy fishing village of her childhood to lick the wounds of her complicated life. She marries oaf-ish Jerry, (Paul Douglas) for the serenity and security that kind of simple life will provide.  They have a child and Mae soon gets bored, her irritation complicated by the muggy, summer heat. I am of and age to remember when women went around in their one-piece white slips and men in their tank undershirts to beat the summer heat, and alot of this goes on in the movie. This is an excellent "bored woman has affair with someone far beneath her husband (Robert Ryan) drama," complete with alcoholic rantings by more than one player. Waves crash violently on the shore as we await their fates. Marilyn Monroe, sporting a modified poodle hair-do, sizzles as Mae's young sister-in-law.

$REVIEW.: After we watched this season 1 set of DVD's  I checked the books out of the library and read all the other stories.  I think there are more than 16 of them.  Kerry Greenwood is an excellent writer and I love the vocabulary and the development of characters.  Sometimes it is slow going to keep track of all the characters so it is important to read the books in order to make it easier.  I can't wait for season 2.

$REVIEW.: That's pretty much how I can describe it.  While watching it, it felt better than it actually was, but rethinking back, it was nowhere near the level of the previous two years' Wrestlemanias.Money in the BankEdge vs Matt Hardy vs King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs Randy Orton vs Finlay vs CM Punk vs Kennedy KennedyIt came and went, and was above average, and it was short, and it was not as well-put together as the previous two years.  The most memorable high spot of course is the ladder spot with Jeff jumping onto Edge laid out on a ladder propped between the ring apron and the guard-rail, breaking the ladder in half.  It actually managed to look and sound better as a Youtube clip than on the event itself.  Crowd was almost completely dead for most of the beginning, and barely gave this ladder spot the pop it deserved.  (7/10)Kane vs The Great Khali(0/10)WWE United States ChampionshipMVP vs NO ONE WHO'S NAME DOES NOT RHYME WITH "BRIS END LAW"~!This one had a surprise twist in that MVP actually managed to out-wrestle the technical wrestler here, putting on some almost Angle/NO ONE chain wrestling as was seen in Wrestlemania X7.  The problem was that the crowd was completely dead for most of this (Just like Benoit a few months later, OH SNAPSZ~!  Terrible joke), and the match wasn't as long as it should likely have been.  (7/10)World Heavyweight ChampionshipBatista (C) w/o BASKETBALLS~! vs the Undertaker w/ Druids to waste five minutes with piped-in chantingSmackdown main event practically a curtain jerker as the third match on the card?  BAAAHAHAHAHAH!  This was one match that felt better when watching it than it actually was.  Further retrospective reflection shows that the Undertaker carried most of the match, as he did with Mark Henry in Wrestlemania 22, but this was no classic match.  (5/10)ECW Originals vs NEW BREEDTommy Dreamer, Sabu, Sandman, Rob Van Dam vs Marcus Cor Von, Elijah Burke, Matt Striker, Kevin ThornThe match almost made me cry as the audience was absolutely DEAD for the entire first half of the match.  No pops for anyone but Rob Van Dam.  This is just to show you just how much the WWE cares about pushing the ECW originals and getting the crowd behind them (hint, not at all).  The audiene finally started to make noise at some point in the middle.  Mildly entertaining match killed by total crowd apathy and piss-poor hype buildup.  (6/10)A note on the matches thus far and to come, considering how this crowd is supposedly recordbreaking 80,103 people, I expect a damn lot of noise from them, and thus far they're behaving like a half-empty 2,000 full arena; it didn't sound anywhere near as loud as 80,000 people at any moment in the event.BATTLE OF THE BILLIONAIRES~!Vince McMahon | Umaga vs Donald Trump | Bobby "Lindsay"How painfully stupidly awkward this publicity stunt was.  And it -was- a publicity stunt.  Not hard to believe how badly WWE was doing at this point in time ratings-wise that they needed to do this.  Seeing Donald Trump pretend to be interested in wrestling and the soap opera-ish kayfabe of it was embarassing.  Seeing Trump awkwardly clothesline Vince McMahon, and do a piss-poor job of selling Stone Cold's stunner was embarassing.  The match itself was straight out of Umaga's Royal Rumble match against John Cena --- Umaga utterly squashed Bobby Lashley, but since McMahon's an idiot who kept screwing with Stone Cold rather than let Umaga kill Bobby Lashley, Stone Cold flips and beats up Umaga so Lashley can steal a win.Seriously, the ending was never in doubt; you honestly think uptight Donald Trump is going to be shaved bald instead of Vince McMahon?  Say what you will about McMahon as a promoter or a booker, but he is an amazing boss in that he will go all-out and do anything to entertain people, even if he goes overboard by inserting his character into places it should not be (ie, the center of the Invasion angle, overshadowing the fatal four way at Wrestlemania 2000), he still puts his body on the line all the time.  He is as Alexander the Great was; right there in the front lines with his men.  He does everything he asks his wrestlers to do, from wrestling to high spots and bumps to humiliation.  I commend Vince McMahon for that, but I cannot commend stupid stunts like this match was.  (2/10)WWE Women's ChampionshipAshley vs Melina.  Who the hell cares who was champion to start?Reviewer "Cryza" says that the Women's championship should never be defended at Wrestlemania.  I would have argued against that if it weren't ASHLEY MASSARO wrestling in this garbage match.  But for the time being, as the WWE hires more models and less female wrestlers, it will be a fact that women's matches will almost always suck.  (0/10)WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena (C) vs Shawn MichaelsSince this was deep in the reign of Superman Cena as the undefeated "exalted one" who would never lose the championship to anyone short of God Himself, and even then he would need an immediate rematch the next day to win it back.  Many superstars have been booked in this sort of way but unlike them all, Cena did not have the wrestling skill or the charisma to back it up.At first I thought it was just an occasional occurrence, but this match is the third instance in which I saw John Cena's strength---getting beat up on.John Cena has this amazing ability to bring out the very best in his opponent; in making them beat on him so thoroughly and passionately that it feels like the bookers make you eat their underwear when Cena wins it after his opponent puts on a match of a lifetime performance.Wrestlemania 21: JBL puts on the absolute best match of his life, dominating Cena for a good 90% of the match, only to lose in an ass way after having been on the dominating end for the last few minutes.Royal Rumble 2007: Cena gets more offense in, but Umaga just sells MONSTER HEEL to new heights and levels in the absolute best match of his career, but SUPER CENA NEEDS TO RETAIN, DAMMIT!  Invisible white boy rapper with square jaw and monkey face = MONEY~!And so in this match, the very same Shawn Michaels who in the last year's Wrestlemania I called a great entertainer but a poor wrestler, puts on a spellbindingly entertaining wrestling match, with absolutely unbelievable psychology (Michaels wants to shake Cena's hand at the beginning, Cena refuses, Michaels absolutely brutalizes him and screams at him, slaps him around, mocks and taunts him, then refuses Cena's handshake at the end), and while Cena put in even more offense than at the Royal Rumble, he was still little more than a stumpy roid ranger who did little more than F-U's, clotheslines, punches, and generic hoss offense, while Shawn Michaels MADE this match.  (7/10)And just like the Smackdown main event at Wrestlemania 21, Cena gets his ass beat by an opponent who goes all out like an exterminator using a laser death ray on a cockroach or a soldier using an air strike to take out a single enemy soldier, and yet STILL Super Cena wins it, because he's John Cena and Vince McMahon cannot bear to have him be pinned by anyone.And the crowd mirrored this sentiment, as in the beginning HALF the people were for Shawn Michaels, and HALF were for John Cena, and by the middle of it, almost EVERYONE was for Shawn Michaels, and only the kids were still for John Cena.  You could clearly tell the tones of the crowd, as the cheers for Shawn Michaels were louder, lower, and throatier, while the cheers for John Cena had virtually no bass to them, and were too high to include women.On the whole, the matches were decent enough for a Wrestlemania, but the overall booking was subpar, the crowd was pathetically out of it for almost everything but the main event, and there was way too much in the way of filler and time-wasting like repeating overly-dramatic hype videos and the 10 minute entrances before the BATTLE OF THE BILLIONAIRES~! match.

$REVIEW.: The title is dialogue spoken at the diabolical finish to this classic and famous film noir based on the radio play of the same name.  It stars Barbara Stanwyck as Leona Stevenson, a rich invalid who overhears a telephone conversation between two men who are plotting the murder of an unidentified woman.  Alone, from her sickbed she desperately tries to find somebody who will listen to her story and stop the murder from happening.  Burt Lancaster co-stars as Henry Stevenson, Leona's handsome husband from the wrong side of the tracks.Stanwyck's performance is excellent, although according to what I understand (not having heard the radio play), she is not as good as Agnes Moorehead was in the original.  Be that as it may, Stanwyck grows in the part until as the story ends she is totally authentic and believable.Lancaster too does a good job in one of his earlier roles.  He went on to star in scores of important films, perhaps most notably in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Elmer Gantry (1960).  Here he is a bit tentative, his enormous screen charisma held in check playing a compromised character.The screenplay by Lucile Fletcher, based on her radio play, was expanded for the silver screen and consequently the story loses a bit dramatically as the tension is diffused as the end is delayed.  Fletcher uses flashbacks to fill us in on the story of how Henry and Leona met and how the murder plot developed and why.I thought director Anatole Litvak did a good job with the flashbacks, but frankly their artificiality was noticeable.  I would have preferred starting the story at the beginning when Leona and Henry first meet and then telling it chronologically without flashback.  But that would have been a great departure from the structure of the very successful radio play.Because of the added material, the movie becomes something more than the original intention.  Indeed the theme is expanded, that of the possible consequences of marrying for money, and the consequences--from Leona's point of view--of marrying someone who may or may not love you.  I thought this was well done.  It is especially interesting to see how trapped Henry feels working for his father-in-law and even living in his father-in-law's house.  Also interesting is how Leona's insecurities regarding Henry's love are manifested in psychosomatic symptoms.When Hollywood once again reprises this (and you can be sure they will, but perhaps they will use email and not the telephone) I suggest that they concentrate on both the dramatic and psychological aspects of the story and tell it straight.Bottom line: Despite some awkwardness and dissipation of tension, this is one of the best film noirs from that classic era of the genre, the late forties and early fifties.  See this for Barbara Stanwyck, one of Hollywood's celebrated stars whose career spanned half a century beginning in the silent film era.

$REVIEW.: Intriguing that a clip collection featuring gallons of fake blood, car accidents victims and snowblowers operated by band members under the influence of LSD only warrants a PG rating, but that's the friendly charm of the Flaming Lips for you. Uplifting videos for the Cat Stevens-pilfering Fight Test, Do You Realize?? and SpongeBob SquarePants soundtrack addition (SpongeBob And Patrick Confront The) Psychic Wall (Of Energy) are grouped together with old lo-fi productions for When You Smile, Christmas At The Zoo and Turn It On. She Don't Use Jelly is also here, although sadly not lifted from the band's live performance of the track on Beverly Hills 90210. On this set there's no extra clips apart from a different version of Do You Realize??, but the band commentary for each clip is amusing due to its ramshackle presentation. Fearless but freaky...

$review_text.: Blue Ray with two good movies in it and for the price, you can's beat that!!. I had seen these movies before already. Michael Douglas does a good job in both, but especially playing the victim as a person accused of "sexual harassment" by his new boss, Demi Moore whom is also good at her roll. Good suspense movie and good story when you almost never hear the man is the one being sexually harass at the job, you always hear it when is a woman. As to Fatal Attraction, well, Glen Close co-starring in this one with Michael, playing the obsessed woman that she became after what he thought would be a one night fling for the both of them, turned into a nightmare! especially when he thought, that's what she had agreed it would be. Glen Close, really gets into her role in this one and she is really good at playing the "villain" here, although in her mind she believes to be the victim.  This one could almost be called a classic!. I recommend them both. They both had good scripts and good direction, not to say "good acting"Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: This movie is what I call &quot;Pure&quot; Sci-Fi... one that takes our reality, then adds a Science-Fiction element to it.  [i]Contact[/i] will not bore you if you get into the movie.  Ellie Arroway, portrayed beautifully by Jodie Foster, shows you just what a scientist's life is like, slightly Hollywoodized, on the silver screen.  Her spiritual, emotional, and scientific journey is one I don't think you'll want to miss.Are there aliens out there?  Is the main question and plot of this movie.  &quot;It would be an awful waste of space.&quot;It also delves a bit into the politics of the science world, which is refreshing and different for a Sci-Fi film.  The plot is also quite similar to the book, which I also recommend reading.The DVD, while preserving the sound and video to almost perfection, has included some worthwhile features.  The &quot;making of&quot; sequences tell quite a bit how a movie comes to light.Last but not least, if you're still not convinced, then you should get the movie just for the beginning and climax.  Keeping an open mind will help you understand just how those parts of the film are interesting, theoretical, and contraversial.

Beyond the alcoholism, this is such a low life style of living embraced by Tommy and his cohorts that I have to ask myself how much more I wish to know about these fire people.  I truly hope this is not a true cross section of fire fighters in America.  They certainly do not lack for bravery but they have just about every other character flaw one can imagine as depicted by this show.

$REVIEW.: Yet another triumph from director Akira Kurosawa and his favorite star, Toshiro Mifune, Yojimbo is one of the more influential films Kurosawa made. Although the simple "man in the middle pitting two sides against each other" has been seen as early as Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest, Yojimbo has been remade twice (as A Fistful of Dollars and the Walter Hill/Bruce Willis actioner Last Man Standing) and has long been recognized as one of the greatest samurai films ever made.Mifune stars as Sanjuro, a run-down samurai with no current direction. He happens upon a village with two feuding factions and instantly sees the opportunity. He hires himself out as a bodyguard, first to one then the other and has them wipe each other out with little physical effort of his own.But don't think that Kurosawa misses any opportunity to show off Sanjuro's skill with the sword. However, their appearances are few and therefore to be treasured. Mifune is perfect as the has-been samurai and Kurosawa's dark sense of humor has never been so showcased.Although not as praised as his masterpiece Seven Samurai, Yojimbo is more accessible to the average viewer and is thus a perfect introduction to the director's work.

And the fact that this is based on the life of a real person makes this one of the best movies of all time, in my humble opinion.Cuba Gooding brings you right into the movie. It's not easy portraying a real person, but he did it as great as he possibly could.A tale of overcoming the odds, and proving everybody wrong.Do not let this movie slip by you. You NEED to see it, to judge for yourself.I am not a person who liked the idea that blacks weren't equal. So this movie was a very emotional one for me, and I could watch it again and again and would never get tired of it.Men of Honor deserves the 5 stars I gave it, and anyone who hasn't seen it and is judging it by the negative responses need to find out for themselves. It's as simple as that.

It's not so much his performance which triumphs as much as the film itself, with an innovative and easy to follow story structure that surprised me. The thing you've gotta love about British comedies is they are so literate yet easy to follow. The writing is just so solid. As they say in Hollywood, it's a "high concept" story, well executed, as it were.Guinness as Captain Henry St. James seems to have the best of everything as he shuttles between Gibraltar and Morocco on his passenger vessel, enjoying the life of an intellectual yet bon vivant Captain both aboard his vessel and with his sultry girlfriend in Tangier or something (played with lusty gusto by the ravishing Yvonne De Carlo!) and a more placid married life with his obedient wife (Celia Johnson) back in the British territory of Gibraltar. It is the strong male fantasy element that kept me coming back for more.From the tender mercies of a firing squad to the miserable life of the two-timing bigamist (the flamenco dancing scene with Guinness and DeCarlo was the best!), Paradise is a film full of invidious and cross-cultural comparisons placed in an amusing and comical light. It's supposedly "male-chauvinist" investigation into the nature of marriage and relationships, with the Euro-British twist, is particularly enlightening. What is most unusual about the film is that, unlike most situation comedies, it takes place over a significant span of time -- time enough for his ladies to change their stripes.While Anthony Kimmins is not a famous director, I like his transparent, easy-going style, and his use of straight-on closeups was excellent. Kimmins doesn't get in the way of the story at all.The only bad thing I can say about this film is the ending to the story is not fully resolved, just implied. They skipped over some details in the interest of achieving a brisk 96 minutes. That's OK.I could hear foreshadowings of "Bridge on the River Kwai" in that excellent score by Malcolm Arnold (who scored both films -- many of the same "climbing dread" chord progressions), plus the fact that Guinness is also, in this film, a commander in uniform, once again reminds me of Kwai.For the infinitely malleable Guinness (this time in the sneaky rascal mold), and the very delicious, sexy Yvonne DeCarlo, this is a film you don't want to miss. Highly entertaining.

It is the kind of documentary that makes you understand how horrible war is and how much suffering experienced the people who lived it.  I wouldn't recommend it to young audiences due to the graphic nature of the images presented so as they say, viewer discretion is advised.

$review_text.: When most people think of movie studios (which they probably don't very often), they usually think of big names like Warner Brothers, Columbia, Paramount, MGM, 20th Century Fox and Universal.  But even when these old-timers were in their prime, their were other production companies as well such as Lippert Pictures.  Lippert was one of the "Poverty Row" studios that produced cheapie movies that were occasionally memorable but more often forgotten.  Hence, the collection of old Lippert pictures in the Forgotten Noir sets.  Series Two presents six short movies - with the longest being 82 minutes and two under an hour - that are definitely second or third tier material, but still are not without merit.The discs are labeled Four through Six (the first three in Series One).  I happened to watch the discs in reverse order, which is also how I'll review them.  Disc Six has I'll Get You and Fingerprints Don't Lie.  I'll Get You owes a bit to The Third Man, with George Raft as an American sneaking into England following up on a job offer from a man he met in the States.  By the time he was doing these Lippert Pictures (which would also include Loan Shark in Series One and The Man From Cairo, reviewed below), Raft was a bit long in the tooth for these tough guy roles.  The story is passable but unexceptional.More interesting - and more flawed - is Fingerprints Don't Lie, an early bare-bones version of a CSI episode.  Richard Travis plays a crime lab technician who feels he is about to send an innocent man to prison despite fingerprint evidence incriminating him. For better or for worse, this movie is one of three in this set to have Sid Melton providing comic relief.  Melton has a minor resemblance to Lou Costello in his shtick and occasionally is amusing but more often just provides distracting filler.  Even with Melton's stretching things out, this one just makes it to 56 minutes.On Disc Five is FBI Girl and Tough Assignment.  FBI Girl is the closest to an all-star movie in the set with Cesar Romero, George Brent, Audrey Totter and Raymond Burr.  The story has Burr as a political operative trying to get a hold of certain FBI records that could incriminate his employer.  Yes, the plot has holes and depends a bit on coincidences, but it is still probably the best in the set.  It even has a very early role for Peter Marshall, later of Hollywood Squares fame.  Tough Assignment is an utterly routine crime movie which is actually more of an updated western, with Don Barry as a reporter infiltrating a gang of modern-day cattle rustlers.  This is one of the three with Melton, and was directed by William Beaudine, one of the most prolific directors ever, though few of his movies are noteworthy:  Beaudine would eventually finish his career with the twin camp horror classics, Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula.The Man from Cairo and Mask of the Dragon are on Disc Four.  The Man from Cairo has George Raft in Algiers, accidentally involved in a hunt for $100,000,000 in missing French gold.  With romance, intrigue and an exotic setting, this should be a better movie than it really is.  Mask of the Dragon is a companion piece to Fingerprints Don't Lie with almost the exact same cast and crew.  With shades of The Maltese Falcon, this 55 minute film deals with a jade dragon that is worth killing over.None of these movies are really good, but none are awful, either, especially when you consider the miniscule budgets that were used to make them.  Besides the movies, there are some nice extras including photo galleries, trailers, biographies and some commentaries.  The commentaries are interesting, but the three done by Joel Blumberg (on Tough Assignment, Mask of the Dragon and Fingerprints Don't Lie) are often redundant, though informative.  If you only occasionally watch movies, this is not the set for you; if you are a die-hard movie aficionado, however, this set gives you a chance to see some really obscure movies.  If you like them, you can get the other Forgotten Noir set or the related Hammer Film Noir sets.

$review_text.: First of all I have 5 Taebo Videos and have been doing Taebo for 5 months now.1)Taebo Ripped Extreme2)This Is Tae Bo3)Taebo Cardio Explosion4)Ultimate Taebo5)Ultimate BootcampComparing Ultimate Taebo to #1, #2 and #3 it is not that great


I would Highly suggest #2 above all of them
I would then pick #3 then #1

I am leaving out Ultimate Bootcamp because it is not a cardio workout
That DvD is for building muscles and man does it ever
I won't write a review for it yet though.I did sweat a good bit from this video but I wasn't nearly out of breath like I am from #2


Most of the moves you see on this DvD you will see on the 3 I recommend


It makes sense though since this DvD(Ultimate Taebo) came first
The workout is good but I found it lacking in intensity
If you want itensity go with #2 and #3

I didn't like the dance moves around the 50 minute mark of the video
I'm not a dancer


If I wanted to dance I would buy Zumba

I want a kickass kick and punch video and didnt get it from Ultimate Taebo


Again #2 and #3 much better

I shut the video off at the 60 minute mark but I could have gone to the 90 minute mark no problem.

$REVIEW.: you get to the end and they make it into a kind of joke

 This is unfortunate:  you get a very scary plot, of this chip that is so valuable in what it can do that holders of it are automatically offed, but then they decide to, well, you have to see it to lose your faith in the film's plausible impossibility
 (OK, I don't want to be the spolier, but criticism is due).Before that silly ending, the suspence is wonderful and believable
 Redford is totally convncing, as is his old friend (Kingsley), who went to prison insead of him by chance


 They have this wonderful duality that you find n fiction, good and bad from experience and luck of the draw, and are now deadly enemies

 You get these wonderfully unorthodox solutions, such as the blind man helping Redford to find where he had been taken by the sound he remembers while blindfolded in a car trunk
 There are many touches like that, splendid details

 Then there is the caper, which is complex and frightening, with bad guys you could believe you would want to avoid

 It is great - 5 stars -  right up until the ridicoulous finale, which ruins the whole thng.Recommended, but skip the last 2 minutes.



$SUMMARY.: excellent techno-caper until...

$REVIEW.: The first season was incredibly interesting and the stories were excellent. The second season is almost as poorly written as the fabled Sherlock Holmes which stars the minimally talented Benedict Cumberbatch. I am aware that Cumberbatch is an idol to many British television viewers but I really do not care.The second season stories seem to have the writers struggling to find a reason and an opportunity for Det. Sgt. Drake to beat into submission as many defenseless suspects/witnesses/defendants as they can in each episode. I know this is merely entertainment, or what passes for entertainment, but maybe just once they could have some criminal beat Drake within an inch of his life.The brooding of Det. Insp. Reid is getting old, very old.Now the positive part of my narrative. I find the lovely MyAnna Buring well worth the price of admission. She is an incredibly talented actress and her beauty would make a blind man wish he could see.I am sure my failure to purchase a season 3 will not worry the producers of this show. Give me _A Touch of Frost_ any day.

$review_text.: I decided to write my review for the show until the season finished (which was last night), and I gotta say I loved this third season as much as seasons one and two! Since I watched the first two seasons on DVD, this was the first AHS season I watched on TV, and it was full of blood, horror, a great variety of very different characters that strangely bond together, and the addition of new actors was great. Emma, Gabourey, Angela and Kathy were spectacular with their roles, and the returning actors were awesome as usual.But the best about AHS is that you never know what's going to happen next, and this happens a LOT in this season. They are a lot of "OMG" moments, and I gotta admit I yelled at my TV with some stuff that happened. The plot moves really fast from one episode to the next one, and every episode is a good one! There's always something happening with all the characters. My favorite character from this season was Misty Day; Lily Rabe really proves that she can play anything! Of course, it lacks the horror of the previous seasons, but it compensates it with awesome performances and a good storyline. I can't wait to get it on DVD and watch the whole season again. Buy this if you're an AHS fan, or if you're looking for a great show about witches(mini-series)!

$review_text.: I originally purchased this movie largely because X-Files creator Chris Carter cited it and the short-lived Night Stalker TV series as important influences on his own vision.  I also love vampire movies.  This does seem to be a rather unusual TV movie for its era (1971), but you can hardly go wrong when Richard Matheson is the scriptwriter.  Darren McGavin is wonderful as Kolchak, the much-beleaguered, formerly big-name newspaper reporter determined to get to the bottom of a string of murders in Las Vegas.  The cast is rather interesting, featured Larry Linville of M*A*S*H fame as the "boy coroner" and Claude Akins as Sheriff Butcher.  This is a rather old TV movie, so there is virtually no blood to be seen outside of IV packs and bottles, but there is plenty of suspense.  Kolchak is brought back from vacation by his editor to cover the string of murders, yet the editor won't publish anything Kolchak writes.  The police are no fans of him, either.  When Kolchak makes the logical conclusion that the killer is a real-life vampire, the authorities are less than open to such a possibility--at least, until a swarm of Las Vegas' finest cannot bring down the suspect with brawn and bullets.  Don't expect to see Count Dracula in this one; Kolchak's vampire is not suave or mysteriously handsome at all; his appearance explains why he attacks women rather than seduces them.  I must say that the ending was somewhat unusual and helps to distinguish this movie from the string of forgettable, darkly comical string of low-budget vampire movies of the 1970s and 1980s.  History shows that it is not easy to make a decent vampire movie, but The Night Stalker succeeds rather impressively.  Having been made for TV, it is rather short (clocking in at around 78 minutes), but The Night Stalker deserves a place among the better vampire movies ever made. Even  the most squeamish of viewers should be able to sit through this movie without a problem.  I myself prefer more blood and gore in my horror movies, but the kind of suspense this movie manufactures is the most critical factor in its success.

$REVIEW.: Mr. White ( Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange ( Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink ( Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue ( Edward Bunker), and Mr. Brown ( Quentin Tarantino) are all perfect strangers that have been brought together by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney)to pull a simple diamond store heist. Unfortunately, when they show up, the cops are waiting for them and the simple robbery turns into a blood bath. Now this obviously means that they were set up. But no one knows which one of them is the police informant. The majority of the film involves introducing us to the characters and showing how they came to be involved, as well as flashbacks and flashforwards taking us through the day to watch the events unfold.&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; marked the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and I must say that it has to be one of the best film debuts that I have ever seen. The cast picked for this film was absolutely perfect. They all offer outstanding performances, and the film could not have succeeded without them. Tarantino was not only responsible for the direction of the film, but also wrote the flawless script. The script is brilliant. You have got a simple robbery gone wrong, that turns into a hard to solve mystery. Any man could be guilty. Not to mention the violence, which includes the infamous torture scene with Michael Madsen. The main reason this film succeeds, is that it shows what ordinary crime films keep out - the frustration when something goes wrong, the humor, and the clashing of egos between the criminals. The soundtrack to this movie is outstanding as well, and each song used fits each scene perfectly.Overall, this is one of the best crime films that I have ever seen. The film is shot brilliantly taking us back and forth over the day of the robbery. This provides for tons of violence, a hard to solve mystery, and outstanding dialogue between the characters. This is the first crime film that I have seen that runs mainly on the personalities of the characters, and not the actual story. The DVD is great. The film was re-released with this Special 2 Disc Edition. Now you get deleted scenes, interviews with all of the cast, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, and much more.

$review_text.: Billy Wilder's WW2 Oscar nominated classic "Five Graves to Cairo" released in 1943, is typical of propagandized movies coming out of Hollywood at this time.British corporal John J. Bramble played by Franchot Tone gets abandoned in the Egyptian desert, falling off his tank retreating from Tobruk.  He makes his way to a remote desert hotel just before the arrival of the German high command.  Nervous hotel manager Akim Tamiroff and a youthful Anne Baxter playing a French chambermaid help him pose as the clubfooted hotel waiter.Upon the arrival of the pompous Field Marshal Rommel played by acting ham Erich von Stroeheim, we learn that the waiter is actually a German spy.  He becomes privy to military secrets that allow Rommel to successfully wage battle in Africa.  His mission becomes the delivery of this information to the British high command.While the acting is decent, I never was impressed by the timid Tone as a leading man. I would have preferred original choice for the role, Cary Grant.  Tamiroff, however, proves time and time again to be an excellent character actor.

$REVIEW.: So we reach the end of one phase; although Principal Li isn't eaten by a giant worm, and the school isn't blown up, Daria and Company have, in those immortal words, survived high school -- even without the aid of the Ramones.And what happens after high school?  Well, you start making decisions more-or-less on your own that will affect the entire future course of your life.  It's scary and one is tempted to duck out... but the decisions have to be made.What college?  What major?  College at all? Go to a college that looks good on a resume, or one that actually fits your own needs or desires?  And many others.Daria is stuck choosing between two schools -- the prestigious Ivy League-ish school that boyfriend Tom's family almost owns and which he will certainly be attending, and which Tom will attend, or the rather less prestigious school that her parents attended.Jane is panicking; she had intended to attend Boston Fin Arts College, but now she's beginning to have second thoughts; essentially, beginning to doubt whether she's good enough.And so on.For what is apparently the last hurrah of the series, we see the characters all being gloriously themselves; one of the first things Daria says as she and Jane share a pizza is "I wanted some sisterhood, just so long as it didn't involve my actual sister."Daria's acceptance speech as she receives a surprise award at graduation is a masterpiece of anome and sardonicism, summing up neatly some of the core concepts of the series.Daria, as a character, resonates deeply with many viewers, of course -- all too many of us barely survived high school intact (sometimes even in physical terms), and the loner who ignores or even actively disdains the values and enthusiasms of the majority and suffers for it is a classic archetype (or stereotype, depending on what you think of the character).Daria, of course, is the uninvolved sardonic onlooker carried to the extreme -- so far, sometimes, that she herself becomes the butt of the joke.This is probably not the place to begin with Daria; too many of the situations in this film depend on knowledge of the characters and of what has gone before -- but for the experienced Daria viewer, or for the newbie willing to take certain things as givens, it's a fitting farewell to the characters and milieu of the series.(A follow-on of Daria and Company in college/later life might be fun.  Or, of course, it might be a disaster...)Included are two episodes of the MTV series, "Lucky Strike", in which the teachers go on strike and Daria winds up substitute teaching, and "Boxing Daria", which was the final episode of the last season on MTV, and which examines Daria's relations with her parents and looks back to her childhood to give us a slightly different take on the givens of the sereis.((Also included is an easter egg featuring an early Daria appearance on "Beavis and Butthead" (she is the cousin of one of them) -- but, since it's "Beavis and Buttheead", i'm not going to tell you how to find it...))

$REVIEW.: BAD TEACHER is not a bad movie; it's just not that good.  Cameron Diaz plays a teacher whose dedication to her job is hardly admirable.  She merely teaches to raise money for a boob job--she's self-centered, amoral, foul-mouthed--a parent's worst nightmare...but in spite of this she's somehow likeable--almost.The movie does expose the oftentimes hypocritical side of education albeit stretching it to extremes.In spite of some funny moments, the movie ultimately isn't truly funny, winding up a bitter experience.Diaz is effective in her unlikeable role and other cast members give good support.  Justin Timberlake offers a humorous turn as a dimwitted love interest; Lucy Punch is on target as the uberteacher and Cameron's rival; Jason Segel and Phyllis Smith round out the cast.BAD TEACHER avoids many of this genre's cliches.  There are no redemptive moments or sudden enlightening revelations.  The tone is consistent to say the least!All in all, BAD TEACHER is somewhat guilty pleasure but doesn't inspire a lot of educational appreciation.

$REVIEW.: Roman Polanski's The Pianist is the real life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who was a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland.  Adrien Brody plays Szpilman and he gives a star-making performance.  Szpilman is a concert pianist who plays on Polish radio and as the film begins he is playing on the radio when the area of Warsaw the station is in is bombed.  The Szpilman family is defiant at first towards the news of the German occupation, but then like all Jewish families, they are forced to follow the strict rules the Nazis set forth regarding Jews.  They are made to move from their spacious and homey apartment into a [cramped], run down space in the designated Jewish ghetto.  The family struggles for money, but Wladyslaw is still able to play piano in a Jewish restaurant for meager earnings.  Eventually the family is in line to be sent to a concentration camp, but through sheer fate, Wladyslaw is pulled from the line boarding the train and is spared certain death.  He then spends time working a slave laborer building the wall separating the Jewish section of Warsaw from the rest of the city.  Again, he escapes through the gracious help of others and through the underground resistance is kept hid in an apartment away from detection.  Although free from the ghetto, he is a prisoner in the apartment and at the mercy of others.  He is facing starvation when he is forced to flee the apartment when it is bombed.  He hides out in a hospital for a while and eventually ends up in the bombed out ruins of Warsaw.  It is while he is hiding in the ruins that he again faces almost certain death when he is discovered by a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann).  Hosenfeld speaks with him and asks what Szpilman's profession was and Szpilman replies he is a pianist.  There happens to be a piano in the house and Hosenfeld makes Szpilman play.  Szpilman plays a gorgeous piece and Hosenfeld is moved to spare Szpilman's life.  He brings him food and when the Germans are retreating from the Russians, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat to keep warm.  It is the exchange between Hosenfeld and Szpilman that is the heart of the film and shows that despite the horror of war and the atrocities of the Nazis, that the true spirit of humanity can still shine through.  Ironically, Szpilman survived the war and went on to continue his career as a pianist and Hosenfeld ended up a prisoner in a Russian war camp where he died several years after the war ended.  Mr. Brody is incredible in his part.  His facial expressions convey the sense of fear and hopelessness that Szpilman must have felt through his tragic journey.  Never once does go over the top, it a truly genuine performance.  Mr. Polanski also does a brilliant job of directing.  He details the senseless brutality and omnipresence of the German occupation of Poland, but never sinks into gratuitous violence.  The film was nominated for seven academy awards including Best Picture.  Both Mr. Brody and Mr. Polanski scored unexpected, but richly deserved Oscars for Best Actor and Best Director respectively and Ronald Harwood won the film's third Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.

It's hokey, dumb and fun
The character of Brenda Star reminds me in some ways of the Katy Keene comics

It's not a GUY'S movie, but I think it's fun enough that a guy could enjoy it

The movies features Shirley singing "On the Good Ship Lolli Pop" and shows off her talents as a very young actress

There are only a hand full of her films that I will always remember and this is one of them

Heidi,Curly Top and The Little Colonel were the others


The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized version


I am not a fan of colorizing anything,but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both.

$review_text.: Here's Frankie at the apex of his swingin' Fifties movie fame in THE TENDER TRAP (1955), a fun romantic comedy which pairs him with darling Debbie Reynolds and also boasts the strong comedic support of David Wayne and Celeste Holm.New York talent agent Charlie Reader (Frank Sinatra) lives a charmed life
 His bachelor pad is serviced by an endless parade of beautiful girls (including Carolyn Jones, Lola Albright and Jarma Lewis) ready to cater to his every whim
 What more could a man want?  Certainly not marriage!  But his latest discovery, stage singer Julie Gillis (Debbie Reynolds) couldn't care less about her career if a wedding's not on the immediate horizon
 Whether he likes it or not, Charlie's about to be caught in the 'tender trap'...While Sinatra and Reynolds were the top-billed stars of THE TENDER TRAP, the film is mercilessly stolen by David Wayne and Celeste Holm's snappy supporting performances
 Indeed, Holm made such an impression that she and Sinatra were reunited the following year in "High Society"


 Debbie Reynolds' character of Julie might rankle female viewers in the modern age, but she gives a delightful performance--given the limitations of the script


 Frankie and David have some great scenes together and the whole affair breezes along in splendid fashion

 A fun title.The DVD includes a featurette focusing on Sinatra's attempt to reinvent his movie persona in the 1950s, plus the trailer


 Available separately or as part of the Frank Sinatra: The Golden Years DVD collection boxset (which also includes "Some Came Running", "The Man With the Golden Arm", "None But the Brave" and "Marriage on the Rocks").

$REVIEW.: Note: I saw this movie a few hours ago in HD via XFinity On Demand.MILD SPOILER.The Prince Of Egypt is a faithful retelling of the first 20 chapters in The Second Book Of Moses Called Exodus

As stated at the beginning, "Artistic and historical license has been taken," obviously to make the movie suitable for children, and therefore the textual and creative liberties taken are understandable
For example, Moses' cold-blooded murder of the Egyptian who is mercilessly scourging one of his brethren is changed to an accident


This is one of several differences those who have read the Biblical account and or viewed the 1923 or 1956 film versions of The Ten Commandments, both directed by Cecil B

DeMille, will notice

This version is suitable for the little ones, and discussion about the true story found in the Bible after seeing this kid-friendly version is strongly encouraged

The songs in the film are first-rate, the animation is absolutely stunning, the special effects are brilliant, and with the exception of the awful Boyz II Men (who?) song in the latter half of the end credits, I recommend that you cotinue watching the credits to listen to Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey's Academy Award winning song When You Believe

There are two quotations from The Holy Bible and, inexplicably, one from the so-called 'holy' quran or koran (or however those people spell it) at the conclusion of the end credits
Just thought you should be ware of it.Rated PG (thematic elements).

$REVIEW.: As I write this, my husband is watching it streaming from online via netflix


 I already viewed it that way
 It seems streaming is the default way for viewing L&O; of almost any of its infinite variations
 This L&O; CI still has our original detectives
 This is the show at its best


 That will change in later seasons where we see our original two only on alternate weeks
In any event, for THIS SEASON you get ONLY Eames and Bobby (Erbe and D'Onforio).The use of the law on this show is pretty good


 Yes, there is artistic license but turn on court tv and watch a real case proceed and you'll see why artistic license is so important for entertainment! I think the thing that is the most far fetched on the show is how easily both detectives are able to get admissions from suspects when the suspect has the choice to not say anything

 It seems that only psychopaths represented by counsel exercise the right to remain silent on this show


 They strain artistic license to the breaking point when smart, educated and/or affluent people cave in to them
 That is the only real flaw.The stories are well written and interesting


Each case is followed from the point of the crime's commission to the two detectives solving the case

 Unlike the other two L&O;'s, there is usually not a trying of the case in this L&O.;  The ending is solving the case, not winning it
This is a good evening's entertainment
 I recommend it and intend on giving Jeff Goldblum and Erbe a try when they go solo in 2010

Goldblum was very good in the 2009 incarnation of the show.All of L&O;, in any guise, is available online at Amazon Instant, itunes, Netflix Instant, etc.,  It is very behind on DVD releases.

$REVIEW.: This is a movie anyone should see. Funny, engaging, violent, heartrending were thoughts that came to me after seeing Memories of Murder. These are not usually the diversity of emotions I've seen in most movies, and even rarer in crime dramas, but they reflect an extremely well-done movie by Joon-Ho Bong.At times, it's early pacing can feel slow, much slower than an average crime drama. Bong allows us into the world by taking a decent amount of time to familiarize us with the environment: a boring, quiet country beauty that he paints for us with his early slow shots. The soundtrack, a quiet but moving score, adds to an environment and a feel that is very real, very universal. But as soon as the action starts picking up, the movie ramps into a full-on thriller, as it becomes a race against time and feels very much like some of a few other crime drama/thrillers I've seen. At the same time, there is something intangible, something very (for lack of better words) sad that permeates through many parts of the movie. Dilapidated factories, protesters, corruption, senseless violence suggest a deeper meaning within the movie, a desperation and hopelessness of that time in Korea.But thankfully, Bong keeps this part of the movie simple. Although it is important to contextualize this film within a certain era of governmental corruption and crime in Korea, it certainly does not require an extensive knowledge of the period. I did not find it's overall sentiments propagandizing or overwhelming, quietly presented.I could go on about more specific parts of the plot, but it is a movie which I do not want to spoil. Simply put, it has all the elements of a great movie. Highly recommended

$REVIEW.: Ever since it was first theatrically released in Japan more than 25 years ago, "Castle in the Sky" has been my favorite movie of all time. And I am not alone. The thrilling fantasy adventure film is the first work from Studio Ghibli that went on to make such masterpieces as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away," and though not as famous as the other titles of the studio, "Castle in the Sky" is a great piece of anime that anyone can enjoy watching.Originally titled as "Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta," director Hayao Miyazaki's 126-minute anime film follows the story of Pazu, a young boy living in a coalmining town, and Sheeta, a beautiful girl descending from the sky. Apparently Sheeta has been chased by a group of pirates, as well as a government agent. Pazu and Sheeta set out a journey full of adventures, looking for the floating castle that no one has set foot in for many, many years.You can see Miyazaki's recurrent motif here - flying and strong heroines - and with fleshed-out characters and rousing flying sequences, the traditionally drawn anime is still amazing. Set in a fictional Industrial Revolution-era, "Castle in the Sky" is a great adventure/fantasy movie that you will never forget.Believe me or not, "Castle in the Sky" was not a box-office success when first released in 1986 (it was "Kiki's Delivery Service" in 1989). Later the film gained popularity (broadcast on TV as many as 13 times until now 2013), finally becoming an integral part of the Japanese pop culture. Most anime fans can quote Colonel Muska's memorable lines.In short, "Castle in the Sky" is animation at its best - a great story told with imagination.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely loved this movie! The whole thing was entertaining. I think the only part that annoyed me was that our hero only had to dig a little to find THE CHARLET. And, if the ship had sunk why wasn't there any water left in the ship? Everything was ship-shape. But other then that it was great! Only Nicholas Cage could pull this off. You don't think he is related to Harrison Ford? Although, this will never take the place of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it stands as a masterpiece. To me, that is. Not bad for PG. Disney seems to be moving up in the world. I've seen the reviews for this movie and IT IS NOT A FLICK! Just though I'd make that clear for any of you who have not seen this yet. This was a pretty clean movie. There were some threats made but no one died. It would have been nice if it had a little more action, though. Jon Tureltaub does it all with touches of humor. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure has its share of Romance. But, they don't throw it on thick. That is usually the downfall of and excellent movie. There are enough clues to keep you guessing. Once again here is another one with a stunning cast. But, cage is the one who made it. Without him I don't think the movie would have surfaced. It still would have been good but not superb. From the start the director feeds you with little bits of the story, and then he gives it to you. I won't tell you the ending, but it's really good. You will be satisfied, I promise! So, if you have nothing to do this holiday season, I would go see this. I think you'll find it's a lot better then you think.

$review_text.: This was one of the better PPVs that I&#65533;ve seen.  Also, the live audience was incredibly into almost all of the matches.  It makes watching a little bit more interesting when the crowd responds to the action.  The crowd was very into it, and  it was interesting to see how much they responded to some wrestlers.Right To Censor Vs Too Cool / Rikishi:  When I started watching wrestling, it was in the fall of 2000.  I never saw too much of interest from any of these guys, but the audience was very hot for the action, actively booing RTC and cheering heavily for Rikishi.  The match itself was decent, not worth the audience reaction it got.  I&#65533;ve seen better opening matches.X-Pac Vs Road Dogg:  At the time, Road Dogg and X-Pac were members of Degeneration X but were beginning to feud because of an incident in a tag team match where Road Dogg left X-Pac to be taken out.  The match had some entertaining spots, but as a whole it was short and under-whelming.Mixed Tag Match Val Venis (C) &Trish; Stratus  Vs Chyna &Eddie; Guerrero: Venis was the Intercontinental Champion, but the stipulation was that if either Chyna or Eddie got the pin (even if it was on Trish), that individual would win the belt.  I was rather bored for this match.  The only thing that interested me was watching Eddie wrestle, but this was fairly blah and ended exactly how you would expect.Tazz Vs Jerry "the King"Lawer:  This was junk.  While Lawler is rightly a legend in the business, he fails to entertain in the ring (or as an announcer).  As it stands, this match was more about Tazz and J.R. than it was about the ringwork.The Kat Vs Terri Thong Stink Face Match:  Even worse than the last match.  This has no place in wrestling as there was no actual wrestling.Shane (C)Vs Blackman Hardcore Title Match:  For a man who is not an everyday wrestler, Shane McMahon never fails to entertain when he steps in the ring.  Steve Blackman, amazingly enough, also did a good job at working this match and entertaining.  The big thing about this match is the fall Shane took off a 50ft support tower and the elbow Blackman followed that fall with.TLC Match Hardys Vs Dudleys Vs Edge&Christian; (c) for the Tag Team Championship:  This was the very first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.  Like the 4 that I have seen, it was incredible.  The risks that these men take to entertain&#65533;unbelievable.Two out of Three Falls Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit:  This was one of the better feuds that I can remember.  Jericho and Benoit have always worked well together, and had there not been a TLC match, this would have been the match of the night.Undertaker vs Kane:  The Undertaker took off Kane&#65533;s mask.  Junk match.Triple Threat for the WWF Championship - The Rock (c) Vs Kurt Angle vs Triple H:  It&#65533;s hard to get excited for the main event match when it feels like a sideshow the the Kurt Angle/Stephanie McMahon/HHH love triangle.  The match itself was quite good, but it even in the wrestling, it played second fiddle to the story.  Very good match, but it didn&#65533;t quite live up to my expectations (perhaps unreasonably high.Overall, this is one of the better WWF DVDs that I&#65533;ve seen.

$REVIEW.: For years, THE police show on television was none other than "Dragnet." As a kid I caught the original series in syndication and was immediately hooked. I loved the Dragnet comeback in the 60s, but was disappointed in that it went from strict crime solving to a cultural critique was was often unintentionally funny. I would often ask whatever happened to the original. It waasn't long before I found out: being in the Land of B/W, it was to be forever lost in the Brave New World of Color. Every now and then, a couple of episodes would be released on DVD, usually the same episodes. To someone discovering them for the first time, it would seem beyond the pale that 276 30-minute episodes were filmed between 1950 and 1959.This 20-episode collection of "Dragnet" is a good start, bringing back the flavor and impact of the original. The technicalities aren't the greatest -- some episodes were shown as "Badge 714", the syndicaion title. But Who Cares?? They're all watchable, and enjoyable. Fans of the 60s version will find much to see in these earlier episodes. The perfection of the staccato dialogue ("How's that?" "I see." Stick to the facts."), the development or lack thereof in Friday's character, many of the regulars that populated the 60s version (Stacey Harris, Virginia Gregg, Peggy Webber), stars-in-the-making in early roles (Leonard Nimoy, Carolyn Jones), and the similarotoes between Officer Frank Smith (Ben Alexander) and Officer Frank Gannon (Harry Morgan.All in all, this package is a great start, what with 20 episodes for a good price. Perhaps tohse in production should take note and begin to release this cult classic by season, as is done with many other shows. For unlike many other shows, this one deserves the comprehensive treatment.

$review_text.: This is the life story of Dr. Ben Carson, chief of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins University and considered the world's best pediatric surgeon. The story begins with Dr. Carson being asked to consider operating on the two sons of a German couple who are joined at the abdomen and skull. No one has ever performed this surgery successfully with both children surviving. The film then flashes back to the childhood of Dr. Carson. He was raised by an illiterate but very loving and determined single mother who married at the age of 13 and was divorced soon after when she discovered her 'husband' was married at the same time to another woman with another family. She was determined that her two sons would not turn out the same way she did. It is an amazing story of this mother and her love and determination. Ben, not realizing he needed glasses, consistently performed way below the other students in class until his mother used all their savings to get him a pair. That, along with her firm hand in making the two boys read two books a week from the library (along with written reports) as well as limiting TV watching to two programs a week turned Ben into the 'student of the year' in 8th grade. Even that, however, was tainted, as a teacher at the award ceremony berated the other students for letting a 'boy of color' with serious disadvantages and a single mother outperform them. The story continues with his achievements and struggles through high school and his scholarship years at Yale and on to his residency at Johns Hopkins. The story then takes us back to the conclusion of the decision whether or not to operate on the German twins. It is an incredible story of someone who not only had the 'gifted hands' needed to be a great surgeon but also the determination, humility and faith to make a life of great service to his fellow humans against great odds. The acting is outstanding. I would encourage everyone and every family to make this a 'must watch'. I would also highly recommendSomething the Lord Made, another story about a great African-American surgeon, Dr. Vivian Thomas, who was born 30 years too early to be able to have the same opportunities as Dr. Carson, but nevertheless made a great contribution to medicine that is still being used today. Enjoy!!

$REVIEW.: 'Man Push Cart' is an absorbing slice-of-life movie


 Many accolades have been heaped upon it, but it's availablity has been obscure for so long, which is a real shame
 I have to admit that I was suspicious from the previews that it would be one of those "noble" entries one finds that becomes drawn out and tedious


 However, I was pleasantly surprised to find how accessible and enjoyable this film really is.Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) is a typical immigrant protagonist
 Coming from Pakistan, he lives and works in New York City, the quintessential immigrant city:  One that's filled with opportunity as well as bewildering urban bustle and stress


 Like many with ingenuity, he has his own business
 He's a street vendor who sells hot beverages to commuters on a busy city street
 The portrait of him and his life unfolds along the way in ways that are engaging and colorful.Soon we find out that he has come to the one year anniversary of his wife's death, and he has been estranged to his son, Sajjad, whom his inlaws have custody
 He is a hard worker, like so many immigrants, and this initiative pays off with one customer who hires him to do some work on an apartment

 It is during this liason that we learn that Ahmad was famous previously, but I won't divulge the nature here
 However, this new business associate gets him some new business for which he was famous, and from here he meets a lovely Spanish immigrant (Leticia Dolera) who becomes his new love interest.He does what he can, but he seems to have to choose between love and money, welfare and family along the way


 He has a friend named Muhammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval) who checks up on him, and from their conversations we pick up on their lives
 Reflecting on making ends meet Ahmad says, "[It] Gets harder for people like you and me...What I need to do, I'll do."  What makes 'Man Push Cart' so worthwhile is the intimate view of his struggles and motivations--what makes him tick and the decisions he makes to have a better life.Complications develop and some of the movie borrows a bit from Italy's classic 'The Bicycle Thief,' but the story is so authentically presented that it feels like a documentary of real people than it does a movie rehash


 The direction by Ramin Bahrani is excellent for making us walk in the shoes of Ahmad and feel the struggle of his journey.

$review_text.: I gotta say that I wasn't to convinced to watch this movie, but I saw what Tyler did with Meet The Browns, and I enjoy that as well. As for this movie I just LOVED IT, I'm not married yet but I can appreciate a good movie when I see 1. The cast is 5 stars, it's so hard to point out who was the best. But I will say that miss Tasha Smith was the funniest. I thought I was over all this romantic movies but this one touch to many cords for me to ignore, most of all I felt the realness to it. I saw my and my friends as those couples in a couple of years. Jill Scott was great I've never seen her act before but she did shine. As for the other cast members I was blown away... I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE, no other way to describe it....

$review_text.: The film opens with a stage production by an acclaimed choreographer Pina Bausch.  A woman, perhaps blind or dazed, wanders around on the stage while a man tries to move chairs and other things not to let her hit them.  What does that mean?You will have your own answer later on, but the film here introduces us two men -- Marco and Benigno, both watching the production as the audiecne.  Months later, these two men meet each other at a medical clinic, where Benigno, a nurse working there, is taking care of a comatose woman Alicia.  Marco, whose severely injured girlfriend Lydia (and she is also in coma) is now taken to the place, is advised by kind-hearted Benigno to 'talk to her.'The film tactfully reveals how come Benigno has been nursing Alicia for more than more years, or how Lydia came to be wounded like that.  And by the time you see what happen to these four characters in the following chapters, you will why Pedro Almodovar is now thought one of the most accomplished film directors in the world.The film looks often melodramatic (in a good sense, of course) and sometimes very surreal, but it always is beautiful, and rich in tone.  The four actors are all impeccable (plus special guest Geraldine Chaplin), especially Javier Camara as Benigno, and Leonor Watling as ballet dancer Alicia.There is one comical (and very sexually explicit) black-and-white part called 'Shrinking Lover,' which parodies old silent film style.  It is funny, but later you will find that its hidden meanings are so serious; it is shocking, audacious, and  even horrible.And then, you will know that this is an Almodovar film, unconventional, daring, but somehow manages to be  compassionate.  Though 'Talk to Her' is not his most daring work, it still shows that only Almodovar can tell this bitter-sweet love story, with his taut storytelling skills and confident touch.  The film is painful and moving, but finally very rewarding.

$review_text.: Marvelous Marilyn filming "Something's Got To Give" was the totally awesome event every MM fan followed, collecting any & every news article or those catchy cover story Life & Look Magazine issues pertaining to Miss Monroe's amorous adventures during what was a particularly fascinating time in the life of the legendary lady...going to the Presidental Birthday event right in the middle of filming to sing "Happy Birthday" to President Kennedy was a given, silly Fox Studio made a big deal of it and fired their main Diva...not smart! Several weeks later, they quitely resigned their leading Superstar to a multi-film pact with a dramatic increase in pay from what Monroe had been receiving from a outdated fifties contract, this made her very, very happy, now wanting the world to know about this conquest & other tumultuous events in her life, Marilyn requested of her press secretary scheduling the following Monday a media press conference, this was not to be as her life was taken that weekend and mystery surrounding how this happened remains to this day, hardcore fans feel the cover-up continues with this propaganda filled release, insisting she took her own life throughout "The Final Days" becomes very irritating and not for a moment convincing, ultimately this visually appealing documentry is interesting only for having a chance to view the making of what would have been another extraordinary Marilyn film classic...gone too soon to be sure. Looking radiant in every sumptuous frame and totally commanding in every scene, never did Marilyn look more gorgeous & beautiful on The Silver Screen, making "The Final Days" a must-have to view Marilyn Monroe in fine & glorious form, clearly ready to take position in the fabulous sixties as leading drop-dead gorgeous Diva of the Silver Screen...RIP beautiful lady, you are loved and missed by so many!

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this movie

I like Mel Gibson's action movies

This falls into that category
Gibson plays this one straight.I remember instantly liking the new young actor Heath Ledger who played his son
I think we will see more of him in the future

We don't get many movies about the Revolutionary war and I enjoyed this one


Some of the scenes reminded me of THE LAST OF THE MOHEGANS especially the ambush scene in the forest

The final battle scene was very good

They don't make movies like this anymore

 The plot is chaotic and meandering and greatly suffers from a lack of coherence and believability.Val Kilmer plays a Secret Service agent tasked to rescue a senator's daughter after she was abducted and sent to the Middle East to be sold into the sex trade


 It turns out it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys and nefarious plots are afoot


 But as the plot unfolds it is flat and really not well conceived.Thumbs down.

$review_text.: This is a brilliant satire on the invasion of Normandy, and on war in general -- the dialogue is sharp, literate -- indeed, I think this is Paddy Chayefsky's most brilliant work.  It is one of the finest, if not the finest, screenplays ever written by an American.  I was able to locate the novel on which it is based, which forms a very loose framework for the film, but Chayefsky's script is infinitely superior to the book.  "What's a lion doing in a man's house?"  James Garner and Julie Andrews are perfectly cast in the leads, and James Coburn is also terrific, as is Melvyn Douglas.  This is a wicked, wicked satire on the military and the greater folly of war, in which Garner is an American officer tasked with capturing film footage of the first dead man on Omaha Beach -- a naval man, of course -- an assignment which is completely insane, hatched by his senile commanding officer in a moment of sheer daffiness. All of this occurs at a time when Garner has fallen madly in love with Julie Andrews, and they have married, and she has already lost a husband in the war.  There is a particularly biting scene in the garden between Garner and Julie Andrews' mother -- sarcastic, nasty, painful, and cutting to the greater truth about the pure folly of heroism in war.The script is simply brilliant, brilliant.  And the theme song written by Johnny Mandel is memorable.

$review_text.: Switching gears a fair bit, "Basket Case 2" retains the continuity and the ferociousness of the first "Basket Case", and is certainly equally bizarre (if not more so!) but has added in more humor and even a great deal of fun.  Humor and fun?  After the searing and almost traumatically shocking nature of the original, adding in these elements in abundance , plus moments of great beauty, would be one thing - and would take a great deal of magic to pull off the transition - but to do it even while holding onto the savagery and the tragedy that made the original such a unique entry in the annals of horror is quite another.  Incredibly, just such a feat is pulled off flawlessly.  "Evil Dead 2" successfully combined intense goriness with comedic freakout-ishness, but this goes even beyond that. It's like combining "Gremlins" or even "Return Of The Killer Tomatoes" with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", something which should be impossible to do right without the contrasting elements crippling each other.  Another way to view it is the Creature Cantina scene from "Star Wars" done as a horror movie set at the Fawlty Towers hotel.Picking up years after the first movie, Duane and Belial find a place in the world at a home run by a kindly woman for 'unique individuals' (meaning Belial-type mutants, though Duane is readily accepted into the fold as well) and unique is certainly one way to describe them.  The greatly improved special effects are necesary to bring to life this weird and wonderful assortment of characters, and the acceptance into this haven quells Belial's murderous bloodrage.  Both he and Duane even find love in their new home.  But when their sanctuary is threatened by outside forces, it's an uprising the likes of which film has never seen before.Clearly, the ambiguity of the first movie gives way to a more direct representation of Belial as the protagonist, but by no means is he a tame creature, and it's not unthinkable that he could go completely out of control even after finding sanctuary.  The prescence of brighter elements in no way means the horror is gone, and there are shocks in the movie both happy and terrifying.  I'm probably not doing full justice to the movie, but a film like this simply defies easy description.  I noted in my writeup on the first one that there was never another movie like it.  Well, this is a worthy and faithful followup but indeed quite unlike its predecessor in many ways, yet somehow, despite all odds, maintaining excellent coherency.  And, there would never be another movie quite like "Basket Case 2" either - the third installment is even more bizarre and warps in different directions!  Truly, the Basket Case trilogy is one of the most unbelievable series in film history, and Part 2 is as mind-blowing as any of them.  This HAS to come out on DVD eventually.

$REVIEW.: This is one of my very favorite episodes because it shows Spock's vulcan side along with his human side.  He becomes very irritated while on board the enterprise; not even the good ole doc can figure out what is going on.  Upon examining him, however, Mcoy finds that Spock will die unless he returns to Vulcan.Kirk approaches him and Spock then explains the ritual of Pon Farr , where he is supposed to take a wife.Of course, Kirk puts his friend's priorities first and quickly takes him home.  Spock invites Mcoy and Kirk to join him for the occasion, which turns out to be a bad idea, for Spock's betrothed decides to challenge the ritual.  She chooses Kirk for her man, so Kirk must fight Spock for her.  Kirk decides to do so when Mcoy tells him that Spock probably cannot stand up to a big fight and would probably die.But, Kirk isn't used to the Vulcan atmosphere and begins to show signs of fatigue against Spock.  Mcoy realizes that Kirk isn't going to make it unless he intervenes.When Spock kills the captain, he becomes normal again and returns to the ship with the intention of turning himself in.This episode shows the relationship that Kirk and Spock actually has.  Never before have we seen such emotion coming from Spock!!

I think the character named Williams is good.Picture Quality: 4/5I think this Blu-ray is an improvement over the DVD. I think the it looks good. I think the colours and such looks very nice, compared to my DVD.Audio Quality: 3/5Cheap and lazy Warner Bros didn`t even make a lossless 5.1 audio track. We only got the standard, and high compressed lossy version from the previous DVD. If it was up to me,  it would be mandatory to have every BD that is released to have a lossless audio track. It does sadly not work like that, as you can see.I think this film would`ve sounded better if we got a lossless audio instead of the common lossy one. The DD 5.1 sounds just ok in my opinion. It lacks good bass from most the punches and kicks.Film: 4/5Overall: 4/5

$REVIEW.: When I first started watching this movie, I thought I was in for a polemic rave about the Communist regime in East Germany....which it is to an extent. But it is so much more.A man employed by the Stazi police in EGermany sets up a listening post near the apartment of a left wing playwrite and his lover. He "spies"on them by listening in through the multiple microphones implanted in the apartment.Along the way,  he somehow gets involved in their lives and starts trying to influence or manipulate the outcome of the story. I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't say more about it, except to say it is both tragic and beautiful.I was extremely moved by this movie. It bears watching again in order to savour each scene.

$REVIEW.: Billy Wilder's the Apartment is a dark comedy about sex and ethics in the business world. In this Oscar-winning offbeat tale we find out that stepping up isn't so much fun when it's someone you care about that you're stepping on.In the apartment, the late Jack Lemmon plays C.C.Baxter, a guy trying to move up at his job. His trick is that he lets his managers use his Manhattan apartment to entertain their mistresses. He's the man to go to; a lot of executives want to use his place to. Even though Baxter would like to get some sleep, things are going smoothly so smoothly that he decided to make a copy of the key to his apartment so J.D. Sheldrake the director of HR can have exclusive use of his apartment. On the same day, C.C. tries to make a move on Fran Kublelick, an elevator operator. The same woman J.D Sheldrake the Director of Human Resources. is cheating with. C.C. enjoys his big promotion on the day of the Christmas party. However, on the night of the party he finds out how hollow his victory is when Fran tries to take her life because Sheldrake dumped her in his apartment. Realizing what he did to someone he cared about, C.C. Baxter really has to think about his arrangement over the course of a long weekend. I won't give away any more, the movie is too good to spoil. You have to see it for yourself.The late Billy Wilder knows how to write a story, even though the movie is almost 45 years old, the comments he makes about business and ethics are still relevant to 2005. Anyone coming out of college and going into the workworld needs to see this movie at least twice.The late Jack Lemmon is great here as C.C the employee struggling with his ethics and identity in the working world. He's one of the all time great actors; Every time I watch one of his movies I see a character telling a story and not him. It's a pleasure to watch him act. Shirley Maclaine gives one of her best performances here as Fran Kubelick. I really felt sorry for the character of Fran Kubelick because Maclaine made her so real. The late Fred McMurray and Ray Walston (the dad on My Three Sons and My Favorite Martian for you people who remember that far back) are amazing in this movie playing the exact polar opposites of the nice characters they play on TV. These two especially McMurray are so unethical you can feel the smarminess coming off them.The Apartment is an all around great movie and a Shawn James Five Star essential Video. You must buy this movie up and Wilder's equally hilarious Some Like it Hot. While you're at it pick up Office space and Clockwatchers. Compare and Contrast those two films to the Apartment. You'll find some interesting similarities in those three different workplace films.
$SUMMARY.: Wilder at the top of his game. I LOVE this movie! Buy this NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

$REVIEW.: Well there isn't a great deal I can say about this thriller in the area of any outstanding praise. It's simply not a truly great movie. All the familiar elements are there, and even some new twists are still not enough to get this movie sailing. Nothing here that is particularly groundbreaking. Halle Berry is a great actress and I'm sure she was persuaded by what seemed like a great character to play when she was considering the script. Depending on production values and a tactful director this could have been the next Silence of the Lambs. But maybe that's giving the film an unfair comparison. It's not really anywhere in the territory of such a classic serial killer movie. Be that as it may, it's clear from beginning to end were watching a slightly above average kidnapping thriller. Berry, if she realized this during production she didn't care, because she truly turns in a more that reasonable performance. She's good in this, but she's not the problem. More about that in a bit..The key importance of this film is the situation Berry's character finds her self in, a 911 operator dealing with the day to day ever so real horrors that go on in the world, an audible bystander who has to hear first hand every minor detail during terrible events. Hearing, but never seeing them, or for that matter once the police take over never knowing what the final outcome was.  The film does well telling their story, the story of 911 assistance operators. When every second counts and what the operator does to help the person on the other end of the line can mean the difference between life or death.  It's an unpleasant job, but someone has to do it, right? The film explores pretty new territory in the motion picture industry. For the first time we've got an indepth look at what it is really like to work as an emergency assistance operator. This is what the film really does well, and it does show this world convincingly and often with very interesting results.What is not as interesting or all that unique, or even at times poorly executed is much of the rest of the story. An innocent girl kidnapped and trapped in the trunk of a car. A calculating and cunning predator who has done it before. he should be a careful predator. But he's not really. and maybe he's perhaps not very smart. In fact he's downright stupid. It takes him a great deal of time to realize the girl he just kidnapped in the trunk of the car he's driving  has a cell phone and is conversing with a 911 operator. events proceed in such a way that anyone with any brains would have begun to wonder long before he does. He never checks any pockets of his victim to see what she's carrying even when he has several opportunities to do so? The kidnapped girl get's away with a great deal before he discovers what she's doing.Now we've all heard the stories of dumb criminals doing dumb things, so I suppose it's possible he never thought she'd have a cellphone. In this day an age however it's commonly known that kids and texting almost always go hand in hand. But let's not check to see if she has a smartphone This guy is dumb for a lot of reasons. I mean who kidnaps someone and throws them in a trunk without securing their victim, hands tied behind their back anyway?, much less leave them in there with large 2 cans of white paint and a big shovel? Yes this serial killer is pretty clueless. A little too clueless. And he's a pro at this presumably? He's done it before who knows how many times. The film suggests- perhaps many. I just didn't buy it all together.Another thing I thought didn't make much sense was more a casting issue. Michael Imperioli, who played Tony Soprano's nephew, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos, is a truly gifted actor, and here he is totally miscast and horribly underused in a very small role as a bystander that thinks something is wrong and does what he can to try and help the kidnapped girl in the trunk. I found it really weird to see him in this part. It does not fit him at all, and it's absolutely one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a major motion picture in a long time. An actor of his ability with his very impressive resume deserves much better than this. On top of it, he simply doesn't work in the role. it's just a totally off the wall casting call.The serial killer here is interesting enough, but as menacing maniacs go he's pretty bland. I think they forgot to consider that the public has seen so many villains in similar roles that you've really got to work and think things through and come up with someone really unique and scary enough to make a dent. This guy is no Norman Bates or Hannibal Lecter, that's for sure. He's not someone that stands out as a truly creepy villian most of us have been used to seeing in these sorts of roles.The Call is far from being another flop, and though it does tell the story of the day to day routine of 911 operators quite brilliantly, and it does have a few interesting moments that can qualify it as a reasonable thriller, at least to me by the end of the film I thought "yea, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I would care to even remember when I wake up tomorrow". Just a fairly somewhat interesting run of the mill thriller.

$REVIEW.: YES!!After a long and torturous gap of years of waiting  -- during which time lucky "Dallas" fans were able to get 7 seasons of their favourite show issued to DVD -- finally we "Dynasty" fans have something to cheer about too.  At last the red tape transferring legal rights has been taken care of and a new company that seems to appreciate the value of this show has taken over the DVD issuing.  Let's hope this means the remaining seasons will now continue to come out in a timely fashion.After waiting SO long, at long last the incomparable Joan Collins once again graces my TV screen with her ravishing presence.  I felt so let down when she did not even appear at all in the Season 1 set I bought.  Without her, "Dynasty" seemed bland and somehow lacking its usual spark.  Now finally I get to see the "Dynasty" I had been longing to see again.The packaging for this set is slightly different from the Season 1 set that I bought years ago.  Instead of individual slipcases for each pair of discs, I was amazed to find all 6 discs fitted inside a single case only slightly thicker than a standard 1-disc case.  Usually this means some kind of system in which the discs are layered on top of each other and we must risk damaging them every time we pop one out to get at the one below.  But not so here.  This is a brand new case design I have never seen before, and each disc is completely independent of the other discs and quite safe.  I find this quite a good and effective design, and I think it will save a lot of space on my overcrowded and ever-growing DVD shelf.Just a couple of minor quibbles.  First, as others have mentioned, the traditional "last time on Dynasty" intros have been chopped from all of the episodes.  I had always found these quite useful in refreshing my memory on the often intricate plot -- especially if I had not watched for a week or two.  And second, unlike the Season 1 set, there are no extra interviews or featurettes here, just a "Carrington family tree".  I would love for them to interview more cast members (especially the ones advanced in age who might not be with us much longer).  And how about some episode commentaries too?  I'd love to hear what Joan Collins and Linda Evans have to say about all their catfighting!  In this respect the set is a bit bare-bones.  But...I guess I should be grateful just to have this on DVD at all.Hard to believe we have to say that for this show that topped ratings for nearly a decade round the world in its day.  But I guess the studio execs have more important things on their minds these days, like the latest pathetic waste-of-time reality show or moronic American Idol clone.  Ah well, at least now I have something good to watch so there's no need for me to be subjected to such garbage.I just hope they hurry up with the release of  Season 3, because this one is so good I'm going to be through it in no time!

When something does finally happen it is typically just watching his character &#34;Parker&#34; getting beat up.  If I wanted to watch a movie where the protaganist just gets beat up the whole time then I'd just watch a Jean-Claude VanDamme movie, any Jean-Claude VanDamme movie.  This movie was mind numbingly slow and painful to watch and just seemed to drag on endlessly.  The entire story probably could have been wrapped up in 45 minutes instead of dragging it out for two painful hours.  Ultimately I couldn't relate to or care about any of the main characters and I was openly rooting against them and hoping that they would fail in their objectives.  Unfortunately everything seems to work out for the main characters so that they can return to the their selfish and meaningless lives.  I want my $3.99 back and the two hours of my life wasted on this horrible movie.

$review_text.: "Friday Night Lights" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, "Friday Night Lights" doesn't rely on the "big game" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  "Friday Night Lights" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black ("Sling Blade") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what "Friday Night Lights" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.
$SUMMARY.: "We're in the business of winning."

$review_text.: Immediately, when you pop in this DVD, it gives you the choice of Widescreen or Full-Screen, Followed by the statement, "Warning: This Film Contains Scenes Which May Be Too Intense For Persons Under The Age Of Seventeen".Bruce Campbell (NBC serial, "Generations", in 1989) returns four years later in this sequel to theThe Evil Dead(1983).  Ashley brings a girlfriend up to the cabin where he was terrorized before.  Something happens.  Ashley plays the reel to reel player with spell on it.  The evil force is released.  Girl taken through window.  Ashley finds her possessed.  Girl killed and buried.  Then the evil spirit gets a hold of Ashley, temporarily.  He gets back into the yellow car only to find the Dangerous Bridge has been totally destroyed.  The evil spirit won't allow him to leave and chases him back into the cabin and into the cellar.  Meanwhile, there are other people who have flown in just to get to the cabin.  The tow truck man knows another road.  Ashley is now fighting with the evil spirit and with his own possessed right hand.  Plays like a "drive-in" film and uses special effects we have seen inThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad (50th Anniversary Edition)(1958) andBasket Case (20th Anniversary Special Edition)(1982).  Studio must have been given him an extra $100 for the budget this time.Followed by:Army of Darkness(1993).Evil Dead (2013).

Its the story of an oppressed little girl who has &#34;powers&#34;

But she uses them for good, fun and humor while righting wrongs
Its a feel good movie that is cute

We did find that for younger kids, there are a few parts that can make them a bit uncomfortable

The &#34;adults&#34; save for one, are quite unappealing characters ..


to the extreme and the cruelty they show compared to the compassion of Matilda is at the heart of the story.

$review_text.: The title is unimaginative.  "Sophie Scholl - The Final Days"  And that's what this movie is about.  Ms. Scholl (played remarkably by Julia Jentsch) was a member of the non-violent anti-Nazi group "White Rose" who was arrested in 1943 along with her brother Hans (Fabian Hinrichs) and others subsequent to an anti-Nazi flier placement at a university in Munich.  This film claims to rely on traditional accounts as well as new material collected since the renunification of Germany a decade and a half ago.  Much of this movie involves the reasonably thorough investigation and non-violent interrogation of Sophie by federal investigator Robert Mohr (Gerald Alexander Held).  The subsequent, repellent spectacle of a "trial" was a mere formality on the fast-track road to an end determined at the conclusion of the investigation.  Hans' speech was marvelous.This is a powerful movie, not because of any tricky cinematography or stirring soundtrack or any of the tools one usually sees employed to stir feelings and arouse passions.  Oh, there are beautifully framed shots and the occasional use of music for effect, but this movie is largely based on dialogue and is a great contest of wills and ideas.  Mohr is a diligent Nazi functionary.  Held's performance is perfectly balanced against Jentsch's Scholl.  And I believe he comes to respect and possibly even love sophie with the affection of a father for an intelligent, stubbornly willful child.  He simply doesn't understand how someone as "gifted" and intelligent as Sophie can fail to see the world the way he does.  He gives her every opportunity to mitigate her involvement, indeed even tries to talk her into framing her confession in language most likely to allow her to live.  And so this is also a story about fidelity to the purity of ideas and convictions.  And a lesson how even in the shadow of death one can see the sunshine of a beautiful day.

It's passable because there are some nice moments in the movie (like with Keanu's Klaatu is being interviewed) and Reeves, known for cardboard performances, is perfectly cast here but don't expect much beyond contrivance.  Passable for a couple bucks.

$REVIEW.: Much like "The Wrong Man", another Alfred Hitchcock gem, "I Confess" is a classic "what if?" scenario, this time involving a Catholic priest and a confession that completely changes his life.For a basic plot summary, "I Confess" sees Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) hear the confession of murderer Otto Keller (O.E. Hasse).  Sworn to secrecy by the tradition of the confessional, however, Father Logan must grapple with his devotion to the cloth when outing Otto would mean saving himself and the woman he loves.This is a simple little film (nothing grandeur or over-the-top about it), but at the same time it works very well on a number of different levels.  The acting is superb (also including Anne Baxter in a key role), the plot is classic Hitchcock character-driven suspense, and the narrative keeps progressing forward in such a way that it continues to build upon itself.  In other words, the pressure only continues to mount on Logan as each new development in the murder case comes to light.Overall, "I Confess" is a solid Hitch effort that, while maybe not in "Top Ten" status for the famous director, is most certainly worth a viewing for the emotional characters and progressive drama.

$REVIEW.: Fellini's film 'Amarcord' catches glimpses of the directors' genius in a series of events tied together in poetic fashion. The Film has enough cinematic gestures and symbols to keep film students busy for years. The charm of this film, although it excells in so many ways, falls short of making it as profound as some of Fellini's films of the 60's. It did not have the same astounding feel of La Dolce Vita or 8 and a half.The style of the film, however, is flawless and the cinematography by Rotunno is beautiful. I am sure many people will like this movie and rate it as a masterpiece - it just did not give the 5 star punch I so wanted to get from it.

$REVIEW.: After being told that "Paranormal Activity" was the "next big thing" in horror movies (in line with The Ring and Saw), I wanted to experience the phenomena first-hand.  Unfortunately, despite the film's knack for making you continue to watch just to "see what happens", it left me disappointed in the end.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a young married couple who begin experiencing some strange phenomena once their heads hit the pillow at night.  It starts with little things, like creaky noises and bumps in the night, but eventually escalates into footsteps, moving sheets, and slamming doors...too obvious to be anything "naturally occurring".  The young couple then must decide what to do next...run away, or stay and fight this invisible force.The interesting angle of this movie is that it is shot in a format not seen since The Blair Witch Project...handy-cam (for lack of a better word).  However, the manic flailings of "Blair Witch" are tamed down this time into a simple camera on a tripod recording all the action.  Whereas most traditional horror movies try to scare you with disfigured antagonists or bursts of well-timed creepy music, this effort just lets the "camera do the talking".  It is a very unique way of creating suspense, and thus at least held my interest until the very end.The big problem, though, is two-fold: repetition and incredible annoying characters.  Every night, the same thing happens: a noise startles the man, who curses a few times, which wakes up his wife, who pleads with him not to go downstairs (which he always does anyway).  That same sequence happens literally every night until the very end of the film.  It doesn't help that both characters (played by Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat) do nothing but annoy each other (and thus the audience) for the duration.  Micah treats the whole ordeal as a joke, even when the visual evidence is too much to deny, while Katie is reduced to little more than a scream-machine (albeit a very attractive one).Thus, although Paranormal Activity is indeed a novel way to create a horror film, I can't wholly recommend it due to the shallow characters and repetitive plot.  Up until the final couple of minutes, the plot is so tired and slow as to almost be boring at times.  Let's just say that when PA 2 premieres this October, I won't be in the theater.

$REVIEW.: There are so many fine reviews here that another detailed commentary isn't needed. The film inspired some wonderful comments.  I just want to add my five star vote.The idea is brilliant, the script, written by Thompson and Mike Nichols is brilliant, the acting and directing are all brilliant.I can't imagine another actress doing what Thompson does here!! The supporting cast is excellent. Eileen Atkins, as Thompson's teacher, will bring tears to the hardest heart in what has to be one of the most moving scenes in all of film-dom.  I wished the movie had ended there, but it didn't and we had to see the final installment of the dehumanizing treatment by the clueless hospital staff.  Unfortunately this is a reality in our world.  Hopefully movies like this may make their way into medical training to help things along.This isn't a movie for the faint hearted or for those who want mindless diversion.

$review_text.: Another fantasy movie starring white kids; seems that Hollywood is running out of ideas.  Luckily this movie makes up with great execution and original special effects.  I have never read the book that inspired this movie, but it must be good.The storyline is simple enough, a divorced mother takes her twin sons and daughter to a house in the countryside that was owned by her aunt.  There, the children discover a world of creatures of various shades of friendliness.  Some of these creatures want to obtain a book from the country house, and this quest for the book, called The Spiderwick Chronicles, is the chief conflict of the movie.  Its resolution is quite original and probably the best part of the movie.Here are some things to look out for.  First is the great acting by David Straithan, in his first fantasy role.  Second is Nick Nolte's casting as the chief antagonist.  His voice is perfectly suited to his character.  And last is the twins played by Freddie Highmore.  He pulls of both quite well and makes each a distinct character.  Overall, a nice use of 2 hours.

$review_text.: "My Reputation" (1943/46, dir.: Curtis Bernhardt): Barbara Stanwyck in a typical Bette Davis melodrama. She is a young, wealthy widow with two children getting acquainted to an officer (George Brent), but society does not want to have her happy so early after her first husband's death... Stanwyck gives a beautiful, touching performance, proving that she can not only be the tough lady. The rest of the picture is quite well, but not outstanding. The end is much too moral-driven, because it is never clear why we shall accept that some of the old conventions do make sense. This film suffers from the fact that is risks comparison with the earlier "Now, Voyager" (starring Bette Davis), e.g. by the appearance of Gladys Cooper in a similar role. I think the not-so-happy ending in "Now, Voyager" is more convincing, because in "My Reputation", there is really no reason why our couple should not come together. Therefore, the script needs to invent what was natural and logical in "Now, Voyager".

 With thousands of people suddenly out of work, and Jane having quit her job because they both thought that the new VP salary will be all they hoped it would be, Dick and Jane face poverty, eviction, and humiliation

 Dick and Jane try to get work, any work, and then the day the eviction notice arrives Dick decides to take things into his own hands......and Dick and Jane go on a reign of terror...as thieves.There are laugh out loud scenes in the movie, and of course Jim Carey is periodically out of control
 Tia Leoni is the perfect complement to Carey's mania, and their chemistry is fantastic.Some of the things they do are downright silly, but that's forgivable because, you really want them to come out on top.Even so, this movie does not fall into the category of "I love it", but I say that I really liked it

This was a great movie solely because it was an action movie with a comedy storyline and the cast that performed it was exceptional. I would highly recommened this film to anyone youll love the action atmosphere and parts with the comedy roles, the chemisty between Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker is amazing really makes the movie. Blu Ray or DVD, Its a comedy role movie but its all about the action behind the comedy theirs tons of shootouts explosions and some fighting, youll want the blu ray for this movie, its much better for action movies and this can be considered one.

$REVIEW.: Gia's a great biographic film with a credible story, cast and presentation

Angelina Jolie's performance here is nothing less than incredible, in fact there was a short time when I thought she's really Gia herself and that she's really troubled...that's how convincing her act is
Mercedes R makes a great support role...and a mother as well.I have seen this movie a number of times since it was let out and its one of my favorites


Jolie is super-impressive as she portrays the highs and lows of Gia's fame: strutting through a crowd of admirers, the look on her face saying, "I'm GIA, and you're nobody!"; indulging in glamour drug of the moment, cocaine; fiercely proclaiming her love for Linda (Elizabeth Mitchell), right in front of Linda's boyfriend; tearfully begging her visiting mother (Mercedes Ruehl) to stay with her, then hurling obscenities at her while throwing her baggage out of the apartment; and quietly and gracefully accepting the most tragic news about her health, just as she's finally getting her life on track


This movie deals very frankly with Gia's sexuality and there is some nudity and scenes of sexuality, but looking past the sex and the drugs and the tough exterior she displayed (especially when someone took her knife away from her), you see a very lost, fragile person
Gia is almost childlike in her disillusionment about the fashion industry, and you feel it in the way she fantasizes about a "normal" life with children, the way she feels like people regard her as a "piece of meat" with no brains, and the way she is so truly hurt by a fellow model calling her hateful names in a jealous rage.I think this movie is something that should be seen by people of all ages, regardless of its sexual content, because it carries a strong anti-drug message as well as a touching story we can all identify with even if a lot of us are not blessed with the kind of glorious physical beauty Gia was blessed with

$review_text.: Maybe you've forgotten that Robert DeNiro was once considered America's best actor. Maybe his constant involvement these days in lousy projects (Showtime, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Hide and Seek, et al) has diminished his reputation? Well, Stanley & Iris is a terrific place to go to see him at his guarded, emotionally tight best.This is a middle-aged love story, about two people whose lives have been difficult, and who need each other more than they know.While the direction and story are somewhat weak, the characters of Stanley and Iris and DeNiro and Fonda's performances make the film.Here you will find excellent acting, genuine vulnerability and and angle of repose and beauty.
$SUMMARY.: Terrific performances.

$REVIEW.: In our house, kid's movies get re-watched a *lot*, meaning that if our daughter (or we) really likes a movie it an go into pretty heavy rotation. Many kid's movies are a joy to re-watch, but some get annoying pretty quickly, and Meatballs falls into the latter category.  It's not that it's a bad movie, it just doesn't have the charm and sophistication to be a family favorite.That being said, it's still entertaining and watchable, so if you or your kids haven't seen it, it's worth a look.  But if you're looking for something timeless and classic, this isn't it.

$review_text.: This movie is a flop in its theatrical run. So the DVD is its best chance to appreciate the movie. It is a great action thriller about a bunch of robbers headed by Morgan Freeman who attempt to rob an armor car driven by Christian Slater during a big flood in a small town. The director, Mikael Solomon is the underwater photographer from &quot;The Abyss&quot; so he handles wet scenes really well and 99% of the movie takes place in a rain. Randy Quaid and Minnie Diver co-star. The picture of the DVD is sharp and bright and the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is very good. Action fans get this DVD, you won't be sorry.

$review_text.: My main problem with "De-Lovely" has nothing to do with the acting, the music or the way that director Irwin Winkler has chosen to present the material.Kevin Kline is excellent in this movie, and Ashley Judd gives her best performance in years, which isn't really saying much
The music is excellent, though it's occasionally obtrusive in the movie.The "It's a Wonderful Life" story device used to tell the story is a bit odd, to be honest
In it, the aged Cole Porter is commanded by some sort of visiting angel or "director," played eerily by Jonathan Pryce, to tell the story of his life

So, occasionally, the entire natural story stops, allowing for aged Cole to interfere or intervene in the way his life is going.My main problem, I fear, has to do with the arrangement behind the marriage of Cole and Linda Lee Porter, which is not the movie's fault at all.I'm bugged by the fact that Linda Lee marries Cole knowing full well that he's gay - yet much of the movie is devoted to how it's difficult for her to live with this choice

When she sees him devoted to another man, she moves them to another country, even though she knew he was gay to begin with
It's like she's a hanger-on, even though he didn't love her the way she needed to be loved
There's was a marriage-of-convenience, not of romantic love.There are too many shots of Linda looking disappointed that her husband is cavorting with men, even though she knew before they married what he did.Linda herself admits to not much liking men


Her first husband, according to the movie, abused her, so her marriage to Cole, one of "respect," is without passion.The entire movie is about their compromise, and it's difficult to watch or determine what exactly we as an audience are supposed to feel about it.Either Cole is horrible for cheating on his wife with her permission


Or Linda is silly for intentionally entering into a loveless marriage to someone who is actually a very dear friend who cares for her intimately.See it for the music
See it for the acting

And, if you're gay, be very happy that you live now and, more than likely, no longer have to undertake a sham marriage and hide who you really are.

$REVIEW.: I've never been a big Nicholson fan but this film did give me some hope.  Above all else this is a Hal Ashby film and if you enjoy Harold and Maude or Shampoo you should check this out. The plot centers on two Naval officers who draw duty to escort a third to military prison where he will serve eight years for petty theft.  The sentence is a harsh punishment for the crime but in the end all characters are trapped and must concede to the rules of their superiors.  Ashby does a great job of portaying the imprisonment of all the characters in their roles which may seem particularly difficult in that this is also a road movie.Wonderful.

 I even love Lady in the Water (it's a different story for him, but it's a fairy tale, and if you give it that credibility, it works).We rented The Happening, and it was terrible


 Right from the get go, I just didn't believe it

 There was some effort to allude to phenomenon in Nature we don't understand - Colony Collapse Disorder


 But it was not enough to support the entire film.There was no ending
 really truly no ending.This was just a venue to find as many different ways to kill people as possible, for no reason.This idea of Nature turning on us could be really fascinating, but this was not it


(The Birds is still an amazing film after all this time.)The Happening smacked of War of the Worlds at points, and not in a good way.Whoever said this is Shamylan's best work since Sixth Sense is terribly terribly wrong.Do Not Waste Your Time or Money.

$REVIEW.: This set has its own virtues. Unfortunately they were not the qualities I was seeking, but I'm sure they are for plenty of others. Each DVD pretty much follows the same format: one 20-minute season followed by a second of the same type and intensity. A complete yoga workout in 25 minutes has its audiences: the format is ideal for anyone with limits on their time/ patience/ fitness. It works pretty well with kids.I feel deceived that this set doesn't disclose itself as beginner-oriented, however. The flexibility DVD posed some new challenges, but in general the practices are not real ambitious.  The entire set has the teacher speaking from within the video- not dubbed in- and this can be irritating, as well.

Nor would they build one that could not defend itself.  Certainly there would be Starships patrolling nearby.

$REVIEW.: This is undoubtedly one of my favorite Gordon Liu films, as well as one of my favorite kung fu films of all time.  Like another reviewer, I have watched his movie several times without tiring of it in the least.The beginning is full of the comedy of differences and humorous rivalry between a young Chinese man (Liu), who is proficient in Chinese boxing, and his new Japanese bride, who is proficient in Japanese fighting; along with the misdeeds of a meddlesome servant who manages to incite even more difficulty between the spouses.The rivalry turns into a formal challenge, as a cadre of Japanese fighters: experts in--among other things--Bushido, Karate, Ju-Jitsu and Ninjitsu, visit the character portrayed by Liu, to defend the wounded pride of his wife, which translates to their own pride in the (alledged superiority of) Japanese martial arts.Liu then faces off against each of seven Japanese fighters in a series of very entertaining matches.  Liu carefully chooses the appropriate Chinese weaponry and/or fighting style prior to meeting each of the challenges (the ju-jitsu match has its own surprises, though!), then engages.  Good, clean (and informative) fun!  No blind revenge, no death matches or victims coughing up blood, just a wholly enjoyable look at two competing styles within the context of 7 challenges, each of which affording the contestants new insight, appreciation and respect for each other: the elegant, diverse repertoire of Chinese martial arts styles pitted against the powerful, efficient styles of the Japanese.And in the meantime, the marriage relations get better!Top-shelf, top-of-the-list entertainment for every devotee of "old-school" kung fu films.

$REVIEW.: This is a great movie for any age!  The princess is a tomboy who loves riding and archery and she's darn good at both.  When her parents tell her it's time to put those things aside and prepare to be a queen, she horror-struck and determined to show-up the princes who try to win a contest for her hand, which she does - easily.  Mom is reasonably upset, they argue and daughter runs off to the woods where she meets a witch who gives her a spell to 'change' mom's mind.  Only problem is, it doesn't change mom's *mind* but rather turns her into a bear.  When the princess realizes what's she's done, it's a race to find the cure before the spell becomes permanent.  How the two manage to resolve their differences and restore mom is a wonderful tale for parents and kids.  Probably one of the best Disney movies I've seen in a long time.Just as an aside - the music is absolutely gorgeous and totally fits the Celtic setting.

The art direction has no direction and is overly complex, difficult to look at and too dark. You can't art direct your way out of a disaster of a screenplay. The less said about this film the better actually since there is so little to recommend it. It fails on as many levels as the original succeeds. The new version of "The Andromeda Strain" is to Robert Wise's original version what the remake of "The Haunting" was to Wise's original version of that film - a muddled piece of junk.

The first one is a pretty good movie with a mix of comedy and horror.  The special effects are pretty good considering the time it was made.  The second movie is a real star filled stinker.  I can't believe it was written and directed by the same guy.  Even Bruce (don't call me Ash) makes a cameo.  I really felt sorry for him in a short embarrassing role.  I don't think he even took credit on the back of the DVD case.  One cool thing about the second film is the spoof on classic horror films including Dawn of the Dead.  Overall picture and sound is just ok but nothing special.  Worth the price even though the second movie is a stinker.

In the grand tradition of films like The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks comes Hop, the tale of a CGI rabbit who dreams of becoming a drummer and instead crosses paths with a slacker human with a surprising knack for delivering Easter candy to kids the world over. Let's be honest here: Alvin and the Chipmunks made over $350 million worldwide at the box office and spawned two sequels, and Hop made over $180 million itself. In other words, even though the movie was horrible, it's pretty clear I am not the target demographic. Want something silly and formulaic to babysit the kids while you tend the barbecue? Here you go.

$REVIEW.: It is appropriate that one of literature's greatest and most tragic figures, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, is given compelling life on screen by one of fildom's most gifted and spellbinding artists, Greta Garbo, in MGM's luxurious production of Tolstoy's masterpiece, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;.Anna is the neglected wife of Russian aristocrat/bureaucrat, Karenin, haughtily portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Karenin is consumed by his career and social standing.  It seems that the only reason he married Anna and had a son with her is to enhance his &quot;respectibility&quot; in society.When a handsome officer, Count Vronsky, played with conviction by Frederic March, understandably is infatuated by the astonishingly beautiful and charming Anna, he makes this known to her.  He is persistent in his pursuit of her.At first Anna is reticent to his charms, but eventually succumbs. This story takes place during the 1800's under the reign of Czar Nicholas I of Russia.  In this era, there was a strict and judgmental social code.  Adultery was treated like a crime or a contagious disease, and Anna finds herself the object of scorn and ridicule among society.Anna's husband Karenin refuses to grant Anna a divorce and tells their son that Anna is dead when she flees to Venice with Vronsky. Eventually Anna becomes a social outcast because of her affair, and Vronsky begins to suffocate from their relationship. He decides to go off to war rather than be with Anna constantly.Devasted by Vronsky's abandonment and shunned by society, Anna's fate is tragic.I can imagine few other actresses than Greta Garbo who could so realistically embody the character of Anna. Anna is essentially a good person, a loving mother, and dutiful wife.  But she is starved for tenderness and affection so she turns to Vronsky.  Garbo subtly conveys Anna's despair and loneliness in her loveless marriage to Karenin.  Garbo makes you empathize with her predicament, and you truly feel the joy, passion, and guilt that Anna experiences as she falls in love with Vronsky.As an actress, Garbo is a minimalist in the best sense.  She understands that less is more.  She can gladden or break your heart with a glance, a smile, or the slightest tilt of her posture.  Her eyes are wondrously expressive. This is a masterful, mature, and dignified performance by a consummate actress.As for the rest of the movie, the direction, sets, and photography are all impressive.  And Garbo's unearthly beauty is complemented by the ravishing costumes designed by Adrian. This version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is a triumph.

$REVIEW.: This remake of the 1975 blockbuster (itself based on Ira Levin's book) updates the plot with current events, and modern plot twists.  Cynics can no longer write off this title as a time-sensitive fad, and must instead acknowledge its continued urgency to American cultural and political life.  Because the fashions and home decorations are generally updated for today's audiences, it is easier for my and future generations to focus upon the storyline's relevance to our own lives.After she is fired from her network executive position and then suffers a nervous breakdown, Joanna Eberhard (Nicole Kidman)  and her family move to the idyllic town of Stepford Connecticut. Priding herself on independence and strength, Joanna is quickly horrified to learn that most of the town's female residents are unabashed throwbacks to the idealized version of the 1950s, and Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken) presides over a quasi-secret men's club while wife Claire exherts a parallel pull over most female residents. Joanna quickly bonds with fellow outcast Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Middler), a writer who has remained cynical about the hamlet AND retained liberation despite her own long-term Stepford residence.Contrasting with the earlier film (which arrived shortly after the stonewall rebellion and before GLBT Americans came out in today's numbers), this version has an openly gay couple in the town---Roger Banister (Roger Bart) and Jerry Harmon (David Marshall Grant) . The people of Stepford pride themselves on being robo-Republicans but they are also happy to be just open-minded enough to publicly acknowledge the long-term relationship (hardly a benign issue with same-sex marriage making headlines around the country). Alas, he too is headed for dire consequences---because he becomes one of the very few Log Cabin Republicans after his own transformation.Joanna's husband Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) appears visibly reluctant in his own right to claim the numerous privileges Stepford confers upon him specifically because of sex.  He is obviously charmed by the town, but eventually realizes that he had specifically fallen in love with Joanna because she was an independent person who could NEVER be the "all American homemaker".Well-placed jabs at infamous rightwing women activists (such as Phyllis Schafly and Beverly Lahaye) abound when the town finally wakes up and realizes who was REALLY responsible for programming all of the women into being airheads.  Not all women are victims of subordination because other women made a very public name for themselves ensuring that their gender either remains or returns to inequality. When the plan is explained, this same person becomes instantly transformed from the idealized norm to a desperate and psychotic shellYet, if men are really unwitting accomplices in this same caper, this critical scripting update also suggests they can be, should be, and are important partners in women's equality.  Women's liberation ultimately makes both genders happy and well-rounded members of society.  Conversely, women's restriction also prevents men from enjoying life.

$REVIEW.: The Condemned is one of those movies that you know right off the bat is made for one specific type of audience. If you like reading Jane Austin novels and sunsets and walks along the beach and romantic movies then this movie may not be for you. This is all out balls to the wall action movie that does not apologize for what it is. Premise is a reality series producer is putting together the ultimate survivor series on the internet. He picks ten people from the worst prisons around the world and buys them from death row and attaches a bomb to their ankles. The Bomb will go off in 24 hours the catch is simple only one can win. It's a fight to the death the prize is you get your life your freedom and a big bankroll. Trapped amongst the sadistic killers is Jack Conrad (Steve Austin) a former Navy S.E.A.L. who was recruited to do black ops types of jobs his last one went bad and he was caught in El Salvador awaiting death. All Conrad wants to do is get out of this alive and go home to his girl. But Conrad is decent man with Honor and a code of principles that will not let him take part in this sadistic game so he tries his best to survive and get help. Steve Austin does a good job in his first film As lead actor and he's gone on to make better films since his role in the EXPENDABLES is much better and you can see Austin has grown as a actor, This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of this type of action flick. Better then Van Damme's hard target and Rutger Hauer's The game, This movie does deliver good entertainment.

$REVIEW.: I saw this movie on TV a long time ago.  I wanted to see it again and buy the DVD. It makes one hate the character who plays the calculating,greedy,manipulative and deceiving wife who pretends to be the victim of her unfaithful husband.  I loved the way she plays her mean, believable character.  It was worth waiting to buy the DVD.

$review_text.: These early movies of Chuck Norris finds him speaking softly which means turning up the volume for dialog and down for the music or leaving the volume alone and going with the flow
 His experience as a former World Champion Karate Fighter, retiring with a 25 and 0 record as the Champ, makes his moves a lot more realistic than with other, want-a-be Martial Artists in today's movies
 As always, Chuck Norris is entertaining and that is why we buy movies
 If you like Chuck Norris, you are going to like these movies


 Getting three good Chuck Norris Movies for this price was a deal that I just could not pass it up
 Buy them
 You will not regret it.

$review_text.: Jack the Giant Slayer was a lot of really good clean fun with some top notch acting. This beautifully cinematic adventure has several similarities to the classic tale we've all heard but also a lot of really great changes. It is every predictable and very cheesy but it's overall a really great movie to take the family to or if you just want a pleasant night at the movies. There is a considerably high amount of people getting killed or eaten but it's all mostly implied and everything is very light hearted. I would defiantly recommend seeing this.

$REVIEW.: .... not Al, mind you, the red stuff.What we have here is one vicious, ticked-off slasher flick.One that's not afraid to cut a few throats, and gush it's true colors. (deep shades of red)So if you love bloodbaths get your luffa ready, because every death is going to be visceral & torrential!The gore steals the show here.  Every death is a star.It upstages:the silly throwaway story where everybody makes the worst possible decisions,the masked murderer with unspeakable strength who can take a bullet like it was a lead snowflake,the magma hot heroine with a case of amnesia,the quintessential character written in to reveal everything in one 2 minute scene,the needless twist at the endthe anorexic thin plot,(a woman wakes up in a casket with an annoying case of memory loss.She is being pursued by a mute behemoth with a Chrome Skull glued (?) to his face,and a video camera strapped to his shoulder, who guess what, kills anyone in his way.)Yeah it's your typical slasherit acts like a slasher,and chances are it won't make it through a metal detector.But it doesn't hack like a slasher.It hacks like a barbarian.MORAL OF THE STORY:If you don't have the brains, have the blood.ALSO RECOMMENDED:Hatchet, Dead in 3 Days, High Tension, Inside, Midnight Meat Train,  Murder Set Pieces, Identity, Toolbox Murders,House of Wax, My Bloody Valentine 3-D, Friday the 13th, Silent Night Deadly Night, The Cottage, Botched, Scream, Behind the Mask.

$review_text.: I enjoyed watching the movie "After Earth."  It was a different "style" of Will Smith movie..., which is a good thing.  Will Smith was excellent in the role.  He played a loving father who knew in order to save his son and his own life he had to let go of the emotional "father role" and become his son's commander and teacher.  The special effects where top notch and both Will Smith and his son did excellent acting in the movie.  I do hope there is a sequel where Will Smith is more involved in some of the action scenes.  Unfortunately, many moviegoers rated this movie low on the ratings scale.  Anyone who did not like this movie needs to ask him or herself why?  Was it too educational for you?  It seems to bother moviegoers (even African Americans) whenever black actors drop the "colored-folk" stereotypes and step into a different genre of acting. I say, why should Will Smith mold himself into a stereotypical actor...speaking the same old dialogue and phonical diction that most movie goers hear from black actors.  "Oh, no, yawl, not gonna..." etc, etc.  Movie audiences love films like "This is the End" where producers show a bunch of bodies spewing blood all over the place and clog every scene of the film with curse words.  If people were truly honest with themselves they would ask, Why are there so many gory, horror movies?  Why do our society gravitate toward films filled with sadomasochistic sex against men, women and children?  I know it is a reflection of what is happening in our society.  Maybe, just maybe "After Earth" is not just a movie to entertain us, but to educate us how the earth may one day become...if we do not change.

$review_text.: As a mid-season filler for "NYPD Blue", "The Job" turned out to be one of the best shows aired in a long time. With a sharp-witted irreverant script and a uniformly great cast, it should have run longer than 19 episodes.Denis Leary, co-creator, co-producer and co-writer (with Peter Tolan) stars as unscrupulous Mike MacNeil, a pill-popping chain-smoking NYC Detective trying to keep his wife/family, 26 year old girlfriend and job all in balance. When the show ended, everything was unravelling in his life....The rest of the cast is just too good to single anyone out, even with the recurring "guest" roles - with one stand out there being Janet Hubert-Whitten. Although listed as appearing in only four episodes as Bill Nunn's (Pip) iron fisted domineering wife Adina, her presence is felt in nearly every episode looming over the whipped Pip like a dark menacing cloud.Nothing whatever is sacred whether it be race, religion or severed body parts. Case in point would be Lt. Williams, played in the pilot episode by Richard Gant, who can't remember the two Hispanic detective's names and calls them rice and beans ("I've been a detective for 36 years...I'm too old to learn new names")While many things in the show would be offensive if they were played straight, the brilliant scripts don't pull it's punches on any topic and delivers dead-pan humor with gleeful zest.The four DVD set comes nicely packaged and has few, but substantial extras, including interviews and a gag reel. Definitely one of the best releases of the year!

$REVIEW.: I've alway been of the opinion that American Beauty was terrific due to a great screenplay, terrific direction and fair acting.Thora Birch seemed to have terrific range in that movie as an actress, but that could have been editting and direction.In Ghost World, she makes me wonder if she was what made AB great.This terrific movie boasts some remarkable dialogue, excellent cinematography and very tight directing.More importantly it boasts a living heart that is often imitated in film but very infrequently to success


 These girls make you care about them

 They're terrific, funny, a little cruel but definitely very human.If I have a critique, its that the plotline was a little weak

 But in truth, the nature of its living heart means that the plot is like that of life, vague, mostly not-there and intriguing.Go see this flick

 You'll be happy you did.By the way, among the unknown cast members, the shirtless fellow with the nunchucks was a wierd little standout...who in heck was that?Oh, and last, why wasn't Terry Garr's name (she's nearly unrecognizable in this film) in the credits?  Its not even that she did this film incognito...Maxine, her character in the movie, isn't even listed in the credits.

$REVIEW.: Scientists like to forget that it was Darwin's theory of evolution that led to the scientific racism of the early 20th Century and attendant atrocities, including eugenics and racial/ethnic genocide.In this film it is proposed that Captain Kirk's ex-lover, along with his illegitimate son, have invented a technology with the power to reshape all matter in the universe into something delightful, like a giant Garden of Eden. The germ for this story-line probably began in the imaginative works of slightly off-balance Gene Roddenberry who consulted on this production. I imagine his thinking went something like this:The Big Bang resulted in an orderly universe, so why can't sentient beings someday create  a technology that improves on the Big Bang?If agnostic Roddenberry had taken a few minutes to think things through he might have concluded thus:The Big Bang created a universe so vast, it boggles the mind. Despite all our probing we have yet to detect the slightest clue of life, or even suitable conditions for life anywhere else in the universe. Moreover, what we do know about other planets is they are staggeringly harsh environments; Earth is the only true oasis we know of formed from all the vast matter of the universe. Therefore, if man did someday harness the ability to rearrange matter on a galactic scale what is the probability that said rearrangement would result in anything more than more cold, forbidding, lifeless planets, asteroids, and the like? No, I think a better plot for a film would be for Kirk to take the Enterprise to the farthest reaches of the universe only to discover that Creator God, who fashioned oasis Earth, is near to every man, and every heart, if only they open themselves up to Him. Yes, that is the film I'll make.

But like Jim Carrey, he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can't help but be won over totally by his zaniness.  I didn't think Black was very funny when this movie started, but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over.There seems to be a generation of film makers now (Richard Linklater, Cameron Crowe) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone &quot;cool,&quot; and their movies are full of welcome messages.  Cool isn't about how you look or dress or act.  Cool's a state of mind, man.  Peace out.Grade: A-

$REVIEW.: This movie gave Bill Murray a place to show case his talent of being a weird oddball character that somehow becomes enduring.  While he wasn't the star of this movie, I believe it was the last time he did not get top billing and I still recall this movie as being a &quot;Bill Murray&quot; film.  Yes, Dangerfield and Chase are funny, both playing funny characters,  but the scenes in which Murray is talking to himself, explaining life  or trying to kill the gopher are classic.  The main complaint about this film is that with about two minutes of editing it could have received a pg or in today's ratings a pg13 a that would have made it a better film.All in all a funny movie and a strong recommendation to any Murray, Chase or Dangerfield fan, plus those that enjoy somewhat offbeat silly coming of age teenage comedies.

$REVIEW.: This is a quirky, oddball comedy with some very interesting layers and connections back to 70's counterculture and secret military black projects. While not a full-blown Hollywood farce or timely put-down comedy which are so popular today, it speaks pretty loudly to those who are familiar with the subject matter. I also happen to like all the major stars involved. Equally as important to me were the Extras with interviews of some of the people on whom the book and film were based.Yes, Virginia, these things have a definite basis in real people and events.The characters and events are a mixture of fiction along with true events and real people, with the main characters being composites of some very real people. They touch on some of the stranger (declassified) programs the military has tried in an effort to anticipate the future needs and trends in warfare and military techniques. What is in the movie is a blending of at least two different programs, which may not have had much connection in real life: the First Earth Battalion and the Stargate remote viewing program. (NOT to be confused with the radical environmentalist Earth First group.)The movie really spoke to me in basic ways because I have connections to some of the material covered. Back in the 80s, I discovered and began to study the First Earth Battalion on which a large part of the movie was based. I have two copies of the original Evolutionary Tactics manual from when it was first offered to the public (through the Whole Earth Catalog folks, I believe). I was quite taken by the concept of the modern Warrior Monk, having cut my teeth on Bruce Lee's work and the original Kung-Fu TV series. I had my own T-shirts and buttons made, and seriously considered myself a member of the larger First Earth Battalion community. This was all way before the internet.I also have a colleague who studied at seminars (courtesy of the Tarrytown folks) with Jim Channon and his associate Frank Burns (not the MASH Burns). When this colleague and I first realized this unlikely connection between us (I also subscribed to the Tarrytown newsletter), we were struck by the very long odds of this happening in the remote and quite small town in which we live, kind of  like the tattoo revealing scene in the movie. He currently has one of my copies of the book.I also have all of Joe McMoneagle's books on the remote viewing program and have seen the documentary based on Schnabel's book, so I am aware of that material as well.If I didn't have these connections with the movie's content, I doubt it would have had as strong an impact, and if you don't know or understand these programs and how they fit into history and the changes in military and related areas, then the movie probably won't mean as much or be as good an experience for you.On the other hand, maybe it will make you sit up and take notice. Maybe you'll find a new part of your path in this material as well. Amazon has most of the material the movie is based upon......and more.Channon and others are also still around and going strong. First Earth Battalion - For People and Planet!

$REVIEW.: As this film demonstrates, Faulkner's books that utilize shifting points of view/interior monologues are not easy, most likely impossible, to fully translate into screen format. The biggest dilemma is that those who have read the novel or are at least familiar with Faulkner-in-general are bound to be a little dissatisfied while most non-Faulknerites will probably raise eyebrows and ask "Huh?"Nevertheless, the makers of this film did about the best job possible of condensing AS I LAY DYING into such a short length. It's expertly filmed, and the personalities of the individual family members come out very well. Specific nuances and key quotes are also effectively captured. Though this AILD may not come close to doing justice to the book, it's still helpful in elucidating Faulkner's novel and should be especially valuable for those teaching it to show to their classes. Yes, it is VERY dark and depressing, but I don't see how you can make the story of a poor 1920s Mississippi farm family transporting their deceased mother 40 miles for burial by rickety wagon anything otherwise. The grosser aspects are not emphasized any more than they have to be, and the vivid cinematography and Faulknerianingly maudlin bits of comic relief help make it palatable.As one who's always found Faulkner's work rewarding though seldom much fun to read, I must say that I really enjoyed this film and that it made me eager to reread AILD.

$review_text.: Gibson's Passion portrays the suffering of Christ as well as I could imagine it being done in a film

 His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened

 This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth
 The mocking of the Romans, the accusations of the Jewish leaders, the conflicts of his disciples, and the love for Jesus by the mass of people are all portrayed.The effects of flashbacks during the film to Jesus as a boy, young man, and times with his disciples emphasize his humanness and relationships


 The focus on Mary and her love for her son is gripping as we are forced to consider that Jesus is her child whom she has cared for.We see the anguish Christ faces when in the garden contemplating the suffering ahead of him
 Satan is present there and throughout the film to tempt and ridicule Jesus


 All of the time, Jesus keeps his eyes on his Father and the mission he is accomplishing for all people.The film makes it apparent that at anytime Christ could have ended it all my calling on God for angels or my using his power to stop it
 As we see in the garden, even as he is being arrested he heals the soldiers ear


 Although there were several players involved, we see that no person caused Christ death, but he gave his own life.The fact that the language is aramaic and latin is not bothersome at all and I think it adds to the profundity of the words spoken.I can't imagine this movie being done better that it has been done


 It completely fulfills the goals set for it: to display the suffering of Christ and the love in his heart.

$review_text.: There comes a point when even a great film can be over-hyped; when even a marvel of cinema, a masterpiece if you will, will get so much attention and accolades that it becomes `that movie that failed to live up'

 On the outset, while watching `There Will Be Blood' you could come to believe that to be true of this film


 Heralded as PT Anderson's finest film to date and regarded as one of the two cinematic masterpieces of this year past, `There Will Be Blood' has an obligation to deliver


 What is sad is that many people are not aware of exactly what it plans to deliver

 I can see now how backlash can begin, but I'm here to say that `backlash' in this case is undoubtedly undeserved.Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece (there, I said it) `There Will Be Blood' is not the movie many may believe it to be


 It is a slow and conflicted journey through the desperations and frustrations placed upon us by greed and selfishness


 It exposes the similarities between materialism and religious self-righteousness and it proves that nothing good can come of evil.`There Will Be Blood' is loosely based of off Upton Sinclair's novel `Oil!' but truly it serves as Anderson's very own vision

 Anderson pits oilman Daniel Plainview against religious preacher Eli Sunday in a small town of Little Boston during the turn of the century
 Plainview is a greedy man, a selfish man who will do anything he can to get what he wants, but Sunday is not much different
 Sunday is a man consumed with a fire that matches the determination of Plainview himself
 They are a perfect match; thus they are perfect enemies.The film moves at a slow pace, taking it's time to build and flesh out these characters

 Aside from Plainview and Sunday you have Daniel's son, H.W., a young yet oddly mature boy who takes in much more than one would expect
 As his fathers `business partner', young H.W
stands comfortably at his father's side; a sight that is often as chilling as it is heartbreaking.`There Will Be Blood' is a film that opens with such a savage calm, a feeling of unsettled tranquility


 The score blazing in the distance, Plainview mining for gold; not a word spoken and yet so much is being said


 It ends on a completely different note; one of tranquil savagery; a burst of manic violence that leaves the viewer feeling oddly subdued
 It's such a masterful way to open and close a film; opening in such a way that keeps us on edge and closing in such a way that puts us at ease.Yet another reason why PT Anderson should have won that directing Oscar.The film is masterfully crafted; a film that just fits so beautifully together, each facet connecting nicely with the next

 It's beautifully shot; the Oscar winning cinematography is spellbinding to say the least

 The score is also a huge plus here, lending a helping hand in creating the perfect mood for this piece


 I remember falling in love with Greenwood's score when I first heard it, but hearing it within the confines of this film adds a whole new light to its grace and beauty.And then there is the acting...Much credit has been given to Daniel Day-Lewis for his performance as Daniel Plainview


 He's won just about every award imaginable and has received countless amounts of praise and admiration, for which he has received it with the utmost sincerity and gratitude

 I am here to acknowledge once again his magnificence here


 Day-Lewis completely becomes Daniel Plainview
 He doesn't look like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't sound like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't act like Daniel Day-Lewis

 Daniel Day-Lewis does not exist within this character; only Daniel Plainview is present
 He flawlessly boils to the surface this mans flaws and transgressions, his bolstering greed and domination

 There are moments when you know that this man is thinking the worst and yet all we see is that sly grin and his eyes, those eyes that speak volumes

 This is not just one of the finest performances of the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.Daniel is not without good company though

 There are two other performers here that steal scenes and command attention

 Young Dillon Freasier, who plays H.W., delivers a brilliant performance

 He masterfully creates and otherworldly maturity that chills the bones while speaking barely a word
 Pay close attention to the relationship between father and son; there are volumes to be told
 Of course we have Paul Dano who plays the eccentric Eli Sunday


 His performance is mind-bogglingly good


 There is a scene where he proceeds to expel the arthritis from the hands of one of the members of his church

 It's the first scene where we really get a glimpse into this very complex character


 It's brilliant to say the least and it serves as a masterful building block for what is to come.`There Will Be Blood' is a film that everyone should see


 Everyone should know what they are about to witness first; that way they can really embrace it for what it is
 This is not an action film, nor a thriller in your most conventional sense


 `There Will Be Blood' is quite frankly one of the best character studies I've seen in recent years

 It's a film that flawlessly exposes the inhumanity within humanity and forces the audience to accept the `ugly' within our souls
 As many have noted; this is not a film that wants to be liked
 It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, but it will leave you with much to ponder, much to think about and contemplate and will thus leave you with much to remember.

$REVIEW.: There's not much to play on PS4 yet so I decided to buy this as my first PSN movie. It's hokey and predictable in almost every way, there are 0 surprises and it's such a deliberately simplistic story. There are no stand out performances, no great dialogue and even the action sequences are fairly bland. The basic simplified moral of the story is finding a sense of humanity amidst eugenicist, elitist attitudes that do pervade humankind's reality at the moment so there is relevance to the movie's message but it's not delivered in an epic way at all.

$review_text.: Elephant was a little too "real" for many tastes.  I didn't enjoy the film as I watched it the first time, but thought van Sant did (as always) a terrific job presenting what he wanted to present - if not necessarily my type of movie.  The film hasn't left me and the more I think about it - and rewatch it, the better it becomes.Initially I felt the sense of ennui was a tad overdone watching the back of a student's head as he slowly moves from point A to point B - sometimes for endless minutes on end the camera will not break from that vantage point - the back of a head.  The point seemed made both literally and succinctly the first time.  Nonetheless, this device frees the narrative and affords van Sant opportunity to move his film in non-linear directions so the glimpse of a face unseen earlier is now viewed in full relief, a snatch of conversation previously heard comes into focus - even if briefly.There are elements of the film that are touching and keenly observant.  While van Sant has typically focused on youth for his body of work, these elements are evident in all ages but noticeably and most strongly pronounced in youth, those hormone filled, confusing years where, completely unbeknownst to us, its victims, life is pretty much going to be the same, and one can change high school for the factory, the hospital, the law firm, the insurance company or wherever you spend your days and those with whom you spend them.As with life, some characters will stay with you, some you'd wish to know better, others (the three bulimic girlfriends) who natter on endlessly about nothing - and whose existence one forgets entirely - until the next encounter.There is more than a little heartbreak in Elephant.  Watching Alex pelted with spitballs made me cringe with remorse.  There is little reason to understand why Alex, and his sort of friend Eric, are losers.  There is outwardly no reason they don't fit in, something we see in everyday life:  people arbitrarily shunned because as a society we simply need people to be excluded.  As the boys share a shower and prepare for the shooting spree - and death - Eric's statement "I've never even kissed anyone" resounds with a loneliness that is shattering.Had I written this review upon first watching Elephant I would've given it two stars.  Seeing it again, and thinking and talking about it lots, earns it 5.

$REVIEW.: A Very Long Engagement does a surprisingly deft job of balancing the absurdities and horrors of war with the absurdities of everyday life and the tenuous nature of hope and history, both ever changing and prey to the unbalancing influence of the smallest detail. More than most, this is really a film about the enduring pains of war that linger long after the last shots are fired and the battlefields are grown over as Mathilde's journey for her lost love goes from hospitals to widows to cripples to the thousands of official forms that once meant life or death. It's here that the film's lavish budget is really felt, allowing the story to span a wounded country eager to forget but unable to, as well as recreating the front lines. The reconstruction of the trench scenes is similarly impressive, although, as in Jasprisot's novel, the attitude of the poilous is much more sympathetic than it would have been in reality (deserters and self-inflicted wound cases were widely hated by soldiers at the front, who generally felt they should take their chances alongside them).Its use of narration pays dividends, establishing that each of the five condemned man has a life and people that care about them. It's still done with Jeunet's characteristic quirkiness and black visual humor, but that's all too the good. And while there are some similarities, Tatou is not exactly Amelie here, all-too-ready to dismiss a helpful source as a slut in her own small-minded determination. The little games she plays with fate might seem whimsical, but she loses as many as she wins. Even the ending that proved so unacceptable for US audiences by opting for neither an obviously happy/unhappy ever after ending is just right, leaving its characters in limbo but not without hope.A final touch of absurdity is added by Jeunot's audio commentary, where he complains over the end credits that despite spending more money by filming in France with French cast and crew entirely in the French language, the film was met with astonishing hostility by the French film industry which immediately declared it a foreign film and moved that it be forced to repay it's small government subsidy and be ruled ineligible for all French awards. I guess now he knows how George Stevens felt after being persuaded to shoot The Greatest Story Ever Told with a US crew in Monument Valley instead of cheaper foreign shores now only to be ridiculed and abused by the industry for his troubles... In filmmaking, like war, nothing really changes.

$review_text.: While no mention has been made anywhere on this site, it is worth noting that ADV has released a second version of the affordably-priced (but still not CHEAP) STARBURST edition that includes 4 single-sided discs in a neat little tiered DVD case instead of the horrible double-sided discs that everyone has been complaining about. I am writing this note to warn you: While Amazon appears to be shipping the 4-DISC versions, it is impossible to tell exactly what you will be getting from any NON-AMAZON retailer. So do yourself a favor and order it directly from AMAZON or a retailer who explicitly states that you'll be getting all 4 discs.
