$review_text.: We all have a really busy life schedule

In the middle of that, taking out time for massage therapies can be difficult

Moreover, the cost of regular massages can shake up your budget completely

This book contains some of the very best and effective massage therapies I have ever read about


There are not only head and back massage and acupressure therapies, but the author has listed effective techniques for the whole body

Simply name it head, neck, throat, neck, back, legs, arms, shoulders....you will find it all listed in this book
I have been taking an hour each day to massage myself and my husband with the techniques from this book and it has made a huge positive impact in our lives! Highly recommended!



$SUMMARY.: Easy to Use massage techniques that really help!

$REVIEW.: Book Hangover I say! I am exhausted, but so happy that I was introduced to Author, Ann Lister, and her Rock God Series

I am so afraid to review these two books because I can't even begin to express how I feel about them


They are beautifully written, and as happy as I am on how book 2 concluded, my heart feels heavy because I am wiped out with all the emotion I felt while reading and loving these two books


Hey I guess, I just wrote my review
5 stars for both of them
I can't wait read book 3 in this series and get to know Jayson & Cooper:) Happy Reading Friends

$REVIEW.: If all of the Complete Peanuts volumes are this good, then Fantagraphics will stay in business forever. This first book is beautifully packaged (by semi-famous Canadian cartoonist Seth), with three daily strips per page. Sunday strips fill an entire page. The introduction is short and to-the-point. The essay after the final strip is very good; it explains why Peanuts became the most successful newspaper strip of all time. The books ends with a lengthy interview with Charles Schulz that goes a long way toward explaining what kind of person could create such a wonderfully sweet and sad comic every day for 50 years. Schulz was both ordinary and extraordinary at the same time, and his work reflects that contradiction.But the heart of the book is in the panels, of course. As you read, you get to see the Peanuts world grow. Schroeder and Linus are introduced as toddlers. Snoopy doesn't talk or think until the second year. (He doesn't do much except eat Charlie Brown's candy, either.) Violet pulls the football away from Charlie Brown  before Lucy does. And so on. This book captures a comic strip world in its earliest stages, still forming. Even Schulz's drawing style grows from page to page, in very subtle ways.It's going to be hard to top this first volume. The early strips have a lot of historical value, and the extras are great. Five stars.

$REVIEW.: Gold TrapBy:  Lily MaytreeStory of adventure to Africa. School teacher Meg very strong minded decides she is going to pursue what she wants. Through her teaching history discovers Mary Kingsley.  Things are not same now in the time of now as it would have been back in the time that Mary  ventured there.  Meg tried to follow her footsteps in this great adventure.Wow a lot of adventure in this book. During her travels through Africa Meg plunges forward leaving love behind for awhile while she goes on her adventure.  Meg was determined to follow the path of Mary Kingsley. Taking pictures as she travels. Now keep in mind the 1800's would have been a lot different then now.  This is a fast pace adventure. Some history and of course some romance.  Meg wanted to stray out of her ordinary life and find  what God's purpose for her life was. Lots of adventure like a witch doctor , there is a  embezzler-turned-kidnapper after her,And that's not to mention floating down a river full of crocodiles, two boys who wanted to hold her for ransom, an earthquake, a cave-in, the leopard in her bed, and a pink hippopotamus. In the end, her Divine Appointment from God held mystery, excitement and a whole lot more." Very enjoyable book. Make sure to read Pandora's  Box also.Thanks BookFun.org and TBCN for giving me this book that I might post my own honest review. Thanks Fred St. Laurent.

$review_text.: This new edition, with a new preface, is as fresh and as important as its initial publication twenty years ago, indeed even more significant, as we are now experiencing the planet's own drive toward the wild with resulting climatic changes. I owned poetry of Gary Snyder, but I was not familiar with his prose. What a profound pleasure is his essays! Erudite, wide-ranging, and spiritual, the various sections look to indigenous peoples, their lore and way of life in comparative balance with the environment, to Snyder's own varied work experiences and sojourn in Japan to study Zen, to discussions of the flora and fauna of the Pacific coast and mountains. He properly distinguishes Nature, wilderness, and wild, and observes how civilization, mainly Western, has increasingly separated humankind from nature and from our animalness. [It is natural for people to create dense cities, differentiate labor, develop complex communications, and apply mathematics; ask a honeybee.] Underlying all the socio-political elements is guidance on grasping and living the deep ecology of existence, of rejoining the wild even while working in business offices and factories. Snyder's introduction of Buddhism is not its philosophies, nor its details of practices, but its lessons of practical living. Reading this book will give pause and help reconsider one's life and societal direction. It will help find beauty in the familiar and joy in wild weeds.

$REVIEW.: This is by far one of the best books I have ever written
I love to read about theology and prophecy and I found this book to be quite interesting
It was able to explain an ancient prophecy in the modern form of fiction
It's very good to read with a bible next to you so that one can refer back to the sacred text


I would encourage anyone of ANY faith to read it and maybe they will think twice about WHY they are involved in their faith to begin with

It redefines our self through Christ by allowing us to see things fold out in our modern era--rather than ancient
Of course on in the bible it says faith is believing without seeing...but it sure doesn't hurt to see something to make your faith grow


A phenomenal book!

$REVIEW.: I bought this book only because it was a FREE read at the time. There would be no way I would buy this on my own. I expected to hate this book. To my surprise I did not. It was a bit confusing for a bit but I read through it and was surprised. I would have preferred a stronger ending for the main characters. The ending felt rushed. I felt that it needed better closer.Teen Girl is different. Transported to another world. Her real world to be exact. Has to choose between two men. She is in a world that she is slowly coming to understand and must fight to survive. Meets and make many new friends. Confrontation, fight, than a rushed ending. Both men have betrayed her and both want to use her. One just doesn't know how to talk to people and didn't mean to use or betray her. The other is the cause of her being there and had deliberately used and betrayed her.SPOILER: She sleeps with both men in a matter of days. Feel close to both. Who does she go with?This is a good read for a teenage and young adult. It's a PG-13 read.

The characters develop feelings that are too intense to be realistic in that time frame, and they are too melodramatic to be likable. I also didn't like the heroine much at all. I was willing to take the chance for the super-low price, so I don't have any major regrets, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.

$review_text.: I can see it now, people will slam me for not reading further into the book before becoming opinionated but reading further would have been too arduous. I can't say I made it any further than the introduction and first two chapters. I was hoping to see something enlightening and perhaps intuitive to the demise of the Liberal Class but found neither and to read further to me seemed pointless. The author describes real events and real situations superficially but puts a spin on things that I never dreamed possible. He does so with such conviction that I can't accuse him of fabrication just delusion. Such as apologists are to religion, I find Hedges to be in regards to politics and world events. It seems to me that the Liberal Class is very much alive. Two terms of Obama and a good portion of the American public that still thankfully has a social conscience should convince most people that the Liberal Class isn't quite in it's death throes yet. It is safe to say that I feel no need to read any other books that Chris Hedges has written.

Her boyfriend, Dante, has disappeared through a time portal, stuck in a between place that's impossible to reach without the hourglass door. But the door has been destroyed, and Abby has only a small amount of time to create new one.Problem is, the reality around her continues to change as Zo manipulates time, drastically altering Abby's life. First it's her friend, Justin, then her college scholarship. When her family is affected, Abby will take any risk to undo Zo's destruction. Her friend, Valerie is the only one with answers, but she is under strict surveillance at a mental hospital.As the second installment of this YA series, The Golden Spiral continues the fascinating and highly creative story of time travel. Mangum's writing style is fresh, with a strong literary voice, and will draw readers into the psyche of the various characters and their struggles to understand who they can trust and who still holds dark secrets. Intriguing and suspenseful, The Golden Spiral is an engaging sequel, which will both please readers and leave them anxious for volume three, The Forgotten Locket.

$REVIEW.: And all from an author who was one of the few to see personal HUD devices from the distant past of 2005. Does he really belive that? Apparently this guy has not seen Star Trek, many 80's scifi movies, heard of researchers like Randy Pauch, cochlear implants or retinal implants. Perhaps he was hanging out with Gore and helping him to invent the internet. The devices used to advance the story were childishly random, and there seems to be no comprehension science on the part of the author.  Reminded me of The Koban series. That author at least had the excuse of being old. And for the record, I think it quite silly for an author to introduce himself in the beginning of a book by knocking classic scifi authors.

S

Scott has talent, but it's buried in f-bombs, crude language and cheap talk

Clearly, some reviewers find the unceasing sex talk erotic instead of off-putting

Oh well, potato, potahto


To me the hero is boorish and pitifully inarticulate

He's constantly spouting unvarnished smut
Seriously, who talks like that? The author? The readers? Poor things


The heroine, recovering from a relationship where she was used and disrespected, meets with continual disrespect from the clod who supposedly loves her.This author has potential, but the sheer volume of unpolished, raunchy dialogue becomes ridiculous after a while

I was well short of the halfway point before I quit reading

I get that this is I-Love-You-Buy-Me-Something fantasy, but I can&#8217;t figure out what sort


This sub-genre of novel is neither pure porn nor romance, but a nasty mishmash of the low points of each


The scanty plot is utterly derivative and panders to its drooling readership, if these reviews are indeed genuine

Don&#8217;t teenagers sneak off to read copies of Fanny Hill anymore? I suppose they don&#8217;t even notice it if books like this are popular
A pity
If they&#8217;re going to read Billionaire Undone, exposure to Cleland&#8217;s elegant prose might at least raise readers&#8217; expectations for this sort of...stuff.

$review_text.: I received this through one of the giveaways, and while it isn't a long book, it was certainly interesting.  This is one of a handful of Christian creation tales I've encountered, though one certainly doesn't have to be a Christian to read this.  It's not focused on preaching so much on demonstrating how even those in heaven could become corrupted and how easily even the purest can change for the worst.The story is told primarily from the view of one of the regular Joe angels, one who shares the fascination the angels had with earth, who witnessed how weapons were first introduced, how evil was born from the best intentions, and how and why some of the angels began making choices that would lead to their own falls.The characters were a little limited at first--purposely so, because it's not like angels vary much in their thoughts--but the author did a nice job of slowly changing perceptions and behaviors until the characters were as complex as humans.  Some of the more interesting angels--and the ones I wouldn't have thought as likely to fall--were the ones who caused the most damage in the end.  Again, it was very interesting.I'm not, of course, going to assess how well this fits my view of the Bible or its teachings.  This is more along the lines of a creation story and isn't about trying to preach religion, I think.  Still, overall, while I suspect I'll have to read the sequel to finish the story, this was nicely paced, intelligent, and entertaining.
$SUMMARY.: Very interesting take on the fall of angels

$review_text.: This was not even close to what I thought it was going to be. I mean that in the best way possible as I was surprised by the content, plot and message of the story.First, I want to say that this book has some very controversial ideas in it. It deals with the concept of suicide, abuse, rape and the afterlife. Now normally I cringe when any book deals with rape or a survivor of and it can make my enjoyment of the book fall quite a bit. That said though, I felt like the abuse and rape of Lela the main character, in her time in foster care, added to her character and was well presented for a YA audience. It was not too descript and wasn&#8217;t just thrown in willy nilly to add drama or depth to the character.While the story is not perfect there were a lot of ideas I enjoyed and I let some things that normally would have bothered me go because I was enjoying the ride too much to care. Lela has had a difficult life. Thrust into the Foster Care system she has been moved from home to home over the years and not all of them have been good. In fact one was bad, very bad. Nadia became her unlikely friends and they formed a bond stronger than any Lela has had in her life so far. Strong enough that Lela will go into the purgatory city for suicides to save her friend.--  &#34;She gave me things. Amazing things. A vision of myself, different from what I had been. Better, but still me, you know? Dreams of the future, of what I could become.&#34;I didn&#8217;t expect this story to take place after death and wow to the idea of the city that suicides go to. This is where I got to and couldn&#8217;t put down the story. The city is a living breathing thing almost and some of the ideas were just creepy and fascinating. Lela must find Nadia in the city and only has a short time to do so since she shouldn&#8217;t me there. Along the way she meets a guard Malachi, there is an instant sort of connection to him. Now normally I would hate the semi-insta-love addition to the story but&#8230;.I wanted it. I&#8217;m not sure if I just wanted someone to love Lela because she was so broken but I totally cheered for the romance in the book.--  &#34;Figures. The first time a guy tells me I&#8217;m beautiful, I&#8217;m in hell and he&#8217;s delirious.&#8221;There is also the threat of Mazakin in the city, a demon of sorts that is taking over the bodies of the people in the city. Lela must find Nadia before the Mazakin do. But can you save someone who committed suicide? How do you save someone that doesn&#8217;t want to save themselves?For all of the heavy dark topics in the book I found it to be more hopeful than most. I loved the romance and deep loyalty and love Lela felt for Nadia. The portrayal of Raphael as the most average man ever and Michael as fat slobbery drunkard in the story was also hilarious if they are the Arch Angels of the same name. Also the &#8216;Judge&#8217; wasn&#8217;t what I expected either. I liked the originality of the story and I&#8217;m very interested to see what happens to Lela and Malachi on any future endeavors.

Usually a writer will use the prologue to describe a first meeting between the hero and heroine, or provide background on or both so as not to interrupt the flow later on. Here, the author created an entire story based on a historical deity. The history geek, I mean, buff, in me wanted to know more. So many questions came to mind, I wanted a full-length novel with what I got before Chapter One!Lexi was so awkward, it was hilarious! I saw so much of myself in her. I loved her innocence and at at the same time her bravery to try new things. Speaking of which, the best love scene I have read in a long time, if ever. All. Hail. Ryan. Kidd.I KNEW IT!

He works for a law firm, signing up clients for personal injury cases and taking pictures of cracked sidewalks, etc.  When a man attempts to hire him for some "real" detective work, he refuses the case.  But, when that same man turns up dead, Stanley decides he must investigate.  What follows is a great mystery while also being a great send-up of a hard-boiled PI story.
$SUMMARY.: Entertaining, Comedic Mystery

$review_text.: As with the previous books, I'm not fan of either of the main characters (Adrien more so than Jake).  Nothing much that has happened over the past 4 books has really changed that opinion.  This installment felt like filler...fluff...and completely unnecessary.  The mystery isn't much of one, just like Jake and Adrien's relationship.Skip this installment...not recommended.

$REVIEW.: I read this on my return from Odessa and although it is a novel and stretches the truth where necessary to the story, it also has a huge amount of believability based on what we saw and experienced while there

 To me, the book was a mixture of a fascinating story and travel notes
 I thoroughly enjoyed it.

$REVIEW.: Author K.R. Jordan presents a stunning world of magic and fairies. The beauty is breathless, the story intriguing. Despite the demands of explaining procedures of royalty and rule in this new domain, Jordan creates fascinatingly strong characters. I felt a strong connection and attachment to the relationships formed throughout Riftglade.It had few weaknesses. I felt the language became overly archaic at times, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in a classical fairy tale. I just would have liked to see more modern elements. The present tense language also threw me off at times. But, overall, an incredibly original and engaging read.

I was kinda annoyed with Brooke and Reid because I wanted their relationship to blossom without having other people to interrupt their lives. Once I began reading, it was indeed hard to put down.

$REVIEW.: I rated this book on the title and what I thought I was getting. As a book on revision and self editing, it makes  a better book on the basics on the craft of fiction writing. If that was what is was being marketed as I would have given it a 4 or 5 because it does a nice job of covering the basic 'how to's' of writing. I would say that reading this was not a waste of time. I found much of it informative and it was pleasent to read.However, if you looking for a good book on editing and revision, look elsewhere.

$review_text.: 4.5 StarsFirst Ink is a short story introducing us to the lives of Rush and Addison, two individuals that use to be inseparable but stupid decisions and circumstance tore them apart. Five years later Addison wants the chance to tell Rush how she feels and she goes to great lengths to do so. I was swept away reading First Ink. I personally don't read contemporary romances that often, let alone NA material but this one sucked me in and I devoured it in one sitting before quickly purchasing the next installment in the Wicked Ink Chronicles. I not only fell in love with the story itself but with the characters. Rush and Addison are relatable and their thoughts are genuine and realistic. I wanted to root for the two of them and was biting my nails, waiting for them to figure things out. First Ink was an extraordinary introduction in Wright's Wicked Ink world and I am eager for more! The story is one that I feel we all can relate two and while yes it can be slightly predictable, it is the feel good story with the epic leaps for love that we all secretly crave.

$REVIEW.: I have to admit that I didn't really enjoy this book, however it is still a good book and worth considering if you are looking for an introduction to J2ME

I found that I didn't really connect with the writing style and therefore the process of reviewing this text was a bit more laborious than I had hoped."Beginning J2ME Third Edition" provides an update on the latest J2ME technologies and gives it good coverage, with a comparison to the older technologies (so no problems if you're stuck a few versions behind)

I also felt that the samples sometimes wandered between being too small and not exercising the given point through to being too large and burying the example in pages of code.In the end maybe I was just disappointed in what I felt was cursory coverage from two good authors.It's not all bad news though


The samples are still very useful and the coverage of some areas that I had found confusing in other books was much clearer here.Maybe my impression of this book was affected by my lack of connection to the text

There may be better books out there, but I've found they too have limitations and may not be as up to date as this one; you'll have to weigh this with your requirements

I guess I'm still waiting for something else.

$review_text.: Picking up the story of Aaron and Spencer very quickly, we are again taken into the continuing recovery and growing relationship of the two main characters


Spencer has taken the job offer that he received for the software design that he and Aaron had jointly developed

He now has an apartment about an hour away

Their relationship is starting to change, even with the constant on-line chatting and regular visits
Aaron has made some major strides in his recovery of the events of that fateful night years ago, but he is nowhere near being a whole person yet.The murderers are apprehended, and now Aaron is faced with an upcoming trial where he must confront his attackers

He must be able to take control of his life back from these monsters if he is to survive.All of the secondary characters to this story are all well developed and, while each has their own demons to face, nothing comes close to the ordeal that Aaron must endure.In a complete surprise appearance, the two main characters of Rowan Speedwell's book, &#34;Finding Zach&#34; make an appearance as supporters of Aaron in his battle to regain his life


Although it was pleasant seeing these guys again, and using them in this manner, since the book had a similar storyline, I believe that &#34;Finding Zach&#34; covers the key element in a more compelling and original way

It's all about taking control of your life back and being a survivor and although this pair of novels does that job quite admirably, my favorite is still the Speedwell book.However, that in no way should diminish your enjoyment of Barnaby's work

Coming to terms with being a survivor is what it's all about, and that is told here with great feeling and compassion

Barnaby is the author of the &#34;Little Boy Lost&#34; series, and it is a classic in gay literature
Her skills are quite apparent here as well.

$review_text.: I had read so many books about walking the Appalachian Trail that I thought I would not purchase any more, but noting the excellent reviews of 'On the Beaten Path' I decided just one more. I am glad I did.Everyone's experience of the AT and the reasons for undertaking the venture, is unique. Robert Rubin was having a &#34;mid-life crisis&#34; and hoped that the challenge of the trek would produce some sort of transformation in him. He probably did not expect the level of guilt he would suffer throughout the journey over what he admitted was a selfish act.I liked the inference that the AT has now become the &#34;beaten path&#34;, because so many people hike it every year. He brings to light just how close the AT is to civilization when he sees the tops of the two towers of the World Trade Center and realizes that the panorama of Manhattan is just beyond a single wooded ridge.The author also paints a graphic picture of the illnesses that befall the AT community, the torn knee ligaments, the stomach bugs, the health hazards of crowded mouse-lousy shelters, the strange effect on the bladder. But it is not all doom and gloom, the author has a beautiful command of the language and the descriptions of the environment he is walking through read like poetry.This is the first book where I have read the &#34;Afterword&#34; before finishing the book because I could not resist finding out whether he really did find what he was looking for.

$REVIEW.: Though I'm not familiar with Benni Harper books, the quilt patterns themselves are a stand-alone reason for quilters to get this book.The finished quilts range in size from baby or lap quilt size (39" x 39") to the largest, at 74" x 88". There are many styles in the book, including country/country-western (She Shall Overcome, Senor Azure, It's Never too Late to Be a Cowgirl, Kansas Troubles, Final Roundup); vintage-look (Path in the Wilderness, Best Friends in Spite Of, A Mother's Love, Family Chain); modern (Coming Storms); and classic (With this Ring, Big Bear Honeymoon). My favorite, the Path in the Wilderness quilt, looks cute when done in '30s repro prints, and the original that it is based on can be viewed on author Fowler's official website. Quilt designer Margrit Hall mixes traditional quilt patterns with the non-traditional. The one thing that would have improved the book, in my opinion, would have been for the traditional quilt designs they were based upon to be discussed in more historical detail, perhaps in side bars.As a beginner, I want to say to other beginners: Don't be intimidated by the quilt designs in this book, even though they look complex. Because many of the quilts are small, you'll have a great-looking quilt in no time--the smaller ones are great first projects for future quilters!

A fateful day, an ouroboros mark formed on her neck, causing the change of events that will transform her forever.The novella continuous with the paranormal mythic world of beings created in Sophia's Journey. Here we see Ophelia becoming part of this world of creatures as a Cruor. Story is engaging and it's notable the use of descriptions to heighten the narrative. Slow story that gets dynamism once the MC embraced her new nature. Takes a little time to get use to Ophelia's accent, but it is not a big drawback.Find the ending rushed. Felt I wanted to know more about the characters. Who knows, maybe we will see more of them in Hamilton's future projects.The cover: gorgeous, mysterious, great colorsHave you read this novella?

$review_text.: Oldests Kind of Magic is a story that never fulfills the plotline's great potential.Daria Morgan is a magic practitioner who doesn't believe in a soul-mate imperative, a cliched version of the romantic storyline of finding Mr. Right. She's a virgin and will be until she meets him. Bent Benthausen is the stereotypical CEO who needs Daria's special consultation services.The problem with "The Oldest Kind of Magic" is that the characters fall flat on the page. There is no life to them. Instead of being them, feeling with them, like a reader should, the reader watches them float through convoluted talk from Daria's family about soul mates and magicians and the subplot of sabatoge on a company Bent is trying to turn around - which could have been better developed.The dialog is archaic - not conversational - and very distracting at times with it's formality. Bent's character isn't believable and Daria is, well, the same in some instances.That said, there is potential with author Ann Macela. It might be worth it to read her next book to see if she gets her groove on a a paranormal romance author. Of course, I won't test that theory at full price.

$review_text.: Homicide detective Rance Nicolet is looking into the brutal murder of a little girl that was placed in foster care.  He finds himself attracted to her social worker who seems to be just as driven to find out why this little girl was murdered.  When her old lover is found dead in a trunk with a letter from her in his pocket, Rance has to make a choice: blindly believe in the woman he's falling in love with or follow the evidence no matter what.This novella is an absolute page turner!  Some people might claim it lacks depth, but of course a novella isn't going to have the depth of a full length novel.  The fast pace of this book, keeps the reader focused on the here and now so much so that you'll never suspect the big twist! I sure didn't!  I love the fact that Harlow Drake wasn't afraid to dabble with a little line crossing.  The little girl's murder was gruesome to say the least and the ties back to some form of tribal shamanism was great!  If you want a quick and entertaining read, look no further.  I can't wait to read more from this author.Thank you to Novel Publicity for the review copy.  It in no way influenced my review.

$REVIEW.: For the past year I've picked up more than a few Strange Chemistry titles featuring strong heroines, mature and strengthened by their independence. Without a doubt, Julianna Scott's The Holders is no exception! When I first began reading I had high expectations to be thoroughly intrigued, but I didn't expect the urge Scott's writing built in me to read furiously until the end. I fell for the characters, the plot, and the beautiful presentation of Ireland.Rebecca Ingle, 17 years old and self-charged with protecting her younger brother, Ryland, is a force to reckon with. Scott opens the novel showcasing the most admirable trait that any character can have and Becca has loads of: fierce loyalty. The voice she's created for young Becca is honest and strong; even when she's afraid of change or danger she still comes across as real. I thought it was extremely interesting how her rage, which could be considered a flawed trait in certain scenes, was perfect because it came out in her protective streak over the ones she loved.The voices Ryland hears in his head have alienated him and made him the target of several offers to be locked up in mental facilities. Becca is completely against them all until her family is approached by representatives from a school in Ireland. Alex Bray convinces her that her brother is special and that the voices he hears are a sign of his emerging power. St. Brigid's Academy becomes a beacon for Ryland who may finally find the help he deserves. Becca tags along in hopes that she can be there for Ryland until he settles down and to make sure he's truly safe. The transition reveals the truth about why Ryland is special for a Holder and what his role is in a centuries old prophecy.The Holders could remind readers of X-Men, or even Kate Kaynak's Minder, but the fantasy elements are just a touch more intricate. Not to mention the fact that the Holders race began after regular humans were blessed by an Irish goddess many centuries ago. The idea of humans with superpowers is nothing new, but it's the little things about the Holders' society and control of power that sets Scott apart from the rest. I am so thankful this is only the beginning of a series because I couldn't imagine not being able to read a continuation of Becca's story. The Holders is a novel too entertaining and emotionally charged to pass up!*ARC provided via publisher in exchange for an honest review*Also posted on Lovey Dovey Books

$review_text.: At first, Unavoidable may seem like a cookie cutter romance novel.  As you read you discover it has a suspenseful, action movie weaved in.  Brianna, our heroine, comes from a bad upbringing, rendering her on the streets.  Somehow, she finds her way out of all of the bad and recreates herself.  The unfortunate thing about problems though, is that you can never really run from your problems because wherever you go, there they are and eventually they need to be dealt with.  Throughout the story Brianna struggles to deal with her past while trying to build a future with Colton.  Colton, is a typical tall, muscular, handsome hunk of a book boyfriend.  Whereas, Brianna is anything but the typical female lead.  There is a role reversal of sorts here, where Brianna is the protector and takes the lead more often then not.  Simply stated, she is a badass disguised as a sexy as hell vixen!  This makes Colton different simply because we are so used to seeing the total alpha male.  Colton's character was brilliantly done and his taking a backseat to his leading lady in no way shows him as weak.  This is a book for anyone tired of the whiney, damsel in distress female lead who wants a story with some serious action scenes.  The supporting characters were awesome and I wish we had gotten more closure from their stories.  I hope that the fact that we didn't means there are some spinoffs for these characters in the works?  Overall, a great first outing for Ms. Greathouse.  Looking forward to what is to come.

$REVIEW.: Originally posted at Fantasy Literature.Jack Campbell, a retired U.S. Navy officer, is best known for his military science fiction novels which he writes under the pseudonym Jack Campbell (the LOST FLEET series) and his real name, John G. Hemry (STARK&#8217;S WAR, JAG IN SPACE). With his latest offering, a novella called The Last Full Measure, he brings his military mind back down to earth.In this alternate history, the U.S. government no longer upholds the constitution. The president&#8217;s free use of the Alien and Sedition Acts have put the military and the press in the ruling party&#8217;s hands. To protect itself, the government no longer allows U.S. citizens to learn true American history, so most Americans don&#8217;t realize that the freedoms their ancestors enjoyed have gradually been eroded.Even though the Constitution is no longer easily available for U.S. citizens to read, Joshua Chamberlain, a professor of rhetoric, knows something has gone wrong, so he begins to investigate and discovers the truth. For this he&#8217;s sentenced to jail, along with a tall gangly man named Abraham Lincoln who the authorities suspect may be a focal point for rebellion. When rebels hold up the train which they think carries Lincoln to his jail cell, they free Chamberlain instead. He is only too willing to join the revolution.Along the way Professor Chamberlain will meet, or hear tell of, such famous characters as Sam Houston, Ulysses Grant, Robert E. Lee, Cump Sherman, George Armstrong Custer, Jeb Stuart, John Lawrence Burns, Lewis Armistead, Winfield Hancock and, of course, Abraham Lincoln. He&#8217;ll be forced to consider many ethical issues. Slavery is the &#8220;easy&#8221; one. He&#8217;ll also have to think about the role of government in society, the necessity of war, and the danger of letting self-interest dictate policies rather than a moral conviction. As a professor of rhetoric he&#8217;ll learn that sometimes words are not enough. Sometimes action is required, even by the &#8220;little&#8221; men who don&#8217;t realize they have an important role to play.The Last Full Measure is a short offering by Jack Campbell &#8212; only about 100 pages long &#8212; and will probably appeal most to those who enjoy American historical fiction or fans of Jack Campbell&#8217;s military science fiction who want to see what he can do with a story set in the past instead of the future. I enjoyed the story as an alternate history and, perhaps, a warning. It feels like The Last Full Measure may be the beginning of something bigger. The end leaves us feeling unfulfilled but hopeful.

The comedy factor was their again, I love a book that can make me laugh and cry. This is an emotional roller coaster of fun, happiness and heartbreak.I am one of these people who loves a good 'baddie' in a book and Kasey hit the nail on the head in this aspect. Oooo you're in for a treat.I sat and read this book in one sitting and for the life of me I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. It drags you in and keeps you hostage until the very last word.Jeremy was an easy character to love but he'll never take Jackson's place in my heart I'm afraid, it's Jackson all the way for me. I love Ava and her strength. She was also weak in places but found her back bone when she needed it.Oscar, well Oscar I fell in love with. How could you not. Such a sweet little boy. I love the way that Kasey has not shied away from the topic and brought it to the fore front of her readers minds.There was a particular part in the book that I feel wasn't explored fully and for me it was a big part that needed to be addressed and for this reason I can only give Sky Cowboy 4 out of 5*.

$review_text.: When you read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion the first thing you wonder is how could anybody have taken them seriously. Yet that's exactly what thousands of people did - and not only ignorant Russian peasants but also scholars and intellectuals from all kinds of backgrounds and nationalities. The origins of the myth of the Jewish world-conspiracy and its devastating effects are clearly explained by Norman Cohn in this fascinating book. What originated as a fabrication concocted by a few obscure fanatics, eventually became a major influence in the treatment Jews received in Russia and Germany. Jewry, imagined as a closely organised, world-wide political power was seen as an embodiment of modernity, a symbol of all those forces in the modern world that the most reactionary members of society feared and hated.The Protocols originated in France but found their most ardent adherents in Russia - a country with a well established anti-Semitic tradition - and later in Germany, where Hitler found in them a "rational" explanation for his beliefs and a justification for his actions. Save in Britain, the unmasking of the forgery in 1921 made little difference and they ultimately became a warrant for genocide during WWII, when millions of Jews were systematically exterminated by the Nazis. As Mr. Cohn puts it: "Behind the massacre as a whole there was a blind fanaticism which was largely inspired by the Protocols and the myth of the Jewish world-conspiracy."Norman Cohn's book is populated with obscure, half-crazy, half-criminal political adventurers who used this ridiculous fake as a device for obtaining influence, privilege and power. His well documented and brilliantly written analysis of the origins and effects of the Protocols is an essential work for understanding the extreme anti-Semitism that led to the murder of millions of people.

I did enjoy the stuntman scenes, and the secondary characters, each of the main's friends, were good, but could have been developed further. A nice holiday read, though

$review_text.: Justin is a typical fifteen year old, generally dissatisfied with life and the way it is going for him


 It all starts to change because of three things: swimming is the one thing he does well, and he makes two special friends - one straight and one gay

 Suddenly life takes on new meaning, he becomes one of the leaders of his swim team, he stands up for one member who is being picked on, and he leads the other guys in the skinny dipping initiation


 To say anything about his two important friends would e a real spoiler, and it would be much better if  you enjoyed this book as much as I did.

$REVIEW.: This engaging and comprehensive book is testament to how far alternative medicine has come in recent years, at addressing our health concerns.Everything that one needs to understand about the eye structure, the description of a cataract and other useful information is included, with many links to other resources.Then the author outlines all the practical steps one can take to optimize eye health as well as the nutrients that are required


The alternatives to surgery are as diverse as antioxidants, homeopathy, herbs, light therapy and much more

Truly, a great resource for those who need to address cataract problems without resorting to surgery
Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: WAR!There is a war going on. A war for talent. If you have read "Talent masters", "Workplace 2020" or any of the latest books in the human resource space you are aware of the importance of recruiting and retaining talent.What can you learn from the special forces?81% of CEOs claim that they are losing that war. George Anders in his book "The rare find" looks at what makes recruiter successful and uses examples from the special forces, the FBI, sports, venture capitalists, education an the medical sector. It explains how Facebook recruits their talent (online coding puzzles!).The long tail in talentThe book refers to "The long tail" and how you can use that long tail to spot talent outside of the standard top resumes. Has elements of "Business exposed" (super CEOs and super talent are hugely overrated) and "Blink" (trust your instincts).Key messageThe book has a few key messages:* if you don't know what is coming you need to hire the unexpected* look outside the box* resumes are only the tip of the iceberg, find out the whole story* read the resume upside down* it is not about skill, it is about character and hidden virtues* compromise on experience, do NOT compromise on character* use observation* ignore cultural fit at your peril* don't look for "good enough" but "try to find the "could be spectacular"Common senseThe book makes absolute common sense and in some ways there is nothing new in it. The good companies and CEOs will understand the messages in the book instinctively.Mavericks at workI think it is a sister books beside "Mavericks at work" where the key message is that you need to recruit people that share your passion and that skills are secondary. This book has the same message about the importance of character and how that supersedes experience.Your mum and dad and the FBIHow your mum and dad raised you is more important than your education. And it is best explained through what the FBI looks for in candidates.Initiative, perseverance and compatibilityDiscipline, trainability and judgementLoyalty, leadership and maturityYou can't gauge that from a resume.

$REVIEW.: I received ARC for an honest review. I know I am partial to bad boy rockers anyway, but this is truly one of the best rocker books that I have read. This is the first book that I have read by this author and I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed. The story centers around the group Lush. Lush is on the fast track to becoming one of the biggest rock bands in the world when a secret from the past threatens to tear the band apart and ruin a lifetime friendships. At the band&#8217;s helm, front man Joss Jamison has spent most of his life in love with the idea of what his best friends Tammy (band manager) and Walsh (drummer) have. Mel, Tammy&#8217;s little sister, has spent most of her life growing up around the members of Lush. They have always looked at her as their little sister they never had. When Mel is forced to leave school after a shocking indiscretion that threatens her academic and future professional career, she joins the band on their As Lush As It Gets Tour as the band&#8217;s photographer. Joss soon notices that Mel is no longer the little girl that they all grew up with and much to older sister Tammy&#8217;s dismay begins a torrid affair with the broken and troubled front man. Can Joss and Mel let go of their mistakes and find true love or will their secrets tear them and those around them apart? Read A Lush Betrayal and find out!

$review_text.: We all know that zombies are killers

They're usually depicted as mindless eating machines, with no feelings of regret or remorse
But what about humanity? We've all seen the monsterous actions of human beings when we're at war

This wonderful short by Dane Hatchell taps into that animalistic rage that we can sometimes display

Not for the faint hearted, I found that the inhuman actions of the survivalists outweighed the horrors that zombies bring


You really have to ask yourself, would this really happen? Would some of us become more horrific & frightening that the zombies themselves? And, can love truly prevail under those circumstances? Read on & find out!! Get this book!! It will change the way you see humanity.

$REVIEW.: Not your typical &#8220;home for the holidays&#8221; Christmas story, there is definitely something between Mark, the homicide detective, and Savannah, the florist, even before they meet.  They have scoped each other out for some time before Savannah finally runs across the street to see if her cop neighbor can intervene and keep &#8220;Santa&#8221; from towing her car.  Unfortunately, Santa&#8217;s paperwork is all in order and Mark can&#8217;t help much.  He also explains to Savannah that he is homicide so to let him know if she finds a body.  Little does he dream that she&#8217;ll be back screaming when she finds her ex-husband dead in her kitchen.  Mark has lots of rules, a meddlesome mother, and Savannah is causing havoc with his nice, quiet, boring life.  Cute and funny, with steamy romance.

$REVIEW.: The Coming Jobs War by James Clifton begins with theUSA having won the 1970-2000 jobs war by leading in newinternet technologies, superior business models andexport knowhow

Winning future jobs wars can preservethe current 25% USA share of  the global economy.James Clifton believes that this growth can besustained by tapping the resources of large cities,huge universities and the community connectionspossessed by local leaders.Most solutions begin locally


James Clifton believesthat whatever improves the jobs picture at theneighborhood level should be facilitated throughthe prism of local leadership


If rezoning improvesjobs and economic opportunity, then part of the solutionis to rezone

In the new economy, there is a definiteneed for entrepreneurialship or salesmanship


Leadersof countries who create new jobs require adequatesupport systems in law, education, military plansfor transitioning resources for peaceful use and municipal planning.Student engagement is needed to prevent large drop-out rates.Key personal traits ae excellence in mathematics coupled withleadership skills

Ultimately, student graduation is a veryimportant predictor of a municipality's future innovation andentrepreneurialship potential.Increments in the GDP are good for workers becausenew jobs are created in the economy and more peopleare hired
When more people are hired, consumerspending increases

Growth may be achieved by cuttingtaxes and raising business output
 When take-home payis reduced, spending is lowered , as well as GDP.China's GDP is expected to reach $70 trillion dollarsby 2040 with the United States trailing at $30 trilliondollars in the same time frame.The Coming Jobs War demonstrates that health carecosts are a large fiscal drain by multiple layersof government
The area of behavioral economicsrecognizes that more optimal eating choices, smokingcessation and moderation in drinking are criticalingredients to reducing health care costs rationallyand permanently.The Coming Jobs War by James Clifton is a wonderfulbook which explains how the United States can keepgrowing well into the future provided that simplesteps are taken now.Credits: First Published on Blogcritics

With a little tweakingand your own personal favorite fabrics, you can create a myriad of wall hangings or just the intended baby quilts, from simple to more complex using the patterns listed.

$REVIEW.: I picked this book up because I loved the cover and the blurb that went with it piqued my interest. Now I didn't totally dislike this book. It has a good message and lots of hope. I liked Riley and wanted her to find peace and love. Tristan was an interesting character and London was odd.This is what kept me from loving this book. Riley was broken and so closed off that nobody could get in. Almost immediately after you meet her she changes her MO. She is all friendly and has a physical relationship with a complete stranger. I just figure her out. Tristan was the same. He was weak and broken then he was all alpha. I hard a hard time following their story because of the identity crises they both had.The other issue was Tristan violent behavior that he never was held responsible for. Any normal person would be held for charges and made to pay the consequences.Another issue I had was the plot had identity issues as well. It didn't know if It wanted to be a romance, a murder mystery, a psychotic thriller or a coming into your own story. It was all over the place. I couldn't figure  out what direction it was going.  The ending was beautiful and rewarding  and gave you faith in the human race. I appreciate the effort the author put into this and that is why I have the book 3 stars.

I felt like I was in Spain, enjoying the tastes, smells, sounds and landscape of the area.I really liked the main characters and their chemistry was palpable as soon as they met

Their internal conflicts were well established, good sexual tension between the couple and I was rooting for them through the whole book.The author intermingled mystery, suspense and ghost sightings with a romance that will have you sighing, laughing and at the same time keep you intrigued to figure out the outcome.Well written story.

$review_text.: It's sort of like fantasy football for literature buffs: Trying to fit all your favorite fictional characters into one gigantic family tree, a Unified Field Theory of heroic fiction
Sci-fi author Philip Jose Farmer laid the groundwork, postulating that the real-life crash of a meteor in the English town of Wold Newton in 1795 gave off radiation that altered the DNA of those nearby, creating a strain of nearly-superhuman geniuses and physical marvels who then became the great heroes and villains of fiction


Everyone from Tarzan to James Bond to Travis McGee to Phileas Fogg were part of the extended family
Since then, many other "Wold Newton scholars" have jumped into the game, expanding and refining Farmer's original family tree to incorporate even more characters from literature, movies, radio, tv, comic books and cartoons.Myths for the Modern Age lays out the origins of the Wold Newton concept, and the generally-accepted "rules of the game"

The bulk of the book consists of essays establishing, clarifying, and debating how various characters fit into the Wold Newton Family
Was Captain Nemo really Professor Moriarty in disguise? Was Charlie Chan the son of Fu Manchu? Is Zorro in all those books, movies, and tv shows really all the same person? How many children did Tarzan have, anyway? The answers are all here, exhaustively researched and footnoted, with a generous dollop of imagination and a touch of tongue-in-cheek humor.It's a niche interest, to be sure...inside jokes don't get much more "inside" than this
But if this kind of "creative mythologizing" and pop-culture obsessing appeals to you, this is big barrel of fun.

The story uses facts from Aldrin's life as a type of metaphor describing the protagonist's plight and journey. Initially I had reservations as the book was slow getting started but once I adjusted to the relaxing pace of the author's writing it was very rewarding.One added enjoyment was that the reader gets to explore a rather isolated place known as the Faroe Islands. I looked them up on Google Earth and found many of the places mentioned in the book. It really helped to view the actual locations although the authors descriptions roughly suggested what I discovered visually via Google Earth.
$SUMMARY.: Relaxing and rewarding reading

$REVIEW.: Johnny Nothing has nothing, not even loving parents. That is kind of sad until mean old uncle Marley left him a task. Suddenly he has something, and his parents are hell bent on spoiling it.As a kid/ mother myself, I can see myself doing a lot of those things. Particularly buying things that I do not need and telling my kid to save. I can also imagine my own child, at 10 or 11, tweenage years understanding what it is like to be Johnny Nothing.Love the hilarity and the solemnity of it though. It is like a parody of life.

I went in completely blind, not knowing much about the storyline or the author's writing style, and was pleasantly surprised with what I read. The blurb caught my attention so I dove in. I can't believe this is only Bayli's second novel - she has a beautiful writing style that really captures you in with every single page. I loved this so hard. I read this in half a day bc I needed to know, was fully invested and loved these characters. 5+ stars!!

I was taken on a sublime journey and gently deposited back in my suburban life. What a journey it was! Drama, angst, heart throbbing, nail biting, tears, laughter, and clenching(lol). I cannot wait for book 3. The anticipation will kill me, but isn't that why we all read? To feel? To live even for a moment in someone else's life. Be a part of something bigger then us.

Now I wake do my eight minute exercise, and drink coffee.  My first meal is at noon.  I am not Hungary and I eat Big Macs and fries for lunch and pizza for dinner.  The thing I am most excited about is I feel the burn when I wake.  I have tried every diet, this seems to work. Will up date in a week.I now am changing my review.

$review_text.: This was a good sequel to Fish & Chips.  The guys have come back from the undercover work where they were able to be an openly gay couple and have to go back to to regular life where they have to hide their relationship.  Zane is trying to wrap his head around the fact the Ty has confessed his love for him.  The guys seem to be so much closer together while their is a someone terrorizing the city. Ty and Zane get caught in the media spot light while trying to catch the person bombing the city and robbing banks and Zane gets injured, which i think definitely made him rely on Ty more which I feel ultimately brought them closer together.  Ty's old Recon team shows up and Ty confesses to his friends that he is gay and that he and Zane are more than just work partners.  I think we get to see a whole new side to Ty when his team comes to visit.  I liked seeing the relationship with the guys develop to the point where Zane can confess that he is in love with Ty.  Sadly though, right after Zane confesses his love to Ty, Ty leaves him.  The guys relationship is totally in the wind at the end of the book.

Whereas other fantasy comics will resort to archaic languages, Saga reads like it is being told by one of your more charismatic friends.

$REVIEW.: Someone once told me that the best philosophy to have when writing a book is to get your audience hooked within the first minute of them reading it. Robert Vaughan delivers in this regard!Admittedly, I knew and cared very little about WW2 when I bought this book, and I bought it at it's introductory price to try a book in a genre I wouldn't normally read.I care now. I care about World War 2. It was that good. The author's attention to detail and character psychology made the military scenes feel like something out of a movie, and while the bulk of the book deals with interpersonal romance between the characters outside of a military situation, the author manages to weave his characters into some of the biggest and most recognizable military events of World War 2.I am very glad I bought this book. It was a meaty and enjoyable read.If you are an avid reader of this WW2 fiction, then you will likely get even more out of the book than me. In any instance, expect a well-written, enjoyable novel.

$REVIEW.: Looking for a relaxing but thought-provoking novel to while away a winter's afternoon?  If so, I highly recommend "Down Molasses Creek" by Nicole Seitz.  You'll meet Ally Green, recently returned to an empty house and a lost love after her father's death.  After years of running from her past, can she put down roots in old, familiar soil?  And, if she tries, will the ghosts of her past let her stay?  As Ally says, "Sometimes stepping back in time is the only way for a girl to move forward."Skillfully woven into the story is another story of a young girl in India who sets out on the journey of a lifetime, uncertain if the truth she seeks will set her free or bring her disaster.  No spoilers here, so where her story intersects with Ally's is something you'll have to find out for yourself!  I really enjoyed this book but would have to say that the characters were much better drawn than the setting.  Still, even with that minor flaw, it was a lovely way to spend an afternoon and I would encourage you to spend a little time "Down  Molasses Creek."This book was provided to me for this review as part of the BookSneeze program.

A kid from a troubled background's full back story might not fill the ouvre out but for a completist.However, this is a rip-roaring yarn in the best tradition. Not overloaded with gun porn or superhuman being deadly fighting. Real human beings bleeding and running about for the ultimate good of society.Jet/Maya is great, beautiful and a little troubled, perhaps a little sociopathic, but you know underneath she's human and that shows out.Once again, I read the darn thing straight through without stopping, a full Sunday afternoon.

The author highlights the health benefits of a plant-based diet with updated medical advice, and recommendations for a healthy diet. All mouth-watering, flavorful recipes include: The number of servings, simple directions, and helpful tips. There are several inviting, colorful photos that compliment the recipes. Many of the ingredients are common, and several recipes are within a friendly budget.The Index includes: Breads & Muffins; Breakfast; Salads; Soups & Chillis; Burgers, Sandwiches, And Tacos; Entrees; Side Dishes; And Desserts.Some of the delicious Desserts include: Mint Chocolate Mousse Torte; Peanut Butter Fudge Truffles; And Easy Breezy Sunday Cobbler. We are anxious to make the Coconut Pillows. We made the Creamy Fettuccini, which is simple to make, and very tasty. I have lemons & limes at home, so we made the Lemon-Lime Green Smoothie, which was delicious, and filling. Our Next Selections will be the Creamy Broccoli Soup, The Nacho &#34;Cheese&#34; Sauce which my daughter selected, and the Baked Onion Rings. We will leave updates with New recipes we try. Most of the recipes are easy-to-prepare with simple preparation. A Great addition to my cookbook collection at a reasonable price. Highly recommended for all those seeking a healthy diet on a friendly budget. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is more of a cookbook than a true guide. Thau uses examples he lifts from other sites to make each example. The reason I label it more cookbook than guide is the entire book is laid out poorly from start to finish with no sense of overall reason.So, judging from that angle this book does an acceptable job of presenting the material. It shoots from one topic to the next, with barely enough time spent explaining the first before presenting the second. The best example would be to picture a ferret on speed the understand the lack of depth offered by this book. Based upon that, it does cover a significant number of topics, just none of them in detail.The biggest fault is that you can get better (meaning less typos and mistakes) code and example freely on the web than is offered in the book. So, use this book as a launching pad for discovering better resources elsewhere.

$review_text.: Breaking Spades is the 4th installment of the Hamden series, and this series is filled with hot alpha men and the women they love.Meet CeCe, she is independent, beautiful, successful, and is lying to herself when it comes to men. Does she date? Yes. Does she do commitments? NO. She was burned a long time ago, so she has decided that she will protect herself and not let another man hurt her.Meet Jarod, a PI who is battling the pain from wounds he received in the war, along with battling the wounds he caused to the only woman he has ever loved. But will she give him a chance to prove to her that he is not the same man she remembers?CeCe and Jarod share a past, a past that one wants never to relive and the other wants to continue what they had.After leaning that she has a stalker, her oldest friend and only man she trusts, Dylan, decides he needs to protect her. He hires a PI to help catch the person who is threatening his friend, but not knowing the history between CeCe and Jarod, he has no idea how hard it is going to be to keep her safe.CeCe refuses Jarod's help. She doesn't trust him. She fights with him every chance she gets. Jarod is determined to keep CeCe safe, and to show her his true feelings. There is danger lurking, and with no idea of who it may be, the two of them have to work together to keep CeCe safe.Jarod is the quintessential hot alpha boyfriend, and since CeCe has already been down that road it is a total battle to the end. While Jarod tries to show just how much he has changed, it is the way CeCe has changed to protect herself that is the true battle.  It may take several life changing events before CeCe decides if she will follow her head or her heart.Breaking Spades may be the 4th installment to the Hamden series, but it can be read as a stand alone. The characters from the previous books make an appearance, just a FYI.I received an ARC for an honest review

$REVIEW.: It seems rare these days to find a book that captures my attention so thoroughly that I &#8220;can&#8217;t put it down.&#8221; Trinity: Military War Dog by Ronie Kendig was one of those finds.Heath Daniels and his partner Trinity- a military war dog- have their careers ended when Heath is injured in an Afghani explosion that could have also ended his life. When the former Green Beret begins to put his life together, he finds new purpose working with Trinity and other retired service dogs in a non-profit company called A Breed Apart.It is during one of his engagements with A Breed Apart that he meets Darci Kintz. This engagement provides one last mission for Heath and Trinity, one that risks everyone&#8217;s lives.Ronie makes it clear through the detail of her story that she is knowledgeable with military life and paints accurate scenes from that knowledge. This book kept me distracted from my responsibilities as I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what happens with Heath, Darci and Trinity. Trinity: Military War Dog has me eager to read other books written by Ronie Kendig, including the rest of the &#8220;A Breed Apart&#8221; series.

$review_text.: A book I got for free recently.It is more a collection of essays and short stories than a book. Anthology is maybe a stretch. Not much that ties them together other than the tin foil hat the author wears quite proudly.The writing is pretty good. The essays and the stories could be better if he did not go on and on and on and on and on with his way out there politics and world view. I don't have anything against the view so much as  the repetitiveness gets in the way of the story and of the essays.One essay was basically suggesting setting up snipers to deal with rioters. It was probably 5 times as long as it needed to be to just say that in an effective way. Incidentally, sniping at rioters is not that bad of an idea if things get that bad, but the essay just took too long getting there.I also think he is way too optimistic about how cops in general will react to general lawlessness by government. I have seen very little that suggests that enough of them would come riding in to rescue the rest of us as a couple of his stories suggest. Most are more interested in their paychecks and pensions, and are selected for obedience to authority rather than for ethical character these days and it shows in how LE operates today.

$REVIEW.: Lewis uses the word "awareness" as a key element to improve your breathing. Most authors advocate deep breathing; however, few alert readers to monitor this process.In fact, one can optimize breathing by simply paying attention to it. Becoming aware of your breathing and body movement will teach you to breathe efficiently and naturally -- this book shows that.It has also taught me how to handle stressful situation. In such state, instead of rapidly changing the breathing rhythm, I calm down by simply being alert and analyzing my breathing.Thus,the more you pay attention to your breathing the more you improve your life quality. However, in order to obtain optimum results it is essential to do the exercises shown in the book.Speaking of breathing exercises--known by experts as breathing experiments--I would also recommend "Ways to Better Breathing" by Carola Speads: the best.

Its not bad, but not the best. She tends to loose her readers (at least me ) in this book, by the second chapter. I found myself drifting uninterested!

$review_text.: Clean eating offers a great blueprint that describes why our bodies get out of sorts, how to correct these problems and the benefits we will derive from clean eating. With environmental toxins and parasites prevalent in our world, it's more important than ever to pay attention to these principles.As the book explains there are three main factors to clean eating: detoxifying, replenishing and re-energizing. Following these fundamentals helps to correct imbalances when you overindulge (during the holidays, for example). I appreciate that the book encourages you to follow your common sense and does not try to enforce a rigid dogmatic system that never seems to work with diets. This book will be an excellent addition to your healthy living library!

$REVIEW.: Visit Into the Night Reviews at Web: [...] or Facebook: [...] for great book reviews, new release updates, giveaways and more!!I really enjoyed Jaded Touch.  I think there is definite value in reading Gilded Destiny first as it does provide the back story to the Vespers.  While I think you could still read Jaded Touch without it, there are some elements that will just make more sense if you do.Three is a wonderful, head strong character.  Different from other Vespers in that she was not made by the original pair, but rather made by a &#8216;Gent&#8217; (a male Vesper).  As a consequence she is taunted by other &#8216;Maids&#8217; and susceptible to control should a Gent choose to impose himself upon her.  Unlike Levitiqas, Vashni the female Vesper queen, does not banish memories from the maids unnecessarily &#8211; consequently Three has some recollection of her origins and her maker, although his precise details have been expunged from her mind.Jaded Touch is well written.  The relationship that evolves between Jack and Three is fabulous.  The banter between the two is entertaining and charged with sexual tension, not to mention the underlying risk of death to them both should the Vespers discover their secret.  Jack was just wonderful &#8211; his willingness to confront Three, despite the consequences clearly conveyed the depth of his feelings for her.There are other wonderful characters in this story too, I particularly liked Sychar.  Despite all the rules and restrictions imposed by the Vespar culture Three and Sychar develop a friendship &#8211; something completely forbidden.  This was actually one of many transgressions from the rules by both Three and Sychar, and it had me wondering just how much control Levitiqas and Vashni really had.  It also had me wondering whether there would be a future story about some sort of Vesper revolt.As much as the Vespers are terrifying creatures I couldn&#8217;t help but feel sorry for Three and Sychar &#8211; clearly just wanting to have a level of comfort with their existence but this was simply not allowed.  The manipulation by Levitiqas and Vashni is extensive and it is not until almost the very end of the story that you understand its full extent.  I do hope we get a Sychar novella in the not too distant future.There was enough in the two Vesper novellas for me to watch out for any further instalments.  Jaded Touch had a bit more substance to it for me and shows great promise for more in this series.

$REVIEW.: The new novella from Mark Allen, "Resurrection Bullets" -- did you know he almost titled it "Hell's Harvest"??? -- is exactly the kind of story that gets your blood flowing, heart pumping, your guns loaded and your axes honed. Written as an homage to "The Crow" mythos, the storyline MAY seem familiar but Allen doesn't paint with the same sort of brush -- he writes with razor blades dipped in arsenic. The palpable pain the main character goes through, his supernatural lust for revenge, the uncomfortable (yet necessary) murder scenes, the soulless twist at the end ... it all makes for one of those stories you start and don't stop until you are done. And unlike some of his other tales -- "Suck a Bus," "The Killing Question," "Mudslingers" etc. -- it's written with a more gothic, haunting slant. Recommended for anyone who likes to read anything, ever.

But the telling was only so-so

On the other hand, the problem with many of the best-selling authors not-so-good books is that they don't have stories as good as this.

$REVIEW.: Cisco CCNA - Routing and Switching 200-120 Official Cert Library is the new addition to the Cisco press library to cover the latest CCNA exams announced and implemented recently. Wendell Odom is one of my favorite authors in Cisco Press publications. He is always detail oriented and covers the fundamentals very well. This new official Cert Guide Library covers the topics for ICND1 and ICND2 version 2 exams.  Cisco always brings changes in the curriculum to fit the need of current networking Market.  This package contains two books with DVDs. Cisco CCENT/CCNA book covers the fundamentals of networking (OSI Layers, IPv4 & IPv6 addressing, Routing and switching, IP services and Network management). CCNA Routing and switching book covers the actual implementation and troubleshooting of the above.  CCENT/CCNA book covers the basics of networking that anyone seeking employment at an entry level positions requires. This time they set the bar high by adding all the Routing and Switching elements of CCNA which was not covered in previous CCNA Libraries. CCENT/CCNA now has increased value than its previous version simply because the contents are more than just fundamentals of networking.I have seen lots of new stuff added in this book. Few of the topics are...IPv4 and IPv6 troubleshootingNetwork ManagementRouter and Switch SecurityIPsec VPN conceptsVPN, OSPF ipv6 and EIGRP ipv6Software licensingManaging IOS filesSyslog, SNMP, NETFLOW, DHCP etc.Implementation and Troubleshooting chapters in second book (ICND2) are specifically on IPv4 and IPv6 are critical to today's complex network environment. Author has done good job by focusing on troubleshooting.As usual the organization of chapters starts with Quiz and all important subtopics have been marked as "Key Topics". I like the way that is defined. It gives you a kind of importance to read it carefully.All the Figures are very clear and "Note" on important points are the key to anyone preparing for their certification.The DVD contains network simulator, practice questions and videos. I like the concept of "Mind Mapping". Mind Mapping is the concept by which you can remember all the aspects of a particular topic. It enhances your understanding of the topic and helps you remember and relate each and everything that the topic.Overall, nobody could have done better job in covering latest Cisco CCNA topics than Wendell Odom.

$REVIEW.: In this short novella, author Karen Lenfestey has managed not only to give the reader well-developed characters but also has written an intriguing plot
 A teacher in an inner city school, Diane has been falsely accused of a crime and suspended from her job

 Returning to her mom's home, she tries to reconnect with an old beau, while encouraging her widowed mom to do the same


 Will either encounter rekindle old flames?  Or is it too late for both?  And, even if the truth about Diane's actions at school is disclosed, will she be too disillusioned to ever teach again?  A quick read, this tale will grab you from the very start
 I received this kindle edition free from the author.

But I'm not kidding when I say you do need an MBA level of understanding of these concepts to make sense of what he is trying to say.Having said that, he covers a lot of information, and has a lot of interesting tidbits of information. On the negative side, it is disorganized, jumping all around the time line. Of all the books on this general topic, I would give it a grade of B.He was a key player in these events, so don't expect an impartial discussion of the issues. He has his opinions, justifies his actions, etc. Among the criticism here on Amazon is that he doesn't accept blame for some things. Well, he's arguing his case. Don't expect him to impartially analyze his own life's work.

Anyone reading this book with learning in mind can take away powerful new ideas and strategies. What one does with this richness of strategies is what makes the difference between the learner and the doer.Gary May, one of the authors, is a powerful example of someone who learned new strategies, immediately used them, and refined them from his personal success and experience. He now successfully trains others. You will benefit from his expertise!Read this book and pick at least one powerful strategy - and do it until a new habit is formed.  You'll be happy you did.

$review_text.: Buck Owens was complicated man whose life has many aspects -- his performances, his finances, his place in American culture then and now, his recordings and his sex life.  Sisk focuses heavily on his sex life via interviews with actual and alleged participants.  One learns a tremendous amount about his messy liaisons, but the tale is not related that clearly.  Continuity is choppy and it's difficult for the reader to keep the names and dates straight.  By the end of the book, one is relieved that the tacky tale has ended and left wanting more about Buck Owens the artist and performer.  That's a story for another biography of Owens.

$review_text.: There are many questions people need to ask and answer.One should disregard this author's reputation and past works if one is going to objectively look at the information presented here


 This latest book by Gore Vidal has highlighted and investigated many things the Federal government is doing today that perhaps not enough Americans are discussing at the moment (post 2002)


 As a result of what occurred in 2002, many fundamental operations, as well as the outright constitutional philosophy, have changed in the U.S

In addition to this governmental metamorphosis in the U.S


many individuals, beauracratic agencies, and corporations have benefitted tremendously from 9/11

 Many will benefit from a regime change in Iraq

 There are many angles to look at but people should be aware of 1

who benefits 2

how they benefit, and 3

why they benefit.An incremental and consistent eroding of the Bill of Rights, and *successfull* attempts to eliminate such judicial precedents e.g., the "Exlusionary Rule" are a slippery slope that began in the latter part of the 20th Century


 Federal, state, and local police agencies have increased their power to alarmingly enormous levels as a result of 2002


 These encroachments (i.e, the Total Information Awareness Act, which may falter) focuses on ALL Americans, and not on the false premise that these new powers will be used exlusively to investigate terror suspects, who of course, need to be consistently found out and quashed.Like the Cold War, and the War on Drugs, the State is feeding off of 9/11 like a body builder on steroids.

$review_text.: Wow...just wow ! !Well...actually, I had to FORCE myself to take more than just a few days to finish it - so I could make it last longer. And it was THAT good, believe me !Well, what we have here in the story is a good-looking, amateur detective named Dick Hardesty who works for a public relations firm where his nasty boss is always looking over his shoulder.Then whether he likes it or not, he starts getting himself involved in a mysterious case of arson attacks when some unknown person starts burning down gay bars on and off.( It's always difficult for a reviewer to write book reviews without spoilers... *sighs* so I will try not to go into too much detail, then. )First, there are a couple of parts where we cannot help but have tears in our eyes:* Where it has finally become obvious that Chris who has been living with Dick for more than five years has to move away because he has been given a great opportunity to work in New York.* When his friend's lover dies.* The moment when the truth about a man who has played an important role in the story has finally been revealed.From what I have gathered so far from the story, it seems our Dick here is not too young but not too old. And so many of his friends ( plus his enemies ) seem genuinely fond of him and that many have described him as a "hot" "handsome" and "sexy" guy.Our Dick cries, too. His love and concern for his lover and friends ( plus some of his enemies... ) are enormous. Yes, he is all heart ! Caring, loving, funny...well, often cynical though he is incredibly cute and absolutely adorable !( And did you know that he sometimes has his little "Dick Hardesty-to-Dick Hardesty talks" ? )Well, here...we can see he does have feelings...and so does the lower half of his body that often gets in the way of his business, ignoring Dick's direct orders... *smirks*And...speaking of the lower part of his body, there are not-too-graphic sex scenes written here, too...which reminds us that Dick is human like everyone else. And I believe they are the kind of scenes in a novel which are necessary to make a story all the more real.And finally, having reached the last several pages, I must tell you that the ending to the story turned out to be a real blow to me ! Knocked me sideways with this shocking but amazing revelation, honestly !!* * * * * * *The funny thing is...as soon as I started reading the novel, I had this Opening Theme from Strange Report playing in my head as some sort of a theme tune to Dick Hardesty Mysteries as if they have been made into TV-mini-series !  XD( Strange Report is a British detective story made for TV series back in 1968. Well, that's far before my time though...when I listened to it, I simply LOVED it. )As for the sad or nostalgic scenes, I couldn't help but play this Home at Last from Labyrinth [ Movie Soundtrack ] in my head which helped me add more sadness to the already-sad-scenes and forced me to cry more than necessary. Haha...Strangely enough, my version of Dick has been ( and will always be ) Ewan McGregor at 2003 Premiere in Sydney. Blond, bearded, wearing a white shirt, black suit and tie. ( The photo can be easily found as "Ewan McGregor Premiere Down to love in Sydney 2003" - in case you're interested. )Anyway, I do thank you from the bottom of my heart, Dorien Grey-san, for creating such amazing stories and bringing Dick into the world !  :)References:- Opening Theme from Strange Report by ttf2011 on YouTube.- Labyrinth [ Movie Soundtrack ] - Home at Last by Thaimorian on YouTube.

$REVIEW.: First of all, how cool is that cover?Dr. Arthur Bradley has done his homework and it really shows in this novel, the first in a series. A virus, dubbed Superpox-99, has raced across the country, leaving the population decimated. There is little in the way of law and order remaining. U.S. Deputy Marshal Mason Raines happened to be visiting his old cabin stuck way out in the boonies and managed to miss all the excitement. While Raines might not refer to himself as a "prepper," he has all the knowledge and gear one might expect. His cabin is well-stocked and provisioned to last a long time. Raines is, or was, a firearms instructor and is very adept with shooting, a skill he makes use of several times within the story.But, I'm getting ahead of myself.As I mentioned, Raines was on holiday by himself when the collapse occurred. Upon heading for home, he quickly learns something major has happened as he comes across vehicles containing corpses. Raines ends up finding a small degree of solace in a little town struggling against a gang. Along the way, he also makes friends with an Irish Wolfhound and they become partners of a sort, watching out for one another in their journey.Running parallel to the main story is a subplot involving a convicted killer who has been released from prison by a guard he befriended. There is much more to this character than we see at first glance. He rescues a young girl, a very important young girl, and promises to keep her safe.THE SURVIVALIST: FRONTIER JUSTICE grabs your attention at the first page and doesn't let up until you hit the back cover. The action scenes are described in just enough detail that the reader can easily follow them, without becoming massive info dumps describing each weapon down to the serial number and the names of the guys who worked the assembly line the day the weapon was manufactured. Raines is quite believable, with motivations and skills that seem actually human rather than coming across as some sort of superhero. Each of the other primary characters are fleshed out very well, allowing the reader to actually care what happens to them.The dialogue throughout rings very true. Few, if any, long, dramatic "Do it for the Gipper" type speeches.All in all, I very much enjoyed THE SURVIVALIST: FRONTIER JUSTICE and am eagerly awaiting the next in the series. Dr. Bradley writes with a practiced hand, quite unlike much of what passes for "prepper fiction" today. The story was obviously edited very well, so the book is not rife with typos and such. A very welcome change of pace, I can assure you.This book will appeal to all fans of post-apocalyptic fiction as well as those who just want a great, action-oriented tale.

$REVIEW.: I'll start with the downside of this. Science fiction fans will recognize the similarities with David Weber's Honor Harrington series and comparisons are inevitable. I will allow you to form you own opinion. Mine should become clear during this review.First let me speak of the editing of the books in the series i have read. these books were obviously read by human being and not just spellchecked. Further, they did .a very good job, which seems to a rare occurrence in kindle  books, especially if  independently published.Spelling and grammar are excellent. Bravo, Mr. DiPrima!The plots are good and the action is fast.. There seems to me to be less 'technical' information offered than in Mr. Weber's series which pleases me as I am not a big tech fan.Aside from both being female Jen Carver is not a clone of honor Harrington aside from both being military geniuses. Jen Carver has no treecat but in this book has acquired a couple of animal friends.I will not go into plot and characters except to say they are professionally done and enjoyable. It seems to me that Jen Carver is a bit luckier than might be expected but that's just my opinion.If you enjoy military science fiction then I believe you will enjoy this series.

Because they are old, they are free, but, best of all they allow one to take a trip back in time as well as to a foreign location. Plus, most of the world has maintained a since of history and in many cases things written about in these old books are still available to visit today.

$review_text.: So, I was all excited when I saw "No-Bake" and "Refrigerator Cakes". I was thinking that I would be making all kinds of cakes - every day - and eating them straight out of the refrigerator, no cooking involved, won't heat up the house, etc. CAKE. Every DAY. Well, clearly I had a duh moment because 1) 'no baking' is not the same thing as 'no cooking', and 2) how the heck would you get cake with no cooking at all? Actually, there IS cooking involved, just not BAKING involved, just like the title says, and I obviously wasn't payng attention. Not a big deal though, because it's minor, usually just melting chocolate and butter and such, so I need to shut up and stop whining.The recipes themselves look great and though I have not yet tried any of them, they read well, make sense, and there are several things I will be attempting.

$REVIEW.: Essence of Evil is a story that lives up to it's title. Barbara Ann Derksen has tastefully written a story that deals with the difficult subject of pedophilia, a parents nightmare. I became deeply  engrossed with the story and all of the characters. I have not read the first book but was able to read this as a stand alone book. Hope to read the first and third books in the series.Christine Smith witnessed the murder of her parents at the age of five. The killer has never been caught. After receiving a package she wonders if the madman has found her. She investigates the abduction of children and returns them to their parents. Sometimes it is to help them find closure, sometimes a happy reunion.Jeremy Goodman is a detective and business associate of Christine's. He cares for Christine and wants to protect her but she feels she does not need his help and seems to always to be angry with him. Jeremy is a man of faith while Christine struggles to believe that God even exists.Barkley Goodman is Jeremy's father and Christine' lawyer.Love Christine's rescue dog Chief who is also her friend and protector and love how he helps the children when they are found.A suspense and action filled story with heartache and happiness, fears and danger.I am glad I had the opportunity to read this book. Well written with strong characters.I received this book from bookfun.org for my honest opinion and review.Review posted by Donna McGinnis

$review_text.: I loved the concept of Battling Boy: transforming T-shirts? A society where every young person goes off to become a hero? A society haunted by a child-stealing menace? Sign me up! However, this first installment didn't seem to be quite my style. I expected something more along the lines of superheroes, but I ended up with &#34;cute and fairly interesting.&#34;The art is beautiful: big, bright color illustrations, like they used to have in the comics in the newspaper. Battling Boy seems like one of many generic protagonists: an honest, scrub-faced boy eager to please his father and anxious to appear more competent than he perhaps is. I'm mildly curious about the role of the inventor's daughter in Battling Boy's adventures, and the cliff-hanger at the end is intriguing. For fans of action-oriented stories, this could turn out to be exactly what they've been wanting. However, it's a bit too heavy on the sound effects for me, and I'm not quite invested enough to continue. An OK story, but still not quite fantastic.

$review_text.: Let me ask you something: when is the next volume out? This is one of those stories that grab your attention from the get go.  We could say it's about zombies, but also it could be about miracles.  It is a new POV on undead creatures.  Imagine a neighbor returns to the community after dying, what would you do? Sincerely I wouldn't know. After too  many Romero's movies and the seasons of The Walking Dead I have been predisposed to be a zombie exterminating machine in theory.In this comic, people revive and seem normal, just disoriented.  Then they become confuse and aggressive. A task force is created to work these cases, where Dana one of the main characters will see how things unfold on this crisis.  Her sister Martha, will be crucial on this volume and probably will be relevant in future volumes of the story.  This volume has a surprising ending that gave me a glance to some clues about the mysteries that have been presented up to this point in the comic.This comic made a big impression on me. The story is grabbing and certainly challenging in content for the author.  It requires ingenuity to create novelty in the zombie idea.  This author achieved this.  It works an infinitely used idea, people returning from the dead, and a interesting idea is born. What if people return and behave just as they used to before dying? Should we be welcoming? Are they a threat? The story has lots of possibilities, all in the hands of this author. I read this, already thinking about the next volume now because it is that amazing. It has amazing art to match it. Colors are really nice and the drawing style is exiting, never boring.I recommend this comic to all comic readers but also to those who haven't read a comic yet. This is the kind of book that surely will make you a comic reader. Thanks to Image and Netgalley for providing me this for an honest review.

Beginning with a full reproduction of the statement, the author then takes on a systematic examination of each of the statements 19 affirmations and denials. This makes for a handy reference guide for one's personal examination and affirmation of the Doctrine of Scripture. On it's own I'd rate this 4 stars out of 5 if it weren't for the following quote from chapter six:'Discussion of inerrancy is merely an academic exercise unless it concerns the individual Christian on the level of his growth in God...Confession of the full authority and inerrancy of Scripture should lead us to increasing conformity to the image of Christ, which is the God-ordained goal of every Christian.'That statement along bumps my rating of this book up to a full 5 stars based on the following rating scale:+ poor read++ so-so read+++ good read++++ excellent read+++++ life changing read

$REVIEW.: So, I've been meaning to pick up some Theresa Weir for a while now. I eyed her previous NA Come as You Are, but then, given my relative ehh-ness over contemporary NA in general, I kept putting it off. Anyway, when I saw this book, He's Come Undone, on a $.99 introductory price, and I clicked over and read the blurb.SOLD.First off, the premise reads like a romantic comedy. Other people keep comparing it to John Tucker Must Die but I think these pretending-to-be-someone-you're-not stories have deeper roots. You know, Shakespearean roots. There's something very compelling about the idea of falling in love with someone, but not really being able to be the "real" you for whatever reason. To sum up, this is a book about a girl who gets paid by some other girls to break the heart of a guy who slept with and then ignored all of them.I'm going to deal with that premise just a bit at first here. (Okay, saddle up, folks. This review's going to be long. You've been warned.) The first thing that I want to say is that it was just oh soooo nice to start a book and really feel like I was in good hands. It's so rare these days that I pick up a book, especially in the NA romance genre, and it's well plotted. The story starts on page one. So, there's no meandering around describing things and explaining about the main character's boring relationship with her dog or "Hey, this is my gay roommate. Let me tell you how we met and what his favorite color is and why we're besties, even though we all know his only role in the book is going to be popping in and making commentary on the relationship that's going to develop between me and the Hero, who won't be showing up for several more scenes so that you can get to know more boring details about my life." NONE of that. BAM. Story starts. Can I just talk about how much I love that? Jesus, it was like a revelation from heaven.Next, everything went smoothly after that. Which is to say that the story began to work its way through familiar romantic comedy grooves. All the right pieces were there. The meet-cute. The progression of the relationship. The realization that the main character was in over her head because she actually liked the guy.And you know what? If the story had only been that, I would have liked that. It was deftly done, and it was nice to read such a nicely-put-together story, something that progressed and moved forward and hit all the right notes. Sometimes when I'm reading NA books, I feel like the author was sitting at her computer evilly chuckling, "Want to watch them make up and break up twenty more times? No? Too bad. Hahahahahaha!" This book had a PLOT, ladies and gentleman. A plot. I had not realized how deeply I missed them.Okay, but, believe it or not, it gets better. No, I'm not kidding. BETTER. Because, okay, you know that point in a romantic comedy, that point where it starts to stretch your disbelief? Where you're like, "Oh, come on, just tell him that you're only dating him because of a bet. There's no reason to keep this a secret." But in the romantic comedy, the characters just keep wandering around blindly following the set-out plot when it doesn't make any sense exactly?Yeah, okay, well this book doesn't do that. It goes right to that place and then it veers off the path into this wonderful, lush, dark place. Suddenly, all the characters are REAL. Like real in a way that makes you ache. They transcend their cookie-cutter, romantic-comedy stereotypes and become fully flesh and blood with deep pain and real problems and... and it's beautiful. Heck, there were moments in this book where it was almost Salinger-esque. And I'm thinking that was deliberate, because there's a good bit of discussion of Salinger in the book. But the feeling of being young and adrift and confused and yet somehow fiercely alive comes across loud and clear in this book.I don't know. Maybe I had a different college experience than everyone else, but this book is much closer to the way it actually FEELS to be a college student than any other NA romance I've ever read.And the sex scenes... Oh, the sex scenes. They were so great. I loved that they were retold in this gushing voice, the kind of voice you'd use to narrate it back to your girlfriends afterwards-you know what I'm talking about-only a hair more detailed than you'd actually be with your friends. I haven't read sex scenes quite like these maybe ever in my entire life, and they were fantastic.So, um, basically, this is the best book I've read all year. I wish I hadn't waited so long to check out Theresa Weir, because this was... oh man, this was just great.
$SUMMARY.: Best book I've read thus far this year. Simply lovely.

$review_text.: I read this short story as part of the Bend anthology and discovered that I may just like historical romance books.  I was familiar with Shay as an author, but had never read any of her stories until now.  I just may read more.  Honestly, I love history, but reading something so far back as Roman times has never really interested me.  I'll watch a movie or TV, but a story is going to be a hard sell.  But, Shay Savage accomplished quite a bit in such a short span of time to get my attention and to find the worth of a slave girl and a Roman god that has been injured while fighting.  It was written quite lovely and I liked the flow of it.  I've heard she writes a mean sex scene, but that wasn't really included in here.  Just a bit to leave you wanting more.  Still, good development with the characters, but was just a taste.

$review_text.: I have no idea how to begin; I am sitting here staring at my computer screen, trying to come up with the words for this review.  I love to read. I can handle pretty much any book with any concept: abuse, rape, M/M, m&eacute;nage. You name it, I have read it. I particularly like dark reads every now and then. I have two favorites from authors CJ Roberts and Aleatha Romig that are extremely popular. I love books that have ultimate mind melts. (I want to say a different word--rhymes with duck, suck...words like that--but Amazon has a problem with foul language, so please as you&#8217;re reading this feel free to insert the correct word.)I think it might have been hours before I actually took a breath while reading Tears of Tess. I loved the book and I hate that I love the book; it&#8217;s not really a story or character that you should love but I do. It is dark and twisted beyond words and I ate up every second of it. I could not put it down; I was entranced the entire time and as hard as some of the scenes are to read I could not look away and many times I really wanted to look away. This book may be the one that has broken me, some of it was too much for me to handle. It tore me to shreds inside. Now you are probably asking why it did this to me. I do not have a great answer for that except to say maybe it is that I just do not understand. I have never read a book with BDSM quality to it that goes to this extreme.  I would imagine that there are people that delve into this extreme and &#8220;to each his own&#8221;, I say. I do not want to confuse people, yes this book contains BDSM and some of it is consensual or verges on consensual. Other parts are not and what is done to women that have been sold is torture and rape.That right there shows what an amazing author Pepper Winters is--true, raw, natural talent. The author writes Tess as a fighter; she is a survivor and fought and coped in whatever way she needed to in order to survive. Q is her new Master. She was given to him as a gift and watching her fight him and be drawn to him at the same time should not even make sense. You wanted her to get away from him, but you wanted them together at the same time. I hated myself for feeling that way. Q is a mystery though and one I did not figure out until the end when Tess figures it all out.  The revelation blew my mind! I always figure it out and this time I was so entranced, the answers passed me by. Q is definitely not what he seems.The magnitude of this relationship once the cards are laid out on the table is brutally honest and brutally beautiful in a way that seems wrong but is right for them.  I am asking myself if I fell for Q in the book. By the end I did fall for him, but I also see him as he sees himself--a monster and in turn I would then have to say that Tess is a monster too. Maybe I am wrong for believing they are monsters since I truly can&#8217;t understand where they are coming from; I can&#8217;t grasp the things that they want and so desperately need from each other. Maybe it is not fair of me to say, all I know it is how the book made me feel. I am just trying to be honest with the readers as well as myself. The most honest I can be to my readers here is that this book frightened me. I am scared to read book 2 Quintessentially Q but I will and I it is going to happen soon. I also know that there is a third book and I will read that too. I have really opened myself raw to anyone that reads this review, probably opened myself up more than I ever have before. I feel very emotional letting these feelings out for all of you to read.I stand in ovation to Pepper Winters for her creativity and for being able to make me feel so intensely about a book. I know it is for entertainment purposes but it is her skill as a storyteller that brought the story to life.

$review_text.: Article first published as Book Review:Adam Orser (Chronicles of Evolution) by Daniel Armand on BlogcriticsIn Adam Orser (Chronicles of Evolution) by Daniel Armand, we are in store for a highly challenging look at a new plan put in place by the Cosmos. When a young 9-year old girl is abducted the country goes on an all-out hunt to find her before the worst happens. Time is ticking and her chances of survival diminish as the days drag on. A young Rookie detective, Louis Collins stands ready for the challenge of finding her. Can he do what others with more background have been unable to do, find a reason for her abduction and a location of where she is being kept before it is too late?Adam Orser is just an ordinary young man with a great outlook and in love with Jazmin. He is steady and gifted and working in a field he loves. Ready to make Jazmin his wife, he realizes that not only is she everything he has ever wanted but that her young daughter Carly also holds his heart, she is very like his own, and only ads icing to the decision. Ready to pop the question, he is distracted and decides it will wait. Heading to work he is injured in a car wreck, putting him in a coma, barely clinging to life. Can he find the will to survive?Adam is the unknowing hero and has already come far along on his path to enlightenment. It is only during his coma that his past life regression is allowed to be remembered. With his deceased father as his guide he begins to receive training to help him get ready to help the army win a new battle in the never ending war. The elders have broken tradition in an effort to challenge a deadly evil, they only take their warriors from the deceased yet Adam is not dead. They have chosen to pull one from the living to help them in this time and this journey.Jazmin is on the outside praying for Adam's safe return. Gathering his mother to her fold of friends, she finds she is in danger in a way she does not understand. Meeting an old flame, unaware of Adams true feeling, she finds herself fighting her own battle for her feelings. Will she remember what it is that Adam means to her? Will he be able to return to her from his coma and his own secret quest in order to help her realize the truth of love?Armand has given us a smorgasbord of happenings that stretch the imagination. The development of his stasis for Adam's true meaning is very in-depth and thought provoking. The revolving of Adams soul, as he transgresses into another realm is deep and meaningful. He is allowed to remember his past and his present in an effort to challenge the status quo. He is needed in this world to challenge an evil that has transcended its own journey and broken its own bonds. There is evil loose in the world that is beyond the reach of the usual warriors. Adam is their chance to make things right.The circle of hope rests in Adam Orser, Jazmin and Louis Collins and as we learn more about their characters, Armand begins the delicate touch of weaving the strands through the different lives that begin to tie them together in a way that seems effortless. Initially there is confusion as to what each player brings to the whole, yet as the stories meld together they create a continuation which adds a solemn and unique twist to this work.If you enjoy karma and angels, you will enjoy this work. There is suspense, danger and death, which give it a darker feel than many of the works along this genre. If you are a fan of the paranormal and enjoy a good mystery, this will fill the void. Daniel Armand has given us much to think about.

$review_text.: This book is not meant to be a literary masterpiece. NO erotica is really. That being said, this one is actually pretty good for being what it is. The story is interesting. A type I personally haven't run across before, at least not quite like this.Earth is under attack by the evil Scourge and it's up to the Kindred aliens to protect it. But these aren't your average aliens. These come in the form of hot hulking men, three types to be exact, each being described by their physical appearances and, um, bedroom abilities, if you will. The only catch for our protection is that they get to 'claim' women from Earth to be their brides.It starts off pretty straight forward. The writing is pretty good and engaging, the characters for the most part likeable, and the bedroom scenes were nice and steamy. But I found that the author spent too much time inside the characters' heads, mostly Liv's. Which would be fine if it was more entertaining or new information, but most of the time it just seemed redundant and obvious. And annoying. It really made me dislike the main character after awhile. Especially the sister. Which we get the pleasure of going inside HER head as well, ugh... One of the main things that drove me crazy was Liv's reasons not to 'bond' with her oh-so-perfect alien hunk. The rarely seeing your family thing would suck, but who really WANTS to see their family more than twice a year anyways? They must have a more functional one than mine. But I digress... The thing that really bothered me was how she didn't want to give up her nursing career. Nursing really isn't a dream career, and if I had the choice to quit and travel the cosmos with a dreamy guy that only thinks of my pleasure, you know which one I'd take.It's mostly set on-board a spaceship orbiting Earth. It's here that the author gets really creative, and a little weird... For such an advanced civilization, I found it really bizarre that they relied on animals to do a lot of their, chores is the word I guess I'm looking for here. For instance, they have an animal that lives in the cupboard of their kitchen and feeds off waste disposal scraps. Kind of like a space age Flinstones.Despite the silliness, it was easy to get into, minus the predictable and kind of sudden climax, (of the story, not hers...). It's left open for sequels, but seeing as how it stars the annoying twin, I might think twice before reading it.

In a way this book allowed me to be more appreciative and grateful for the life I do have. No matter our physical, financial or spiritual dramas we go through, somewhere someone else has it even worse.The journey Wallace went through from a young age is remarkable. Many people use those traumas and play the victim, but Wallace was stronger than that and changed his life for the better.This isn't one of those books that you read once, ride the emotional high, and put it next to the other dust-collecting books. It is one of those books that you will read over and over again, and every time you do, the same emotions will rush through your body.

$review_text.: This is a very strange subject.  It seems to be a case where technology, government secrecy, and the occult all sort of merge together in sinister ways.There are many interesting facts about the Roswell incident in this book and this information alone for me gives the book 5 stars.  It was very interesting for example how when they took the dead creatures to the Roswell base they had to turn off the air conditioning to prevent the horrible smell from spreading around.  This is indicating that this was a real event.Unlike the authors I don't however view this as a scientific issue.  I feel people see this event from the perspective of the way human society is today.  This causes them to have preconceived ideas about what an alien spacecraft and its occupants might be like.  The Roswell event matches those preconceived ideas which is probably an indication that this event, although real, is not what people believe it to be.The premise of the book is if flying saucers are real then people should expect that they crash sometimes.  Rather to me the exact opposite is true.  If these are extra terrestrial spacecraft the expectation is they would never crash.  They would be so far advanced from Earth technology that we would only see them when they want to be seen and they could not be shot down.According to the story the spacecraft began to explode so the occupants 'ejected' from it using escape pods but they ended up dying anyway.  I guess some people might think this makes sense but to me it doesn't.  Even if they were ejected from the vehicle why didn't any of their counterparts come and get them ?  They just left them there to rot in the desert ?The authors themselves now realize that the statements made by Gerald Anderson are not true although this information provided a lot of the framework for the first edition of the book and thus could not easily be removed from this edition.  The fact that the authors believed Anderson's statements that one of the creatures was alive and was trying to help one of its friends with a first aid kit shows how gullible the authors are and how difficult it is for them to view this event independently from the way human society is today.These things are I believe part of the Satanic empire in the universe.  They are manifestations of Satanic forces and imperfect imitations of life forms that exist on other planets.  As such they crash.Still the authors should be given credit for standing up for the truth and risking criticism and possible danger from the government spooks.There's a very sad aspect to all of this.A guy in Canada said the subject of UFOs was given a higher security classification in America than the hydrogen bomb project.  This put the lives of people who knew about it in danger if they refused to cooperate with the government spooks.The nurse at Roswell who had seen the dead creatures and told people about it disappeared mysteriously.  It's sad to think they would kill someone who was serving their country for something that is probably not really that important.Kenneth Arnold, the person who created the term 'flying saucer', was also apparently in the cross hairs of the government killers at one time although he wasn't murdered for some reason.Two people who were involved at a higher level, James Forrestal and Dr. James McDonald, were either murdered or driven to commit suicide by the CIA some believe.  Forrestal was a member of the Majestic 12 group and McDonald was an outspoken critic of the Air Force's secrecy and lies.There's an episode of the TV show UFO Files called "Mexico's Roswell" where a flying saucer crashed in Mexico.  The first people to arrive on the scene were some Mexican soldiers but a mysterious American team arrived soon after.  By the time the Mexican authorities got there all of the Mexican soldiers were dead and their bodies were being burned and the flying saucer had been loaded on a plane ready to be taken away.  The Americans were dressed in biological warfare suits and said the Mexicans had been killed by an alien virus.  However a much more likely scenario is the Americans murdered the Mexican soldiers so they could take the flying saucer.This gets into the idea that since the Roswell case special teams have been set up to respond quickly to these types of events and the U.S. is constantly monitoring the skies to detect and capture any more saucers if they crash.During the Roswell event people came so close to blowing the lid off all of this.  Mac Brazel's son had kept a few pieces of the debris and casually saved it in a cigar box.  He made the mistake of mentioning this in a bar where the government spooks were hanging out spying on everyone.  They paid him a visit and confiscated the material after making him an offer he could not refuse.There were other cases where if things had just happened a little differently this situation may have turned out differently as far as how much the public found out.  If only someone would have just stashed a few pieces of the wreckage somewhere for all of these years.The Majestic 12 documents include an attachment about what to do if one of these things crashes in a location where it cannot be kept from the public.  These documents are another interesting twist on this case and appear to validate the information contained in this book.  The world can only hope that whoever provided these documents to the UFO community has more of them such as the various attachments and who knows what else.The U.S. government is definitely the bad guy and the enemy in this story.Ufo...Contact from Planet IargaSecret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of Ufo AbductionsThe Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and FutureFulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient EgyptTop Secret/Majic: Operation Majestic-12 and the United States Government's UFO Cover-upUFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Coverup, 1941-1973The Philadelphia Experiment: Invisibility Time Travel and Mind Control - The Shocking TruthThe Hunt for Zero Point:  Inside the Classified World of Antigravity TechnologyOccult Ether Physics:: Tesla's "Ideal Flying Machine" and the Conspiracy to Conceal It

$REVIEW.: As someone who is very interested in World War 2 and reads and watches anything that pertains to it this was a given. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The dichotomy of the people in Berlin in those days was fascinating; the Flying Court Marshall squads and the ordinary citizens who had born the brunt of Hitler's "Total War" is mind-blowing.  I became really invested in the day to day activities of Karl and Harold and the G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung like events happening all around them.A small cynical part of me wonders if perhaps Karl wasn't "cleaned up" a bit, children of his age were fed Nazi ideology with their Mothers milk, but that did not stop me from enjoying it and eagerly awaiting the next the next book "Trust to a Degree" I give it 4 1/2 stars, the only way it could have been better was if there had been footnotes or something to explain some of the German terms. I highly recommend this to anyone; you don't need to be a history buff to enjoy this book.

The characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional. There is a surprise around every corner, and so many suspense-filled moments that it is impossible to put the book down. Don't start this book if you don't have the time to give it your full attention right up to the end. Many similar stories of former special forces people and country-threatening conspiracies are out there, but this one makes all the others look like pale imitations. It is well worth a read or two.

It is truly an epic work and I feel blessed to have stumbled upon this fine work. I was particularly drawn to his warm and engaging portrayal of PM Menachem Begin who is vividly alive in this book. All in all, just a brilliant and enthralling work.

The spiritual insight and growth in her journey was rich and believable.Their were meaningful, loving relationships shown here, from Grace's loyal and caring assistant Samantha to Estelle who opened her arms and home to Grace.The plot was so real and very heart warming. The ending was hopeful and inspiring yet it left room for a sequel.This book left me knowing that I want to read more of this authors work because I loved Grounded so much. I look forward to the sequels!Thank you so much to Worthy Publishing for sending me this book!

$REVIEW.: This is one of the best sewing books! I'm fascinated by the classic Chanel jacket because of it's iconic status and exquisite craftsmanship. I'm not one for designer labels, but I want a similar jacket for the quality. As a home sewer, it's one of those garments that done well, will be a source of pride for years to come. This book will help you get there.Three cheers for a book dedicated to the subject. I was wondering why this hadn't happened before. However, it is worth the wait! I love getting a sneak peak into Shaeffer's personal collection. The garment index makes interesting reading.On to the making of the jacket. Shaeffer starts at the beginning -- with suggested fabrics and a good pattern. Of course there is a section on the famous trims. There's a detailed resources section in the back of the book; you'll know where to go for what.The book assumes you can manage diagnosing and correcting any fit issues on your own. You'll do this with a toile. In terms of construction, this book breaks down a very daunting process into digestible chunks starting with the quilting. This is still advanced stuff and obviously includes tailoring. Please bone up on your hand stitches.  There are chapters on buttonholes, the three-piece sleeve, edge finishing, hand-set sleeves, patch pockets and finishing.Perhaps my favorite chapter is "What Makes Chanel's Cardigan Jacket Different." I love it for the historical perspective. It helps ground you as you think about what you want your finished jacket to look like.In the DVD, you're walked through each step of the construction process. The DVD and the book can stand alone as complete instructional tools. Together, they are awesome. I will say that based on the reviews, I'd decided not to purchaseCouture Sewing: Tailoring Techniques. After watching the DVD that accompanies this book, I will purchase Couture Sewing:  Tailoring Techniques for the DVD. If the DVD instruction is as good as it is on this DVD, it's worth the purchase.If you want to make your own Chanel-style cardigan jacket, this book is a must. As other reviewers have mentioned, the techniques here are specific to construction a Chanel-style jacket, but they will help make you a better sewer as you apply them to other projects. This is a great addition to any sewing library.
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic!

$review_text.: This was my first book on robots


Prior to this book I had only a cursory interest on the topic


But after diving into these pages my interest in the subject magnified


The first third of this book was the most interesting for me

The book opens with a rich history of robots in Japan; highlighting their use in festivals, their functions as tea-serving dolls and social machines was what sparked my interest the greatest

Western films seem to always depict a friction between man and machine, where as with this book we see that Japan had a very inclusive view of automatons

From there, the book travels into the not so distant past of popular culture where Robots are faithful companions to humans and even our saviors

There's a terrific section on "The Mighty Atom" where we begin to see the idea of the robot with a soul -- or perhaps the robot in search of a soul
The book, of course, takes us into the present where Japan continues to make startling advancements in robo-technology, creating life-like and life-size near androids that, from afar, appear deceptively human.As a fan of films of Oshii and Myazaki, this movie also helped me to understand some of the nuances of their films


Both of these film makers do an incredible job of weaving their past culture with storylines that are relevant to the present
The fusion enriches their works and sparks the curiosity of a Westerner like myself


I can thank this book for giving me more insight on their works


I can also thank this book for inspiring me to blow hundreds of more dollars on other robot related books


The next step will be to blow a few grand on a robot of my own.

$review_text.: You can blame the pretty amateurish writing on the translation but who takes responsibility for the plot? And the love interest between the inspector and the beautiful DA? Totally unbelievable. Here you have an inspector who is supposedly tongue tied in front of women but after the initial award phase is not only able to bed her but even goes to the extent of kissing her in front of his superiors and peers. Surprised that he wasn't brought up on charges unbecoming work place behavior.The plot is equally unbelievable. The only thing more unbelievable? The way the inspector comes up with the solution. No clues - just intuition! Only reason for my stars was that it took place in Bruges. Would have like more about the city but even there we got shortchanged.And this is supposed to be an international bestseller? A million copies sold!?  Oh well.My saving grace is that I did not buy but borrowed from my library. I would suggest you do the same. Or just skip entirely. No great loss.

$review_text.: I was given an ARC of &iexcl;Frontline&iexcl; in exchange for an honest review.So, let&iexcl;s run it down:  Sexual tension:  check


 Intrigue:  check


 Sexy, alpha male lead character who doesn&iexcl;t take no for an answer:  double-check!  Romance:  check


 Danger:  check


 Wait, what?  Danger?  Oh, ya!  If you are looking for a relaxing romance novel, this isn&iexcl;t it


 &iexcl;Frontline&iexcl; had my heart pounding and pages turning from Chapter 1


 I lost two nights&iexcl; sleep and got to work late two days in a row because of this book!  Make room, book boyfriends, Trenton Merrick has arrived!  What can I say about Trenton Merrick, the sexy celebrity sports-car-for-every-day-of-the-week billionaire?  Oh, there are your undeniably impressive limos, Porches, Ferraris, Aston Martins&iexcl;K  But when Trenton pulls up in a Bugatti Veyron, he completely ups the game!  The Bugatti is sex on wheels, and Trenton Merrick is sex behind the wheel!  This is one dominant man who knows what he wants, and what he wants is Sara Peters.Sara Peters has recently moved from San Francisco to New York City to pursue her dream of working as a triage nurse on the frontline of Manhattan General Hospital

 And she&iexcl;s doing that quite peacefully, thank you very much, until the night Trenton Merrick walks into her ER


 I liked Sara immediately


 She&iexcl;s beautiful, but she doesn&iexcl;t use it to gain advantage

 She&iexcl;s smart, but she also knows how to pick her battles

 She&iexcl;s passionate and compassionate, and has a genuine care for people
 What Sara is not is easily intimidated or impressed by arrogant billionaires who are offered preferential medical treatment based on financial status
 And&iexcl;K Sara is nobody&iexcl;s fool
 Trenton&iexcl;s story about how he sustained the injury that brought him to the emergency room seems suspicious, and despite the crackle between them, and the passionate exchange in the small, private examination room, Sara is hesitant to accept an offer from Trenton for dinner the following evening at his Connecticut mansion.When Trenton&iexcl;s mansion reminds her more of something out of a gothic novel, Sara&iexcl;s suspicions escalate

 Cue the creepy music, because before their evening is over, Trenton unexplainably disappears, and Sara is left to be escorted home by one of his men

 Despite all the warning signs that should have Sara running in the opposite direction, there&iexcl;s that attraction

 That damn attraction


 That undeniable, irresistible, damn Trenton Merrick attraction.In addition to Trenton and Sara, Author Alexandra Richland also gives us the irrepressible Kelly and incorrigible Denim, Sara&iexcl;s friends, confidants, and biggest supporters


 Trenton is not lacking in the friends department either with Sean and Christopher &iexcl;V &iexcl;brothers&iexcl; since grade school


 Much to Trenton&iexcl;s chagrin, when Sean and Christopher meet Kelly and Denim &iexcl;V well, meet is probably too strong a term really &iexcl;V maybe &iexcl;encounter&iexcl; is more accurate &iexcl;V the results are fun and flirtatious, and even had me giggling a bit

 There&iexcl;s a sequel to &iexcl;Frontline&iexcl; in the works, and I&iexcl;m hoping to have not only more of Trenton and Sara, but of Kelly and Sean and Christopher and Denim too.Frontline is full of suspicion and suspense, along with a healthy dose of sexual tension and romance
 It is one terrific ride


 It&iexcl;s not a Bucatti, but it is a page-turning, breath-holding, ride from beginning to end.Four **** page-turning stars!

$review_text.: The author used an interesting hook to pull me into the book.  He started off in third person point of view, but switched to first when it came to the main character Ash Levine.  I didn't find the transition lost me at all, but it actually made me curious about Levine.It starts out with a murdered cop and them wanting to pull Levine back into active duty.  The reason for Levine's being an ex-cop in the first place involves a back story which becomes meaningful in the course of the novel and actually helps define the main character and his motivations.For me, one thing that stood out was the number of references to race.  I understand this can factor in when trying to ID suspects, etc, but it seemed liked there was fair mention as to skin color and race.  However, in defense of the author in this case, Levine's Jewish background (and the murder and persecution of his family members) sullied his vision of the world around him.  Don't take this as he's a bigot, but know there is mention and distinction when it comes to different nationalities.  There is also mention of his Jewish background being a point of mockery used by one of the other detectives in his unit.  I found it hard to believe something as direct would be tolerated within the police department.Another nit is the main character seemed to eat a lot, and it was different food..none of which awakened my appetite, therefore failing to instill my sense of smell in the various scenes.However, with all of this said, I did enjoy the book.  There were two cases that were solved making it a multi-tiered novel, which I liked.Corwin built a strong main character and was the pacing pulled you forward.  The author was also very good at dialogue--especially when it came to attributing inflection and speech suited to the character.

$review_text.: This is a very quick book that most people could read in less than an hour.  In the beginning I thought the main character was going to become involved with someone and it turned out differently than I expected which was a nice surprise.  Because it's a novella I think the story line wasn't as developed as it could have been.  I didn't really believe that someone that was just finishing up her law degree would be rash enough to jump into having a baby right away without thinking things through in detail.  I understand the premise of the clock ticking, but I just think this was at odds with the smart caring woman the main character was.  I also think that being artificially inseminated is a very detailed process and very expensive so it just seemed unrealistic to just snap your finger and expect to be pregnant.  If you can set reality aside, the book did leave you with a nice happy fairy tale ending.

$review_text.: What was it like to be an artist thousands of years ago?  What if that artist was a slave?  How did people in another land--a land full of other gods and religions--find their way to God, and why?The stories in the Bible are set in a time and place that I can't always relate to, which has sometimes kept me from "living" the story as I read it.  However, Biblical characters that come to life through a novel give me a kinship with these far away people, and bring the spiritual truths of scripture alive for me.This book attracted me because it delves into the life and heart of Bezalel, an artist, a creative carver and goldsmith.  I read it because I believed that it would give me a new perspective on how others take what is in their heart and shape it into a creative, visible form for the benefit of others.  Destiny's Hands gave me that perspective even more than I expected.The author demonstrates her own creative talents by imagining Bezalel's desire to succeed in his craft and his developing faith as he sees the power of God with his very eyes.  It was fascinating to see him sort out his beliefs from those of his family, in contrast to those of his co-workers and his community, and to find an authentically personal communion with the living God.Just the right amount of description and scene put me into the story setting without making me restless to get back to the exciting plot.  I loved learning about life in Old Testament Egypt and in the desert, and it felt so real, I was confident that the author had done a lot of research.  I liked that the dialogue was easy to read with the natural conversations we would have today, yet there were times where some dialogue bumped me out of that particular world, as I would have a hard time imagining someone from that time using some of our contemporary expressions.Destiny's Hands was suspenseful; it kept me turning the pages past my bedtime and I finished it in two days.  (I wish I'd rationed myself, to prolong the joy!)  It delved into a romantic relationship, showed us the history and customs of that time and place, and made us feel the intense struggles and emotions of the main character.  I've heard and read so often that a reader needs to empathize with a character, and this writer has skilfully enabled us to feel what he feels, at one place bringing me to tears.I highly recommend Violet Nesdoly's Destiny's Hands.  It is a perfect example of why I read fiction.  I was inspired by this account of a true story, I was challenged and strengthened in my own faith, and on top of all that, enjoyed being immersed in a different world.  I can only hope that the author is hard at work on another book!

$REVIEW.: Call me Ishmael
One of the most famous opening lines in all of English literature

I was thrilled to find this audio edition of a lengthy classic that I, like many Americans, doggedly plowed through in high school, when I was certainly much too young to appreciate its depth and meaning
Having recently completed Ahab's Wife, my interest in Ahab and what his choices brought about for him, was piqued, and I decided to take another look

This audio version is perfect for someone like me - I know I would not have persevered in reading this on my own.This version has kindled an understanding and admiration for Moby Dick as adventure story, allegory, and journey of self-discovery
It was surprising how much I learned, simply in the factual sense, about the whaling industry in New England, where I was born and raised and still reside today
This is a book that is probably ruined by the introduction of it during adolescence, when it has little to say to the very young reader

Like Nathaniel Hawthorne, Melville is an author who speaks to the reader who has grappled with the universal questions about life and death, sanity and madness, revenge and forgiveness


Not to mention multiculturalism, racism and tolerance

And, a new word - moby - was coined and entered into the English language.Intelligently narrated by William Hootkins, the audio version has a lot to recommend it and is a pleasant way to revisit an important American masterpiece

Take another look (or listen!)

$REVIEW.: I love a good office romance. The excitement of the this could mean the end of someone's career if the relationship fails, or what if one of them wants a deal but the other does two and it comes down to the relationship or the deal?Guaranteed excitement! In the new J.K Coi read we get to know Elizabeth Calson and Ben Harrison. They use to be friends, coworkers and ALMOST lovers. But this all happened before Ben suggested they mix business with pleasure which sent Elizabeth running for the hills, because there is no way she wants to lose her heart to a hotter than hot hotshot tycoon who lives for his take no prisoners attitude,  and then there is the fact that she wants to start her own company. So the entire business - pleasure thing is not for her and she walks away before it gets too hard.But Ben with his take no prisoners attitude makes sure he always succeeds in getting everything he wants , and he wants Elizabeth, but before he could have her she walked away, sparking an all out rivalry war!Whist competing for the same contract they both end up at a Caribbean conference and the attraction is too hot to handle. Ben still has his sights firmly set on finishing what they started but Elizabeth is still set on not losing her heart, her clothes and a few other inhibitions sure, but not her heart, no way! The question that remains is of course, can Ben make her see a business - pleasure relationship has nothing to do with him loving her more than life itself?I really liked this read, most office romance reads have the same flow of events. The couple meet at work or through an office event, get down and dirty with each other and then pop, it becomes some kind of mess and the atmosphere in the office is downright uncomfortable.But in this read it was a fun new twist with both main characters having their own companies and going up against each other, okay so they get into each other too, but that of course just made it more exciting. I loved the I want you, you want me but this will cause an issue vibe it made for some very entertaining reading.I adored the character of Ben, loved his go get 'em attitude. It made him sexier than Ryan Gosling stripped naked! Elizabeth was a bit of a frustrating character at first, simply because I could not wrap my mind around her being so extremely determined to no fall for Ben. But after a while I tried placing myself in her shoes and I realized that when you put your heart and soul into anything or a as Elizabeth a company then it is never an easy decision to make when it comes to risking it on something that could have you lose it all.I am taking away a message of life is filled with risks, some work out and other don't. But when it comes to risk taking you need to find that perfect balance between wanting it all and knowing you need it all. If you only want the glory that goes with success then go for it, but remember that all the glory of success will not bring you happiness when you find yourself alone with stacks of money and no love. If you know you need it all, then find a way to balance the success and love because somewhere in between you are going to find the right balance allowing you to have the best of both worlds.I recommend this read for all fans of good, passionate, entertaining, fun and sexy romance reads.4.5 star review&#34; All is fair in love and war, right ?&#34;** Copy provided in exchange for a honest review

$review_text.: Til Death by the wonderful Kate Evangelista is the first book in a promising new YA series.  Magic, ancient warriors, special powers, evil villains and romance all combine to set the stage for this story.  Although there are some issues with the story, I think this is a solid beginning and will be looking forward to upcoming books in this series.Selena Fallon appears to be a normal, high school aged girl.  She lives in a very small town in Wyoming and has lived with a secret for her entire life.  The only people who know about her secret are her best friends, Kyle and Penny.  Although she has dealt with this secret for some time, her experiences with it seem to be increasing.  I like that Selena is basically a normal girl in the beginning of this book.  She is trying to find a job to make money for college, hanging out with her friends, studying, and she has just broken up with a handsome jock.  Her troubles begin while trying to deal with her ex-boyfriend who still wants her.In walks Dillan Sloan.  &#34;Mr. Rock-and-Roll-National-Geographic.&#34;  Dillan is arrogant and rude when we first meet him.  He is also powerful and intelligent.  His chiseled good looks draw the attention of everyone in his high school, but Dillan has no use for any of them.  That is until he meets and shakes hands with Selena.  I liked Dillon's arrogance, but I'm always a sucker for that type of character.  You can tell that underneath his tough facade that he's just trying to find his way in his new world and to make the right decisions.  Sure, he's a jerk, but an extremely redeemable jerk.  Dillan is dealing with his own demons and with some funky things that are happening in the small Wyoming town.Dillan becomes more and more fascinated with Selena, mostly because of the charge he feels when he is around her.  While working on a school project, Selena comes into contact with some really bad supernaturals.  Dillan becomes more amazed when Selena is able to handle herself and with each passing day, he becomes more and more affectionate towards Selena.  Selena is often confused by Dillan's actions and his words, but she would be kidding herself if she said she didn't find him interesting.  As they spend more time together, and learn more about one another's backgrounds, they come closer and closer together.  One thing I loved about Dillan is his absolute absence of anxiety with Selena.  He may be nervous about the evil he chases, but when it comes to Selena and his feelings towards her, he makes no apologies.One thing that I didn't like about this book was the way it was told.  Kate Evangelista is a fantastic writer.  I've always enjoyed her writing style.  This book, however, fell a little flat for me.  It is told in dual points of view, which would normally not be a problem for me.  Selena's chapters are told in the first person, yet Dillan's chapters are told in the third person.  I would have enjoyed this much more if both points of view were told in the first person.  I applaud Kate for taking this risk, but it was difficult for me to jump back in forth.  There were instances in Dillan's chapters where the book would read, &#34;He said .....&#34;  &#34;He did ....&#34;  A few times I had to reread to make sure whom the &#34;he&#34; was; Dillan or another male that he was interacting with.As much as I enjoy Evangelista's writing style, I thought the plotting of this book, especially in the beginning, was a bit slow.  We meet and begin to understand the characters of Selena and Dillan, but I think there was a bit too much of that.  This book dragged for me for about the first third, but it definitely picked up after that.I think this is a good start to a new series.  It has an interesting premise and characters that I genuinely like.  I will be looking forward to the next book in this series to see how Evangelista expands this world and uses her characters.

I liked Al and Dailey; they played off each other well. Al's family and Dailey's friends/players really entertained throughout this novella.However, even though this was a novella I think the end of it just wrapped up to quickly for my liking. I just wish for a little bit more. Yet I did like the "epilogue." =0)I recommend this to anyone looking for a fast-paced contemporary romance novella.Review By: From Me to You ...

The action never stops, while I was in another type of law enforcement, I can still relate, but not as well as Mike since he was in the action all the time and knows just how to relate that on paper to keep you glued to the seat and the book in your hand.You will hear yourself gasping and yelling "look out" so many times as you turn page by page through this outstanding police novel.  Prepare to be transfixed to the written word as you won't be able to put it down not even for dinner. My wife found this out last night when I failed to show up for dinner.McNeff has claimed another believer in his Robin Marlette novels, who can't wait to find the next installment.

$REVIEW.: ARC kindly provided by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review. This review is spoiler-free.Screen star Liam Warren needs to do a "re-shoot" of the most important role he ever played...husband to Katy.  How does Liam feel about it all? Disconnected (book #2) by Bethany Daniel is the retelling of Liam and Katy's relationship from Liam's point of view.  Liam got caught up in all the trappings of being a Hollywood "it" boy causing him to lose his wife. Four years later after searching for Katy he runs into her while filming a movie in Georgia. Their relationship gets a "re-write" Hollywood style.I really liked getting into Liam's head and learning his feelings and thoughts.  There were so many obstacles getting in the way of their relationship -- psycho bitch co-star, paparazzi, fans and a controlling movie company etc . Although the story felt very rushed, this second chance romance unraveled pretty smoothly.Disconnected didn't feel like a regurgitated version of book one. This book can definitely be read as a stand-alone. I recommend reading the first book to get the full picture...but it's not necessary.  I have to say I enjoyed Disconnected more than book one - Liam got to me :).  If you love celebrity/Hollywood romances - this book (and series) is for you.  Three and half Hollywood stars!!!This review appears on [...] [...] Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter.

$REVIEW.: While on a Recon mission to rescue the daughter of a U.S. Senator deep in the bowls of Columbia, Jesse Evan's informant is murdered in what she comes to realize is an ambush, meaning the mission and the team sent to rescue the girl has been compromised. When she tries to notify her superior, everything goes horribly wrong. Now she finds herself on the other side of the law, branded a sell out, a traitor and a risk to National Security. Somehow she manages to make it back to the States where she vows to bring the real traitor, Green Leader Robert Langdon, down. That may sound like a good idea, but it's a difficult task when you're alone and can trust no one. Then help arrives in the form of a handsome Texan named Cole. But is he who he really says he is?This was one action-packed read, and I loved every second of it. I only put it down once because something known as sleep got in the way of finishing it off in one sitting. From beginning to end, the pages are filled with action, conspiracy, lust, deceit, a drug lord and bullets flying all over the place. Jesse Evans is literally a kick a** heroine. She's Emma Peel, Evelyn Salt and a little bit of James Bond rolled up in one. In full mission mode, she can keep up with any alpha male, but on the inside she tends to let her emotions rule her and her actions. Her only family left is her autistic sister, Amanda, and she will go to any length to keep her safe. Aside from being tired of being and feeling alone, Amanda is probably Jesse's only weakness.Cole is one of the wildcards in this story. He was Green Team Leader, and he's the lone survivor of the Green Team massacre. He saves Jesse's butt a few times, but is it sincere or just a ploy to gain her trust? Throughout the entire story I went back and forth on that question about as often as Jesse did, and seeing as the entire story is told from her perspective we can only build a picture of the players as she finds them out for herself. Talk about nerve-wracking.Jesse and Cole have instant chemistry that is only hindered by Jesse's distrust and Cole's attempts to make her trust him even when his actions and words appear shady. That still doesn't stop them from heating up the pages whenever they're in close proximity. However this book contains more suspense than romance. The sexual tension lasts well past three quarters of the story before the inevitable happens, and it's one time only. As for the plot, you don't get the big picture until the very end, but the journey there was worth every page.A couple spelling/grammar mistakes, but nothing that really interrupted the flow of the story, so I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: I usually don't write reviews and even more rarely write bad ones but buyers need to beware of this book.  I got through the first couple of chapters and stopped.  I can not relate to a character who chooses to stay in a abusive situation!  If I had a friend in a situation like this I would not let this continue.  So there are actually three characters in the book that I can relate too.  Friends do not leave their friends in life threatening situations.  I probably would have been okay if the main character was out of the abusive situation and struggling to live her life but I can not read about someone who stays in that situation.  I have personal knowledge of these kind situations so I speak from a place of knowledge not just off the cuff.  If you can get past this....then its probably good read.

It presents Wendy's strategies and what to look for to make a decision to pull the trigger or not.The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is that the charts would have been better in color than black and white, and what she describes in her writing could have used some chart annotations as to which candle she is referring to.  Maybe it's me, I always like to see the chart on the same page which it is being described instead of flipping pages.  Otherwise, a must read for any wannabe option trading.

$review_text.: I love Julia dearly why because I always get to beta read her books and she spoils me rotten (winks.) On to the review!! My Rourk, my Rourky ugh I love him, he's still as playful as he was when he and Keegan were first dating, "be sure to breathe between bites

I'm not sure how I would explain to my team sergeant that I didn't make my flight because of a trip to the emergency room." He still has his hotness, "with a grin on his face, Rourk tossed his shirt off and joined Keegan under the covers." So I had some weird vibes before reading this book because I love Keegan just as much as I love Rourky, and I thought we would get a book about Rourk and what he does when he goes bye-bye but that's not the case we get BOTH point of views in the book plus more so I was really pleased with that


Keegan goes through something traumatic in the book and I applaud her for her courage, and will, "I will not allow you to break me

There is nothing you could do to me that would break me

My body is nothing than an outer shell
My soul resides deep inside and you cannot touch it." Every time Julia gives me a book to read the woman is like all nervous especially with this one as it's her first novella, and as always I assure her I will NOT hate it, and I don't I love the way the woman writes she does have talent (and no I'm not just saying this because she does spoil me) but it's the truth
I was VERY pleased with my Rourky!

$review_text.: Jungle Warfare by Christopher A

Cunningham allows the reader a unique perspective on the sales industry

 Subtitled "A Basic Field Manuel for Christians in Sales," Cunningham uses instructions from an old WWI jungle warfare field guide as a parallel to the guidelines a Christian in the industry should follow


 The book is brief, set in a 22 day devotional style with an FAQ section in the back.While I found the concept intriguing, I must say that the description is a misleading

 As someone who is considering sales as a future job, I expected more of a how to survive style of instruction


 What I found was more of a daily discipleship devotional

 Each of the points presented should impact a Christian regardless of job field


 Though Cunningham did attempt to tailor the topics to sales experiences, overall the subject was too broad to specifically address the sales industry.I give this book 3  stars for discipleship

Only 2 stars as a sales guide.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the [...] [...] book review bloggers program

$review_text.: The premise of "The First Dragoneer" is a good one. Bren and March are two good friends going on their last hunt before one of them leaves the village. They run into some unanticipated adventures in the process.M.R. Mathias starts off with a really good idea. However, I found myself distracted by homonym problems (e.g., arrows are properly referred to as "nocked," not "knocked" and one lights a fire using a "tinder box," not a "tender box."). There were several other similar issues that gave away Mathias' using his spellchecker instead of a human proofreader to look at his manuscript. This kind of stuff leaps out at me, as I was a newspaper copy editor for a long while and still do editing on a freelance basis. The editorial problems caused me to take a star off of the rating because they were so pervasive.This novella also includes a two-chapter preview of "The Royal Dragoneers," for which "The First Dragoneer" is a prequel. I think that Mathias has a great idea for a series, and am hopeful that some judicious editing will lead to success for him.Edit, August 21, 2012:  I have learned, in discussion with M.R. Mathias about another matter, that the editorial issues in the story have been resolved.  Thanks for the opportunity to update the headline and share this information.

$review_text.: "The Brummstein", by Peter Adolphsen, originally came out in 2003. The 2011 version that I am reviewing is a translation into English by Charlotte Barslund. At 78 pages, this is a quick read, but quite an interesting one. It follows the "life" of a sample rock taken from the Holloch Caves ... taken by Josef Siedler, who visited the caves with his wife to search for the fabled entrance to the underworld. What he found was a massive rock formation that emitted a strange ... and strong! ... humming.A bit of science fiction, a bit of real life from the years of WW II, the life story of this sample of rock, as seen through the eyes of those who come to own it, is riveting! The author proved snapshots of each owners life, consistent with the background of their time (from WW II through the German art scene of the 1960's). How it ended up in a museum, and why the paperwork with it was deemed to be so important, is something tat the reader will have to get from the book.I found this to be very well written, believable, with well rounded characters and a plot that flowed. For a read that is a bit out of the ordinary, this is where you wan to go!

$review_text.: Three novellas that are in a fantasy setting, but explore the same topic. How quickly you can fall in love with someone who pushes your buttons.  Authors Erin Kellison, KC Klein and Jessa Slade, each have their own unique style of taking you on the voyage in a sizzling, exciting and new way.In "All That Glitters" Mica Sol is part of a royal family. She doesn't really want to be. She wants to explore the planet.  She goes away to do just that. Then her sister contacts her to let Mica know she's getting married. On her way back home, Mica literally falls for her ex Simon. They go through a lot, but in the end realize they were meant to be together."To Buy a Wife" is set after the global war.  Hudson Black Creek witnesses a female being beheaded.  When they bring the second female prisoner to be beheaded, Hudson is immediately taken by her. Without realizing it, he speaks up to save her. Lake is to be executed because she was found with a personal computer.  They must learn to get along and might fall in love too." Enslaved by Starlight" finds Corso Deynah lounging on his ship. His spaceship.  Suddenly he is contacted by someone. Benedetta Galil asks for his help in saving their planet. Her planet is home to some very special crystals and  pleasure slaves. Reluctantly, Corso goes to the planet to see what they expect him to do. If he succeeds, his payment will be Benedetta herself. Even though he declines the payment, Corso is drawn to Benedetta.  From here anything could happen.I LOVED the premise for this set of books. To think someone is terrible and then fall in love with them is wonderful.  The chemistry between them is undeniable from the beginning, but it takes something drastic to realize what they mean to you.  The stories are full of heat and excitement.  You'll want this book on your shelf.I didn't find anything wrong with any of them.I gave this one 5 out of 5 books because it was a fun read.~Copy of book provided by author in exchange for a fair review

$review_text.: Another anthology from my favorite ladies. This go around we have A Season to Remember by Ava Stone, Catherine Gayle, Jerrica Knight-Catania, and Jane Charles. If you have read any of the previous anthologies you would remember some of the characters. If not that's ok. This time they are focusing on Louisa Whitton and the Bartlett family. Trust me it's an adventure to read. So, here is my quick overview of each of the stories and my thoughts:Devil in Her DreamJane CharlesEveryone believes the perfect husband for Louisa is a vicar. However, she doesn't want to succumb to that fate. Plus, she's afraid her grandfather might marry her off to some poor sap that she doesn't really like. After all he still has a special license with her name on it.Devlin Bartlett, Viscount Marston, has three sisters he needs to marry off before he can settle down and start his own family. However, that is all foiled when he meets Louisa Whitton and is charm by her. Yet, it seems Devlin brings out the worse of Louisa. Is it possible for Devlin to realize he needs Louisa before it's to late?My thoughts: It's always fun when family and friends join the crusade to fix you up with the guy of your dreams. Does it always work? No, but in a story it has too, right?  I love how everyone pictures Louisa as one thing, yet they really don't know her. Still Devlin is able to see past the facade.To Enchant An Icy EarlCatherine GayleEarl of Fordingham is trying to mend fences with his brother is not having any success. If you had read any of the Duke's Summons you will remember Tristan Cavendish had a falling out with his brother Wesley.Anyways, Calista Bartlett heartbroken from a previous attachment to Lord Ellis decides she doesn't want anyone like him. So, she takes matters into her own hands, which would be out of character for her.She approaches Lord Fordingham and basically begs him to ask for an introduction from her chaperone. I know shocking and fast of the girl. Not sure what brought it on and if he would actually carry through. Shock by the request and follows through. Now the question is will this carry on to a real courtship? Or just end after the introduction? Another good question would be can Fordingham mend the bridge with his brother?My thoughts: Lord Fordingham is such a boor in the story. Yet, you can't help but like the guy, because he knows what he wants and go afters it. A lot of people don't like heroes who are like that. However, I think its character building, especially when they fall in love. Those types are usually the ones to fall hard. I love how Calista took matters into her own hands.My Lord HerculesAva StoneLord Harrison Casemore is not a gentleman with a pristine reputation. However, when he sees something that's not right he will take matters into his own hands, especially when he finds a young lady dress in mens garb.Miss Miranda Bartlett is worried about a friend and will do anything to find out the truth. Even if it calls for her to dress like a gentleman and enter a seedy gaming hell.By luck, Harry finds Miranda and basically rescues her from disaster and sends her on home. You would think this was the end of the story. No, no, no, it's just the beginning. Can Harry be the hero Miranda needs? Or just fade away into the sun set or in this case the morning light?My thoughts: For one thing, you have to love when a girl is willing to risk her reputation for a friend. I mean that's loyalty at its finest. Then you have the hero who doesn't have the best reputation, yet will take on the world for the girl. If that doesn't scream love, I don't know what does.A Penny for Your ThoughtJerrica Knight-CataniaFinally we arrived to Penelope Bartlett, the youngest sister of the Bartlett family. Just barely out and she is feeling a little down. After all, a lot has happen during the year. First her older brother and father passed away. Then her other brother gets married and both her sisters get engage. That's a lot to take in all at once. Well, Drake Lockwell, Viscount Flitwick stumbles upon a crying Penelope.Drake is able to comfort the young lady and has desire to see if there is still an attraction in the daylight. Can't trust the moonlight, since everything looks lovely underneath the stars. So, the next day he calls on Penny and finds that he is strongly attracted to her. Basically, he wants to start a courtship with her.Aww, young love. However, it is squash before it even starts. Devlin has issue with Drake and tries to put a stop. Yes, we know how well that goes over. Of course with a forbidden love in sight, all directions lead to Gretna Green.Now the question is will Drake and Penny make to Gretna Green with no problems? If they do will they have the happily ever-after? Or will a problem arise?My thoughts: An anthology is not complete without a trip to Gretna Green. As impulsive as Drake and Penny's decision was, it made a fantastic read. Was perfect ending for the youngest Bartlett.Overall thoughts: I absolutely loved all the stories. I mean they were all very entertaining and flowed very well together. I'm so glad these ladies were able to get the story of the Bartlett family love lives together. I truly look forward to more stories.So, I would check this book out and see if all siblings end up with their own happy endings. So, long and happy reading.

$REVIEW.: Sweet and sometimes passionate romance based on true adventures of mail order brides are a winning combination for the author. The Mail Order Bride Series deserves and gets excellent reviews by people like me who are moved and entertained by the books.There are many books that document the campaigns and horrors of America's Civil War, but few deal with the aftermath. In The Widow Finds Love we learn of the post war reality of living in a nation stripped of young men. Many war widows and families were left in terrible circumstances as husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers didn't return home..It's hard to read this book without tearing up. The hardships experienced by American families during and after the war are well told in a way that takes you to post war South Carolina and Texas. It's a simple story based on fact and makes one wonder how people in those times found the will to press on.Kudos to the author for making the The Window Finds Love so believable yet so entertaining..

$REVIEW.: Edd is a real character ... there are many instances when I found myself saying, "I would have done no different."  He is 'Mr. Every Man", in that we all have dreamed of coming to Hollywood to seek our fame and fortune and he did it.  In that case, you can live vicariously through his experiences and adventures.  He certainly tells a very truthful and straightforward story, and in the end, he is fortunate to have survived it all.  It is an easy book to read and a hard book to put down. And at the end of the day, you can decide whether a career in Hollywood is worth the trip.

$REVIEW.: Sometimes, I am overly critical and curmudgeony against mega-churches and their pastors but I like Craig Groeschel a lot. And I really like this book, Chazown, a lot, but I got problems with the title. So while this is generally a pretty positive review, the next paragraph is a little cranky. If you're avoiding negativity in your life, you might want to skip it and pick up this review in paragraph three.The title, Chazown comes from the Hebrew: '''''' or ''zn (Romanized according to SBL). As Craig says, it means vision and he's right, but why he chose to spell it this way irks me. When you a quick google search of "Chazon," "Hazon," or Chazown, you discover that the first two spellings are in far greater usage. Most of the hits for "Chazown" seem to relate directly or indirectly to Craig's book, a couple of online lexicons and a Youtube clip from a documentary on Cher's son's sexchange operation (Chaz- Own). Maybe this is a legitimate way of writing a holem vav(a pointed vav indicating an `o' vowel) but it is not what I was taught, and it doesn't seem to me to be that common. I kind of think it's similar to me writing a book called Selah Vee from the French for "That's life?" Why not spell it like everyone else? In the accompanying website chazown.com, Groeschel pronounces "Chazown" with a hard k (Kazone) instead of the soft guttural kh sound. Of course beyond faulty spelling and pronounciation, why name it "Chazown" anyway? The answer: marketing. Beyond a brief reference to the King James Version's rendering of Proverbs 29:18, "Where there is no vision, the people perish (newer translations have the much more liberating, `cast off restraints' instead of perishing)," there is little discussion in the book of the Hebrew concept of vision; instead Groeschel loads the term with his own understanding of what vision is. The use of the Hebrew here, is simply because if you saw another Christian/personal development/leadership book with "vision" in the title, you probably wouldn't buy it. But you don't know Hebrew so Chazown is exciting.All right, rant over. This is very helpful book which is thoughtfully engaged in helping people achieve God's `chazown' for their life. Groeschel helps people cast a vision for becoming all that God made them and take steps to walk into it. He begins in part 1 to get people to envision of where they want their life to end up (writing your epitaph). In part 2, he presents three overlapping circles which point to God's vision for your life: your core values, your spiritual gifts and your past experiences. In part 3 he talks about the convergence of these three areas and how they reveal where God may be calling you. In part 4, Groeschel presents the image of a wheel with five `spokes' which hold things together and allow us to acheive our vision. It is his contention that if we are to stay on track with "God's chazown" in our life we need to cultivate our: (1) relationship with God, (2)relationship with people, (3)integrity in our finances, (4)make healthy choices about diet and exercise, (5) and attend to meaningful work. While I have a theological objection to placing God as another spoke in the wheel of our dreams (God is the center, the axle and the wheel itself), I like how holistic Groeschel is in his approach. His image illustrates how these areas are not `seperate spheres' but interrelated and necessary components which need our attention.In part 5, Groschel talks about the need for accountability. In the end matter of the book, he gives helpful advice for picking up the pieces when we feel like we've failed God and ourselves.I have read through the book and found it challenging at different points and think it has some useful tools for self discovery, attending to areas of spiritual/physical health, and discovering where God may be calling you. I have finished the book, but plan to reread sections and go back and complete several of the exercises. the book also includes questions for personal use or group discussion making it a thoughtful choice for a church small group. As someone who has worked in college ministry, I think that this would be particularly helpful in that context.Thank you to Waterbrook Multnomah for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for this fair and honest review (albeit cranky in places).

$review_text.: I have been reading this book for hours over the past week, and am only to the approx. 17% mark. This book should be finished by now. I am interested in Ft Worth and it's colorful past (I was a baby there, then visited relatives regularly for 20 years, then spent years socializing and working in Dallas), but I am at a loss as to why it's taking so long to tell the story from so many sources.In addition, the Kindle version is loaded with typos - fix becomes "ix", flock becomes "lock", in several places - just for starters. I actually came here today looking for an update, but the only thing I find is that I can pay $10 for the same book with a different title. Really?I am fascinated hearing all the names, places, and history, but with mistakes like these, I am uncomfortable about accuracy. Oddly, I don't recall ever hearing or reading the name Norris. I suppose it was just too far back for my relatives to have heard it or deemed it fit for discussion. The whole fundamental, gun-totin', KKK, awl-man bit is too over the top for me. But wait - there WAS J.R., wasn't there?

$REVIEW.: While the Amazon description states that this first volume of Keley's two-part prequel to her outstanding debut novel, On the Soul of a Vampire, could be read before the latter, I think the reader's understanding of the characters and situation would be best if the books are read in the order they're written.  (The prologue and epilogue of this second book also flash back to the ending of the original, and would be hard to understand without having read it first.)  Pro Luce Habere fleshes out the 800 years (here in this volume, the period of 1212-ca. 1370) of background to the series opener, answers some (but not all!) of the questions raised there, and further develops the characters, and the author's penetrating spiritual and psychological themes.  Much of what I wrote in my review of the earlier book is relevant here, too.  The same strongly positive features of Keley's unique literary vision and style are as manifest here as in the earlier book!Set in Europe and the Holy Land, this book re-introduces us to some of the secondary characters from the first book, and brings in some new ones; but our focus, as before is on Valery's story.  It's a dark story indeed, played out against the tragic insanities of the Children's Crusade, the atrocities of the 13th-century "holy war" between Catholics and Cathars, the ravages of the Black Death, and the bloody beginnings of the popular fear epidemic that would become the witch hysteria of the succeeding centuries.  There are some scenes of grisly-gory violence here, though Keley does her best to spare us the worst of it; but the grisliest horrors aren't the deeds of the vampires, but the things human beings are capable of doing to other humans.  The outward story, though, is only part of what's here: much of the meat of the novel lies in the character's interior reflections (and the head games of the older vampires).  This is definitely a novel of serious, deep ideas; Valery and his fellow vampires grapple with issues like the existence of God, theodicy, the nature of right and wrong, the status of human life, and the possible extent of God's grace and mercy.  And here these aren't just abstractions --they're agonized questions wrenched up from the guts of Catholic-educated souls who can continue their earthly existence only at the cost of (fairly frequently) taking human life.IMO, this series will stand the test of time as a significant contribution to the tradition of vampire fiction, and serious Christian supernatural fiction.  I'm glad to have the privilege of being among the first readers, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the next book!
$SUMMARY.: No series slump here!

$REVIEW.: I already had the opportunity to review one book by Therese which really changed my life, Beyond Blue

The Pocket Therapist is yet another resource by Therese sure to help any person struggling with depression, anxiety or anyone just looking for a little reassurance in their everyday life.This book is exactly what Therese titled it, a pocket therapist
Keep it in your purse and if you are like me, you can highlight or tab your favorite tips in order to easily access them when necessary


Therese offers you short, quick tips from lessons that she has learned to help in a number of situations.For Example:#97- Untie the strings:"A set of high expectations is almost always guaranteed to deliver- overnight, no extra charge- a carton of suffering..

By lowering my standards- both with others and myself- I gave my brain a better shot at optimism and sanity..."#110: Err on the side of compassion:"It's more important to be peaceful and happy than it is to be right...loving relationships don't operate like a Judge Judy show


They're often lopsided, with one person doing the majority of the giving and forgiving...you can invest your time into loving a person in the fullest way possible, even if she can't repay you or love you back as well."This is genius


I think a lot of people need to meditate on that quote


We spend so much time wanting other people to love us this way, or do things that way
Love a person for who they are and don't worry so much about fighting with them and trying to change them into who you want them to be
Which coincides with something Therese says here:#11- Love them anyway:"You need only concern yourself about your side of the friendship, marriage or golf foursome..

People are illogical, unreasonable and self-centered
Love them anyway..."A-men!#123- Don't try so hard:"Sometimes the harder we try to make something happen-especially in a relationship or job that's headed south- the more we complicate matters

The more we "insist" on solving a problem one way, the more it "persists" in our life."Therese is like that friend of mine who has been there, done that in regards to a lot of what I am going through now


Due to her life experiences, she can offer me very candid and helpful advice regarding things that I am going through now
So, when I need a pep talk, I can pull her out of my purse and get one.The Pocket Therapist has little nuggets of wisdom to help you weather the storm

The best piece of advice that I can offer you from Therese come directly from her mom:#2- Dance in the rain:"You can't sit around and wait for the storm to be over

You have to learn to dance in the rain."Buy It and keep it in your purse, car, or desk at work!

$review_text.: This book gets 5 sweet peas, just because of the recipes in the back. The end.Ok..ok. A real review then&#8230; ;)This book is fabulous. The characters are fantastic. The storytelling is sublime. There isn&#8217;t anything about it that&#8217;s too much, or too little. It&#8217;s just&#8230;wonderful.It starts off with a flashback of Hugo and Kevin kissing in the woods, which is actually a day dream that Hugo is having while driving his best friend, Summer, to her lake cabin to help her get through a bad breakup. Posy  Roberts has a way with weaving you immediately into her characters&#8217; lives. We quickly get to know Hugo &#8211; both through his present interactions with Summer, as well as his memories of high school and his time with Kevin &#8211; and see how close and intimate their relationship is. Their friendship is one that every person wishes he or she had. It&#8217;s beautiful to read. They have supported each other through so much, and it is easy to see that they are lifelong friends, even promising to have a child together if nothing pans out for Summer in the boyfriend department.While at the cabin, Hugo and Summer decide to go to a BBQ at the home of another friend on the lake; which is where Hugo runs into his first boyfriend, and the man who really still holds his heart, Kevin. They waste no time in reconnecting&#8230;and the rest of the book is really the telling of their journey, both past and present, through both character&#8217;s eyes.Spark goes seamlessly back and forth, between the boys in high school, and the current day happenings. The story is perfectly told. We learn what happened to them as teenagers, and how they came to drift apart after high school, as well as getting to know them as adults, and watching them re-establish their connection, discovering whether their lives will still fit together as perfectly. There are a few bumps along the road, but not too terribly much angst or drama. It&#8217;s just a lovely, enjoyable read. To that note, I have to share one of my favorite bits. It&#8217;s a note that Kevin sends to Hugo in high school, along with a little &#8216;bouquet&#8217; of candy canes:Red because you woke me up and make me feel alive.Orange because with your words you heal what my father breaks.Yellow because your smile is like sunshine.Green because of where I first kissed you. It was because you were so beautiful surrounded by the forest.Blue because I feel serenity when I&#8217;m with you.Violet because we are connected. I feel you in me all the time.Rainbow because you showed me my truth, even though it has to remain a secret.And, that&#8217;s just a small example of the swoony awesomeness that is this book. Kevin and Hugo&#8217;s heat is INCREDIBLE. They are sooooo sexy and uninhibited with each other &#8211; the sexytimes are amazing. Just the way that they look at each other, and talk to each other, and&#8230;.. Ok. Obviously I could go on and on. But, I&#8217;ll stop there.I also have to say that I am so happy to hear that Posy Roberts is going to also write YA fiction, because the portions of the book with the boys as teenagers are so, so good. The entire story is extremely well-written&#8230;but, it&#8217;s also very easy to see that the author has a gift for YA storytelling as well.Here&#8217;s the great news, people!! Spark is just the first book in a new series by this wonderful author!! The second book in the North Star series, Fusion, will be out on November 18th, and I can&#8217;t wait.

$REVIEW.: A different twist from her previous apocalypse series, Marie F Crow has proven to be a very vivid writer. I have been a regular with her previous zombie tales of the Risen series and having enjoyed the crisp and graphical magic she creates with her writing style I was tempted to try her  first book of the mermaid fantasy series, The Sirens.Since my childhood, I have been quite fascinated and emotionally attached to mermaids and the ocean. The ocean mysteries and uniqueness has always created a true sense of curiosity and creativity in my mind, and I am glad I purchased 'The Sirens' It lived to my expectations and took me to the realm of mysteries and definitely a book for the younger generations, to make you feel wholesome and happy.The mermaids are portrayed in a new window and in touch with their ancient roots, the main character of the story Verona lives a sheltered and cosy life till her mother Ostila undergoes coronation. The story unfolds on how the little girl matures through life and conveys a lot of positive vibes even for us on how to expect life. Verona or as you get to her , Rona's aunt too plays a significant role, Morlena, dark and mysterious, deals with almost death magic. Various character by Crow to spice up the story and keep you reading joyously.The male character Corander, a friend and close associate of Rona, plays a role together with Rona in discovering life. This book is filled with self discovery, betrayal, love, action and many more to move your emotions. And what I like more is how females are tried to be empowered and it is indeed greatly entertaining , engaging and interesting.A must pick for both genders equally, you are sure to enjoy!

$REVIEW.: I had the joy of reading this alarmingly beautiful story immediately after Incomplete, the first in the series. I didn&#8217;t have to wait, which was fantastic because I just NEEDED more Grayson and Lily. The first story is written from Grayson&#8217;s point of view and this story, Complete, is written from Lily&#8217;s. I just love that. It was amazing to get her take on things.The one word that I would use to describe Lily is strong. She is far stronger than I ever thought to be. To give up the man that she loves with every fiber of her being just so he could pursue his life and dream is amazing. The story picks up two years after the ending of Complete. Lily is miserable. Grayson is miserable. Life is just not right when they are not together. Plain and simple. Getting thrust back together in their hometown is what finally brings their relationship back into the light. It&#8217;s very clear that there is confusion and hard feelings between Grayson and Lily. I wanted to scream at the book, JUST BE HONEST. They are both so guarded. Which, to be fair, is understandable, but yet, as a reader you just know that they are meant to be. Some things just ARE and Grayson and Lily just are.There are ups and downs. There are more trials in this book that they both have to overcome. There is more heartbreak and devastation. But the unconditional love that is profound and true and real between them is what shines through the madness.I simple loved and will always cherish this relationship. They are honest and that really hit home. I HIGHLY recommend you read and fall in love with Grayson and Lily.5 HUGE smooches~Nicole

$review_text.: I've had an interest in the book of Revelation for many years.  I have read many works that attempt to explain the book, both fictional (the Left Behind series, for example) and non-fiction (the Hal Lindsey series, for example).  All of those books present a similar interpretation of Revelation.However, Hilton Sutton brings a fresh and different look at Revelation.  While his interpretation was not wildly different than the ones mentioned above, he did offer some new insights, and as I compared his interpretation to the scriptures themselves, I found myself agreeing with him time after time.  Please take this for what it is - a personal opinion, no more and no less - but I think this is probably the best book I have ever read on the book of Revelation.If you have a desire to understand the book of Revelation, please read this book!  As Dr. Sutton pointed out, this is the only book in the Bible that promises a blessing to those who read it.
$SUMMARY.: An Excellent Book

$review_text.: 3.5 starsI really enjoyed Reswyt, the first installment of the Dreamline series. In some ways, it reminded me of 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'. I also felt like there was a spiritual aspect to the book (though not blatant) partly because the author's voice was one of reverence and partly because of the underlying themes of good vs. evil and free will. Though Reswyt is a YA novel, it certainly has the potential to challenge readers of every age group to deep thinking and personal reflection. Not sure if this was Mayer's intent or not, but it certainly did that for me.There were some timeline and editing issues in the book that should be addressed, but nothing that will keep you from progressing forward with the story. And an interesting story it is! The story alternates between point of views, though our main narrator is a young girl named Sabine, and realms. At first, these shifts were difficult to navigate as there was a lot of history up front and world-building taking place. The concepts were pretty abstract and not easily understood and it took a while for them to sink in. On one hand, it's fine because Sabine is having the same experience as the reader and you're learning right along-side her. On the other hand, I kept re-reading things to try and wrap my head around it which took me out of the book completely - at least for a small period of time. I found that the plot picked up and was the most engaging around 50-60%. At that point, I was excited and eager to get home from work to finish the rest of the book.What I liked most were the elements of ancient Egypt that were incorporated into the book - gods, beliefs, artifacts. It was very cool. The whole idea of the dream state (reswyt), the subconscious, and the rules while there were very imaginative and fun to read. I am loving the potential for a love triangle between Sabine, Josh, and Dylan. I'm hoping that gains some traction in the next book. Finally, Reswyt has some underlying mysteries which add depth to the story and will carry on into the next books. There are many questions that I'm looking forward to finding the answers to.

$REVIEW.: Any book that sets out to unite the explicit Gospel of the New Testament with the implicit moving of God in the Hebrew Scriptures is going to get my attention.  And 'Memoirs of the Way Home' by Professor Gerald Bilkes does exactly that.  I am saddened that all too often, Christians are reluctant to mine the depths of the Old Testament in search for the undeniable working of our sovereign God in His unfolding drama of redemption.  This book  dives into the Hebrew Scriptures, and not even to the low-hanging fruit, but deep down into the neglected books of Ezra and Nehemiah.Professor Bilkes takes the reader on a journey beginning with the nation of Israel, held captive in a foreign land, led free at first by Ezra with subsequent waves eventually bringing Nehemiah to the home he longed to help restore.  The book is littered with Scripture, both from the Old and New Testaments and testifies to the author's thorough understanding of the subject and the significance of God's restoring of Israel.  The book is not a commentary and should not really be compared to as such.  It really is telling of the God's activity in the reconciliation of His people to Himself, focusing specifically on the characters of Ezra and Nehemiah and how so much of their combined stories applies to our personal lives.This book, with the recap questions following each chapter, is probably best suited for individuals that desire to understand the God's Gospel of reconciliation and for study groups interested in the same discussion.  Students of the Word looking to exegete Ezra and Nehemiah could probably look elsewhere for better resources as a means to that endeavor.  I enjoyed the book and do recommend it as a worthy addition to any theological library.'Memoirs' does have a couple of issues however.  First, and this may fall to the publisher-I could find no reference to which translation of the Bible Professor Bilkes quotes from.  Perhaps he has translated the text himself, and if he has done so, I would have liked to know that before hand.  Regardless, I think it is a potentially dangerous practice to quote as much Biblical text as he has without citing which translation this comes from and if permission has been granted to the author to use said text.  Secondly, the prose can be laborious at times.  I buy into the vision the author was providing the reader, but at times it comes of more like a clunky sermon than a smooth narrative of God's desire to redeem a rebellious people.  Finally, and this is rather minute, but in the introduction to the book, the author tries to connect the Parable of the Prodigal Son with the return of Israel from captivity-and I can see the connection.  However, he also references the prodigal son as being 'dead' and thus without a free will to return on his own.  I fully support the Reformed understanding of the will, but this text is not the text to make this argument and the book would have been better had it been left out.Overall, an easy recommendation.By way of disclosure, a copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in return for an honest evaluation, which I have provided.

$REVIEW.: When author Anita Jain mentioned "baroque absurdity" and "the tincture of caricature" in the very first sentence of the book, I braced myself for 300 pages of pomposity.  Oh brother, I thought to myself, another writer trying too hard to appear intellectual and instead just being annoying.Luckily, as the book went on, the pretentiousness decreased a bit and was accompanied by a heartfelt page-turner of a memoir recounting Jain's dating experiences in India.  Her first-hand accounts of the sexual liberation among India's young people, the lingering ill-effects of the caste system, internet dating and many other topics are fascinating and often hilarious.  Jain is worldly, intelligent writer.  However, she does make too much of an effort to prove this.  The numerous foreign phrases and unnecessary multi-syllabic adjectives she sprinkles into her writing are distracting.She is also brutally honest about her escapades and self-limiting behavior and at times candid to the point where you start to feel sorry for her relatives and former lovers whose dirty laundry is aired so publicly.  In any case, this all makes for a very entertaining book.As some have already pointed out here, you do shake your head in frustration at times while reading this book as you see Jain engage in the self-destructive behavior often seen among accomplished 30-something single women.  She finds herself obsessed with completely inappropriate partners who treat her like crap.  She drinks and smokes pot/hash with a frequency that is unbecoming someone far beyond the age of youthful experimentation (you actually start to wonder if she has a substance abuse problem).  Ditto for her going out to all those trendy Delhi clubs packed with scantily-clad teens and early 20-somethings--probably not the best venue for finding true love, especially for a Harvard-educated woman in her mid-30s.As her happily married peers can attest (fortunately, I put myself in that category), sometime in your 20s or 30s, you realize that impossible drama with good-looking but vacuous partners, getting wasted, and going out to clubs every weekend is not a long-term plan for happiness.Four stars for your book, Anita Jain.  But please, forget about that hot 20-something guy who hangs up on you and uses you for sex.  Let yourself to fall in love with a grown-up who treats you with respect.  That is what all of us ultimately want, no matter how intellectual or socially sophisticated we may consider ourselves.

$review_text.: Reviewed by Sarah LBook provided by publisherReview originally posted at Romancing the BookMisplaced Cowboy is Book Two of the Foreign Affairs series by Lexxie Couper and Mari Carr.  While it could probably be read as a stand-alone, it does run alongside Misplaced Princess (Book One) and in order to get the full picture of what is going on, I definitely recommend starting from the beginning with Book One.After getting teasing glances of what may or may not be happening between Dylan and Monet in Book One, we finally get to find out firsthand what is going on.  Dylan is a hot, sexy, Australian stockmen who finds himself alone in New York.  Monet is an erotic New York artist/sculptor.The plot is very similar to Book One with Dylan and Monet intensely attracted to each other even though Dylan traveled to the US to meet face to face Annie, Monet&#8217;s best friend.  The sparks fly between the two of them as they try desperately to fight their attraction.  While not unique, it engaged me from Page One.The authors do an excellent job bringing the entire story to life and making me feel a part of the character&#8217;s lives.  There were definitely some comical moments in this story which had me laughing out loud.  There were moments however where I felt myself tearing up a bit as well.  I experienced a myriad of emotions in this story.All in all, this was a great addition to the series which I read very quickly and could not put down.  I am eagerly looking forward to the reading the remaining books in the series.

$review_text.: There were many points of view and bringing them all together was quite an exciting feat for the author.  First, we have Neil, whose parents cut his brain in half as an enfant (he is very defensive of them and they were not convicted of the charges against them) along with his psychic wife Mavra and they make quite a pair as Neil is hired by the government to investigate things gone missing.  As a result of the halved brain, Neil can use both sides at the same time, looking at the road while driving and reading a book at the same time.  Freaks people out to see his eyes go in opposite directions and so he trys to not do it too ofen in front of others.  Then the most interesting, and lovable, character in the book is Fenny the robot, who has so many illegal upgrades that it should be scary but it's not really and we love him.  As a robot he does not sleep, of course, and reads philosophy and How to Raise Children at night and often goes outside for walks and I just can't tell you any more.  Let the title be your guide.  There are many more characters and time travel and just too much for a book review.  I absolutely loved it and felt good after reading it.

$review_text.: Rebecca Mead does not step delicately around issues surrounding modern American weddings in One Perfect Day -- rather, she tackles them head-on with class and wit. Her examination of the extravagance and opulence expected from modern-day weddings makes for a exhilarating ride. Going beyond just the statistics, she talks with photographers, planners, and vendors to get their inside view to the world of weddings.My own perspective on the world of weddings is highly colored by my own experiences planning my wedding (which took place last May). Did we have a great, elegant, classy celebration? Yes (or at least, I hope so). Was it pricey? Yes. Did we do everything that people expect these days or make it an astonishingly unique display of our interests and passions? No.I don't take any issues with Mead's lack of discussion of the actual point of a wedding, the marriage itself -- I have A Practical Wedding [...] for that -- but I would love to see a longer examination from her about a more reasonable wedding approach, like the one she took.This is a great book for anyone planning a wedding, to provide a dose of sanity, or for anyone who is astonished at the current state of affairs for weddings.

$REVIEW.: I was constantly grabbing on to the moments that would make me feel something other than emptiness and guilt. And as soon as it left, I was back to wondering how I was going to make it through the day.***Milo has his ghosts he has to deal with daily. It is something he has dealt with the last 2 years with the help of his best friend, Joey. He goes to work, he works out, and he keeps his mind and hands busy so he doesn't fall back into his old, bad habits. Maya has her own ghosts as well. She helps out at the local community center with those who are facing their own addictions, all while taking care of her brother. Together they face an uncertain future while battling their pasts and their secrets. Their relationship may be too much for them both. Will they succeed? Will they fall apart? Will they fall in love? Only time will tell.***As much as I wanted her, as much as she set me on fire, more than anything else, I wanted her to open up her soul and let me into that part of her she didn't let anyone else see.***Crap. I don't know if I have read a story by Crane that was so deep and so emotional. This book was definitely one of those that is hard to put down due to the attachment it had on me from the start. This book will be one that so many will be able to relate to. It was one of those powerful reads that make you think about yourself...the way you are living your life. Am what I doing in this life enough? Will I look back and have regrets? Well, that is how I saw it.***He smiled, but didn't crack any jokes. He leaned in, taking me in his arms and pressing his lips to my ear. &#34;Fall, sweetheart. I'll catch you.&#34;***I hurt so badly for Maya mostly and had a connection with her from the start. Not that I had a past even close to hers...it was just her that I connected to. She was easy to love and easy to care about. And really? How much loss can one person take? Milo also has a heart that just makes you feel for him. And boy was he swoon worthy once he got the help he needed and cleaned up. Most everything that came out of his mouth was enough to make any girl weak in the knees. But it was all real and not just to get the girl. Of course he wanted to get the girl, but he wasn't looking for something short term. He wanted Maya for always.***He leaned toward me and stopped with very little room between us. I waited. &#34;How far do you want me to chase you, Maya?&#34;I breathed, &#34;As far as it takes.&#34;***Absolutely and most definitely a must read. I think it was my favorite of Crane's ever. Even though Merrick (Collide Series) will always be my favorite Crane Guy, I just loved this story that affected me so much. It truly was a fabulous read that touched me. I recommend it to any and all out there that love an enchanting romance with characters that aren't perfect and have imperfect pasts. 5 Big Ol' Stars from me!

Sarah is confused that Will is so close to her family while she has drifted away from them over the years. You do have to pay attention because the story goes back & forth between present & past, but I loved the way the story pieces came together between the 2 books, & that the first book was Sarah's POV while the second Will's. Loved it!

$REVIEW.: Heather Lyons weaves this story of not just Chloe and her journey, but also a tale of how love and family and Life can be the most wonderful and frustrating thing in the Worlds. This novella we get to see A Matter of Fate through Jonah's eyes and a glimpse into his life before moving to California. And damn if my heart wasn't torn into two after reading this. Because when you read this, knowing what Chloe went through, you see that this situation doesn't only affect Chloe, it turns the world upside down for many many people. One of these people is Jonah Whitecomb."I'm overwhelmed by just how deeply engrained this girl is in my soul. I love her. Gods, I love her more than I've loved anyone else in my entire life. "Oh Jonah. You fell in love with a girl you only knew in your dreams and seeing how everything played out made my heart swell in the love you feel for Chloe. At first, you didn't let anything stop you from getting to her, that was of course until your (amazing, wonderful, hot, please-just-hold-me) twin brother decided one day to talk to the girl of your dreams. Seeing that scene from Jonah's POV totally made me fist pump for Kellan. Don't Judge. But then I remembered how torn Jonah felt during this and how complicated the situation got. I was again pulled into a story of not only what twin I like better, but suddenly I was overcome with the emotion and knowing, at this point in the story, one of these people was not going to win. One of these characters I had fallen in love with had the potential of not getting a HEA and I didn't know if I could deal with that. I felt like my heart was torn out. Because this love triangle is NOT a case of good/evil or picking the the right guy, it is three amazing people having to make really hard decisions and all I want to do is take these characters and give them a big hug and tell them it's all going to be okay."She is my siren, calling me home"If you only take one thing away from novella, know this, Jonah is fierce in his loyalty for not only his true love, Chloe, but also for his brother. He is aware how hard this is for everyone, showing a quality of selflessness that is admirable. With that said, you also see how he loves Chloe and will fight for her no matter what. He won't give up. In the other books, you saw this from Kellan, maybe one of the reasons I also leaned towards him, but it is not different for Jonah if not even more intense. Jonah just doesn't express himself the same as Kellan, something important to know. And you also see the similar qualities Jonah and Chloe share: guilt. These poor characters carry a lot of quilt and it sucks because it's not anyone's fault, it's what fate has thrown at them. Stupid Fate. I think I should officially be Team Screw Fate."Love can inspire such wonderful blissful feelings, and then, once it's gone, the worst emotions possible. Depression, hopelessness, pain...two sides of a coin. And because love is so rare and precious, we risk his without question when ay day the rides could turn."In short, Jonah's story is a good one. No, it's a GREAT one that gives depth into an already amazing heart filled emotional stor

$review_text.: I managed to get my hands on one of the first copies of this book, and I half expected something esoteric and technical (which is the usual for writings on hermetic magick). I was pleasantly surprised to find, instead, a gentle but firm introduction to Thelema. He goes into both philosophy and practise in multiple, easy pieces, and covers the most basic rituals in a manner that's accessible without skimping on the details. Del Campo doesn't put on airs in this book and will make you feel right at home. This is not an encylopedic work on magick; rather, this could be treated as a good starting point. Definitely recommended for the beginner and for more experienced magician-types (Wiccans etc.) who are curious about Thelema.

She retains her "little girl" qualities while exploring the local natural history (including Elf's pet cockroach!) from the perspective of her new size.  It is a fairly easy (though there are linguistic aspects that one might expect to find in a more advancedbook) episodic read, and it is enchantingly sweet and old-fasioned without being sentimental._Twig_ was the only book that kept my daughter happy when she was ill over Christmas.  She smiled though her fever was high.  She slept with the book beside her so she could read it when she awoke.  The simple chapters reminded her of the joy and fun there is in the world.

We all know this is a ticklish issue that we as parents often struggle with.The book is well written easy to read and something that both parents should read and adopt.

$review_text.: Perhaps I'm being harsh, but I found the Kindle sample wordy and slow-moving. I also have grave misgivings about both the methods and some of the results apparently reported in the book (based on reviewers' summaries).First, the methodology. It appears to be a purely statistical approach (LIWC certainly is, and LSI as well), and therefore offers no insight into the *hows* and *whys* of the phenomena reported; to me, reporting *that* a phenomenon exists isn't very illuminating without *understanding* it. It also appears to be purely correlational, and correlation is not the same as causality; this may seem academic, but causality seems to me to be a significant aspect of the understanding of a phenomenon.More importantly, from the standpoint of results, I spent a year studying psychophysiological indicators of deception, and word choice was *not* one of the dozens of factors that were discussed in the literature (some of which *were* verbal). This work was related to an ongoing research initiative by the DoD Polygraph Institite (DoDPI), and if detecting deception were as simple as counting words I suspect that some of the hundreds of papers they've published, and some of the hundreds of other references I consulted in the course of my research, would have mentioned this.Without reading the original research papers whose results are summarized in this book, it's impossible to know whether the reported results are valid, and everything I know about this particular subject tells me that they cannot be. There are too many ways to slice and dice data to produce the results you want, and too many recent instances of questionable research methodology (particularly in the social sciences) for me to accept these results at face value: one of the author's points is that his results are counter-intuitive, but in this case my "intuition" is informed by thousands of hours of research into one of the areas where he apparently claims success.I am *not* suggesting that there is any willful deception involved; however, slight but significant fudging of results is apparently widespread and not necessarily regarded as unwholesome in some disciplines. Google "academic research fraud" for some info on this, including an article entitled "Fraud Case Seen as a Red Flag for Psychology Research" from the NY Times that is a real eye-opener.

I enjoyed the interaction with Jen, Xander, Johnny and Darian so much that I actually found myself laughing several times throughout the book. Darian's personality in this book was so much different from the previous books that it made me like him so much more. Lizzy Ford's writing is always full of excitement, suspense and romance. This book was no different. Darian has been one of my favorite characters in this series since his return. It was interesting to read his and Jenn's backstory - it answered a lot of questions.I look forward to reading the Original Series. Not really sure if I like it beginning with Xander or not. Hi story may be quite intriguing.

$review_text.: O'Reilly publishes great books that help others with learning new skills (especially programming). I have read two other books by them and they were very thorough and complete (python books) with regard to the subject.With iOS, developing apps is mainly done through Xcode--Apples platform for coding, or the 'shell'. Objective-C is the programming language used in Xcode. This book teaches, lightly, how to work with Cocoa and Objective-C. Cocoa is a framework such that it defines many functions/objects within objective-c for easy retrieval. Cocoa eliminates having to 'code' very common objects, in other words it makes coding faster.The book is very short for a programming guide and it is observed in the lack of 'thorough' explanation of all things iOS coding. While it does give you a step-by-step to get started and allows you progress to writing a few apps, the material is limited and so will your app writing. Contrary to what many reviewers have said, this is not for experience programmers only. Mr. Buttfield-Addison explains the introductions so that you can receive light 'introduction to programming' knowledge. The latter being enough to begin coding.Even though it is not as in-depth as other O'Reilly programming books, it is a good primer for when you dig deeper into the language and usage of Xcode/cocoa. If you are very serious in app developing, consider a complement (or two) book to go along with this.

$review_text.: Two years after her brother Will is killed in a terrorist bombing Finley Sinclair decides it is time to heal and reconnect with God. Following in her brother's footsteps, Finley departs to study abroad in Ireland. Since he felt close to God in Ireland she hopes it will be the same for her. She believes it is the only place where she can find the ending to her music piece dedicated to Will, except she must finish it before her audition at the Manhattan music conservatory. Once there Finley becomes fast friends with her host family, but things don't go as planned when she meets local movie star Beckett Rush and becomes his assistant in exchange for his help as a tour guide. Then instead of recovering from her loss, Finley starts receding little by little, when will God show up to piece her back together?At first I assumed this book would be just like most teen novels are today where there is a famous movie star, an unaffected teenager, both don't get along at first and then at the end they fall in love. Well this did go along those lines but, it was much more than other teen novels, it deals with grief, determination, love, humor, standing up for yourself and it does an amazing job portraying God; no matter what situation you find yourself in God will always be there waiting for you to let him in. I truly did enjoy this book; Jenny B. Jones did an impressive job depicting real emotion, to the point where you could actually understand Finley and what she was going through. Overall it is an excellent book, engaging quick read, I give it 4.5 stars.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading every page and didn&#8217;t put the book down until I was finished. There is excitement, romance, suspense and a good dose of paranormal to keep the reader on their toes.The romance between Sebastian and Arielle is sizzling in this book but in very good taste. The beautiful friendship between the British coeds and their desire to find the man of their dreams is coming to focus as you move on with the series. The plot is very ingenious with plenty of twists and turns to keep you glued from one page to the next.Arielle decides against abstinence when she realizes that Sebastian is the man she has been waiting for and the only man that she will ever love. The author does an amazing job of pulling the reader into their lives and leaves you wanting to know what is coming next. I absolutely can&#8217;t wait to pick up the third book in the series. The book is overall a great read that flows smoothly from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anyone that loves romance paranormal.

$review_text.: Cardanica by Dario Tonani is a story that explores the danger of making machines too self-sufficient when they remain as cruelly logical as a computer tends to be. When the living characters here must rely on such thoughtful technology while trapped on a far off world of poisonous sands, their safe haven of a high-tech transport becomes little more than a prison.As the story progresses, the humans come to realize how little control they have over the nearly sentient ship. It also becomes more familiar with them, urging and insisting their help with actions that they would never dream of doing alone. Just how much will Cardanica ask of its crew when it finds that the blood of dead workers can be effectively used in the place of its shrinking supply of oil?

My main issues would be clearing up some of the disorienting writing around Andrea and Noah's first "encounter" and making it more clear what the whole "relationship" situation was between Andrea and her agent

I also was pulled out of the story somewhat but Andrea's eating disorder, it seemed to be highlighted a lot with mentions that she beat it but then there was a lot of focus on what she ate
That quieted down later on in the story so it didn't detract from the story for me but it just seemed odd

That aside the story was written well and the characters had a surprising about of depth to them, definitely a great set up for future stories about the rest of the Bartell siblings

Not incredibly long but well rounded beginning to end none the less a good sexy story to check out.

$REVIEW.: An interesting story of Judge Solomon and his court for veterans.  The Judge is willing to work with vets that commit a felony by giving them an opportunity for rehab.Judge Solomon also works with the VA which places and closely monitors the vets in rehab programs.I liked the fact that the Judge was also strict if the veteran did not comply with the court's order.  And, the fact that the veteran was not allowed to go home if he was still in danger to himself.PTSD is an invisible wound and must be treated as such.  The quote at the end by Phyllis Miller &#34;Please be understanding and supportive of people suffering from PTSD&#34; is one that is filled with compassion and understanding.Most highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: The book started off okay, but then not so much. Andi got on my nerves. All she did was cry the entire book! It was also really irritating that all she talked about was finishing school and how important it was, then she starts her relationship with Brian, and doesn't check her email for three weeks to see if she has any needed communication from her professors. Just not very bright. All in all I was just not very impressed with this storyline.

$REVIEW.: My husband and I recently learned the hard way that we need to store our most valuable documents in a safe, easy-to-locate place.  Last summer, the State resurveyed their land next to our property, and according to the new survey their boundary moved 84 feet south, effectively swallowing up our house and land.  When we tried to locate our deed, title insurance papers, and documents relating to the purchase of our house and land, they were nowhere to be found.  We had to recreate all of our documents by going to the Registrar of Deeds, the real estate company, and the title insurance company. Unfortunately, the latter company had been out of business for many years, and I had to hunt down the entity that now held our title insurance.We needed The Everything Binder ten years ago!When we started to build our Everything Binder, the section on Real Estate got filled up, first.  Speaking from experience, I suggest you file a copy of your property survey (if you don't have a copy of the original survey of your property, your local Registrar of Deeds may have one), your title insurance policy, and your deed.Once the Real Estate section was completed, we began to go through the Everything Binder section by section, adding in the information that is suggested by the multiple checklists.  A CD copy of the Everything Binder pages in PDF format comes with the binder, so you can download updated pages as you fill them out.Since the Everything Binder is a bit too big to fit into a safety deposit box, you may want to make an electronic copy of all of your important documents plus the updated pages from the Everything Binder and store them in your safety deposit box.  Then the binder itself can be stored in a convenient location in your dwelling.Although it takes a fair amount of time and effort to complete your Everything Binder, I think you will find the effort worthwhile.  Both of my parents died intestate and left no information on how they wanted their property disposed of.  Hopefully, our Everything Binder will make things much easier for our heirs.***a review copy of this product was supplied by the manufacturer

$review_text.: This was a very interesting read.  Gender stereotypes and targeted marketing have been ingrained in all kinds of products to influence the decisions of the target audience throughout history.  Before I read this book, I hadn't given much thought to the use of influence in cookbooks.  The author did a great job of researching this topic and offers a lot of insight into something most people probably don't give a lot of thought to.This book is very well written and has a lot of interesting examples of how cookbooks geared toward women have subtly or not so subtly been used to influence gender roles.  The author made the topic interesting and an entertaining read.

$REVIEW.: Author Christopher Cunningham takes a little liberty with his grandfather's WWII Jungle Warfare field manual and adapts it to the business of sales.  Jungle Warfare is filled with anecdotes, devotions and daily meditations geared towards individuals working in the sales industry.There wasn't a chapter in the book that stuck out for me or any part of the book that reeled me in.  Perhaps, a person with a military background who is just entering the sales force would find the book more enjoyable or even a person with years of sales experience may find the book of interest.  However, for me it was just a typical, anecdotal daily devotional.Liner Notes:  The parallels are obvious: Stay fit. Keep your wits about you. Know your enemy. Serve your leader well. In today's unsure business climate, those who find a way to keep their faith intact while pushing through the difficulties of market downturns are the ones who will be rewarded. This book is about fighting the good fight and finding inspiration even while crawling through enemy territory.Disclosure:  The views expressed in this post are my own.

$REVIEW.: Chasing The Trickster is a refreshing read with a little mythology and folklore in it. I have to say that it was very comforting reading this book because it did not follow the regular story telling pattern that a folklore or mythology story tells. The Trickster God is up to no good he has his eye on a new victim to play a nasty trick on and when he does he is surprised by how the person acts.Nina is a photographer and when she looks at her recent photos she thinks she sees ghosts. After her best friend is shot she turns to the only person she trusts and that is her ex-boyfriend Pascal. Pascal is determined to get to the bottom of who is trying to hurt Nina but what he doesn't realize is that the danger and the truth are darker then he or Nina could have imagined. As their love re-ignites and they come together as one Nina and Pascal will have to fight like hell to remain together. The trickster has so many tricks up his sleeve and he wants to have some fun.This is such an amazing story that it is a MUST READ! Go on out and get it and read it and see what tricks the trickster has in store for this couple!

$review_text.: It almost always annoys me when someone who isn't a professional writer produces a great book, but Victoria Sweet has written the best non-fiction book I've read this year and all I wanted to do when I finished reading it was to meet her and congratulate her and ask her a lot of questions.So I did.Something happened at the start of that conversation that made me realize why her book dazzled me --- the qualities that make her a great doctor are the same qualities that make her book so powerful, original and relevant.She heard me

She paid attention
She made me her patient.Before I asked my first question, I mentioned a health issue


When she returned to San Francisco, she wrote me: "Now that you've let me know you haven't been feeling well, you need to make sure to let me know that/when you are feeling better and the meds are kicking in


Otherwise, I worry."You want a doctor who has infinite time for you? Who cares --- as a person --- how you fare? Who uses not just the tools of current medicine but learns Latin so she can scour texts a thousand years old to learn the wisdom of pre-modern medicine?For 20 years, to get that kind of doctor, you went to Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco.To an almshouse --- a facility that provides medical and spiritual care to the poorest of the poor.For free."God's Hotel" --- the term comes from the Htel-Dieu, the French charity hospitals of the Middle Ages --- is four books in one
Because it reads as much like a memoir as a chronicle of daily life in an unusual hospital, it's the story of Victoria Sweet, who came to Laguna Honda on a part-time basis for two months, stayed two decades and, along the way, staged a successful "twenty year escape from health care." It's the story of her patients, many of them "Bad Boys and Bad Girls," and how treating them with dignity either sweetened their days or, on occasion, turned their lives around
It's an intellectual adventure story; a doctor follows an insight and reconnects with a way of practicing medicine that's almost totally forgotten
And it's the story of clueless government bureaucrats and "efficiency experts" whose apparent goals are to transform an adequate facility into a dysfunctional one.It is, I suspect, this last thread that will resonate with most readers


We are not, most of us, poor


In the main, we are healthy

It's not likely we'll embark on a treasure hunt for obscure knowledge

But heartless bureaucrats --- yeah, we've met a few.Laguna Honda did not, as legally required, deliver mail on Saturdays
The daily menus were not translated into Chinese

There was peeling paint

Dust
And --- horrors --- drug and alcohol abuse among the patients.How to fix all that? Thin out the medical staff, add administrators
Bring in consultants who earn 10 percent of any savings they produce
Decide to tear down the old hospital and build a new one
Make sure the architects never talk to patients or doctors, so when it's finished there is no place to put the wheelchairs.Infuriating stuff
And yet that's not what you feel at the end


What you leave with is, oddly, a sense of celebration
For a very long time, a gang of renegades got away with practicing medicine the way it should be: sitting with patients, watching, listening, often doing nothing more than being present


And then Victoria Sweet, a candidate for sainthood, wrote a book that is a beacon in the darkness.JK: Give me three adjectives you'd use to describe your patients --- the poor.VS: I don't think of them as poor
I don't know why I don't
They just didn't seem "poor" although they mostly didn't have money


But they were the bottom one tenth of one percent of our society; they were the ones who fell through the holes in the safety net, and they were always two standard deviations from the mean


Any mean.JK: You write: "The diagnosis is written on the body." You write: "The secret in the care of the patient is the care of the patient." What other home truths have you picked up that you weren't taught in med school?VS: One is from a book that many doctors have read, "The House of God"--- "In an emergency, the first pulse to take is your own." And then "the efficiency of inefficiency." Which means: do the thing in front of you first

The secret in caring for the patient sometimes is doing the little things


In Latin, there is no distinction between caring and curing --- "curare" means both

In that way, doctors can learn a lot from nurses; I know I did.JK: You write enthusiastically about the "tincture of time"--- not an idea most of us are familiar with.VS: This was the secret ingredient of pre-modern medicine
The old doctors had observed that almost everything gets better over time if you are able to remove or fix the initial problem --- the infection, the appendix, broken bone

The body wants to heal --- let it, help it
It's what I've come to call "Slow Medicine," as opposed to the Fast Medicine that works so well to remove the appendix, open the blocked coronary artery or shrink the cancer, but which doesn't work so well after the appendectomy, the operation, or the chemotherapy

That's when patients need time, rest, and Dr


Diet, Dr

Quiet and Dr

Merryman.JK: Many of us know Hildegard von Bingen as a composer and mystic


For you, her importance is as a healer with insight into a concept called "viriditas." Explain, please.VS: "Viriditas" means green
Hildegard used it to signify the greening power of plants
Her idea was that just as plants have a natural power of healing and growing, so too do patients; that the body is more like a plant, and the doctor, therefore, is more like a gardener, whose job is to remove what is in the way of the patient's natural ability to heal;  to nourish and fortify it.Hildegard didn't depend on numbers as we do


In that sense she was subjective, which is not to say that she didn't have measures


She took pulse and evaluated blood and urine; but it was more subjective and perhaps less repeatable than our own

Although I sometimes think that our measurements too are more subjective than we realize.JK: In an election year, health care is a significant issue


I suspect you could --- with pleasure --- design an ideal health care system for America.VS: Yes

And it's practical: Let people buy it.JK: You mean single payer?VS: No! Calling it single payer was a big mistake
If you sell it as single payer, most people won't want it

So let's just say that we'll let people buy into Medicare
Because, amazingly, it seems that the government has  been able to create a remarkably good system, all things considered.Most patients are satisfied with it, according to studies


Most doctors are satisfied with it, too
By that I mean, many doctors prefer to accept Medicare patients over patients who have insurance; apparently Medicare has less bureaucracy (!) and is more straightforward about what and how much it will pay


Of course, at this point, Medicare is starting to pay so little that many doctors can't afford to take it either.The way it could work would to just let people buy into Medicare

I'm not an economist, but if you take Medicare's budget and divide it by the number of patients it serves, I think it comes out to cost about $700 per month per person

 So if someone wants to pay $700 per month for a Medicare card, why not let them? It would be a wash for the government

(If you don't earn enough? The government kicks in $350.) That seems like a lot of money, but even Kaiser, our HMO in California, charges more than $600 for individual coverage.A second piece of the plan would be to reinstate what we had in the old days, where every county had a free hospital and a free almshouse

They weren't fancy and they weren't equal but they were adequate, and they provided a place where anyone could go, no questions asked, to get care

Even if they were rich! If we had that, at least people without insurance wouldn't have to worry that they would go bankrupt if they got sick.JK: At Laguna Honda, were you often annoyed by patients who wasted your time?VS: It wasn't the patients


It was the administrators

But I don't think it's correct to say that the administrators were annoying --- it really was the bureaucracy that they were required to institute that was annoying

As people, the administrators at the hospital were by and large thoughtful and caring people


By and large, of course

I don't want to set up a personal ad hominem dichotomy.JK: Would it have been better if the Department of Justice had not interfered with a patient-centered institution that didn't satisfy every modern code?VS: In the `70s, young, idealistic lawyers at the DOJ had a mission: close snakepits


By the `80s, they had closed most mental hospitals
The plan was to move patients to small halfway houses


But then there were budget cuts, and the halfway houses never happened --- patients were put out on the street


Now the government has turned its  attention to the last of the almshouses and state hospitals and are methodically trying to shut them down, too

I'm into adequate, not perfect.JK: You write that, in 3 years, the government forced Laguna Honda to discharge 139 patients --- at a cost of $46,000 per discharge.VS: I had to pull that data myself


And when I asked, "Why are you spending so much time trying to discharge a patient who's been comatose for 10 years?" I got a blank look.JK: Where were you in the administrative battle for the survival of Laguna Honda as a traditional almshouse?VS: A group of passionate people fought the changes
I'm not an adversarial person by temperament, so I didn't

As a doctor in charge of patients, you have to choose between seeing a patient or going to a meeting


In the long term, it's probably better to go to the meeting


But doctors are really co-patients --- we don't know what else to be.JK: In the pre-modern period, you write, there was a concept called the Turn of the Wheel of Fortune

"Each of us is attached to that wheel, which is Time, and sooner or later we will go down, and sooner or later we will come up." Right now, where are you on the Wheel?VS: We have no idea where we are on the Wheel of Fortune --- that's the point

We are at the top of the world: rich, handsome, healthy


And one day we wake up and there are lymph nodes growing out of our neck and we have cancer


We turn a corner and are smashed to bits


And vice versa: we are a cook's helper at Laguna Honda, and we win the lottery
We go backpacking, and we eat a can of tuna, and we are dead

So I have no idea where I'm on the Wheel of Fortune
All I do know is that at the moment, this is a wonderful and satisfying time in my life
We'll see how long it lasts.

As for the story, this was actually my introduction to Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser


Excellent pulp fantasy, entertaining and witty, with a great couple of lead characters
Fritz Lieber knew how to do atmospheric horror, but he also didn't take himself too seriously; the stories are as likely to be comedies as grim blood-soaked hack-and-slash adventures
Sometimes both at the same time

$REVIEW.: It was a short story about a gruesome event.  I do prefer mysteries and adventures where gruesome may occur but this story is devoted to gruesome.There were essentially 4 people: a victim, a police officer, a senior EMT and a novice EMT.The one major problem I had with this story was the attitude projected by the police officer.I had a minor problem with the senior EMT who told the novice go to it since this was the first death.At the end of the story(~ 80% mark), the author did ask some interesting questions that engaged your thought processes.While the event has closure and is complete in itself, I find that I have no interest in following this author.However, her questions after the story are extremely interesting and I will revisit those; and this may change my mind about reading additional books by Ms. Patricks.

However as the idiom states &#34;better be safe than sorry&#34;, the author got me thinking and I have start considering the idea of being more proactive for such cases

Recommended!

You should have baptized him right then and then married them in front of everyone of all faiths and believes. So you didn't therefore I hate the books.

$review_text.: This book was my first exposure to the series and I thought it was very good


 The suspense and mystery aspects were compelling and the action was exciting

 Ben Hood seemed reminiscent to me of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, a good thing from my perspective

 I was caught up in the fate of the characters and really found myself caring about them
 This was a fast-paced and fulfilling read

 I can see why the series is so popular.

$REVIEW.: 4 STARSGoddess Born is full of drama, good characters, action with a touch of the paranormal or fantasy. The plot keeps your attention and leaves you wanting to see more of the characters in the future. It also deals with history of Pennsylvania in the 1730. It is also a clean read.Selah Kilbrid is the main character. She is a young woman who is beautiful, she has a secret that she can't tell. She does not want to marry a Quaker minister that is black mailing her.Henry goes by different names at time. He is sold to Selah by his ship captain for seven years. Their is another who wanted to buy him and was unhappy that Selah bought him.Selah's fianc&eacute; died crossing the ocean. If she returns without a husband she will be forced to marry the minister or he will accuse her of witch craft. She makes a bargain with Henry if he will pretend to be her cousin and marry her in name only she will let him go in one or two years.Their are two groups who we know want to harm them but their is more working against them in secret. Selah also has many friends who are on her side though too.The paranormal part of the story is Selah Kilbrid is a descendent of the Celtic goddess Brigid. She has the gift of healing.We see a little bit of what the Quaker lives were like in 1730. I did not know anything about Brigid. So that was nice to learn about too.It was easy to read and follow at a good pace. I want to read more from Kari Edgren in the future too.I was given this ebook to read and in return I agreed to give honest review of a Goddess Born.

Ms


Monodee writes with a delightful descriptive flair
I could see every scene in my mind's eye as clearly as if I was there

Mauritius sounds like a beautiful island.The relationship between Leila and Khalid was intense
I did not expect the depth of emotions that Ms

Monodee was able to bring forth in such a short read, but she was able to portray a myriad of them


I learned quite a few things about the Muslim faith that I didn't know before and this impressed me


 The words of love were so pleasant to my sight that I wanted to hear them out loud.I really enjoyed Once Upon a Second Chance and look forward to reading more work by Zee Monodee.

$review_text.: Three Beds in Manhattan was first published as Trois chambres &agrave; Manhattan in 1946, and was translated into English by Lawrence G Blochman
The story of Franois Combe, a moderately successful actor of stage and screen whose wife leaves him for a younger man

Franois flees to America, where he lives a lonely existence full of resentment

Then he meets Catherine, divorced by her diplomat husband and kept away from her daughter, who leads an equally lonely existence of sterile one night stands


The two embark of a mistrustful, sometimes aggressive love affair, and end up living happily ever after

This is a sentimental love story, and despite Simenon's attempt to include discordant elements of personality, remains pretty much unvaried in tone throughout the book
That two people who have been hurt before should mistrust each other is hardly a revelation to make
Other than that Simenon portrays two self obsessed and egotistical people negotiating for what they want and are still afraid to get
Limited by it's lack of real exploration of personality, and the fall back on easy sentimentality, this is close to a Mills and Boon from Simenon, and a lesser work, though one of his most popular

Apparently based on Simenon's affair with Denise Ouimet, who became his second wife, the story is far too autobiographical to represent Simenon's gifts as a novelist, which expressed something quite deep in his subconsciousness.

Leighton is just as obtuse as Charlie, can't see the good for looking back.  They finally get it right.  Personally, Dennis needed to be filleted and Malcolm needed a spanking.

Sarcastic humor with sly references to characters on kids shows, author's, punk bands etc., make in my mind worth reading. This is not A Farewell To Arms but they are entertaining reads. Yes you have to suspend belief but if Chuck Barris was a CIA hitman why can't a housewife be one. Yeah I didn't believe Barris either but the key word is entertainment and these books are that.

$REVIEW.: This is a good representation of Edgar Wallace's crime novels. I was hooked on them as a teenager and it was nice to stroll down memory lane. Pros: The book is free and keeps you guessing almost to the end what secrets the house holds. In true Edgar Wallace style, the villain has 'evil' methods for his victim. Just the right amount of suspense to keep you reading and give you goose-bumps. Cons: Unfortunately, the compilation is a bit of a disjointed/unorganized read. Unless you like Edgar Wallace work, this book will not endear you to him. Not sure if this is the author's or the compiler's fault.

$review_text.: This collection of 9 short stories has something for everyone - a dad and son burglary team, a pimp, a frustrated housewife. Every story is really well-written and each brings its own charms and surprises. The stories are really varied - touching, menacing, chilling, sad, violent - but what they all have is honesty and immediacy. My favourites were SISTERHOOD with its theme of getting revenge on racists, the title story DIRTY OLD TOWN - a thoroughly nasty little tale set in a gym, and MERRY CHRISTMAS (I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT TONIGHT) a heart-warming Christmas tale of a father and son burglary team. Really good stuff. I always look forward to one of Nigel's short stories because I know I'm going to get something fresh and exciting.

Heat: SizzlingCela and Foster have been through a lot in a short amount of time

Cela went from vanilla virgin to kinky seductress

Foster went from emotionally guarded Dom to a man willing to beg for his woman
It definitely hasn't been easy, but what is if it's truly worth it? This is the installment we've all been waiting for--and it didn't disappoint at all!In Not Until You Love, Cela and Foster's reunion is interrupted by a phone call


One that foster has been waiting for - and dreading - for most of his life
Things for these two are about to get a whole lot more complicated

And depressing
But now Cela is sure what she wants


Who she wants


And right now, Foster needs her more than ever

She's going to have to show him just what he means to her
Heal his hurts with love.For this installment, one word comes to mind: emotional

Not Until You Love is filled with so much love and so much sadness

There is a darkness that hangs over this installment but there is light too

I am so happy with how things turned out
Things between Cela and her dad, between her and Foster..
Cela grew a spine and found her voice and she's not afraid to use either one

And, when Foster was at his lowest, he learned to trust and let love in


Realized Cela wasn't going to run away


Not Until You Love is a satisfying and meaningful conclusion to this serial.

$review_text.: Back in the early and mid 1970s a series of 4 fantasy novels written by one Evangeline Walton and based tightly on the Welsh myths known collectively as The Mabinogion were published in this country by Ballantine Books.  THE PRINCE OF ANNWN; THE CHILDREN OF LLYR; THE SONG OF RHIANNON; and THE ISLAND OF THE MIGHTY were for many of us our first introductions to Celtic mythology.  Ms. Walton was an expert storyteller, and having read the 1949 Gwyn and Thomas Jones translation of THE MABINOGION, and struggled through a Welsh-language version for young people called Y MABINOGI: CYFADDASIAD NEWYDD, I can say that her paraphrase of these tales is superb, faithful, and an incredibly exciting read!The individual novels have long been out of print and hard to find. Overlook Press has just published the four novels together in one elegantly produced hardback entitled THE MABINOGION TETRALOGY.Although Ms. Walton, who died in 1996 at age 92, began writing her novels decades before Tolkien began his, and her style is leaner and perhaps cleaner (aided, no doubt, by the fact that she was reworking already existing material whereas Tolkien was weaving entire worlds from his own yarn), the Tetralogy should appeal to a similar readership.I can't recommend this edition highly enough!
$SUMMARY.: An incredible treasure back in print!

$REVIEW.: These are a few of my favorite things:1. Firemen heroes2. Good Dads, who for all their trying, still can't always figure out preteen girls3. Cute/sweet kids who want to set their parent up4. New Orleans5. Super-romantic men6. Books that make me cry.This book had them all and more! It was like it was written especially for me. When I got it, it reminded me that I don't read nearly enough novels w/ a fireman as hero...it seems like there should be more out there--where are they and why haven't I come across them? I digress...our hero Jason embodies what I always think of firemen being--strong, take charge, but super-caring. Many moons ago I dated a fireman and he and his firemen buddies all seemed to having that caring quality. Yum.Super-funny moment--our hero tries to help his daughter buy her first feminine products. I almost died when he asked her about her "flow." I totally laughed out loud and loved how Colby came in to save the day.While there were times that I wanted to tell Colby to get over it already (I tend to get over things easily and don't know how a cheating parent would actually affect me and I had to keep reminding myself of that) she was such a likeable character that I identified with her anyway. I cried for her when she revealed the pain of finding her college boyfriend, then her dad cheating. And I understood a little better--she never talked about it or really dealt with it. And I was heartbroken for her because she never got to fix her relationship with her dad. And I cried some more. I do wish we could have learned more of what were in her parents' letters to her--maybe the whole letter!New Orleans has been in my top two places to visit ever since I was in my early 20's and I finally got to go last December when my husband took me for my birthday. After being there for all of a few hours, I declared "I think this is my new Vegas--" a place I go to at least once a year and love. I loved being able to identify and picture some of the places mentioned in this book. It almost made me feel like I was there again and remember my own real-life sweetheart and romance (still going strong after 15 years!)So thank you for all of that and more, Rachel Harris.p.s. I REALLY wish there would have been an epilogue--I spent a whole afternoon reading this and I felt that the end of the book was a tad abrupt! I wanted more--you know us readers are a greedy lot! Can't believe I have to wait for the next one.

$review_text.: Reading this book was like relentlessly entering a dark, dank cellar where you expect to meet only vermin, hookers, thieves, junkies, and murderers and leaving its pages at the end was like recovering from a two-week bout of the flu where you're so glad to feel alive once more and breathe fresh air. You come away from the book feeling you barely escaped catching TB or maybe even hepatitis -- so dank, dark and confining was the environment you breathed within these pages, but thank goodness you did escape! Mistakenly, I thought this work was an outsider's celebration of the vagabond life. It is not. It's a confession, without respite, of one pathetic man's life of crime.The author confessed in a letter to Lincoln Steffans (quoted by Bruno Ruhland in the Afterward of the Nabat/AK Press edition) that he felt writing this autobiography was like "dealing off the bottom of the deck." In other words, a con, a cheat. It is a cheat and a con -- in many ways. Half-pulp romance and half-sermon, it is well-written but without psychological depth.The reader is cheated in knowing anything at all really as to what motivated this man to enter a life of crime and stay there. It's simply not good enough to respond like the mountaineer about why he climbed the mountain: "It was there." But Jack Black's blatant avoidance of any deep inner questioning bubbles up on every page.This reader came away with the inescapable feeling that the author was a defective soul, not at all the glamorous "outsider" say William S. Burroughs is celebrated to be, although Burroughs has cited this autobiography as his inspiration for his first novel, "Junkie."The autobiography reads like a novel for the first two-thirds of the book, but then, in the last third, the author starts skipping and "cheating" on episodes involving serious time spent at Ingleside jail, Folsom prison, and then San Quentin while interspersing a few unmoored pages (written for the fools, I think, the author assumed some of his readers would be) about how crime doesn't really pay. There are memorable moments of historical significance depicted in Jack Black's story, especially in the first half, but these events and tales, promising at the outset -- or seeming so -- are no reprieve from the antisocial and moronic life the author relates.An admirer of the novels of 19th century novelist Charles Reade (whom he discovered in a Canadian prison), the author writes about his looting schemes and prison life in a manner that is suited for the parlor rather than the bathroom or a backroom. But I was more than glad when Chapter 24 finished. The author quit crime, quit his "hops habit," and became a bit of a celebrity after the age of 50 and after more than 30 years as a criminal. He also, later, disappeared in the Hudson River in New York and his body was never found. No reprieve.It is well-written and memorable in its scenic depictions, which is why I give the book four stars.

However, what I like best is the common sense approach to Paleo eating. In other words, make it your own, with what you like in your kitchen. Too many of the other cookbooks have recipes that begin to taste the same, or have the same techniques and frankly look/ taste questionably. This one gets it right and is a must have for the new to Paleo and 'seasoned' primal cooks looking for some variety in their meals The only others that  I might add would beThe Primal Blueprint Cookbook: Primal, Low Carb, Paleo, Grain-Free, Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free (Primal Blueprint Series)andPrimal Blueprint Quick and Easy Meals: Delicious, Primal-approved meals you can make in under 30 minutes (Primal Blueprint Series)

I felt most of the book was spent with the zombie outbreak

Too much of the book


I have high hopes that book 3 will give more understanding on Holland and more of a storyline to Jonas and Holland's budding relationship


 I look forward to reading the next installment in this series.Reviewed by: KaTina3.5 stars

$review_text.: An interesting contrast exists between those books given a lot of publicity, e.g.,Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base, by reporters and writers versus those lesser quality written books by people there lacking the publicity machine. Lots of history books exist on the subjects of this period: the former President, the agency, and the U-2, many fine books, cleared books.The first striking thing about this book is that it does have those modern typographic errors which basic word processing spell checkers can't catch in the index "aircraft carrie" rather than "carrier" (for that U-2 capability). One will find mention of CL-292 (a clear typo) rather than the CL-282. The editor's name appears on the dust jacket cover, somewhat embarrassing for her, a little annoying to some readers.As a slant, the earlier part of the book doesn't show Curtis LeMay and the Strategic Air Command particularly sympathetically (not that this reviewer is partial to the USAF) but later SAC comes in line. The lack of "precision" in WWII attempts to bomb V-1 launch sites is illustrated with one photo with noting 500 attempts and no hits. A reader has to keep in mind not only modern cruise missile GPS precision but also that that "precision" has shown its limits, too (Chinese embassy). The line between the strategic and the tactical starts to blur.The book isn't a single linear narrative. It's a patchwork of a number of topical narratives which go into a lesser documented future (e.g., Corona satellites) when reset to a local chronology on the next technical problem topic. Some readers will be interested in the aeronautic while others might be interested in the more political. The author attempts to provide his insights. One of the areas weak is the interaction between image and signals intelligence (e.g.,Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage).The book offers in one place a few small things likely scattered (A-12 technical differences from the SR-71 like daylight only photo missions vs SAR and IR) and certain old War era roles not over the Soviet Union before the UK was allowed to train U-2 pilots (i.e., Suez). Where all these topics add up is that using Internet resources such as MS terraserver and google earth one can these same imaging targets: and they are there, still mostly there: the airfields, the SAM sites and silos (I checked out France's besides the former SU).I'm from the post-Eisenhower era.  I've heard various positives and negatives of the past-General and past-President. He comes out looking good here which make me wonder about how this book would change the thinking of those other old remote sensing types I know who didn't think much of him.I can't suggest that this book is 5 stars, but its over all material is way above 3 stars (average). It's not a book for every body, but it did hit a few of my voids.

$review_text.: This is a suspenseful romance about a girl trying to escape her past and finding the one she has always loved. It was exciting  to read the way Sandi had to flee her family that wanted her dead. Mitchell helped her before but would he be willing to drop everything and help her again. In the process  of helping her he lost his heart to this beautiful amazing woman. It was a very fast read  and a great addition to this series of books. I cannot wait to read the next book in this Secret Series as they have all been great.

 The Sons of Malice story is great to see, and the pre-quel stories are a good edition

 Personally I like anything that has Orks, although they need to win more often
 I really like Graham Mcneill but I just can not get interested in the Honsou character


 Storm of Iron is really good but these short stories he puts out are just boring, I can't get drawn in
 The Salamander tale is great from a less well-known legion
 A good read and well worth the cover price, I look forward to the Sequel, "Legends of the Space Marines".

$REVIEW.: Val Chase is the head of the PR department for a hospital focused on cancer research. When a top doctor absconds with millions in research money, Nate O'Halloran's called in to help minimize the impact on the hospital's reputation and funding. Nate owns his own PR firm, and is well known for his ability to put a positive spin on almost any situation.Val's a bit resentful of the implication that she can't handle the job; Nate's intrigued by Val. Chemistry abounds but Val's also not ready to dive into a hot fling. She's careful about her heart and isn't about to throw it away on someone who's clearly just visiting, even if he makes her nerve endings zing.Ms. Carr writes an enjoyable read with likeable characters who share sizzling sparks. The plot is realistic and interesting as well.  Looking forward to reading more of Ms. Carr's satisfying stories!

$REVIEW.: The author points out that "When it comes to green smoothies, the vegetables are not always selected for their taste. Their essential vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber far outweigh any flavor they add to a drink." But the combinations she chooses are delicious and some lean to the exotic.Health benefits seem endless, besides weight loss and allover health concerns often associated with aging, smoothies are a great way to add water to your intake, especially if you're like me and like some flavoring in your water. They are great ways to ease the digestive load while getting enough fiber, bolster the immune system and more. If you are on a bulk up diet and work out at the gym, consider adding protein powder to your drink.The author lists Breakfast, Snack, Lunch, High Protein and Post Workout Smoothies, while encouraging you to experiment with your own ingredients.. Well done and a great addition if you are collecting smoothie recipes.And besides health benefits, clean up is a snap. Good information.

$review_text.: Before I get into the meat of the review, to those just scanning for a good bit of entertainment quickly, I'll say this: IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ A TRAGEDY THEN MOVE ALONG TO SOMETHING ELSE. "Everyone", and do mean everyone in this book dies. All humanity, in all our known universe... Not the ending I thought and hoped for while I was riding along through the first parts.I really enjoyed the first three quarters of the story/series (bought the complete novel after first three free parts). I'm not sure the author originally intended to rant near the end of the story, but did so through one of the supporting characters through the end.To justify the authors preaching about man's corrupt "human nature" he uses the villain in the story, a somewhat benevolent "activist" who, in the end, annihilated everything and everybody because humanity is a disease...Even though I can sympathize with this point of view, and it's not new to scifi, I didn't like the fact that a story where people are initially doing a good job of beating the odds, flips full-face on you and rubs YOUR face in your own humanity, and then doesn't even have the courtesy to at least leave you standing back up in the end. It was truly designed to lead you in and then stab you in the heart.You put up with the half enraged main character through most of it because you start to believe that there is a change due for this guy. Why else would the violent scumbag be spared over and over. But in the end he just gets even more crazed and out of control until you just don't care what happens to him any more, and then you run out of the point of reading this letdown in the first place.There is even a very long passage of poetry within the story which would make at least this reader believe that within it is the authors main message and purpose for the story in the first place.I was disappointed that the author chose to get a bit overly obscure in the last ten percent of the story, not only with the events as they pan out, but with the story line itself, message having already been delivered to the unsuspecting reader.Events felt like they splintered in all directions and it felt like the author, through his obscurity, either relieves himself of his obligation to his readers to give us a defined ending (although I guess there was one in there), or just wanted to throw a cerebral hook at us to finish us off. In the end I said "WTF"?I guess I'm just pissed that after spending all my valuable time reading the first three quarters and liking it, that the author really dropped the ball and let his passions (whatever they are) take over and run away with the story. Or maybe someone else did. If that was his original plan, "congratulations, you succeeded". And he also made sure I never buy another one of his titles. I for one, do not like when the author betrays me by turning my entertainment into preaching.Want to preach to me? Fine. I'm all for it if: a), you tell me that's what you're doing and I mentally prepare for it, and b), keep it out of my leisure time.One other observation that may actually be way out in left field is I felt the author tried too hard (even though the attempt may have thought to have been subtle) to convey his athiestic beliefs through the main agitant in the story, which would also explain the very negative view the author apparently has on human behavior of the future.I did notice afterward that he asked for input from readers as he was apparently writing episodically. This may have been the downfall here. The story was not done before it was released.As a former publishing firms editor, I can say that releasing an unfinished work can be the death of it once the reading pool starts messing with the author's head. Shame. When I first started reading the saga, I thought for sure it was going to earn all five stars.The ONLY reasons I gave it the three stars is that it was good enough to entertain me for awhile, and "my" letdown may not be someone else's. It IS well written despite the seemingly two-faced direction the story takes. If you're into doomsday scenarios, have at it!

The artist did something totally extraordinary with it.DescriptionAine Yukimura enters a contest to write lyrics for the popular band Lucifer. Unfortunately, while Aine is chasing down her lyrics she almost gets hit by a car!! And the driver is none other than Sakuya, Lucifer's singer. He takes Aine's lyrics and uses them in their concert!!! Because of that, he decides that Aine should be their lyricist, and she does.Even though I highly recommend this book, it is rated M for mature. It goes past the OT mark, so if you are 13 and up {depending on your parents}, you can probely read this book.

$REVIEW.: I hate, I mean absolutely hate to give this two stars. But I just can't give it more stars because I would want the same warning before I buy an awful book. I can't remember how much I paid for this, but even 99 cents is too much. Honestly I want to give it one star, but I'm trying to find the good in it.Before I list pros and cons, I must mention that this is a Christian book. But other than a few prayers and mentioning once that they were in church, it's not drenched in it. There's no preaching, and in fact I wouldn't think a non-Christian would have a problem with this book (other than the negatives I list below...) But on that same note- if you're looking for something kinda conservative or like Jenny B Jones (whom I would highly recommend) - this is not really it. It's kind of watered down Christianity. And I'm not saying that's bad- that may make you want to buy this book more. :)The positives: There's a good story in here. Many girls have done what the lead character, Kate,  does.... gives her heart to a boy who doesn't return the same feelings. And there's another love story that ends in a guy that's just "Not that into her." So many readers should be able to relate to one of her stories.There are even a couple funny lines in there where i laughed out a little bit.Kate had some witty lines and has a pretty strong character to her.And, aside from what I will write as my 1st point in the negatives list, the story does get better. The 2nd half almost (but not quite) redeems the first part.The negatives: I truly hate to say this but that may be one of the worst written books I've ever read. Oh how badly I wanted to stop reading after chapter 1.It would have stuff like: " 'I'm so mad' said Kate angrily."  Every single time someone spoke it had a "Said so and so" after it. There's an art to writing and that ain't it. ;-)I'm wondering if this is the author's first book. And I'm guessing it didn't have an editor.***************BIG FAT SPOILER*************I did not like that ending!!! Are you kidding me? We get to know two other guys that she falls in love with but not the guy she actually marries???????????? They say like 7 sentences to each other and then get married?????? I hate that the author left this stuff out. This is what we want to read. We want to see the dialog between them so we can see they belong together. There wasn't enough there for me to feel as though Kate had feelings for him, or knew anything about him other than his one tragic loss.It was the most important relationship in the entire book, summed up in about 6 pages, and left me disappointed and wanted more . Not more of their lives to follow, but more of the meat of their relationship to help me realize they were good together. I just didn't get it.What a shame.

Highly believable plot, good page turner.Timely in that it deals with climatology and man's desire to control and weaponize nature.

I read the book prior to sending to my brother's girlfriend. Because I babysit my nephew a lot, I needed to know what they knew. So we could all work together.Diana Diaz has put together a very clear, concise and practical 7 step guide to help with potty training a boy.  Did it happen overnight? No it didn't, but over time it worked. We used a reward system. And when we went shopping, he loved knowing he could pick out any pull ups or underwear he wanted. He became a part of the process and it made exciting for him.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a first timer at potty training a boy and finding it difficult or overwhelming. Boys are certainly different than girls. Therefore different tactics must be taken. The book is a very straight to the point easy read.

$REVIEW.: This is brilliant because it's subtle and told in a diary format. It was riveting and kept me up all night until I finished. I like the Zombie/apocalyptic genre. It's a guilty pleasure of mine, and would describe this as being among the very best of the best. The translation was flawless. I'm normally disappointed with transcribed books but this wasn't disappointing at all. It also left the culture in tact enough to appreciate both that and the well told story.There were a few cliche's I would have gotten rid of -- the "perky breast" line was corny and I love perky breast. But all-in-all it was a fantastic read and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoy's the genre. Especially the protagonist wasn't some fearless macho super-dude. He was realistic.

$review_text.: ~ 2.5 Raining In My Heart Stars ~I don't usually read contemporary romance, but I got this free on Amazon.  The cover is HOT and well who can turn down a Cowboy, so I figured I'd try something new.I liked parts of the store and other parts I just could not stand. It had a little to much drama and long winded conversations that repeated themselves. To much sexual tension between the main characters and not enough release. Julie just made me frustrated with her feelings running all over the place and her regret. Cade on the other had is a sweet caring cowboy, whom I feel for at the beginning. I enjoyed Caleb the old cowhand the girls &#34;deceased&#34; father hired; thou we all can figure out whom he is right from the start.

I think the author is definitely talented, as the first short story picked my interest, but it all went downhill from there


Next time hopefully will be a winner.

$review_text.: This is a book that has some good examples of combat leadership and some good quotes. The author goes through a lot of the proven ideas about how to train yourself and those you lead to handle stressful situations. I wish he had been able to go more in depth on how they had created some of the things they trained on. The brevity of the book is the only reason I dropped a star. I think the ideas are great and the materials that he understood in order to write it are excellent. It just seems a little too brief to get to the heart of the topics.

Her words and her style of writing brought you close to the relationship of the main characters. It wasn't the type of story of boy meets girl, and they end up in bed... The love story moved slowly and built with each encounter. You hated for each chapter to end, but you couldn't wait for the next one to begin. The relationships with other characters added a balance to the storyline. Immediatly I went onto Amazon to see if she had another novel, and found out one was in the making."I can't wait!!!!" This book is a must read and I am going to share it with my friends.

Nicely sorted by type of fruit, it's a breeze to find the fruit you happen to have on hand... and find something creative to do with it.  And creative this book definitely is.  I love that the author has thought outside the box and explains how to can naturally... the way it used to be done!  Instead of having to use pectin in the recipes, the author uses the fruit at it's ideal jam stage, thereby using the pectin within the fruit itself.  REALLY neat idea, and works great!!

$review_text.: I received this book FOREVER ago from my sexy friend Mel, and shame of shames I only got around to reading it recently. New man in my life, very little time, and the promise of a spanking all accumulated into my not getting the chance to do so. However! Now that I have read it all I can say is wow! Before you even open the damn thing the blurb has your panties getting all damp with excitement. Allow me to awe you mes petites cheris...A sexually deprived boss, and her HOT sexy heart pounding, Australian kite surf instructor. Andy is saucy, delicious, astonishingly beautiful and drives Jemma mad with her sexual cravings. His hard six pack abs never go unnoticed. Jenna catches Andy having sex while on duty. Revealing more of him than she has ever seen before. Her nerve endings are zapping, endorphin's pumping. Just like Andy pumps Suzie. She is hungry for him.*THUD* I totally passed out from reading that alone. Way to get a girl intrigued Mrs.Craig, as soon as I read that I had to have it! And not only that, but the cover is also smoking! Which reminds me... I have a flight to catch one of these days to claim my promised kisses.Anywho! Jenna has had the hots for Andy for a while, not that I can blame her - wait to hear all about his plentiful package! *purrs* But with his new found fame our Andy gets a big head and a lot of female attention which leaves poor Jenna in the sidelines craving more than enjoying, and turns him into a total dick! Good thing Jenna is willing to wait him out is all I can say.This bad boy should come with a Warning label - NOT for the Weak Hearted, Underage, or straight up Prudes! Mrs.Craig had managed to fit enough rough and ready shagging of the vaginal, oral, and anal variety  as well as a steamy shower scene, into this toe curling short read. I'm telling you now, it will blow your mind and give you your own sexual urges to satisfy. Damn, I wouldn't be surprised if it gives you your first biblio-release! Yeah... you know what I'm talking about!This book really did do it for me. It's been a while since I was able to sit down and get so bloody turned on from flicking through the pages of a book. And not only that, but it's impossible not to fall in love with the characters Mel has created as you follow them in their erotic, life altering, humorous journey of finding ones self and love. Thank you again my sexy mate from Down Under for giving me this awesome read. I loved it! And I'm sure every one of you will love it too. Grab a copy and see for yourselves.

$review_text.: I am traveling to Turkey this summer and did not want to spend a lot of money for language studies.  I speak French, Spanish, and Mandarin.  I have been working with a basic Pimsleur course and was having trouble with their inconsistent pronunciation. One example was the word for HELLO,"Merhaba." It was first pronounced (after listening to the word numerous times) "MEER-hah-bah"...the vowell in the first syllable as a long "i" as in American dictionaries or "i" according to the International Phonetic Alphabet.  Later on, on another CD I heard the word pronounded as "mehr-hah-bah."  I continue to find inconsistancies and contrary to what Pimsleur says and its 5-star rating, I found this little book to be a treasure trove of insights into the Turkish Language and an excellent supplement to the Pimsleur course. This book was designed for those individuals who wish to learn basic Turkish and not long term study of the language. Lonley Planet has done a great job with this little book. Larry Tomaw

$REVIEW.: Natalie had felt like a freak all her life. Her unusual silver eyes, fair hair and pale skin that did not tan, she looked different and at high school that is not a good thing. Then in a freak accident with her childhood friend Jackson, Nat found out she had the ability to heal others. Every year just before her birthday she would have dark foreboding dreams, more like nightmares really and since this year she was turning 18, they seemed to be getting worse. Pierce was the token bad boy who had a good heart and a secret and he has been madly in love with Natalie since they were kids only she doesn't remember him at all. Due to a tragedy in her life, Natalie does not remember her past and Pierce needs to get to her to keep her safe before she comes into her powers. Forces of darkness are at work and even those he trusts will betray him. Can he save the only girl he has ever loved and will she remember her past? Natalie's life is spiralling out of control, she feels safe with Pierce even though she barely knows him and he may be the only one she can trust if she wants to stay alive long enough to find out who she really is. This story weaves the mythology of unicorns and their amazing ability to heal others, a very engaging read. I have liked all the books by Maddy Edwards and this one is no exception.

$REVIEW.: Touch of Death is an excellent start to a new series. This book kept me hooked from the very first chapter. I loved the mythology, concept, and characters. However, the pacing was a bit slow, and I felt misled from the synopsis. Furthermore, some of the plot occurrences felt more convenient than realistic. Overall, though, I'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a new YA paranormal series.I absolutely loved the mythology for this book. It's based on Greek mythology, but not Hades and Persephone. Hades is involved, of course, and I do love the Hades and Persephone retellings, but I have to admit that it's refreshing to see a story starring another mythological character other than those two. Medusa is the main mythological creature in this story, and I loved it.I also loved the characters in this novel. Jodi is a very likable character, and she's not bratty like so many leading female YA characters are. I also loved Alex. He is fantastic, brave, and super sweet. Matt was also wonderful, and he really added a lot to the story. All of the characters are dynamic, well-developed, and believable.The pacing was a bit slow for my liking. Jodi's revelation came way too late in my opinion, and at times, she seemed super stupid not to be able to figure out what was going on. Also, some of her reactions to being stalked were unnatural to say the least. The secondary characters, such as Jodi's mom's reactions, also felt forced. A lot of the time, it felt more like the author was manipulating the story than it seemed like the story was unfolding at its own pace. Additionally, the ending felt forced and too convenient. I'll wait and see what happens next to make my final judgment on the ending, though.Final verdict? This book is interesting. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves paranormal stories that are based on mythology. Touch of Death sets up what's sure to be an interesting series.

$REVIEW.: The goal of this book is to awaken the reader's perspective of conflict as an opportunity to glorify God by seeking understanding and forgiveness.  Ken Sande provides excellent life stories to illustrate the real struggles we face in relationships.  He then seeks the Biblical answer to resolving the breakdown in those relationships.  Each part ends with an "As You Grow" section that helps to bring the study into your own life.Part 1 reviews the common responses to conflict using the slippery slope of Peacmakers.  He then shows that conflict can arise out of idols that we have established in our lives including an excellent examen of conscience that reveals that sin of idolatry.  He then reviews the basic goals and pattern for resolving conflict.Part 2 explores the four vital aspects of a peacemaking marriage.  Confession removes our old hackneyed and easy ways we confess "I'm sorry" and replaces it with a thorough and God pleasing confession.  Confrontation walks through the most avoided but needed part of relationships.  The section on listening is excellent.  Wise words shows how cautious we need to be as healers.  Forgiveness is the heart of this book for me.  It points out that forgiving is not a feeling it is a choice and requires us to make for promises - not to dwell on it, not to use it against them, not to talk with others, not to allow it to be a barrier.  The Young Peacemakers says it - Good thought, hurt you not, gossip never, friends forever.  In fact in forgiveness we replace those negative and forgiven hurts with positive ones.  Negotiation occurs when substantive issues needs to be worked out in a setting that is safe and seeks compromise and satisfaction between spouses.Part 3 begins to apply the principles laid out in the book.  The first sections focuses on how to teach the principles to your children seeking teachable moments and leading by example.  Chapter 9 and 10 gives life story examples of how conflict can be resolves with a child or an adult.Part 4 gives some warning signs to look for to diagnose a troubled marriage.  He then helps to understand the difficulties of both parties going to counseling and how to use negotiation to approach the obstacles to that end.  I found this section very insightful and right on with me and the marriages I've seen.  He then makes a plead to churches to be involved in a failing marriage, to use discipline when necessary.  Finally the author closes with the preventative "insurance" policies to support a strong marriage.
$SUMMARY.: What you do with conflict can change your life!

I am extremely grateful for sticking it out, because by the third book, I was absolutely hooked!!  The storyline is so intriguing and by the end of the series, I was a little sad there would be no more books.  But the sadness of it all coming to an end is worth it because Rose finally gets her man and her happy ending after the struggles she and Dimitri faced throughout the series.  All in all, VERY good series, with the last book being by far the best!

That is not the case at all with this humorous and adorable book. This title has incredibly colorful illustrations that fill the entire page.

$REVIEW.: Excellent book with specific strategies to drive your career the smart way, not the hard way.  The author approaches career development as one that should be self-determined, and not happen blindly.  I like his philosophy, "If it's to be...it's up to me."  One of the most helpful parts of the book was making career decisions that are authentic and congruent with your traits, values, and skills.  Making incongruent career moves and choices only leads to dissatisfaction, stress, and burnout.  The exercises in the book were thorough and helpful to determine these traits .  Also helpful was being aware of your stakeholder's rules and values, in order to determine the expectations are being met and rewarded.  Helpful resource.

$review_text.: Have you ever read one of those books that just blows you away? Not from the sex, Not from the sheer hotness of the guy, But from the astonishing emotions you experienced?When I was reading this book, I felt like I was watching a movie. I could see the wreck & hear the crunch of metal. I could see Araya singing "their" song to her mother, and see her beautiful light green eyes. And I could feel her heart breaking loss.Araya Noelle survived the wreck, at the cost of her eye sight. She was taken in by her aunt and uncle. These two people intentionally treat her as a slave and invalid. Refusing to introduce her to the world as a blind person.  Refusing to teach her how to live. All with ulterior motives...Ryland hates his life, but he sticks it out for his baby sister. Refusing to leave her behind and subject her to their parents' up-turned noses & insane ideas. His saving grace is meeting Araya in the park. Instantly captivated, smitten, intrigued.Through a course of events, Ryland & Araya will never be the same.This story is intense - emotionally. The environments these two are exposed to is shocking. So shocking, that you wonder how they will make it out intact.Where has Melissa Andrea been? The Edge of Darkness is her debut NA book, and all I can say is WOW!!

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by: VictoriaBook provided by: AuthorReview originally posted at Romancing the BookLove Slave to the Sicilian Billionaire is the fourth book in the Guilty Pleasure series by Jan Bowles. I chose this book because I liked the author. I have read several of her books and they are all great.Ella just lost her husband to suicide. She is drowning in her grief, so she acts out. Ella seems the type of person the needs the structure that being a submissive brings. The author did a great job with Ella's emotions. They came across as very real and multidimensional. This character had depth that many authors do not go into.Max is reeling from the death of his best friend and places the blame where he thinks it belongs at Kirk's wife's, Ella, feet. When Ella seeks him out he is reluctant to help her. Max does not want to betray a friend, even a dead one. After meeting her several months later he gives her a second chance.Max character was a character that I truly liked. He did not abuse his power. He was a fair person that lived by his morals. Ella's transformation from the beginning of the book to the end was nice to see. I love happy endings and the journey toward those happy endings. The chemistry these two had went beyond the bedroom.The only thing that would have made this story better would have been if the author was clearer on the timeline. The time period popped up now and then and was very distracting to the overall story line. This is one of the few books that I will go back and read. I love this series and cannot wait to read more from Jan Bowles.

$REVIEW.: This is a textbook example of how not to write a biography: gather a bunch of random quotes from magazines, pull comments from some old interviews, subjectively praise everything the star does, then blend it together in an order that makes no sense. There is mixed-up chronology, unrelated comments about something else tossed in the middle of a paragraph, asides about people that often have nothing to do with the actress, and some of the poorest writing style ever in a major star's biography. It's hard to believe this had an editor. At over 400 pages it's way too long, includes too many large chunks from other books (bordering on breaking copyright laws), and is too subjective to give a far view of the actress or anyone else. (He really slams Agnes Moorehead.) And the author constantly calling the actress &#34;Lizzie&#34; will drive you crazy (especially since it appears there were times that she didn't like that name used.) I still can't figure out some of Montgomery's life story after reading this--the marriage information is so confusing that I tried to go back and re-read sections but it was so bad the first time I just gave up. Believe all the bad reviews--though there may be a few interesting tidbits you didn't know before, this book isn't worth digging through in order to find them. One of the worst Hollywood biographies ever.

$review_text.: The amount of useful information this book contains is just phenomenal


However, I did find it widely repetitive
There were several points during my time reading it that I felt like I had read that section before


I guess this may be to reiterate the point, but if I found it useful the first time I would have remembered it (or flagged it to remember later).The one other thing that bothered me was the style of this book


Being long and having a short-width made it hard to read, and was also impossible to lay flat so I could take notes on things I wanted to remember
I feel like this is a weird thing to comment on, but the book shape absolutely drove me nuts.Overall, definitely a good book to purchase for a newly engaged couple

There are lots of really important "Remember to ask this" sections, and I love how it breaks down by category
If anything, there is too much helpful information (and how can I possibly remember it all with the stream of "helpful" information being thrown at me from in-laws and family members) ;)

$review_text.: Janice Hanna is one of my favorite authors. She has a spectacular ability to create a contemporary fiction novel, as well as historical novels. I had the pleasure of reviewing her previous Love Finds You novel (LFY in Poetry, Texas) and absolutely loved it. So, I was quite excited to have the opportunity to review Camelot for the author. And, what a delight it was!I had this book read in no time. It gripped me from page one and held me until the last page. Reading Amy's story of loving Steve since childhood was so sweet! Poor Amy, bless her heart, she is always trying to do something but it always turns out wrong. So, what happens to Amy when she comes up with the idea to bring Camelot Tennessee back on the map financially?Steve, well he was quite the character! He, too, has loved Amy since childhood, though he's quite shy about it. I had so much fun following Steve in this story...he was such a wonderful guy!This book is so full of laugh out loud moments, along with some pretty surprising twists! Janice Hanna created a wonderful novel blended with life-like characters, Amy's silly ideas, a new man in town, and God's never ending grace! If you like Knights on horses, and ladies-in-waiting, then this 5 star creation is PERFECT for you! I can't wait to read the next Janice Hanna novel!*This review is based on a complimentary copy which was provided for an honest review*

The High Sorcerer's Gift is one of those great fantasy reads that will take you away to another place! This book takes place in an alternate world, a true fantasy with humans battling seemingly alien conquerors. The main character a woman who is the most powerful sorcerer serves or rather is held to serve the invaders. She is torn and conflicted on the inside and well the story goes from there! I don't want to give any spoilers, but this is a great read and will keep you turning the pages! Great work! Thank you!

I found myself skipping through many chapters because they lacked relevance to me, and ones that held any interest ( cameras, social networking) were all over the place. This book lacks order to the chapters as well. While I understand the purpose of this free ebook is to give readers a sense of what the "for dummies" series offers, I would not be one to jump on purchasing any other titles. In fact this one I couldn't even finish.

$review_text.: A hilariously witty read. I spent over 80% of this book laughing and wondering what was going on in Elle's head. I'm so glad she was able to find her match and someone who excepts her. Trent Hamilton came into Elle's work and turned it upside down. He was the perfect piece to her puzzle and was patiently waiting for her to figure it out. Although most of the book was funny there was some real drama near the end. I wanted to cry and I'm glad there was a hero. I recommend this book if you are looking for a break and a good laugh.

$review_text.: Jennifer is a genius. I work in retail, and due to a rather hectic, and always changing schedule I found myself putting the pounds on fast. I tried a few of her other books, and they worked wonders! I mean dropping 2 pounds a week! But still sometimes I felt drained from work, and rarely took a lunch. I was eating once a day - either when I first got home, or if closing, really late at night. It killed my metabolism. With this diet solution I am able to eat one meal a day, and not feel like crap! Best of all its easy to work into your busy schedule! I just take my shaker around with me at work and when the time comes I'm ready! I just started the diet about a day or two ago and I already feel rejuvenated and can notice the difference!

$REVIEW.: I've heard so much about it - and all of it was excellent
 Perhaps I expected too much out of what is essentially a standard romance (but with a kid)
 The writing style was fun and I enjoyed the various characters with the exception of the unnaturally mature statements coming from a 9-year old boy.But, the book really wasn't going anywhere
 Bear isn't gay, Bear is in love, Bear is gay, Bear and Otter are in Love

 At about 70%, I thought is suddenly got good when the Bear's mother comes home
 She was obviously up to something and it felt like she was put up to it as well


 Then, Otter's ex from San Diego arrives and I KNOW something good is about to happen
 But, sadly, it didn't.They were both gone as quickly as they arrived, Bear and Otter reconcile and they all live happily ever after.I didn't dislike the book, I was just expecting more.

$REVIEW.: I chose this book because I've enjoyed everything else I've read by Anchee Min, she is a great storyteller and has an amazing talent of taking historical events of a culture that a lot of Americans know little about and making it come alive.  In real life, Anchee Min was ordered by the Chinese government to denounce Pearl Buck who was thought to be a threat to China by writing the truth behind the lives of women in China.This book started off a little slow...and what I mean by that is that it was more like several short stories divided up into chapters.  Once it started flowing, the ending came too quickly as is typical with books I really enjoy :)You'll love meeting the characters Willow Yee and Pearl Buck (who is actually a real person) and reading Min's version of Pearl's life growing up as an American in China as told from the point of view of her fictional best friend, Willow.  It starts off with them as children in a small village in China, Willow the only child of a beggar/thief, Pearl as the oldest daughter of an American missionary and his wife.  As they grow, their lives together weave in and out as Pearl travels to Shanghai to boarding school, then to the U.S. for college and Willow is sold off as a wife.  They both find love, loss, joy, success and though the miles separate them eventually, they never forget one another.

$REVIEW.: This was a good mystery story. Not great, but not bad either. I liked the main character, Dotsy. I liked the setting in Scotland, with the castle playing a role in the story.  I would have enjoyed learning even more about the area. Mushrooms also figure heavily in this story. I am not all that interested in mushrooms, but the book does go into some detail over the different types. Dotsy meets a potential love interest. I liked that subplot, and would like to see their relationship develop further, but I don't know how that would work out, with them being in two different countries.This book gets high points for the setting, and average points for the actual mystery. It was a pleasant read.

$review_text.: I am not exactly sure what I expected from C.J. McLane in this story, but I will say that I was pleasantly surprised. Harlequin steamy romance novels do not stand a chance against this author! This story is initially set in the beautiful sandy beaches of the Caribbean, where the two main characters all but literally run into each other on the beach. Elize, who introduces herself as Anna, has nearly slammed into Jude, who introduces himself as Joey. They are vacationing in the Caribbean in hopes of not encountering other rich and famous people that they know.&#8220;Anna&#8221; and &#8220;Joey&#8221; have a steamy, sexy, &#8220;bad girl&#8221; dirty one-time encounter with each other at a beach house that Joey is supposedly renting from a friend. After an incredible sexual encounter, they end up going their separate ways and returning to their usual lives and fianc&eacute;s. You will not want to miss reading this book and find out what surprise C.J. McLane has planned for the end of this story!

$REVIEW.: The sheer uniqueness of this murder mystery had me hooked from the first page. I don&#8217;t have much time to read, and I would find myself saying &#8220;ok, I can read for an hour&#8221; and then two hours later I had to force myself to put this book down. The main character, Bob, is so relatable to an everyday man: stubborn, cocky and unwilling to allow fear to show through his rugged exterior that you can&#8217;t help but love him. The supporting character, his guardian angel (who possesses many qualities that have you wondering how he got that position in the first place), adds a great sense of comic relief throughout the story.The plot is well developed and keeps you questioning who to trust, and who not to. The personalities fit right in with the location of the story, and the descriptive details of everything (including what Ann wears each time she enters a room), work to play a movie out in my head. This author has a wonderful gift for writing, and I hope to be able to read more of his books in the future. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family.

$REVIEW.: Seriously, I couldn't.  It was a good story with good characters that you wanted to be ok.  The story just drew me in immediately and I had to know what happened next.  After reading the premise of the story I was very interested so I went to the reviews (when looking for books I often read the bad reviews 1st if it's an author I'm not familiar with, I figure if the worst review doesn't put me off then it's probably going to be ok) and these didn't lessen my desire to read this book and I'm really glad !  I really wanted to know what happened with these guys.  Some folks have said they didn't believe the relationship could develop as it did, I don't see why not.  It comes off as very natural  The main characters are well developed and likeable with all their flaws.  The flashbacks didn't lessen the story for me at all, enhanced it if nothing else and really helped you see how Cam and Austin had come to rely on each other so much.  It was hot where hot was needed, tender where tender was needed.  I almost want to pick it up and read it all over again, I probably will read it again at some point.I absolutely recommend this book!  Yes, it has M/M so if that puts you off it might not be your deal but that isn't the focus of the story.

$REVIEW.: That's probably not really high praise, but this book just doesn't seem as useful as &quot;The Well Fed Writer&quot; or some of Bob Bly's books on the subject of freelance copywriting.To her credit, the author is sometimes strikingly blunt and honest, admtting that it will probably take years for most to reach a six figure income (if ever). But she also seems to spend a little too much time patting herself on the back and occassionally becoming to harsh. I don't know, maybe she was going for a brutally honest approach. It does work at times but it also is off putting at other times.She does offer some ideas that others don't really cover in their books. Still, I would recommend getting &quot;The Well Fed Writer&quot; first and then supplementing the information there with this book. It certainly can't hurt to include it in your arsenal if you are seeking to become a freelance writer.

$review_text.: Long the Mile was a heart wrenching and heart-filled story of two men whose pasts were different but along the way found commonality in the present and future.Judah was recently released from prison

A self- made man, caught in the scheme of insider trading; he lost everything while serving his time

Money, home, friends and faith.Toby, also homeless, had almost resigned himself to his circumstances, but still harbored some semblance of hope


The two men forged a bond that was beyond the physical and ventured into survival.Ally Blue painted a tale of survival of the fittest
A problem that exist with today&#8217;s homeless

Ms
Blue&#8217;s portrayal was not one of fantasy but of reality as Judah and Toby traversed the hardship of homelessness, ambiguity, and general feelings of despair


Each man reacted to his circumstances based on his past life, but soon learned that if a future was to be had then his way of thinking needed to change.Ms

Blue&#8217;s writing was gutsy as she wrote of a bit of humanity in trying times


I adored her portrayal of both men and the love and bond created between the two

Judah and Toby were characters with little to no hope yet each possessed the will to live and better their circumstances

They both touched my heart strings and had me cheering for an HEA.Long the Mile is a tale well worth any readers&#8217; time

$REVIEW.: ...and broke my stone underwear the first time I heard many of these jokes a very, very, very long time ago. Many of the jokes in this book that are not positively ancient are simply not funny unless you are a miserable, old alcoholic misogynist ass*ole with an extremely basic 8th grade public school education who grew up and lived his whole life somewhere like rural Ohio or Little Rock, Arkansas, and there are also more than a few jokes even that guy wouldn't find funny.There ARE some funny jokes in this book, you'll just have to read through a lot of jokes you've probably already heard about 5 million times as well as a ton that just aren't funny to get to the good ones. If you have that kind of patience, are brain damaged, or willing to do whatever it takes to uncover a few truly funny dirty jokes you probably haven't heard before, then you will probably be very happy purchasing this book. However, if old, stupid, and/or vaguely unsettling, disturbing jokes that are just boring or too gross to be funny make you want to kill something, you probably should not buy or read this book unless you heavily medicate yourself first and even then I'd think you'd want to get a different book because it seems like a waste of good drugs to me to read this book after taking them.

I thumbed through a couple of pages and laughed out loud...sat down and cried with laughter through the entire book.  This is simply hilarious, especially if you had a parent / grandparent / aunt / neighbor who made things like this in the 1950s-1970s, or if you have half an interest in kitsch. The annotations / narrative from Ms. McClure are so funny that I wish I could have her over for drinks at my house every weekend. Witty, biting and just plain funny.

$REVIEW.: Mark Matthews has written a chilling work of horror. Right from the onset the description of the antagonist's creation is mortifying setting up the rest of the book for success. The characters and their depth are what bring this story to life and Mr. Matthews managed to create a dark but convincing back story for each of them. Macon is a tattoo artist with trouble focusing on the important things in life. Erin, his partner and mother of their six year old daughter Lyric, has her own troubled past. Their connection with one another and love for their child helps create the atmosphere of concern from the onset.(Spoiler alert) Their stay in Mexico before Macon's big marathon in San Diego goes terribly awry. While Macon is out on a morning training run on a route suggested by their friendly hotel clerk, he has a run in with a group of homeless people. Continuing on his way Macon discovers he's being followed. At the hotel Erin has another awkward encounter with the clerk, this time startling her by finding him alone with her daughter. The encounter is enough to spur Erin to go out in search of Macon when the two are kidnapped and hidden away in a drug smuggling tunnel between Mexico and the U.S...For the entire review please go to my blog at [...]

Between the names of the staff--which I can overlook and roll my eyes--the fact that in a short period of time the hero was able to diagnose a mysterious illness AND create a serum for a cure in a makeshift lab set up in a castle was beyond plausible.Then the whole goverment of a democratic monarchy and voting by subjects to approve a king ... geesh.A fanciful tale indeed.

$review_text.: I really can't find anything worth recommending about this book at all

 I mean, we start with a main character who's totally unlikeable, then pair him up with the even-more-unlikeable, titular Clay
 And they progress, but if anything, they move backward, and not forward


 I missed the descriptions of the dazzling backdrops of Oahu and Kauai that were mentioned on the back cover

 And I really can't see how anyone could compare this to Catcher In The Rye, another novel about a self-absorbed, unlikeable teen, but at least that young man wised up and realized that he was in fact, self-absorbed and unlikeable.And I must confess my general distaste for fiction that doesn't end so much as stop


 There are authors who make this work as a literary device, but I got a much stronger sense here that the author had just run out of things to say.

$review_text.: Noam Chomsky - 9-11Book ReviewBy Richard Edward NobleThis book is a group of interviews with professor and Dissident and Chief on or relating to the 9-11 attack on the twin towers and the policies and attitudes that have come about because of this event.Anyone who has read anything by Chomsky knows that he recognizes two types of terrorism. The one we are all familiar with and another that most do not recognize.Let's call the one we are all familiar with Radical Terrorism.Radical Terrorism can be sponsored by a single person, a small group, or an organized band or cell group bent on destruction for any number of different reasons.Chomsky distinguishes this type of terrorism from a second type of terrorism. Let's call it Elitist, State Sponsored Terrorism.It is clear that the Professor considers State Sponsored Terrorism not only the worst and most serious but the root cause of all other types of terrorism.For the most part he considers Radical Terrorism the response to State Sponsored Terrorism.In other words, it is not governments reacting to the evil deeds of radical terrorists but radical terrorist responding to the evil deeds of governments.He makes this case over and over and over in all of his books.He makes a good case and can defend it with logic, and statistics.The horrible event of 9-11 changed the governmental policies of the world.He makes reference to "The Bush Doctrine."The Bush Doctrine is the governmental policy of preemptive attack. Preemptive attack is the policy whereby a government can strike militarily against another government on the assumption that this country and its government pose a possible threat to the national security of the attacking nation.Chomsky says that Bush was not the originator of this policy. Reagan attacked Libya and Muammar Gaddafi on the same grounds.He then points out the reciprocal moral principle based on the notion that if "Big Daddy" can do it, then "Baby Huey" can do it too. In other words, if the leader and moral standard bearer for the world (U.S.A.) says that it can attack a potential enemy on the grounds that it might present a future danger, then why can't Iran attack Iraq or China attack Japan or North Korea attack the United States based on the same international moral standard established by the new Bush Doctrine.It is very easy to see how the establishment of the Bush Doctrine has changed the world and made it a much more dangerous place.This new policy of preemptive aggression and wars of choice established firmly since and in response to the attacks of 9-11 has also stimulated a worldwide nuclear arms race. Now every nation, even smaller nations, will want to have a few nuclear bombs as a deterrent to threats of preemptive strikes by larger nations.The attack on 9-11 was bad enough but the U.S. response was worse.Reading anything by Noam Chomsky is a new experience for most people. He is called an extremist and a radical but most of what he says is very logical and sensible. Everything he claims he backs up with references, facts and figures. Every Chomsky book is a personal instruction in foreign affairs and contemporary history. He specializes in Elitist State Sponsored Terrorism of which war itself is a crucial part. The problem is that most of us have accepted the illogical arguments of our governments and therefore Professor Chomsky confuses our established, accepted prejudice.Most American readers consider Chomsky a U.S.A. basher and folks from Israel feel much the same. Certainly he is a basher of these two nations but he is more than that. He is really a government basher. Chomsky is an avowed anarchists and considers organized governments evil. So he bashes everybody's government - China, Russia, India, etc. In reading Chomsky the reader has to avoid or put aside his national prejudices and even patriotism and analize the author's logic.Chomsky is a firm advocate of "speaking truth to power." It is impossible for any free thinking human being to discount all of Chomsky's arguments.This book is a small book. I finished it in two days. It is well worth reading.Richard Edward Noble, the Hobo Philosopher, is a writer and the author of "Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book One."

$REVIEW.: This is the story of Walden Bear....a little boy who when presented with the question of what he wants to be when he grows up, answered simply....a BEAR.  Unusual?  Certainly.  Impossible?  No...though his teacher would have him believe otherwise.  Push comes to shove, Walden's mother gets involved (REALLY involved) and when all is said and done, suffice it to say that Mrs. Hunter is out...but Mrs. Lions is in!The real glory behind this amazing story besides the obvious and the illustrations is the message.  Ms. Dweck is notorious for including something for kiddos (well, and readers in general) to take away from the read besides entertainment value and in this case it's a BIG one...you can be ANYTHING you want to be!  All it takes is dedication, heart, perseverance and determination, and you can achieve any goal you set and surmount any obstacle placed before you.  Of course, it never hurts to have "mama Bear" in your corner as well, but you, yourself and I are the ones that will get the job done.In the end, it's an adora-BEAR read that is PAW-sitively wonderful in both story and visual content, THIS...this is one for you.  Recommended for little ones just discovering the world as well as those up and coming in number still finding themselves.  It's a wonderful read with much to enjoy and filled with imagination to boot.  Oh...and one more thing.  At story's end, there are also some playful add in's and edutainment pages for further learning opportunities.  Talk about a great combination.

I was rather surprised to find that I was connecting with characters that I didn't necessarily like in the prior books, but it was a nice change.  I think R.J.'s writing is only getting better and she continues to write good stories appropriate for any age.  I'm a parent and I bought these books for me, but they're some of the very few books that I'd be willing to let my kids read - which they're doing now.

$REVIEW.: Shelby and Dean Davis are a very touching couple.Dean, the hunky ex-military man come's into the story a bit of a broken man. We immediately see what a levelheaded, supportive, and loving wife Shelby is. Their lives have recently gone from structural Army life, to make do civilians. Shelby works at a local Dairy Queen and Dean is still dancing around his guilt, offering little support to his family. I actually didn't like Dean in the beginning of this story. He struck me as a very selfish man.There was a point in the story when I almost didn't think the author was going to be able to redeem this man, but she did so beautifully. Guilt is an emotion that eats at people from the inside out, and Dean carried his hard. I loved the scene in this book that caused Dean to truly evaluate himself. It was very touching and I would elaborate but that would spoil the moment for those who haven't yet read this delightfully touching story.Shelby is an astounding wife and mother. She's keen to see what's going on under the surface with her family, but wisely chooses when to speak and when not too. One day at work, she gets an unexpected surprise that turns out to be just the life changing event they all needed. When Shelby is unexpected hospitalized, Dean turns into a new man. He and Morgan mend the rift in their relationship, his job is going well, and he has meaning in his life again.The family grows close again once Shelby comes home and the touching little surprise at the end will leave a tear in your eye wishing there were more.There's a tiny little part in this story where Miss McLeod leaves us hanging. Cara, the nurse that Shelby becomes close with has a conversation with her husband that Shelby can't help but overhear and the side she heard didn't sound good. She wants to reach out to her friend but the timing is bad, she's just getting ready to leave the hospital.Is there a story with Cara and Kevin coming soon? yes?

$review_text.: Meet Me Under the Ceiba, written by Silvio Sirias, is the  chronicle of the murder of a young woman named Adela by an unnamed researcher who became fascinated by her death.  Through a series of interviews with her family, friends and even her murderers to try to piece together the events leading up to her death and her last moments.This book is not necessarily a mystery: we know who her murderers are from the very beginning and we know exactly why they killed her.  The narrator uncovers small mysteries that paint a clearer picture of Adela's last day on earth, but what this is really about is giving Adela a fair representation, trying to uncover the lies that have been protecting her murderers.Adela, a lesbian, was passionately in love with the beautiful Ixelia, a gorgeous young woman who had been abused her whole life and was eventually sold by her mother into a relationship with Don Roque, a powerful and cruel older man.  When Adela tries to rescue Ixelia from her fate, crosses the wrong paths and Don Roque and Ixelia's  mother, Do&ntilde;a Erlinda, decide to get rid of her once and for all.  Adela's story is tragic and heartbreaking; you spend most of the novel hoping that something will change, that Adela will be uncovered as alive.  She was so obviously loved in her small community.I learned a lot about the state of LGBT rights in Nicaragua and it is very difficult to read about.  In Nicaragua and much of Latin America, being part of the LGBT community means that in the eyes of some people, you are less than a person.  During the investigation and the trial, many people simply referred to Adela as "la cochona", the dyke, never using her name.  Adela is reduced to nothing but her sexuality, she no longer has an identity.Meet Me Under the Ceiba begins with a quote from Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a  M&aacute;rquez: "none of us could continue living without an exact knowledge of the place and mission assigned to us by fate."  There is certainly some inspiration from Chronicle of a Death Foretold in Sirias' narration, but it is more straightforward in Meet Me Under the Ceiba.  There are many intriguing levels of narration since the story is told completely in flashbacks and interviews, the painful reality is that because Adela is no longer here, we will never really know what happened to her.Meet Me Under the Ceiba is an important novel.  It addresses Nicaraguan LGBT rights and also the failure of the judicial system.  Most importantly, it paints a tragic portrait of one woman's unfortunate death in the hopes of stopping future deaths.  Siarias' story is based on the true murder of Aura Rosa Pav&oacute;n and at the end he describes which aspects of the story were fact and which were fiction, but in the end I am so grateful that Sirias told this story, because it is absolutely one that needed to be heard.  I definitely recommend Meet Me Under the Ceiba, not only for the important issues that it puts out into the open, but also because it is a highly readable novel that will keep you an edge.

$REVIEW.: Great book! And great series&#8230; at least that&#8217;s my impression. Bittersweet Magic is the actually the first book I&#8217;ve read in The Order Series and by Nina Croft in general.Now I can honestly say she became one of my favorite authors with just this one book!The world she builds for The Order is modern yet very interesting, new, and fabulous. It reminds me a bit of Larissa Ione&#8217;s Demonica and Lords of Deliverance world. And I mean this in a good way! I love Larissa Ione&#8217;s books. However Nina Croft&#8217;s world is no cheap copy. It has its own charm and a lot of new aspects which make the whole setting of the book extremely interesting and pleasurable. There are so many races&#8230; Vampires, Demons, Fae, Werewolves, Witches,  of course humans and some I will not tell you about because it would ruin the ending for you ;)The characters are well developed and they instantly caught me in their story and I had to know what happens next all the time. I couldn&#8217;t put the book down.Roz is a tough woman&#8230; at least that&#8217;s what she herself believes. Others around her see her more caring side a lot more than Roz herself. In my opinion this is something that is very hard to express for an author&#8230; a character that lies to herself about what she wants or is. Most of the time it&#8217;s not really believable and I get the impression the author does it just to make the character more likable to the reader&#8230; you know what I mean, try to give the character flaws where there actually are none.However, Nina does this amazingly well! I loved Roz and I really believed she thought about herself that way&#8230; okay, I&#8217;m rambling here and it&#8217;s a bit confusing even for me.  I hope you know what I&#8217;m trying to say ;)Piers is a very old vampire and acts like one. He is dominant, arrogant, sexy, and always gets what he wants&#8230; women. Of course now he wants Roz.The two are great together and alone. I think this is something important in a good book. The H/h have to be great characters on their own in order to make a great couple and therefore a great book. Roz does not depend on Piers but nevertheless they are there for each other.Another big fat plus of this book is that it does not give away too much of the first book. Nina Croft does not re-tell the whole story of the first book in the series (which is also not necessary to get what&#8217;s going on). At the end of Bittersweet Magic I still don&#8217;t really know what happened to Tara and Christian and I love it. This way I can still read the first book. Otherwise it would just be boring to read it when you already know everything that&#8217;s going to happen.I loved the side characters!!  Asmodai is awesome! He&#8217;s just hot. I hope he gets his own book. Also the other guys working for the order were really cool. That&#8217;s the only way to describe them. They are just cool.I want more of the Order! I can only recommend this to paranormal fans!

$REVIEW.: This book was a good Action/Adventure that never stopped; it's a real page-turner. The setting was Russia, Mongolia, England during the Bolshevik Revolution. Turner immerses the reader in the story, drawing them in with excellent character building. I liked Christopher Shepherd, the main character, cared about what happened to him. There were characters of every sort, and most were well developed. There was the cold, murderous agent bent on destroying his targets, not necessarily for the good of the people, but perhaps more for the pleasure he felt at doing so. There were good, there were bad, there were blind underlings who followed orders blindly, and there were people who lent a bit pf comic relief from the tension and pace of the story.The Last Eagle includes glimpses of the cruelty of war, enough to make it believable, but not so much that it changes the focus away from Christopher completing his mission. I had a hard time setting my Kindle down.The ending did feel a tad rushed.There were a few things that I deducted a star for: (in limited instances) descriptive writing that felt cliche. And, this book could benefit from a good edit: repeated words, some homonyms used in place of the correct word.In spite of the few problems it has, the sense of story that Turner unleashes it its pages makes me happily recommend The Last Eagle to anyone who likes Action/Adventure.

$review_text.: There is no easy way to deal with death.  Whatever your age, though it is a natural part of the circle of life, the finality of it can be something a person cannot get a grip on, nor can they overcome without the right guidance or opportunity to gain answers.  For children, the topic is even more imposing.  I have found this short and very concise piece of work to be invaluable.  In a reader-friendly "Question and Answer" type format, it addresses not only death of the elderly through old age or disease, but the more difficult topics such as suicide, accidents, murder and even terror attacks.  The language is not condescending or vague, and the explanations are in no way cliches, such as, "it was meant to be..." which often open up more questions in children's minds, and if left unaswered, can fester into depression, withdrawal, and other behavioral issues.  The book focuses on scenarios and how adults can answer the child's questions, with ages ranging from as young as five through 17.  In each case, the adult creates an open, safe environment for the child to express their thoughts, fears, worries, or even guilt and blame.  Religious beliefs are also touched upon and loss of a parent, sibling or family pet is especially helpful and insightful.  The suggested responses are carefully worded according to the age of the child (too much info at a young age is not recommended and not enough for older children still leave holes in their understanding).  I found myself highlighting often in this little book since my children certainly have been exposed to enough situations where death and dying were very real to them, and I didn't always know the right way to approach their questions with careful honesty.  This book has already become an important reference and will be highly recommended in my school as well as to friends and colleages.

Rhian made me love him because he always thought he'd be on the outside looking in with Garrick and Savannah but the tables are turned when something happens to him and Garrick can't get to him, in comes Savannah and he can't help but to fall this strong extraordinary woman that also loves his boyfriend.

$review_text.: The Spanish Civil War has always been an interest of mine, and I looked forward to reading this novel. But I found it a major disappointment, with a disjointed narrative and poorly-drawn characters whose motives are inexplicable. Sergeant Tejada is one of the silliest characters ever put on paper. One moment he's a hard-core Guardia Civile who shoots an unarmed woman in the head, no questions asked, the next he's in love with a Communist teacher and protective of her student. Implausible, incomprehensible, and unsatisfying.

$review_text.: First off I am not a juicing guru and am fairly new to juicing. I bought a juicer for my husband as a gift and found I absolutely love the taste of green drinks. I was thinking of trying a green juice cleanse or diet and saw the stars on this book and was really looking forward to reading it.The book's page one says &#34;Despite the title suggesting diet, this book is more of a supplement to the diet you already enjoy&#34; the author explains so briefly about using the green drinks as a dietary supplement this is definitely not a book for weight loss or cleansing. The author suggests one drink a day, optimally up to three with your regular meal schedule or as it says, before your biggest meals. There is no layout of any particular diet plan and I feel a bit mislead for the book to be called &#34;the healthy green drink diet&#34;! (the word diet isn't even listed in the index. That is how little it is spoken of)As for the rest of the book, I did like how he broke down each green in 1-2 short paragraphs about their benefits and nutrients. That was my favorite part. I do wish since he gave the amount (I.e. 2 cups of spinach) there were calories listed. Eating healthy for losing or maintaining weight calorie counting is very important. Also, it would have been helpful to add the calculated nutrient facts (and calories) for each recipe listed, not just listed singularly under the green produce the author described.I cannot account for the smoothie recipes since we primarily juice, but I found the juicing recipes to mostly have fruit. And out of the 25 juicing recipes only 2 contain no fruit (and one of the two added water). This is particularly an issue for my 13yr old nephew who has type 1 diabetes and is trying to find ways of staying healthy. The quantity of juice from some recipes was also very minimal some less than 5oz. (Such as the cold killah) and he uses frozen fruit and adds water to some juicing recipes.So I liked the info on some of the greens since there was nutrients and the serving size (but I think you wouldn't get all of those nutrients if you are just juicing because of the left over pulp). Also the section describing briefly the different kinds of juicers I.e. centrifugal, masticating and triturating but I already had purchased my juicer and researched what kinds there were. He recommended the one we have, so that was pleasing. The pictures are lovely and take up 2/3 of the book.So, it was one of those books I should have went to the bookstore to look at first. For the $10 I took a chance and it didn't work out. If anyone has suggestions on a good green drink diet (weight loss type) book or how to do a green drink cleanse book I would love a recommendation!

$REVIEW.: "Looking For Palestine" by Najla Said (July 2013).  The author just happens to be the only daughter of Edward Said, who was born a Christian-Arab in Jerusalem in Nov. 1935,but  grew up in Cairo as a teenager, who married a Lebanese woman, and a  Columbia University professor known for having written `'Orientalism''.Even as a very young child the author sadly suffered from both low self-esteem, confused cultural self-identity, an eating disorder, and had a perceived over-weight issue, as she tried to defuse her darker Arab skin-tone into her WASPish NYC neighborhood.While many of her schoolmates were religious, her family wasn't - they were secular, but partook in the religious holidays for fun; this left her she wrote: "As a little girl, I had desperately wanted my parents to believe in something, anything the way `other people' seemed to, but every time I tried to latch on to a part of my identity, my parents would take it away from me" (p. 25).Sadly, despite counseling, she suffered from her inferiority disorder from being a young child through to being a young woman in her twenties.  She gives little insight into her father, while having his love, she felt estranged from him, apparently from a lack of attention as he hob nosed with other university types. As a child she enjoyed her trips with her parents to Lebanon (and the West Bank, Jordan, & Gaza), but disliked visiting there during its 1980s civil war.  As a child she was too young to understand the causes behind the conflict, and as a young adult, she didn't seem to have a broad understanding of that conflict, nor that of the Palestinian-Israel intifada fighting.Although aware of it, she may not have even read her father's book: "Orientalism", as she does not discuss it, nor his other writings.  A reader develops the impression that Najla didn't really try to educate herself to the nuances of the Middle East conflicts, nor why Muslims in the Orient wanted her to dress modestly while traveling therein, although she was trying to understand her DNA heritage association with it.She was repulsed when Palestinian Pres. Arafat kissed her on both cheeks, she "wiped my hand across my face in disgust.  Daddy had often asked me why I disliked Arafat so much, since he was `the only leader we have' "(p. 179) - but didn't ask why Arafat was the `only' leader that the Palestinians had.Regarding the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, she noted "Although when they arrived they were welcomed with sympathy, now they are clearly resented"  (p. 250), but she doesn't discuss why they were now resented.  She doesn't explain why Arabs refer to Palestinians as "rawafia".Anyway, near the end of the book she finally connects to her Palestinian identity; she is happy, well, almost, maybe.  Her rebound continues.  A book more for a look at the problems of behavioral insecurity overall, than about understanding the (Shia-Sunni) Middle East conflict.  One is left feeling that something is missing in her troubling memoir: analysis.

$review_text.: This was my first time reading an Anthology and I have to say, it definitely leaves you wanting more. I mean, I knew these were all short stories, but I didn&#8217;t realize how short until I breezed through a few of them in a matter of minutes. I&#8217;ll admit, it was a bit frustrating to not really know all of these characters and their story in depth, but I think each other did a good job of at least introducing us to what would be amazing stories, some more than others, of course.What I loved most about this anthology, and what I hope anyone who reads this will take away from it, is that we get a sense of the writing style of various authors all in one place. While there were some that I know and love, which drew me to this originally, there were also I knew nothing about and I enjoyed reading their works. Naturally, there were some stories I devoured and others I &#8220;skimmed&#8221; through, but for the most part, I enjoyed all the stories.I imagine this is somewhat shorter than other anthologies out there, since it focuses on a particular theme. I loved that not all the &#8220;first times&#8221; were based on sex. There were quite a few, but also some about experiencing new things, opening yourself up, and discovering who you really are and what you really want. You&#8217;ve definitely got all kinds of romance that is sure to please everyone.If you&#8217;re looking for a mix of romantic times from various authors, you&#8217;ll want to give this a read, for sure.

Prof. Skousen does a masterful job of explaining the roots of communism starting with Marx, Engels and Lenin and then taking us through the ups and downs of the last century. The details are clear and painful. The leftist agenda, strongly supported by key players in the Obama administration, academia, the media and Hollywood are pushing hard. An increasingly poorly educated population, knowing little and paying little attention to the lessons of the past, is setting the country up to relive the tragedies all over again.

$REVIEW.: &#8220;Boy, Snow, Bird,&#8221; by Helen Oyeyemi, is a dark and disturbing novel about self-identity in a complex world simmering with prejudice and misery

The author&#8217;s highly stylized prose is unique, stunning, and brilliantly imaginative

The book is full of inventive, dazzling, and lyrical surprises

The tale teems with well-known, as well as quite obscure, fairy tale motifs


The author also enchants by sprinkling magical realism in odd places here and there in the mists of the plot&#8217;s everyday reality

The realistic and the magical worlds collide and play off against one another adding emphasis and making the realism appear just that much more grotesque
At times the book reads like a strange brew of marvelous modern macabre.But this otherwise outstanding book failed me in a significant way
Despite the author&#8217;s remarkable and obvious literary talents, I felt emotionally detached from the disturbing subject as well as from the characters

This was a novel that appealed mainly to the intellect rather than the heart
This is primarily why I hesitated and did not give this work five stars


I wanted more of an emotional connection with the characters.There are three main characters: Boy, Snow, and Bird

Boy is a beautiful, but emotionally damaged woman, the odd survivor of a bizarre abusive childhood

After developing into a ravishing twenty-year-old platinum blond, she manages to escape her dehumanizing family situation and flees to a small town in New England


There she makes a life for herself, meets a young widower, and marries him despite the fact that she is not in love
Boy values freedom too much to allow love to enter her heart


She has never known love; how can she give it?Snow Whitman is Boy&#8217;s husband&#8217;s six-year-old daughter


Boy is both strongly attracted and terrified by this child


Snow is arrestingly beautiful
She is the type of child everyone idolizes and desires, the type of child that has the world at her beck and call


Soon after Boy marries, she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a daughter named Bird
The new baby is black
As a consequence, Boy discovers that her husband and many of the other people she has come to know as family and friends are actually all white-skinned blacks who have long been passing for whites

What should Boy do with Bird? What should she do with Snow? She feels ensnared in an environment that worships whiteness


She fears Bird will be psychologically damaged if she is allowed to grow up in a black world dominated by an idolized white child
Can the issue of Bird in their lives force the family to abandon its long-held deceit? How will this all play out?The book has such a large cast of secondary characters that I often found it difficult to keep track of them

If you read a digital version, you can always run a search on any name to help refresh your memory about any character and how he or she relates to the plot

However, if you read this book in print, I recommend that you take careful notes to aid your memory; you&#8217;ll need them

The book also contains a lot of unfamiliar black cultural references that you may need to look up on the Internet
This helped me in understanding what was going on, so I again recommend that you take the time to do this if any terms are unfamiliar to you


A lot of the new terms have to do with global ethnic fairy tale motifs.This novel is complex

$REVIEW.: The thing that ruined it for me, is that the summary says the uncle is controlling, but in reality he's an utter tyrant. There's actually a huge difference. On top of that, the bouncer assaults her. She isn't acting out a fantasy to gain independence. She's doing something that appalls her because she's desperate. I just couldn't get over that, so there was no spirit of fun for me.

$REVIEW.: I loved the way that the author developed the main character in this book into a person that was no longer selfish, uncaring and self-centered into a loving and caring Christian. I loved that way that she showed that when we become a Christian we don't have to say a word, just live the life of a Christian and people will take notice. I really recommend this book!!

In addition, I have just been  hired to teach a design concepts class at The George Washington  University.Coming from that background, I read this book for a class I  took at the University of Maryland College Park called &quot;Editing and  Document Design.&quot; I found the book a very good guide to design, very  concise, and very effective with explaining principles of design.My one  big complaint about the book is that Williams is often too blunt with her  advice. Otherwise, it would have gotten a full five stars.

$REVIEW.: ***HONEST OPINION REQUESTED BY AUTHOR..CONTAINS SPOILERS****This is not your little tale of Little red Riding Hood..this is more up to speed and with the sexual tension and frustration going on in this book..I can't wait for the next one.In this book we follow Red who is a bounty hunter for everything immortal..you do your clan or immortal family wrong and beware because she is after you. Except something caught her interest one night at a local bar..his name was Felix a vampire that was on the lookout for someone else. Red maybe over 300 years old but she can play a giddy 18-25 year old as well and that is what caught Felix and then things get crazy after that. Felix takes her to his clan's home and they begin to notice something different about her..they can tell she is a vampire but there is something else..in comes Vince the wolf alpha and man is he intense he confirms the vampires suspension that she is a hybrid half vampire and half wolf.From then on out there is sexual tension between Vince and Red and sexual frustration between Red and Felix so much to the point that I wanted to throw my iPad a couple of times lol. Red tags along with Felix on a case that he is working on which is the fact that someone by the name of Ambrose is going around and collecting and killing other immortals. When Red sees Ambrose for the first time there is something family about him but she cannot pinpoint it until she is close enough and realizes that its her........Sorry you have to read the book for that one lol

$REVIEW.: This book has the wrong title. It should be called The James Bond Film Archive or something similar. As one reviewer notes you need a table and lamp in order to read it. And when you do you'll notice how much James Bond related information is left out.Where is Barry Nelson? Where are the 007 video games? What about toys and collectables? The books by Raymond Benson, John Gardner, Jeffery Deaver and my favorites, Young Bond by Charlie Higson? The daily comic strips? Spinoffs like Matt Helm and Flint? Or for TV: The Man from UNCLE, Get Smart and Wild Wild West? Nick Fury of SHIELD? Satires like Ted Mark's Man from ORGY and  the Austin Powers movies?James Bond is so much more than twenty-three films and I'm very disappointed that this huge, heavy book ignores so much of what Ian Fleming helped unleash.It covers the films well with tons of lovely photgraphs but that's about all. I'm glad LIFE has a book out that covers at least a little more than just the movies. And for a lot less money.

I don't give many five star reviews but this story merits all five. This is the first title I&#8217;ve read by Kelly Moran, but it won&#8217;t be the last. Coming from a large family, I loved the chaos of the Covic&#8217;s interactions. Quirky, charming and fun, the diverse cast of characters were a great backdrop to the blooming romance between Cam and Troy. Ms. Moran moved the couple&#8217;s relationship from friendship to love with perfect pacing while making me laugh, cry and cheer. Well done.

$REVIEW.: Raphael is a vampire Lord. His territory lies west of the Rockies. Raphael never thought anyone would dare cross him. Unfortunately, he was wrong. Someone has kidnapped the only female he would give his life for and he will do whatever it takes to get her back safely! Raphael will even stoop to hiring a human P.I.Cynthia Leighton used to be a police officer but she's had enough of male politics to last her a lifetime. After leaving the force she started her own private investigation firm. She is one of the few that caters to humans and vampires. When Lord Raphael comes to her for help she is intrigued but wary. Cynthia never could resist a good mystery and this kidnapping ranks high on the mysterious scale.Raphael finds Cynthia appealing for more than her investigative skills. There is something about the woman that drives him batty. Cynthia is having a hard time resisting Raphael's charms as well. The sexy vampire may be lord of his kingdom but Cynthia is not about to let him control her world. Can these two alphas join without killing each other? Will they find the missing woman before it's too late?Wow, I'm not sure where to start with the review because Raphael blew me away! D. B. Reynolds has developed one well crafted premiere to what is sure to be a killer series. Raphael is filled with strong characters that give this story great backbone. I love the fact that you really get to know Raphael and Cynthia before they get to know each other better. It really gives the characters a stronger sense of identity and gives the story stronger roots. As soon as Raphael and Cynthia meet you can feel that connection. The heat flows between them but each character is reluctant to cross the professional boundaries and get involved with someone from the opposite species. I love Cynthia's no-nonsense, kick ass attitude. She may be a bit scared of these vampires but she's not about to let them know. She may act first and think second sometimes but I couldn't help loving this sassy vixen. Raphael is definitely an indomitable character but he does have a few weaknesses. He is used to being in charge and I love that Cynthia pushes all those buttons. She is not about to take orders from him without a reason. I could watch these two go round after round with each other and not get tired of it. They have such fabulous chemistry I just love reading about them.Raphael also features tons of sensational story! It starts off with a dusting and never lets up the intense action. Ms. Reynolds has mixed romance, action and mystery that sizzles and keeps you enthralled throughout! Raphael is an incredible suspenseful story that will leave you begging for more at the end I guarantee it! I cannot wait to read the next story in this clever series.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: Ok I am so disappointed in this book.  It started out good but became monotonous and boring to the point I could not finish and that is very unusual for me.  Riveria was abused.  Shan is too good to be true but Riveria is constantly getting mad or scared.  No matter what Shan does she still is scared.  That is fine but it is constant and then they have sex.  That is pretty much the book in a nutshell.  Riveria was so annoying that I became more irritated than sympathetic.  I could not warm to either character and the chemistry just wasn't there. This is the first book I have read by this author and doubt will read another.

$REVIEW.: David Ray Griffin, long known for his contributions to the fields of philosophy and theology, turns his logical mind and keen powers of analysis on the official story of the events of 9/11 and finds it, frankly, incredible.Griffin has performed an invaluable public service by writing this book, and at no small risk to his reputation.  By exposing the flaws in the official version of these events he raises the possibility that mainstream journalists find too terrible to contemplate: that elements of the U.S. government, and possibly even the President, were complicit in bringing these events about.To those (and they are many) who would dismiss such a suggestion out of hand, I would recommend taking this book seriously.  Griffin is no wild-eyed fanatic, and one could not accuse of him of making unwarranted logical leaps.  He treats this topic with the same care and rational rigor exhibited in his philosophical works.  This book is not so much an indictment of the Bush Administration as a call for a serious public investigation (and not a mere whitewash) of events that have been used to justify unprecedented infringements upon the civil liberties of Americans at home and imperial adventures abroad.Ultimately, such an investigation (were it ever to occur) would likely lead to impeachment.  If the evidence points in the direction that Griffin's analysis suggests, the current government of the United States is guilty of the highest crimes imaginable.  It is vital to our democracy that this book receive the widest possible readership, and that the public demand answers to these questions.

$review_text.: I'm a sucker for DC's supernatural characters, such as The Phantom Stranger, Etrigan the Demon and The Spectre, so it was with great excitement that I bought this book. I mean: the original stories of one of my favorite characters, what's not to like?I wasn't disappointed either. Sure the stories are simplistic by today's standards, but at the time I'm quite sure they were extraordinary. The introduction states that with The Spectre, Jerry Siegel was hoping to establish a third archetypal hero, after Superman and Batman. Do I think he succeeded? Yes and no. While, he indeed create a new style of character, it never seemed to have caught on quite the same way Superman and Batman did.If you really want to see The Spectre at his best, then pick the Ostrander/Mandrake issues from the 90s. Great stuff.

$review_text.: Ok. I admit it. I am a hopeless fan of Patricia Wynn's Blue Satan Series. A Killing Frost is the fourth book in the series which is set in the early 1700's in England.The two main characters are Hester. Kean and the outlawed Lord Hawkhurst, (Viscount St. Mars), who was wrongly accused of a murder in the first book and who remains in hiding. In each book, Mrs. Kean and St. Mars work together to solve a mystery. In this case, the mystery revolves around a corpse found at the Frost Faire. The deceased man seems to be a threat to the current Lord Hawkhurst in whose household Mrs. Kean serves. She calls on her friend the Viscount St. Mars to help her solve the mystery.St. Mars has been asked  to help free an imprisoned Jacobite rebel who was part of the uprising to re-establish the deposed King James, the Pretender. Doing so may help St. Mars possibly gain an edge in regaining his holdings.Each book brings a little more romance in and the tension between Mrs. Kean and Lord Hawkhurst really heats up in this one and Wynn is the master at keeping us hooked and though I wanted more romance between the two characters, I cannot fault her at all for the way she has them part.I won't give away the ending but let's just say, I am always sad when I have to close the book and will be waiting impatiently until I can read the next in the series. I give this five out a five stars. Well done.

$REVIEW.: Reason for Reading: I have been reading all the Bloomsbury Group series of books.Summary: Mrs. Tim is the wife of Captain Tim, they have two children a boy and a girl and live with the Regiment in England. Mrs. Tim writes in her diary from the period of January to June detailing the daily life she lives paying particular attention to the eccentric characters surrounding her and the humorous events that can happen in simple village life. Then Mrs. Tim's life is unsettled as the Captain is transferred to a posting in Scotland to work away from the Regiment and Mrs. Tim finds herself living within a civilian community in a new country where she must start all over again (as is the way in army life) meeting new people and learning new ways.Comments: This book is a treasure! I've read five of the six books in this publisher's series to date and this is by far my absolute favourite! The book was written in 1932, the time period of the story is never given and it is easy to assume the book is to be read as contemporary. Mrs. Tim is a wonderful character in her early thirties, friendly, caring, happy to get into innocent mischief and wonderful at bantering between the sexes with her husband. Captain Tim, himself, doesn't play a large part in the book. He is there often enough to be a fully defined character but he's off to work each day leaving Hester time to get up to her escapades or be caught up in someone else's.Not too far into the book the move to Scotland is made and this is where the main plot of the story takes place. Hester meets all sorts of eccentric characters who are not too keen on befriending service people. She does make great friends with her next door neighbour, an elderly lady with a lot of spunk, whom she tells of her strange encounters with the villagers. Then Hester is invited to stay with her neighbour at her cottage by the sea for a fortnight and finds they've been followed by the dashing Major Morley who delights in spending his time courting Mrs. Tim. She takes this in her stride but when her friend's Navy son also visits and vies for her attentions the hilarity ensues but Hester will let the men make fools of themselves charmingly a they know she is a devoted wife.Truly wonderful writing, with real people that one can imagine. Though full of eccentricities they are not overdone and one can simply imagine people one meets in real life having a few of these foibles. D.E. Stevenson brings every single one of the people you meet on these pages come to life and love them, whether they are likable are not. Some of them are lovable because they are so unlikeable. I'd love to see this played out as one of those British television series. I'll say the first 70 pages were the slowest read for me then after that I spent a whole day and stayed up late that night until I finished the book. I love epistolary books, this one being a series of diary entries, one point being they are so fast to read. It is so easy to just keep reading one more entry until the next thing you know time has slipped away from you. Mrs. Tim of the Regiment is laugh out loud hilarious and if I had to choose one Bloomsbury Group book for you to read this would be the one. If you like British cozies, don't miss out on this book!I am so thankful that this is the first in a quartet, hopefully Bloomsbury intend to publish the rest of the books eventually as none of the others are still in print. I'll wait a bit and see what happens before otherwise trying to hunt them down through the Inter-Library system.

$review_text.: I'm a big fan of Colin Cotterill's Dr. Siri Paiboun Mystery stories.  They have originality, wit, interesting plotting and wonderful characters.  Cotterill has practically put post-civil war Laos back on the social/political map with these tales of a septegenarian leftist revolutionary who is trying to get his country back on its feet (circa 1978).  As the country's lone coroner, Dr. Siri Paiboun sees a lot of death and suffering, not to mention criminal behavior.  All grist for author Cotterill's very clever and knowing story mill.In "Curse of the Pogo Stick", several plots run parallel, but the story focuses on the plight of the Hmong people of Laos, who were among the big losers of that country's civil war.  Cotterill provides a compassionate but highly witty portrait of one small band of Hmong who kidnap Dr. Siri in order to obtain his spiritual help with a demonic problem that is keeping them from getting on with their lives.  As is usually the case in these books, an element of the supernatural is part and parcel of Dr. Siri's sleuthing.  Somehow this bit of close-to-the-edge narrative works alright in this context.  "Curse" is wildly imaginative and engaging from the first pages, and an element of satisfying justice is provided by the end of the story.This is enjoyable as a mystery, but read it for the great characters and the humor-in-the-face-of tragedy that it provides.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Howard Bloom has written a tour de force. Yes, it is stuffed with facts and quotes and ideas almost to overflowing. But, the essence of The God Problem is really found in the natural creativity of that thing called consciousness we to date really don't understand very well. Bloom will give us his foundational idea that synthesis is caused by an embedded creativity that gives us the miracles perhaps masquerading as materialism, and also through translation. Through his careful analysis, we understand that the squiggles made on a mud tablet by a Babylonian gave rise to the number system we have today. Thus, translation from one medium to another provide us abstractions that were first grounded in very concrete beginnings. It isn't just a matter of moving from the primitive to the modern that has given modern science is preeminence of place, but the very creative power embedded in consciousness itself. Like his use of the cosmic diner, where he provides invented conversation partners watching quantum particles collide, giving us the counterintuitive notion that 1+1=3. The constant synthesizing of of simples to create the more complex is not just happening when particles collide, but when human thought uses the facility of translation to take something from one context to another.Thus did Pythagoras discover the power of numbers by caressing catgut to produce the harmonics. He translated musical tones into a geometrical pattern. It is these and other examples that give us glimpses into how axioms provide a basic blueprint, but it can be easily shown that everything we take as so complicated now is the simple result of the creative power of consciousness to translate concrete apprehensions into other platforms of observation. This will perhaps come to be his greatest contribution to scientific dialogue, and that is the ability of creation to solve problems through the naturalization of creativity as a common bond between confrontations with the irresolvable happening in the simple act of translation, his bon mot and the message we are to take away from this. He doesn't go as far as Anthony Peake or Amit Goswami in his presentation of the miracles consciousness itself is capable of. But his book is meant more as a contribution to the materialist paradigm that won't ever move away from mechanization. With his journey punctuated with personal experiences, the book also functions as a memoir. But installing life into a bare narrative twins with his desire to install life into the usual assumption we live in a dead world. He may or may not be aware of the scientific revolution going on with Peake and Goswami, but he is headed there with the aplomb of a great thinker. In his words, to be a "bold" thinker, requires one take on the mantle of originality and let the data itself direct us to a greater realization of humankind's function in the world. I think he has done so beautifully.

$review_text.: The Seven Year Bitch is, to me, an extremely depressing and unneeded look into the life of the semi-privileged. The book opens with our protagonist Isolde loosing her job...and hating her husband and things never really get better from there. Isolde is a screaming shrew and her husband Russell is a weak, no back-boned wimp. While I understand that this book takes into consideration the relative brevity of their marriage and the fact that Isolde seems to have a case of postpartum depression, they do nearly nothing to save their marriage. They are content to scream, cry and contemplate affairs and little else. Frankly most of what happens in this book I never found funny at all. This was a painful and bleak look into someones horrible marriage and I wish I had never peeked. The writing was stilted, there was no humor (at least from my point of view), and if this is what women are really like today, then I'm glad I'm not young, but see, the fact is the author can't even use youth as an excuse for the protagonists horrid behavior. They too are middle aged!.Most ..heck all of the characters where unsympathetic, crass, nosy, self centered and obsessed with the lives of others instead of the ones they supposedly love.Save a tree and bypass this bleak look at a marriage that should have never have taken place.

$review_text.: The Family Blood Ties series is meant as juvenile fiction.  Since my wife says that I act like a juvenile much of the time, I guess that explains why I liked it. Every book in the series picks up exactly where the prior installment ended so it is like reading one long book.The Grrr in my title is because the latest book isn't out yet.As you can tell from the title, the series is about vampires.  It is told from the viewpoint of a teen vampire girl who doesn't fit in with the vampire crowd and blends well with the human kids.  While it certainly isn't heavy reading, it is enjoyable, provides a few subtle lessons on fitting in, rejection and teen love without being obvious, sappy or &#34;preachy&#34;.

$review_text.: This is a good story that needed some tweaking also known as editing. I don't know if it was intentional for the plot purposes, but this team of operatives come across as clueless black ops wannabes who can't get anything right. That may be due to the fact that it is a new team put together haphazardly and rushed into action. Add to that that every single one of this guys come with some serious baggage from PTSD to disablement to lack of training, you name it they have it. They lack training, they lack cohesiveness, they lack the resources to make their mission successful and they finally make it by sheer luck it seems. At the end they pull it together and save the day... with lots of external help. Now, that being said, the guys did what they could with what they had. As I said at the beginning, I have the feeling all of this was intentional and we get to see how they come together as a unit, a single minded, well trained, killing machine. I think this series is about that journey that at the end will bring the team together. I'm looking forward to see how it develops.On another note, the book had laugh out loud moments, that was refreshing. About the hero and heroine, you get your typical honorable wounded warrior, tormented and hurt. Gabe's career came to an end after an accident that may or may not have been an accident after all. After believing his career in the military over he is offered another chance to do what he loves in the private sector. Gabe has a lame leg, which proves to be a liability through out the entire mission, and needs a cane to walk. It makes it hard to swallow that he is the leader or a group of ex-military mercenaries that go guns blazing into the jungle when the leader can't even walk! The writer should've given him a lame shoulder or something more believable. The heroine, I like her, she seems flaky and flighty but has spine. She also have some idealistic views about non violence that make her a liability also. Gabe has to constantly remind her that the bad guys are not going to be diplomatic and talk thing over, it's kill or be killed. At the end she pulls her head out of her behind and kills a bad guy, good for her!Overall, it was a good, entertaining read with LOTS of potential and that is the reason I'm sticking with this writer. All the aforementioned issues are said to be address by Gabe, leader of HORNET, at the end of the book (training, resources, etc.) Also, because I'm a sucker for honorable, wounded warriors.
$SUMMARY.: Good, but needed some editing.

$REVIEW.: As a baby, Brian Mauretti failed to thrive on the infant formula that was meant to give him nourishment


The adverse effects of this baby food meant that Brian was devastatingly damaged, with no realistic prospect of living a normal life

However, Brian's formidable grandmother, Angela DiMartino refuses to give up on Brian, and with love, encouragement and sheer force of will, she begins to challenge fate.There is poignancy about this story that really tugs on your heart strings, and as the heart-rending story of Brian emerges you almost want to stand up and cheer as Angela, known to her grandchildren as "Mama" refuses to acknowledge that Brian will not accomplish his full potential.Written with the author's characteristic warmth, and with fine attention to detail, Goodnight, Brian is a story about determination and the absolute power of unshakeable family bonds
If every family had a grandmother like "Mama", the world would be a better place to live.

$review_text.: The concept is excellent. I could certainly imagine this kind of work going on in the future (if it hasn't been attempted already).Unfortunately, the book suffers from a few flaws that I cannot forgive.To illustrate one, it has an entire race of geniuses (the Qufmen) but utterly fails to ever put that genius on display. In the expository scenes, the alpha Qufman never impresses with his insights or intelligence; his audience respects and fears him because of his physical strength and short fuse. At no point do we get a scene where he lays out his plan for all of us to marvel at his genius. Lastly, even the lower ranked Qufmen are supposed to be geniuses but in the battle scenes we don't see them do anything clever or extraordinary that the &#34;dumb&#34; human grunts aren't already doing. Fail.Then *spoilers*....At the end of the book, we meet the high council that runs the planet earth. During this scene we discover that the alpha Qufman runs the council and has been running it for at least as long as it took to get the protagonist into the Service. Perhaps this was supposed to illustrate the Qufman's genius and long-term planning, but the timing of it doesn't add up in the book. The Qufman is the enemy for a good chunk of it but then we discover he's been running this council all along? Fail.The author needed more beta-readers. The plot has huge holes. Ultimately, it robbed me of any enjoyment. I don't recommend this book but I will take a look at any follow-up efforts from the same author.

$REVIEW.: To find a new author (new to me!) in the genre that I enjoy is like a treasure hunt. This time I struck gold. I found this book to be well written, the characters to be believable and real, and the story line to be well conceived. The main character, Sorilla, is the first women main character I've read of in military sci-fi thus far. The story benefits greatly from this. I think if you are a fan of this genre, just buy it and read it yourself. You won't be disappointed.

$review_text.: Anyone who has grown up in Maine has grown up with L.L. Bean. Living here all my life, I was well aware of the success story of this legendary Maine retailer. I was genuinely interested in reading this book by Leon Gorman, Chairman, former President, and grandson of Leon L. Bean. After all, Gorman took over the business in 1967 and ran it for more than 30 years. During his tenure, the company experienced tremendous growth. In 1967, sales were $4.75 million - in 1975, sales were $30 million. Just 5 years later, this figure surged to $121.5 million. The year before Gorman stepped down as President in 2001, sales had reached an astonishing $1.169 billion. (I was pleased to read in the January 2007 issue of Down East magazine that net sales in 2005 were 1.47 billion, up 4% from the previous year.)I had lots of questions: what was Leon L. Bean really like? How does a company gladly accept returns - no matter how long you've owned the product - without question? And above all, how did Gorman lead this company through such astronomical growth and still maintain its appealing corporate identity? I'm pleased to report that Gorman answers all these questions and many more in this informative book.For those less interested in the business side of things, Gorman offers a behind-the-scenes look at his grandfather, L.L., while working at L.L. Bean from 1960 to 1967, the year L.L. passed away. In 1962, when L.L. was ninety years old and Gorman was still in his twenties, he described his grandfather as one who "rarely delegated any responsibilities. It was clear what he wanted done because he made all the decisions. He fully enjoyed his company and his reputation as a Down East merchant."Gorman writes:Because L.L. was outgoing, energetic, and personable, people enjoyed working for him. But he never was and never pretended to be a manager in the conventional sense. He had little interest in planning and budgeting, in organizational issues, in training or developing people, or in performance management. Team building was something he left to the manager of his beloved Boston Red Sox.Gorman explains the famous L.L. Bean guarantee of satisfaction had gone by the wayside when he took over the company. Despite the many stories touting L.L.'s personal guarantee on everything he sold, the guarantee hadn't been in print since 1919 and wasn't being practiced when he joined the company. In 1968 he changed all that by including the guarantee in the Spring Catalog. The unqualified, broadest guarantee in the industry was printed in boldface in 1970.It read:"Guarantee" Our products are guaranteed to be 100 percent satisfactory. Return anything purchased from us that proves otherwise. We will replace it or refund your money, as you wish, and return your postage costs. Please attach letter of instruction and our packing slip, if available, with returned merchandise.Gorman writes that the feared influx of frivolous and fraudulent returns never materialized. He writes that the vast majority of customers could be trusted to be fair in returning unsatisfactory products - and that those returning products they weren't happy with often became loyal customers in the future. This helped to further the company's reputation for trust and became an L.L. Bean hallmark.I'm happy to report that Gorman's description of leading the business through massive growth is presented in a clear chronological way with no effort made to gloss over difficult business times. He gives credit to hiring many professionals in the 1970s and 80s - starting with Bill End as his second-in-command in 1975. At that time, End was a bright and energetic twenty-six year old with an MBA from Harvard. In the following years, many other professionals were hired to help Gorman run the company.Gorman's strengths were in keeping L.L. Bean focused on it core values, balancing growth and tradition, and preserving it's corporate identity. His team of professional managers was given latitude to expand the business through specialty catalogs, retail stores and overseas. They also were instrumental in reorganizing the business and focusing on Total Quality as a strategy to make the company more productive, increase performance and retain the L.L. Bean core values.It's refreshing that Gorman doesn't hide the fact that employees often described him as careful, quiet and reserved. Reading between the lines, it's easy to see that his greatest skills were not in communicating with his managers and workers. A good friend of mine (who was one of the professional managers at L.L. Bean in the 1980s and has since moved on) told me he very much enjoyed reading the book. "Finally," he said, "I was able for the first time to understand what Leon was thinking."

(To understand this picture you may need to read the three preceding books.)So then what happens when this guy becomes a sort of superman among them?  Nothing simplistic you can be sure.

$review_text.: Life can be really messy as Alaxandra finds out the hard way

 After hearing the stories about Paul, her boyfriend of two years and his not being able to explain where he has been, plus him not being there for her at a very critical time in her life, feeling that she has no where to turn and that the best way to handle this whole mess, she makes that final decision to leave, not telling anyone where she is going including her other family members

 Returning to Savanna, GA where her Aunt Martha lives where she grew up around the cotton lands, maybe just maybe she could start over because she has so much doubt, doubt in herself after an incident at her new nursing job and doubting her decisions in her love life.Arriving back in Savanna she enrolled back in college, gets a lowly tech position and makes new friends
 Now the problems start


 One of her new friends is a classmate that immediately hits on her
 Not wanting to hurt his feelings she decides to tell him that she is not going to date after a bad breakup


 Now Gabe is game but that does not mean that he is not interested in her, but just that he is not going to push it right now.A few days later her Aunt Martha hurts her back and being the type of girl Alexandra is she wants to help out to repay her Aunt for letting her stay with her

 The next morning Alex is surprised to meet the family friend that is going to help out while her aunt is out of commission, Blaise

 Wow, Alex feels like she was hit with a atomic bomb, she feels this immediate reaction to him.We now have a whole new set of problems that Alexandra is met with


 As many of us remember twenty two is a very memorable age, which includes a lot of insecurity


 We are at time in our life when we are making many of our life long decisions and not sure we have made the right ones even as we make them


 Alex thought giving up her life in New York, her friends, her problems with her ex-boyfriend and the incident at her nursing job would make things easier..
start all over and make new decisions, with this time being what she felt would be the right ones for her


 Not knowing that nothing in life is ever that easy, she falls into a new trap.I felt that the key members of this story are well developed and they all come with each of their own set of problems

 Alex is a very special person that is so unusual for her age because of her caring and outgoing yet shy indecisive ways


 Paul is a fool that does not know how to express himself and so unsure that he can't deal with the rejection from Alex


 Gabe is a normal college male that sees a pretty girl with problems and wants what all men want to do, date and protect


 Blaise is another unusual person that has been through a lot for a young man at the age of twenty four, losing his parents, inheriting the family business and the care of a younger brother
 Not to mention the mistake of getting his ex-girlfriend pregnant, letting her move in with him, her losing the baby, then realizing he does not care for but because of a secret that no one knows has not forced the issue of her moving out.The story starts out very strong and remains that way all through out
 I picked this book up and could not lay it down even to eat dinner

 It is fast paced with so many twists and turns that you are always on your guard for the next page
 The explosive events will keep you guessing what will happen next
 This book is very down to earth and even with some of the drastic events that happen it shows life at a very worst and it's very best


 Emotions will keep you moving from love, anger, happiness, sadness and joy

 But beware this is not a stand alone book, the ending will have you panting for book two (Then Came Indecision) which will be along soon
 I really enjoyed this book from a very amazing author!

$REVIEW.: As a generic book, I probably would have given it 3 stars


 She is a skilled writer

 I mean, she has writing skills


 However she doesn't have very good plotting skills, and her characterizations and dialog are boring and shallow
 So I would call her average at best.But then....


She undertook to finish a Jane Austen book

 For the lack of subtlety, humor, interesing plot twists, great dialog and otherother features of Jane Austen's work, I am disappointed that she could not do better

 Even if she's a fairly boring writer, surely she could have taken the time to design a decent story?  I am surprised that she is a professor specializing in Ms Austen


 I hope she can appreciate her better than she can emulate her
Just because Jane Austen wrote romances, it doesn't follow that she wrote formulaic stories


 Ah well


 I could have spent my 5 bucks better.

$review_text.: My sister gave me this book as a Christmas present and I have been devouring it ever since


It is a light and breezy examination of nursery rhymes and where they come from
Someone earlier criticized the author for going off on tangents that had nothing to do with the rhyme in question, and I disagree with this
I think that he was providing a historical context for the rhymes that served to deepen one's understanding of how they came into being, not padding the book with useless information

I have found it to be a fascinating read, and the people with whom I have shared some of the revelations gleaned from it (Little Jack Horner is about a land thief! Mary, Mary, quite contrary is about Bloody Mary!) have also been intrigued

"Heavy Words Lightly Thrown" is a clever and witty diversion that will change the way you look at nursery rhymes -- and make you feel like a smarty-pants in the process


An absolute must for any trivia buffs out there.

$review_text.: i have reviewed all of these stories seperately and i feel it is worth putting an overall review here for anyone interested in saving a bit of money and getting all three together.the overall picture i get from this is that you have a linchpin character in a demon who grants wishes from the bottom of a well who then turns the wishes against the wisher. it sounds pretty straight forward but now that i have read all three it is not so simple.not going to give it away but i would say  have a look at this compilation on the kindle. it is well worth having it. the clever unravelling of a story and the sort of long range planning it takes to put somthing like this together while holding back just enough to keep you interested and giving you enough to make you want more, well, thats just brilliant.im sure you will love each story seperately and independantly but if i had hindsight i would buy them all together and read them back to back. definetly one of the best series you can get on the kindle.

$review_text.: Alice slept with two guys at a party. 2 guys, different times, same party. Everyone knows about it, and everyone is talking about it. Now one of those guys, Brandon, is dead, traffic accident while Alice is trying to text him (sexting, you know, all the crave now.) Alice's life, friendships, everything, it's all going down the drain. But it is her fault, of course. How bad can you feel for someone who brought it upon herself?This was a pretty deep book. It was told by 4 different characters. One was Alice's best friend (was....was, was, was.) One is the most popular girl in school. One, the smart, quiet guy that seems to have the least to do with the whole story. The last was the best friend of Brandon, and he was with him during the accident. The whole story will slowly come out by the end.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ending. The whole story was well written. It sucked me in, and I couldn't put it down. I felt like I really knew the characters. At the end, the reader will know the whole story, but probably won't be so happy with how it works out for everyone. Sure, a couple of the characters grow, but there is no real solution. Life goes on. It does seem like something that would happen in a real high school, but it just isn't fair. It didn't ruin the book for me at all, but it could have still been written as well with a &#34;happier&#34; ending. I don't need &#34;happily ever after,&#34; but I do want redemption for those that deserve it, and growth for those that were pretty horrible people. Good read, teens should relate to at least one of the characters, and pretty realistic.Free ARC provided through Netgalley for an honest review.

$review_text.: There were so many things that made Snowflakes and Coffee Cakes by Joanne DeMaio a must read for me. First of all I have read Joanne DeMaio's work before and she's very talented and always creates a fabulous story that I can not put down. Next check out this BEAUTIFUL cover. I don't judge a book by it's cover but when it is this pretty how could I not what to just gaze at that beautiful cover, after I finished the book of course. I also adore the name Snowflakes and Coffee Cakes just has such a catchy sound I could not wait to start reading. So there were all these wonderful things that made me want to read this book, needless to say I had high expectation going in and let me tell you I was not disappointed AT all! I really enjoyed this book. Of course I have not yet meet a book by Ms. DeMaio that I did not just love!Vera Sterling returns to her hometown for her sister's wedding. She has left a few problems behind her, that she would rather not think about during this happy occasion. The big thing is that she has lost her job and needs to figure out what she is going to do with her life next. She takes a big step and buys an old house in her hometown. She loves the house, even with all it's problems. There is also a barn full of surprises for Vera to uncover.  When she meets Derek Cooper, she finds the answer to some of her repair problems. There is also an instant attraction between Vera and Derek.Derek has a tragic past and a memory that he honors every year with the Deck the Boats Festival. However when the snow storm that Vera's weather forecasting father predicts, strikes just in time for the festival, Vera comes through with an answer. Derek has a lot of sadness from his past, that just makes my heart break for him.I really enjoyed reading Vera and Derek's story. I love stories that are set in towns full of wonderful caring people. Ms. DeMaio has yet again created another wonderful story full of people that kept me intrigued and a storyline that had me flipping pages very quickly. I love Christmas stories and this one left me with a wonderful warm holiday feeling.If you are already a fan of Joanne DeMaio, then I think you will love this book just as much as I did. If you love holiday stories but have not read Ms. DeMaio's work yet, check this one out, I do not think you will be disappointed.I know I will be anxiously awaiting Joanne DeMaio's next release. When I read one of her stories I always finish with a feeling I have taken a short mini vacation. She does a fabulous job of describing her settings.I was given the opportunity to read this book so I may share my thoughts with you. As always it has been my pleasure to share my thoughts with you about this wonderful story.

$REVIEW.: Matthew Kelly's book is overwhelming.  It is hard to put into words the power of his message, or I should say, Christ's message.  I recommend this book to everyone who is Christian or interested in Christianity.  And certainly, Catholics should read it if they are at all unclear about their church.  Still, it is possible that the title could also be Rediscovering Christianity, because the focus of the book is becoming Holy and finding the only kind of happiness that endures.

This book concerns a North American apocalypse triggered by terrorists detonating a nuke  high above the atmosphere, which causes an election magnetic pulse that fries every electronic device in North America.

$review_text.: Reason for Reading: The hitchhiker angle always intrigues me and the author's Canadian background interested me as well.  Sounded like it would be a good read.Right from the beginning we are placed with Katrina in a creepy situation as she picks up a hitchhiker only to find herself frightened and intimidated into throwing the man out of the car in the middle of a storm.  Katrina is a likable main character right from the start, though she has a penchant for making decisions the reader may not always agree with.  She is in a vulnerable situation in her personal life and when a strong charismatic man comes along it is only too easy for her to fall under his spell.  I found the situation plausible.  Statistically many women find themselves in trouble because of the persuasions of their boyfriends but in this situation I thought Katrina started following the man's lead too soon.  This was my only beef with the book; a longer, more controlling relationship needed to be established to have been more believable for Katrina to behave the way she did.  The situation was plausible but just didn't quite feel totally believable because of this.Putting that one aspect aside, I had a marvelous read with this book.  I did not expect it to go in the direction it did.  The write up on the back of my book is much more vague than the publisher's summary and I was surprised at who the "bad guy" turned out to be.  The story deals with the moral issue of telling a lie. Katrina is hit with an almost Biblical vengeance when she tells one small white lie, because this one fib leads to another, leads to another, and so on, until the lies are no longer white, no longer, small.  They become cover-ups for misdeeds that are not only ethically wrong but illegal and Katrina is driven knowing that it all started with her one little white lie.  I enjoyed the fact that lapsed Catholic Katrina was pulled back to her faith during this time of turmoil and ended up in the confessional.  From the theme of the moral consequences of lying to the positive portrayal of a priest and penitent in a confessional, (though penance was somewhat unrealistic) I would not be surprised to hear that the author has a Catholic background himself as he has done a fair and accurate portrayal of the Faith.A thriller that is fast-paced with one crisis after another hitting the main characters until they hit desperation and a stand-off against the law at the end that will keep the reader on their toes unsure of how it will all play out in the end.  Jeremy Bates is an exciting new voice on the thriller/suspense scene.

$review_text.: Cline's _Sparrowhawk_ is a marvelous and adventurous tale of vibrant characters that say what they mean and do what they say

 The story follows the intellectual and physical adolescence of Jack Frake, a disenfranchised but hardly impoverished orphan
 Frake's development as a character is a delight to read, and Cline really shines as he details the real-life repurcussions of developing (and maintaining) an independent mind

 Get this book if you appreciate consistently good writing that is written with both a purpose and a message.

$review_text.: Marianne Denton finds herself engaged to the man who tormented her when they were both children because she needs to access her dowry to save her mother and sister. Noah Brenin agreed to the engagement to please his father, but now regrets it. On the night of their engagement party, Noah decides to continue to torment her - hoping she'll break off the engagement so he won't have to damage her reputation by doing it himself.Unfortunately, Marianne has grown a backbone and decides to confront Noah on his disrespectful behavior. She follows him to his cargo ship, where she stumbles and is knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she finds they have set sail and she is stuck on Noah's ship headed to England.Marianne tries to sabotage the ship to convince Noah to turn around and bring her back home to care for her sick mother and young sister. However, he is determined to continue on his business. Eventually, his stubbornness and her efforts result in both of them being captured by a British warship along with two other crew members.They stumble across information that can help save American naval officers. They fight to save themselves and other Americans during the War of 1812. And fall in love in the process...This was the first book I have read by M.L. Tyndall and I absolutely loved it and could not put it down. There was so much action and adventure. The characters were so real - full of bravery and courage, as well as imperfections. Noah and Marianne judged each other from their experiences as children and struggle to come to grips with the reality rather than their preconceived ideas of who the other is. I would highly recommend this story and I can't wait to read other books by this author.

$review_text.: Covering all the islands in one book is a large task, but Lonely Planet does a good job, particularly noting hiking trails, beaches, and other natural sites of interest. There are good, detailed maps; websites, prices and hours are listed; and interesting history notes are included.However, I would recommend that a visitor not rely on just this book alone when visiting.  In looking at the areas I am most familiar with (Central, North Shore, Laie area, Hawaii Volcanoes Nat'l Park, and Pearl Harbor) I noticed a number of eating, shopping, or tourist areas were left out that visitors might enjoy. The index is not very extensive and leaves out quite a number sites. It is difficult to cover it all, I know, but I had to resort to searching through the book page by page for most things- this would be even more frustrating if a visitor was not sure where a particular place is.Visitors need to do their research before arriving, checking out the areas they wish to visit for current hours, charges, and closings. (Hanging loose in Paradise might be nice, but if you want to see as much as possible, you need to plan your days) Also, look for more things to do within your interests. For example, if you are on Oahu and like to shop, Waikele Outlets in Waipio (just off H1 before Waipahu) was not listed in the book but is a terrific place to shop and is popular with tourists and locals alike. The Mormon Temple in Laie may not be open to tourists but there is are lovely, peaceful grounds to walk around in and a visitor's center, too- neither mentioned in the book. The Hawaiian Railway Society operates train tours from Ewa Beach along parts of the west coast (beautiful views!) yet it is not mentioned, either.The people of Hawaii are the friendliest in the nation, so just ask for the best places to shop/eat/play and they will be pleased to give you great advice.

$review_text.: "Legacy of the Witch" is a fun, quick-as-lightning read, that lays the groundwork for what looks to be a really exciting series of books.  In less than sixty pages, Maggie Shayne introduces the reader to the lovely Amarrah, her ancient namesake, who was a Babylonian "slave girl to the slave girls," and three witches, Indira, Magdalena and Lilia.  Amarrah's pursuit of a family heirloom, taken from her when she fled her homeland, leads her to a handsome stranger who she feels she has known before, but she is not the only person seeking the mysterious relic.  While a complete story unto itself, this is clearly meant to set the stage for the stories of the three Babylonian witches.  By turns sweet, romantic, exciting and heartbreaking, "Legacy of the Witch" quickly pulls the reader into the lives of the characters, both ancient and modern.  Looking forward to the trilogy!

It's not exhaustive; it's a high level overview for those with a short attention span, who slept through high school or just want to refresh and who don't care that a few of the dates are off or some of the details are a bit inaccurate.  There may be errors in some dates and a few of the facts (read the news every day and you'll find even MORE error and lack of fact checking than that), but I don't care; if +/- 99% of the material is basically accurate, that's enough for me.  The book a little daily shot of something interesting about history and is presented in a more interesting way than many text books are.  For that, I give it 5 stars.  If I want to know more about a particular event, I can go do further research myself.  Great job!

$REVIEW.: Will and Meg are so cute together.  I like how real Will is even though he's a celebrity.  The way he falls for Meg is so enduring.  I like how he is so thoughtful.  This book is sexy and funny.  The bachelorette party scene had me laughing so hard, I would reread it just to laugh like that again.  I love all of the characters in this book.  This is the 3rd book in the series and I enjoy hearing all of the banter between each of the characters.  I especially love when Jules is involve.  This is a definite read!!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome book!!!

$review_text.: Carter Quinn is a new author although his writing certainly belies his newcomer status. I enjoyed the story of Riley, Jason, and Eric, which is told from Riley&#8217;s POV. Carter has imbued Riley&#8217;s character with humor, vulnerability, complexity, but ultimately strength and determination. He is a little irrational from time to time, but I loved him for his confusion as well his sensitivity. Riley&#8217;s heart was broken six years earlier by his college friend and then lover Eric. Years later he is still wary of giving his heart for fear of getting hurt again. I think Carter gave us a character we can easily relate to as readers.Jason and Eric are also fully developed complex characters. Jason is sexy, strong, giving, and tender. It&#8217;s easy to fall in love with the guy, but the wonderful thing that Carter did in this story is not make him perfect. You root for him but there are times when you want to thump him upside the head as well. Then we have his brother Eric, who is sex on wheels, and it would be easy to fall into the trap of making him an unsympathetic character due to the heartache he&#8217;s caused. However, the author has written a multilayered story that gives the reader deeper insight into the motives and reactions of each of these characters.It&#8217;s refreshing to read a story that isn&#8217;t offering pretty heroes and predictable dialog. With that said I think new authors with the best of intentions draw out their story a little longer than necessary in an effort to make it complete.  I think &#8220;The Way Back&#8221; could have been pared down just a (tiny) bit because I found myself (towards the end) thinking &#8211; guys, let&#8217;s get it together and get on with it already. The angst (as much as we love it in romance) was drawn out a little more than necessary for me. I like angst in a romantic story but a little goes a long way or it becomes a soap opera.Overall, &#8220;The Way Back&#8221; is a great beginning for a new author. The story faults are minor ones and easily overlooked. I enjoyed the story and each of the characters. The sexual scenes were exceptional and sizzled off the pages. Carter has a gift and he will just keep getting better. I look forward to reading more from him in the future.Originally posted at &#34;Live Your Life, Buy The Book&#34;

$REVIEW.: I have read many diet books but this one was totally different from them all
 The author never had a weight problem until a car accident was a life changing event for him


 While it took time for him to recuperate, he wound up eating most of the time

As the weight was put on, he became embarrassed and needed a solution

He found out that fad diets are all hype

He sought God's help and started exercising


 The different Bible verses of self discipline were a valuable Christian aspect of God.He was determined with God's help to make his diet work

 He has a great section on way diets fail and why they work


 He realized how God had prepared him and gave him motivation and courage to stick with a diet and get healthy again.

$review_text.: I read Laura Hilton's first novel and endorsed it with these words: This first book in the Amish of Seymour series captured my interest from the start. It opens with raw emotions and doesn't let up. You know characters have come to life when you want to solve their problems and give advice, like "Communicate honestly and work things out!" But if that happened too quickly there'd be no story. Perhaps this lesson will help me better deal with miscommunication and misunderstandings in my own life. Patchwork Dreams should have no trouble finding its place among Amish "quilted" narratives. Readers will be saying, "Stitch faster! We want the next one."Her second book does not disappoint. A Harvest of Hearts occurs in the same setting, near Seymour, Missouri, but the story also stands alone. Shanna Stoltsfus had left her strict Amish upbringing to study nursing in the city. She comes "home" for the summer to find her family has taken in one of the young men who came from Pennsylvania in a "man swap." Matthew Yoder and Shanna sense mutual attraction, but he has already joined the Amish church and she has no plans to return.Shanna struggles with her relationship with her father in addition to her growing one with Matthew, who wants to marry her. Her former boyfriend Nate also interferes. Shanna feels tugs toward both the Amish life she once lived and the Englisch one she recently embraced. Misunderstandings add to the confusion.Hilton's interesting twists add to the enjoyment of the tale. I'll be looking for the next in her "Amish of Seymour" series.

$REVIEW.: Somehow, in my youth, I missed reading "Journey to the Centre of the Earth".  Now, as someone well into middle age, I thought it timely to catch up with a classic.Jules Verne has written a book which, in my mind, is almost of the "boys' own" genre.  The story is very far fetched.  Indeed, too far fetched.  An old manuscript is located which, when deciphered tells of a portal to the centre of the world.  An extinct volcano in Iceland leads three explorers, Professor Hartwigg, his nephew, Harry, and their local Icelandic guide, the phlegmatic Hans, to a subterranean world.  Together they traverse a vast network of ancient tunnels before coming upon an underground sea complete with pre-historic creatures from the time of the dinosaurs.  I should also add that for the entire journey, they have access to electric lanterns and then, when on the sea, there is a strange artificial light by which they can see.  Eventually, they are thrust to the surface upon a raft they construct.  Their point of re-entry is the island of Stromboli in Italy.I suspect that many might think that I am being too critical.  Just remember that it is a work of fiction and go with the flow so to speak.  This is a valid point.  However, at many tmes during the novel, I was brought to compare this book with the works of the great British novelist, H.G. Wells.  They were both approximately contemporaneous.  Yet, Wells was by far the better story teller.  He wrote of invasions from outer space and time travel.  In other words, they were both writing of science fiction in many of their works.  Wells's work is by far the superior.So, in summary, I recommend that people read "Journey to the Centre of the Earth".  It is an interesting tale that moves at a good clip.  However, do not expect a great work of literature.

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ve heard of this kind of diet before. I think a lot of people out there tend to reject any diet that has the word &#8220;fast&#8221; in the title. However that is a misinterpretation. The diet explained in The Quick and Easy Fast Diet Cookbook isn&#8217;t one in which you have to starve yourself and not consume food for days at a time. It&#8217;s also not a liquid only diet. The concept is actually quite simple. You pick two days out of the week which will be your fasting days. The other five days of the week you will be eating a regular, healthy diet. This doesn&#8217;t mean that on the fasting days you won&#8217;t be eating anything. Instead, those days are calorie restricted. As mentioned in the book, women will consume no more than 500 calories; men will consume no more than 600 calories. Your fasting days don&#8217;t have to be consecutive. You can choose any two days out of the week. Simple, right?The Quick and Easy Fast Diet Cookbook includes 77 recipes which are designed to be used during fasting days. If you decide you like any of them, feel free to have them on non-fasting days as well. There are recipes for breakfast, appetizers/snacks, soups and salads, entrees, and desserts. The recipe section provides the calorie count of each meal, as well as the appropriate kitchen tools to use while preparing and cooking the meals.This book also outlines the health benefits of partaking in the fast diet, goes over the importance of meal planning, and offers tips on ways to help you save time and money. It&#8217;s a simple book that gets straight to the point without leaving anything out. If you&#8217;re looking for a simple way to lose weight, I definitely recommend checking out The Quick and Easy Fast Diet Cookbook.

Unfortunately her life of slavery is not unique, and I now want to know how I can contribute to stopping this horrible injustice going on.  I will research this but I hope her story becomes more publicly acknowledged here in the US.  I want everyone to know that slavery does indeed exist in this world today.

Certain of these elements were missing.The plot was okay.The main female character was difficult to like.

$review_text.: I am a walking contradiction. I am, like many others who have to actually buy these books, tired of spending the money for nothing. Many others, who didn't receive ARC copies and actually know what make up a good series, have said they enjoyed the series in the beginning. I really enjoyed this series in the beginning and was intrigued by Sean and Avery in Damaged but now find them frustrating and annoying. There is no real substance to the series anymore. I however unlike other did enjoy the one "controversial" portion of this chapter because it was the most real event that had occurred since chapter 5. I won't spoil it for others as there are plenty in this round of reviews. But we yes we since I continue to watch my money swirl down the drain are never going to see the end unless we take a stand. The author begs and pleads for the minions to vote down bad reviews. Seriously? Holly is talented and I loved Damaged as well as the first three books about Trystan but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. Yes there are a lot of Ferro men....and a few women to write about but following through with one before diving into another and another. While many may really really enjoy these books and have no problem with the story dragging on I feel like most were  given an ARC copy so why would they care. I have received ARC copies from other authors and if I really enjoyed the book I buy it even though I got it for free to support the author. Can Holly say any of her ARC fans do the same or can she say she supports us as well? End this now an  get onto finishing the other books that have so much potential as long as they don't end up like this one.....except the Proposition which is worse than the arrangement.

$review_text.: I was impressed by this series, the Light and Shadow trilogy, which was another one of my fabulous Bookbub bargains. (Er, by the way, since I talk about them so much, one might wonder if I&#8217;m affiliated, but I&#8217;m not. Though I&#8217;ve acquired enough $0.99 and free books from them, I should probably take out stock.)This is both a fascinating character-driven and an interesting plot-driven story, wrapped in an engrossing fantasy world. Catwin, the main character, comes from a poor family, and until she&#8217;s noticed by the Duke of Voltur, she&#8217;s destined to amount to nothing but kitchen help. Instead, he sees potential in her and sets to training her to be his niece Miriel&#8217;s bodyguard and assassin&#8211;whether she wants to or not.Her struggles with the atrocities she&#8217;s forced to commit are potent and heart-rending. The uneasy friendship that grows from initial hatred between the two girls is well-crafted. They dance around one another, neither sure if the other can be trusted, but having no choice but to rely on one another.I&#8217;m not going to spoiler anything from the second and third books, but I loved how the story developed. The stakes continue to raise, as Miriel must do her uncle&#8217;s bidding and, well, Catwin must, also.I rated the third book as four stars because I wasn&#8217;t impressed with the culmination of Catwin&#8217;s prophecy: As a baby, her mother refused to raise her because she foretold that her daughter would be betrayed. A lot of that back story made no sense, and when the betrayal comes, I can&#8217;t really understand why. It&#8217;s almost &#8230; or completely &#8230; a self-fulfilling prophecy, and I don&#8217;t really understand why the characters involved choose their actions.Overall, I loved this series and I heartily recommend it. If you enjoy fantasy, either young adult or adult, you&#8217;ll enjoy the Light and Shadow trilogy. Ms. Katson is now on my list of &#8220;Authors I Must Read More of If Ever My TBR Pile Diminishes.&#8221;

The only word I can think of to describe this is intense and raw. Shifter/Were novels are usually a hit or miss for me and this was most definitely a hit. I'm really looking forward for more stuff from this author.My only minor bug is that I like my well balanced plot vs. erotica and personally I could have done with a little less sex and a little more action.

$review_text.: In this book you will find every criticism you have had screamed at you, sarcastically joked to you to hurt your feelings, used in a divorce case, written on report cards, said in work evaluations, muttered about by your parents, thrown in your face during fights, gossiped about you behind your back - WE KNOW THE RULES.  I didn't learn anything. It was just the same old "You need to do this."  Guess what? If I could I would.  But I can't.  It's physiological. I had hoped this book could offer helpful suggestions for me to remember the rules and how to follow them.  I know I talk nonstop and hop from topic to topic. Unless I tell people to expect it and ask me to shut up, there's not much else I can do.  In a world of ADHD nonbelievers I get a lot of "Don't use that as an excuse" so I often do not ask for the help she suggests.  It is seen as using ADHD as a way to get special treatment and if people don't believe in ADHD, no matter what I say, they will still be mad about me not being average at everything, instead of being how I am- a creative woman with an IQ of 156, huge heart, great sense of humor, amazing sense of humor, quirky style and out of the box ideas (where IS the box?) WHO ALSO needs people to just be sounding board audiences sometimes, does rather strange things if you are not in my head, forgets birthdays (but sends presents and cards all year round!), cannot cook, cannot be in a 9 to 5 office setting, has very rigid ways of making my life work for me.I am willing to meet the world halfway, but the people in my life have to do the same.  My Provigil is a life saver with giving me this new nanosecond to think before I act and I know now when men are hitting on me and I go to sleep much easier. But this book just made me feel really ashamed.  It's just lists of what gave me low self esteem. How can my friend with the inattentive type remember these huge lists of steps?  How can I slow down when my body feels like the bus in the movie Speed?  She gives very little help  for us. She helps those who are around us a bit, if those people want to take the effort, but if we have terrible social skills, why would anyone care enough to do that for us?I say, find your strengths and build on them, delegate, work to make your part of the world adapt to you as much as possible, and learn self soothing, self compassion skills to help you with the difficulties of being square pegs in a world of round holes. A lot of people will love you for your intuition, off the wall solutions, fast action in crisis, and the magic you bring to their lives.  So if you read this book, be prepared that is every lecture you have ever gotten and it may flood you with shame and then just leaves you there.  If this was a book of solutions I'd like it, but it's lists and lists of our problems. You know what those are - People point them out to you all the time.  Her only solution is to find people to help you shut up.I say get friends that understand and enjoy your ADHD, a career where that is a plus (EMS, journalism, landscaping, etc), learn to relax and self sooth, find ways that work for you in staying on track, and be honest about having ADHD and leave when people don't care.I can honestly say that as someone with an IQ of 156, I put up with a lot of meaningless small talk to be nice to others. I expect the same common courtesy for my ADHD.  ADHD is not an impairment but the culture you are in can make it so. Ditto for any "disability."  Surround yourself with love and fill yourself with self knowledge.  Everyone has special needs, at least you have a diagnosis to explain yours. People talking about The Real Housewives of Atlanta, making homophobic "jokes," not recycling, or coming to my door to harass me about Jesus do not. In my eyes, they are the freaks.I would much rather be alone than do all this work to be friends with people who don't like me for me, but for my phoniness.  Some people love me because I am AUTHENTIC.  I cannot lie.  Say please, I am sorry and thank you, show you care, but really, find ways to adapt your life to you, not what is expected of the average person. If I wasted my time of obsessively trying to do this stuff, which I would be mediocre at, I would never had the time to follow my passions - which led to many successes. Like jobs with a copy editor!  LOL!Would be nice if the "What is wrong with me?" questionnaire we are to give to people for feedback had some of the great ADHD "symptoms" on it, too.

$REVIEW.: Yet again I am left wanting more. Just so you know I was given the opportunity of getting an eARC of this book from this awesome author. Lets just say from start to finished I was captivated between the story of these too, 'Miss. Smith' and 'Mr. Jones'. It will make sense when you read it. Coming out on the 15th of January by the way. I totally suggest you get this book and I can't wait till the next installment if this series.Part of one of my favorite quotes: 'That sounds so wrong'.And once it comes out, you will know what part I mean. I don't want to give away to much you know. But a small tease like above doesn't hurt.... much at least ;)

$review_text.: A lovely romance with Middlegasms!This is one of those, 'feel-good', fun, flirty romances that is a fast read. The characters are not perfect, but not so damaged that it feels like a session in therapy to read. Edge of Disaster is a wee bit 'fast' on the romance (aka insta-love... or almost,) but sometimes, that's just the type of book you need. Right?I do want to clarify... I still would not consider this to be a 'fluff' romance. It does have some darker moments, some scary-type situations. It's not all romance and flowers and candles. There is some actual conflict and trauma that Alexia must overcome. Heck, the beginning of the book starts with examples of her downward spiral and walk of shame. I like how it's still seated in reality and not entirely glossed over to make 'real life' seem perfect.The chemistry must be mentioned... combustible, smoldering, get-your-seat-wet steam. I will also never again look at a diamond tennis bracelet in quite the same way (who knew it could be a sex toy?) It was very titillating and worth the read just for the between the sheets action.The only thing that stops me from going to 5 stars (if Amazon would let me I would go with 4&#9829;'s)... honestly I wanted more. More steam, more romance, more conflict, more everything. It was entertaining and enjoyable as is, but I think more of everything would have turned that knob up to an '11'.I still HIGHLY recommend running out to get your own copy, and see the man splendor that is Pearce.

$REVIEW.: The Anemoi are the Gods who are the guardians of the winds
 All of them  But the most powerful are the Cardinal Anemoi, the guardians of the North, South, East, and West winds
They in turn answer to the Storm God, who rules them all


 In this case, the four Cardinal Anemoi are the sons of Aeolus, the Storm God
 Eurus is the guardian of the East wind, and he has become unstable

 He wants to become the Storm God, and destroy all the other Anemoi, and rule himself.Devlin is Eurus's son
 He has been so physically and emotionally abused by his father, that none of the other Anemoi can even think of trusting him

 This is his story


 It is a story of heartache, betrayal, hatred, and redemption.Aeolus has taken Devlin under his wing, trying to make him strong enough to defeat his father

 Eurus stole the ring that Aeolus wore, that controlled all the other Anemoi
 With that ring, it makes Eurus stronger than he should be


 But Eurus has done everything that he could, to make Devlin look like he is still a disciple of his father'sDevlin meets Anna, a painter who has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and is also color blind
 She is also more than she seems


 But what, truly, is she


 She seems to have an almost magical way of painting and can adjust the light in her paintings by thinking about it.This is the final battle, the one that will determine the fate of the Anemoi, and possibly the world as we know it

 Each of the books has been about one of the Anemoi, but it showcases all of the characters that we have gotten to know from book one through this one.This is not a stand alone book
 It could be, but is really best enjoyed by reading all four of the books in sequence

 The books are:  North of Need, West of Want, South of Surrender, and East of Ecstasy.

The topics and themes with this book based in the 70s are still relevant today. The author did a fantastic job at getting into the minds of the characters. Based in the South, I can relate to many of the customs and the culture of "making nice" for appearances sake. This was a great read and one that I'm glad to have added to my collection.

$review_text.: This is one of the most important books about yang style Taijiquan. You find it in a lineage with the books "The Essence and Applications of Taijiquan by Yang Chengfu", followed by "Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan by Fu Zhongwen", and it is succeeded by "Body mechanics of Tai chi chuan by William C. C Chen". To get better insides and a close understanding of Master Cheng's New Method it is strongly recommended to read his book "Cheng-Tzu's Thirteen Treatises on T'ai Chi Ch'uan" first. The New Method often cites the Thirteen Treatises.This book is not for absolute beginers. You still should have some basics in theory and practice. The form is understandable, the foot diagrams are strange in some cases. The hints by the translator are helpfull and theory becomes clear when read the third time.

$REVIEW.: I was deeply disappointed in this book


99% of the book is &#34;If I can do it, you can do it, too!&#34;, boring, badly-written self-help hype


The first third of the book talks about making goal lists, &#34;discovering&#34; your talents, and encouraging you to use your talents


Then, about a page and a half of Fiverr talk, with no proof offered of the author's method of earning money through Fiverr (other than &#34;I did it, so I figure you can do it too.&#34;)


The rest of the book lists old-fashioned, slow ways of making money (odd jobs around the neighborhood?) and &#34;watch your budget&#34; type of nothing advice.How to make $800 per month? Save your money and purchase a better Kindle book that will actually show you how to make the money you need.

Initially, I gave this book a one star. My rating would change to a solid three if the author corrected the errors.As per some other commenter, this should have been a good book. The author has a good story and good character development. Among the problems the author has is word choice [I suggest that he discard his thesaurus,] and the use of punctuation. Too many, comma's, and many of them in the wrong place.Another problem the author has is the perception that most people get very fatigued after walking a mile.I did read one awesome sentence in the book.

$review_text.: After the secrets and lies uncovered in Undertow, I just knew I would be in for some serious drama - and likely more than a little angst - in Watercolor. Before starting the book, I mentally prepared myself for the return of Jack, what I assumed would be the reappearance of Anna's feelings for him, and the likelihood that I would want to strange each and every one of the characters I've become so attached to for their behavior in this book. I was ready.Watercolor was very different than what I anticipated it would be. I thought I knew going in what type of storyline I was going to be getting, but I was so wrong! It was wonderful. It kept me guessing. There were smiles and squees and tears and just a bit of angst. It was everything I wanted - and more."Julian LaSalle, I've loved you since I wouldn't look at you in algebra class," I said softly. He leaned closer, and I kissed him. "I wanted to die every time you said something to me. That's why I hid behind my books. I've been crazy in love with you for years."I absolutely adore Anna and Julian. As characters, they're perfect to me. They're realistic and relatable and likable (yes, I haven't always felt that way about Anna, but I do now). I love them together and Watercolor is the first book where we truly get a large dose of their relationship. Dragonfly was more Jack-focused (grr) and Undertow had so many complex pieces, most of which focused on the history of Julian's parents. The focus in Watercolor is on Anna and Julian and I loved (nearly every) minute. It took me through the ups-and-downs of their relationship, the inevitable uncovering of secrets that had been hidden for a very long time and the impact those secrets had on the characters I love so much.Because I don't want to give anything spoilery away, I'm not going to say more about the plot. All I will say is that it wasn't entirely predictable. It kept me guessing. Loose ends were wrapped up and secrets, lies and betrayals were addressed. There are some sweet scenes and a couple smoldering ones. I thought this was the last book in the series and I feel the story would have wrapped up nicely if it ended here. Then I saw there was a fourth book, Mosaic, being released in 2014. I read the sneak peek. Oh. My. God. I had no coherent thoughts. I still don't. There's a brilliant twist that just makes *so much sense* I don't know how I didn't see it all coming. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fit together and I can't wait to see how it all turns out!***I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.***

$REVIEW.: When a book (or eBook, this case) has the subtitle "Courage and a kick to hug hope, face fear, and get going," it's written for me.And Scary Hope by Gary Morland is written for me.The author starts with a list of "hopes." Not for the book itself, but for the readers of this book. That's when I knew this book was written with heart, interest in others, and love."I hope you spend more time pursuing than regretting, second-guessing, and woe-is-me'ing.(Scary Hope, Kindle Edition.)"Do you naturally, on your own, think positive about yourself, other people, and circumstances? Left to yourself, with no one to talk to, can you get critical and depressed? I think it's part of our fallen, human condition. The Bible tells us to think about good and positive things, to "set your mind on things that are above." The Bible has to tell us that because we don't naturally do it. We need help."(Scary Hope, Kindle Edition.)It is important to distinguish between the hope we mean when we consider God's hope. That hope is expected, not a dream. The author discusses this hope some, but he also touches on the hopes we have for our lives in this age - our hopes within God's grander hope.We need His help to hope. We need His hope. To desire with reasonable confidence. To expect. To trust.Part of the author's message asserts that we never know an outcome until we act. How will I know if I can write until I write? How can you know if you can run a 5k until you run? How will we know if others will respond to God's Word until we share it with them? Hope inspires action.The author covers hidden hope, scary hope, joy in the midst of unfilled hope, persevering hope, and does it all in a seven-section eBook with a conversational tone, a touch of humor, and straight-forwardness. He issues blatant truths, too, not just sugar-coated dreams of wispy "hope.""Hope can stay unfulfilled. You end up disappointed, crushed. It happens...Hope is confusing. Is it just your own idea, something you made up, or is there something bigger there? Often it's hard to explain what you're hoping for, even to yourself. You might not even understand what it is you're hoping for."(Scary Hope, Kindle Edition.)The formatting seems to be a little odd in some places, but that may just be how the document translates to the application I'm using to read the eBook. But these issues are minor and do not detract from the subject matter. The author inserts a few internal discussion questions at the end of each chapter to spark application thoughts while you read."What if the depth of your wilderness was equal to the depth of the coming fulfillment of your hope?"(Scary Hope, Kindle Edition.)Scared of hope? Sometimes hope is scary. But it's worth it.

$REVIEW.: Rex Feral, Hit Man (Paladin Press, 1992)The incredible amount of attention Hit Man received after the 1993 James Perry case has blown the book way, way out of proportion, mostly because of first amendment issues. Paladin settled a lawsuit out of court by promising to pull all extant copies of Hit Man off the shelf and no longer offer the book for sale; this, of course, did nothing but garner huge amounts of free publicity for a book very few people had ever heard of from a press very few people had ever heard of, splash both book and press across the pages of newspapers across America, and immediately send the price skyrocketing on the collectors' market. (Copies of the book destroyed by Paladin--and this isn't the usual "strip" destroying, the books were actually torn in half horizontally--regularly go for upwards of $50 on ebay, well over three times the original cover price.) Another, even more harmful (from the lawsuit's perspective) side effect: the book is now out of copyright, and is thus easily found free online with a quick Yahoo search. What a great way to suppress a book: get it far more publicity than it would have ever had, and make it available free to any twelve-year-old who knows how to work a search engine!Many already existing reviews on the book, and a good deal of commentary inspired by the court case, consider it a joke. (One wag goes so far as to suggest "Rex Feral" is actually a romance author, judging by "his" attitudes towards women in the book's last couple of chapters.) If so, it's a pretty good one; the author has taken a good number of pieces of data that one can find in your average David Morrell or Ian Fleming novel, put them all in one place, and constructed a how-to book on the art of covert murder for hire. As Reason columnist Jacob Sullum says in his rant on the idiocy of the lawsuit, "Still, it's doubtful that people like James Perry were the main audience for Hit Man. If they were, somehow the thousands of murders they committed have gone unnoticed." No joke.This leads to another, more interesting (and sinister) hypothesis, and note that I have no evidence at all to back me up on this: Rex Feral really is a hit man. He wrote Hit Man to eliminate the possible competition. (After all, how much work is really out there, per year, for a contract killer?) Any reader of murder mysteries and espionage books is going to chuckle at the impossible complexity of some of Feral's supposed methods; what better way to get earnest young would-be hit men out of the way than having them spend weeks working on homemade silencers while the pros from Dover are out doing the actual job and collecting the fee? (And lord knows that homemade silencer would be, how shall we say, distinctive, when pieces were found. Anyone who's read three or four espionage novels is already familiar with the "bang-it-together-in-five-minutes" homemade silencer preferred in novels, which requires nothing more than steel wool and a few washers.)So the upshot? Don't believe the hype. It's amusing, for what it is, but the only real danger here is that a small cadre of stupid, incompetent criminals will end up dying of wood alcohol poisoning while trying to make these silencers. **

$REVIEW.: The Devil&#8217;s Salvation begins where the prior book Retribution ended. Kayla has left relocated far away in order to be alone. To really enjoy this deliciously dark story, you must read the series first and I highly recommend it for a nicely dark and rough erotica story. I really love Gage and to say he is a brutal character is putting it mildly! The sex scenes between Gage and Kayla are really hot and erotic, even when they were difficult to read. The author has written an AMAZING character in Gage &#8211; I do think he has some redeeming qualities, Number #1 being that he is wonderful to Eve, Kayla&#8217;s young daughter, and shows a surprisingly tender side with her.But this isn&#8217;t a simple erotic story, and it is not exactly a romance, either. The story is further complicated by the re-appearance of Ian and the question of whether Kayla will choose him over Gage. I know who I was rooting for from the beginning, but you will have to read The Devil&#8217;s Salvation to find out!I LOVE how Kayla comes to accept her darker side, and I also absolutely loved the sex and submission scenes. They are wild! Be warned that there are some very difficult scenes to read but I highly recommend this book, and the series for all fans of dark romance. This is a thrilling ride and should NOT be missed!

$REVIEW.: I am starting to love the 5th Street series as much as the Moreno Series!! I was anxiously awaiting the upload of this book to amazon all day yesterday. Constantly checking amazon on my Kindle. I could not wait to start this book! I was not disappointed! Elizabeth Reyes really does know how to create a captivating story. She kept me hooked....not sure what was going to happen next. And of course who does not love an alpha male :) I will be anxiously awaiting the release of her next book...whether from the 5th street and the Moreno Brothers!!

$review_text.: What can I say? I won't describe the book again but I will certainly give my impressions of how I felt about this novel. There are so many rock and roll romance books out at the moment and this is one of the best ones out there.Eliza is a college student, artist and an introvert. Gage is the lead singer of the emerging band, FireNine. There is a tour and Ben, Eliza's father happens to be FireNine's manager. He practically guilts Eliza into joining the tour.The sparks between Gage and Eliza are felt almost immediately and the reader is pulled into their dysfunctional friendship/relationship at once. Ms. Williams has a way with words and they are prolific and beautiful.You watch as Eliza, gorgeous and blonde yet insecure and unsure of herself is pulled into a no-strings affair with Gage. Neither imagined their hearts would get involved. They are both damaged by the past and can't seem to overcome what the secrets they burden themselves with have done to them as adults.I have to admit I couldn't stand Gage at first. He was a douchebag of the highest magnitude and here he was, strutting around like he was Adam Levine of Maroon 5 when his band has barely made it yet. They haven't hit the big time. They are more like Fall Out Boy beforeSave Rock And Roll [+digital booklet] put them on the mainstream map.But like Eliza, before three quarters of the novel, you are swooning right along with her. The sex is steamy but not dirty and this is a different kind of novel so if you are expectingReal Ugly (Hard Rock Roots), look somewhere else.This novel is perfect that it has just the right amount of angst but it's not over the top; the characters are damaged but they aren't self-destructive and they are constantly striving to be better people. I like characters who grow and you get to see these two grow over the course of the novel.This is part of a trilogy but one I will be following because underneath it all, it's a bittersweet romance within the rock and roll realm. It's the perfect New Adult novel and a great summer read.
$SUMMARY.: Rock n' Roll & a Bad Romance!

$REVIEW.: Very enjoyable read if you like this genre. It isn't mind-blowing. The writing isn't tier one quality -- a bit pulpy -- the characters aren't developed as well as one might hope. The book opens with an action sequence to provide the hook, then there are a couple of chapters of background, setting up the story line. Once the story starts moving forward though, the author does a great job of keeping the story line moving forward, and the writing is simple and interesting enough to not get in the way of the story.In a sense, by the plot not being overly dramatic or sensationalized, it makes the story seem more realistic and believable. I did think the book could have ended a chapter or so before it did. Overall, a good read. I read this in a day and a half, and for $2.99 on Amazon I will probably read another one or two in the series before all is said and done.

$review_text.: Monsoon Season is the story of Riley and Ben, two young adults who meet and fall in love. Author Katie O'Rourke handles the burgeoning relationship with deft hands, showing in moments and gestures how the two become acquainted and enamored. Here, Riley's hand meets Ben's amidst sparks and spasms; there, he reaches down and readjusts the blankets to cover her cold feet. Facets of their personalities emerge as we follow their movements. They spend hours playing board games and staying in, and days exploring the surrounds of Tucson, where Riley has moved from the east coast after graduating college. The terrain is foreign and new, as is the landscape of the relationship.And yet Monsoon Season begins with Riley on a bus, en route to her childhood home and separating from Ben. From the intimacy of their fledging love, the novel's lens widens to include a supporting cast. Donna, Riley's roommate who has stood by as one friend after another abandons her for romantic pursuits. Laura, Riley's childhood friend who got married young, after an unexpected pregnancy. Ben's mother, Teresa, still dealing with the repercussions from her own marriage. And Riley's parents, Mark and Carol, a seemingly normal middle-aged couple who may have more problems than they let on. As the young couple's circle widens, as the past and present come together to illuminate how they have found themselves in their current state, we begin to understand the complexity of their relationship (of all relationships), and the influences they've absorbed. And like the cracked Arizona earth unable to withstand the torrent of a monsoon, Riley finds herself at the center of a storm, life launching an onslaught from all sides. In the end, she must either drown or dry herself off.Monsoon Season is touching and feels honest; at times, the prose is lyrical and knowingly observant. Part coming-of-age, part love story, part family drama, it is peopled with vivid characters and tells a story that pulls at the heart and engages the mind. This is what it's like to love someone, to make a mistake, to start over. These universalities and their nuanced delivery are the strength of Katie O'Rourke's debut novel.Mary Vensel White, author of The Qualities of Wood

$review_text.: Before reading "Seeking the Spirit of the Book of Change," you may benefit from some background reading in daoist or other eastern philosophy.  While this is meant to be an introduction to Yijing, it also serves to seriously convey a great deal of traditional wisdom and practice.  Some of this stuff is incredibly old and offers a rich culture behind every detail.What I enjoyed best about this book is it stayed away from making outrageous claims, like some books in this genre tend towards. (i.e. moses code)  This is because the author isn't trying to just take people's money but actually teach something valuable.  Whether Yinjing measures up in reality to half of what the author purports is certainly up for debate, but I enjoyed the author's approach in teaching Yijing in a very practical way...despite my lack of practical application.  I'd recommend this book to anyone curious about Yijing for history's sake or looking to study it seriously

This book celebrates the bond between human beings and dogs.  The book is filled with wonderful pictures of dogs and their people from all over the world and includes breeds that you do not normally see in these books.  The book is a nice size and suitable for a coffee table book.  I really enjoyed this book and the author's positive feelings about our relationships with our dogs.

$review_text.: Ghost Omnibus #1 is a great Graphic Novel. I have already ordered #2. The talent of  the artist and writters in this Graphic Novels is incredible. The art work has all the perfect storying telling graphics that the best of the best could do. There is no dought of the graphic novels story telling technics used. I try to incorperate these things into my own work. This book has helped me very much to know that I will continue to use the training I received. The color is fantactic even by todays computer standards, and this was published in 2008.As for the story, it helps any man or women learn a little bit about themselves. Sometimes it makes you uncomfortable, but that's what a good writer is supposed to do. It brings out emotions and feelings we all have, and makes you think.Dark Horse is putting out some high quality stuff. I have read most of their stuff and will continue to do so. I recomend Ghost Volume 1 for the art and story. It is a great book!Theodore Raymond Riddle Creator/Cartoonist/Author

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by Stephanie, Parish (age 3), and Isaac (age 1) Rollins for Reader Views (8/07)Farley is a ferret who lives with Farmer Finley and other farms animals.  He goes to the fair with Farmer Finley every year to share boysenberry jam with the children.  Then a drought hits the area, wiping out the boysenberry crop.  Farley and the local children tried to come up with a solution to this problem.  They basically did a rain dance in the boysenberry patch.The boysenberry crop was saved.  The children were able to eat Farmer Finley's jam and bread at the fair.  Was it a miracle?  No one knows.Parish wants to give the kids a wipe to get the jelly off their faces.  She thinks that they are probably sticky.  Isaac liked the pictures of the farm animals.  The cover is painted in browns to depict the drought, but it is not attractive to kids who typically like vivid colors.  Toward the end of the book, when the rain comes, the colors get brighter.There is a CD that goes with "Farley the Ferret of Farkleberry Farm."  It retells the story with music.  There are children laughing in the background.  Parish and Isaac danced to it."Did you like that story?""HMMMMM....Yes.""Do you think the jam was good?""Yes.  Ma makes jam.""Yes.  She makes really good jam.  Do you think the dancing caused the rain?"She is too busy dancing with Isaac to pay attention to me."Oh, Parish......Do you want to keep this or give it away?""I want to keep it."Book received free of charge.

The author does a great job of weaving the fantastical with reality, and bringing them together as a single entity
The author takes you on a roller-coaster ride from the very first page, and it doesn't stop until the last page
I couldn't put the book down; I was dying to know what happened next


The author really keeps you on the edge of your seat
The book is fast-paced and suspenseful.The characters are written so well they really come to life right off the pages
The main character, Alex Cave, is a true man of mystery.As a debut novel, James Corkill really delivers


This is definitely an author to keep an eye on


I look forward to reading more adventures of Alex Cave.

$REVIEW.: The title "Developing Vision & Style: a Landscape Photography Masterclass" sounds like it might be an instructional manual.  But it is not, at least not in any conventional sense.  Instead it is a collection of beautiful landscape photographs, along with a number of opinions, some of them profound and a few sophomoric, about the meaning of vision and style.A substantial number of the pictures, although by no means a majority, were taken by the authors Joe Cornish, Charlie Waite and David Ward, who are numbered amongst Great Britain's most distinguished landscape photographers.  The remaining pictures were submitted by "aspiring photographers" who were invited to submit their pictures.  Most of the pictures are of the intimate landscape type rather than the grand view.  It seemed to me that there were a great number of lovely pictures of wet rocks and rocky shores.The photographers were asked a number of questions like "what does vision mean to you"; and "how would you describe your vision"; and "what does style mean to you"; and "how would you describe your style"?  Some of the answers are printed in proximity to the photographers' pictures.The editors claim that the book teaches by "encouraging students...to ask themselves critical questions and to take a fresh look at their personal vision, along with the style they select to express it."Perhaps this format would have been more effective if there had been some back and forth debate rather than just a collection of statements.  It might also have been more like a true master class if the three authors had offered a critique of the vision and style of the participating photographers.  Alas, the authors only comment on each others work, and then only to say how good it is.At the same time I realize that it would have been hard to get any photographer to agree to have his work published if it were to be the subject of a critique.  I also recognize that while trying to define vision and style may be difficult for any photographer, trying to get photographers to agree on such a subject may be impossible.  At the same time it may be useful for the individual photographer's development to come to his or her own definition of vision and style.In many ways, readers interested in this topic might do better to read Ward's book "Landscape Within: Insights and Inspirations for Photographers" in which Ward's discussions of vision and style are articulated in a better fashion.  For those who want a book to help them to develop their vision and style more than just to define the terms, I recommend an old favorite, Freeman Patterson's "Photography and the Art of Seeing".  Moreover, because I believe that understanding the landscape will help one develop one's vision and style.  I recommend Niall Benvie's "Creative Landscape Photography (Creative Photography)".For the creative photographer, vision and style are important issues, even though they may never satisfactorily be defined.  If this book can help the photographer toward a definition, it will have served a good purpose.  If not, at least there are a lot of lovely pictures.

$REVIEW.: An enemy right next door may prove difficult for an already difficult situation. "Evil for Evil" follows Billy Boyle, as he is sent to Northern Ireland to potentially put a wrench in a plot that would allow the separate country to join the Axis powers. A tall order for a southern boy, James R. Benn crafts a fine story using much of the trivia of history in his tale. "Evil for Evil" is a top pick and highly recommended read that mystery lovers will simply relish.

I've searched everywhere on google for ways to make money online, including GPT, Surveys, SEO, etc. Many of the methods were outdated or very confusing for a new person like me. I found this ebook and got it free and from the beginning on it explains everything you need to know and more, making it an easy transition for a new learner to this online money making. It's a great E-Book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about making money online.

After the story, there was an excerpt from the next Rizzoli and Isles book. The excerpt was interesting, and made me want to read the book. Reading a short story was not as satisfying as reading a full book, but it was nice to read about familiar characters.

$review_text.: The names are changed, but the story is nearly the exact same, only in Perfect Victim, it's a true story, and in Right to Life, Ketchum made it all up.**Here is the description for Perfect Victim:Hitchhiking from Eugene, Ore., through northern California in 1977, 20-year-old Colleen Stan thumbed a ride into hell

Her kidnappers, a sadistic lumber mill worker, Cameron Hooker, and his battered wife Janice, subjected her to seven years of torture and sensory deprivation


She was made a sex slave, kept locked in a wooden box and brainwashed into believing that an underground network of sadists would recapture her if she attempted to escape....this harrowing tale shuttles between the courtroom and the grisly doings in the Hookers' basement.**Here is the description for Right to Life....I made the changes all caps:SET TO ENTER AN ABORTION CLINIC IN NYC, in 1998, 40 YEAR OLD SARA FOSTER STEPPED INTO a ride into hell
Her kidnappers, a sadistic lumber mill worker, STEPHEN TEACH, and his battered wife KATH, subjected her to 7 MONTHS of torture and sensory deprivation

She was made a sex slave, kept locked in a wooden box and brainwashed into believing that an underground network of sadists would recapture her if she attempted to escape....this harrowing tale DEPICTS the grisly doings in the TEACHS' basement.Ketchum's got cojones, though, because it's very nearly a straight play*-jar*-eyezed (mispelled and split up because apparently it's a naughty no-no word in Amazon reviews) work, including the methods that the perpetrator (whackjob) uses to brainwash his victim AND the name of the fake underground network - The Organization.And like any Ketchum novel(la) you get two, two, two mints in one
Well, three, actually
There's the main story, and two short stories that have nothing whatsoever to do with the main story, and all of this rolled into 158 very short pages that were totally not worth nearly $12.

$REVIEW.: What I Loved: The Lore in this book was amazing. Toni did an excellent job of giving you the history of the Wiccan and Voodoo cultures, some of the spells/chants used, and a glimpse into their world.  This really helped to bring you into the world instead of keeping you on the outside.What I Liked: This book was about two cultures that don't get a lot of time in books.  Though there are a fair number of books about witches out there, the voodoo side makes the book unique.  The story was very compelling in parts and you want to see how it ends.Complaints:  The book was a little to all over the place for me.  It felt a bit like a stream of ideas that were grouped together but in some instances they appeared to be out of place.  That made it where I was little disconnected from the characters and the story in general.Why I gave it a 3:  The lore and world building was done really well in this book.  You can tell the author put a lot of work into making sure that the actions of the characters rang true.  For a first novel, this was a really good effort.Who I would recommend this too:  Urban Fantasy readers who like Lore and unique world building.  I think this will appeal more to those who love Urban Fantasy more than I do.  The romance was not strong enough for me personally (though it was there)

It turned into a beautiful, wonderful, comical, and emotional book. The way it starts with Chrissy talking about her husband and kids you get to see how happy they are as a family. But she doesn't tell you who the husband is. It starts back right where the second book ended. right back in the yoga studio with Kurt and Leo there. The things that happen in this book once everything is exposed is wonderful. Its the real truly, madly, deeply that everyone dreams about. It was the perfect way to end this trilogy. It amazing and wonderful. I am so happy that i got to experience this series.

Thoughts and feelings were contemplated more deeply-- or so it appears.I've read many of Trollope's books and would like to read them all. Most of his stories deal with serious subjects, but he still can make me laugh with some of the names he chooses for his characters.This is one intriguing story, with lots of twists and turns.

$review_text.: Courage and Honour heralds a return to Graham McNeill's rather succesful Ultramarines series. Uriel Ventris, returned from his Death Oath and reunited with his Chapter, is sent out to show the flag on a recently reconquered world, where he encounters the Tau, who've recognized a plum ripe for picking.While the first third of the novel is what was to be expected, with richly detailed equipment, characters, and ritual, from the trials that Uriel undergoes to prove his purity to the new armour he is fitted with, it seemed like a long deserved rest period. But then, after arriving on the battlefield and running into a brief scouting skirmish, Uriel is dealt off the the side. While the characters that all but replace him are at least entertaining, its like asking Skywalker to sit out of a Star Wars novel.The plot that follows feels like a rehashed plot of hit and run then retreat. This is not to say that its bad, but after rereading the invasion of Normandy for the fourth or fifth time, you know where things are going to head from a certain point on. Names and faces have changed, but the plot remains the same. The story finishes up with a good teaser for a future novel, but I'm definitely not looking forward to the next one like I did to this one.As an aside, seeing as how almost every one of my reviews now reads 0 of 1 helpful votes, please comment why if you don't find this review worthwhile. Thanks.

$REVIEW.: Gamble is the continuation of Josie's story post bridesmaid lotto. She heads off to London to start ghost writing a biography for someone famous, and naturally she gets herself into some tricky situations. While in London, her separation from Jake starts to put doubts in her mind about their relationship, and the constant mess with paparazzi just complicates things further.This story was cute and funny, just like the first. I love Josie and love being inside her head because she has thoughts that are just like mine. She is dorky and awkward and clumsy, and I love it. I do wish there had been more Jake in the story because I like him, but I understand that the point of this book was to challenge the relationship.I wish the book had been longer, but I enjoyed it for what it was. If you are looking for a light chick lit read, then this is a good choice.
$SUMMARY.: Enjoyable, light chick lit read.

This brings them into contact with Zephyr, Torque, and Flamingo.  It focuses on each character, where they are at when they are found and what their life was like.  It gives you background and depth to these characters so you feel like you know them and are rooting for them when they are faced with the danger and challenges that they all face.Harbinger is one of the best comic books on the stands today.  If you want to get in on this series, or if you have and don't really know the characters, than this book is an excellent place to pick up the story.More than that, if you just like great stories,  Pick up this book!

$review_text.: I struggled with this one
 I can't make up my mind if I liked it or not, hence I am going for 3 stars....
or should it be 4 because there were some good elements to the story?The theme and details provided to support the theme were good, for me it was that the characters were not really plausible
 Or is it that I just didn't like Viktor?  I kept thinking that I had missed a key in the character development.The good news is that I now have some good absinthe recipes under my belt.The gore didn't bother me

 The action was enjoyable
 The background information I found interesting.You might enjoy it, or it might do your head in

 Only one way to find out..........................

Jaxon is bent on his vendetta against Brandon and isn't above lies to stick it to him.Nancy is so confused when she is told that Hunter was killed. Jaxon tries to convince her that Brandon isn't a good man and that he was the one who killed Hunter. He convinces her that they should get married so they can be protected from both their fathers.We find out about a lot of the secret/lies being told and why Jaxon hates Brandon so much. Jaxon's plan is to use Nancy to hurt Brandon, but what he didn't count on was how he would come to feel about Nancy.So, what will Jaxon do for love? Or, better yet, what wouldn't he do for love?

$review_text.: I do not read much Fantasy. I prefer to look ahead, rather than back. This novel seems to be doing both, looking backward and forward. There is magic, but there will be science.I want to remark before I go any further, that I was pleasantly surprised that Nuttall gave not just explanations in a timely manner, but through using internal dialogue, why the character was explaining, to us and herself, why the explanation came about. These are not deus ex machina explanations, but organic. They come from the characters understanding of their world, and what they have been learning.I have been asking of myself if the number of times a modern cultural reference was a good thing, or not. And I have been unable to make a determination, as perhaps that being referenced will be as culturally long-lasting as other works that have been cited through the ages. Then again, will anything today have any permanent impact on the future, or is it all disposable?I would say that technically this is a bildungsroman, a novel of building the main character. I personally seem to have a soft spot for this genre. But I like seeing how someone can make something of themselves. Maybe because this is totally the mantra of America, or at least what it used to mean, that I get behind such works. Take the experiences that set you apart, and use them to fuel your growth, and your dream.

$REVIEW.: If I had to give a review this prequel to a series was unrealistic. The sex scenes were amazing without a doubt, but how the first  came about was reckless and almost unfathomable. This women to me was  basically raped her first time having sex. Dazed and confused should never be first time memories, nit matter how "turned on" a person is. I may be way off but not knowing her back story until later on in the book made it hard to feel a connection with Katrina. The mysterious Michael was just that, a mystery. His over dominance was at times a bit tacky. Slapping of the face is never appealing. Let's not make this book something it's not.

Courage, duty and devotion, yet also an eery technology that kind of made my skin crawl... on about 3 levels. ;-)It was a high speed ride that kept me from going to bed until I got to the ending, which reached out and grabbed my emotions. This was NOT your typical or predictable space opera tale! I enjoy stories that surprise me, that I can't predict. I had read the short story by M. Pax titled Plantgirl, and "thought" I knew what to expect. Whoa... this was just brilliant. Beyond my expectation.M. Pax has a descriptive yet poetic way of writing, even when talking techno-babble and describing crater pocked ugly moons! I was "there"... I could feel it, see it, almost smell it. It feels like all of your senses are involved in the story. You don't just read it... you inhale it, hear it, ingest it, live it! Can you tell I LOVED Semper Audacia?!Yep... I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: This is a fun and entertaining novel set in the present with a believable and likable hero.  The premise is that Earth is being invaded by a group of aliens who find the most average person on Earth, and use that person to discover how best to destroy the inhabitants so the aliens can colonize the Earth once all the humans are gone.Jacob Smith is the most average boy on Earth.  Most popular name, most popular favorite color, average sports ability, average grades&#8230;  I loved the idea that someone who is average, nothing special to outward appearances can become the hero his family needs and save the Earth.  The characters are wonderful, the Goth Sister, perfect Brother with a secret,  Computer wiz best friend, Crazy Grandfather with an Area 51 obsession, even the aliens are unique: the Fibonacks, aliens who are obsessed with perfection and write the equations of their perfection on their bodies.  Even side aliens like the Octopus like Alien that sits on your head and transmits signals across the galaxy was fun and unusual.I read this as a Netgally reader looking for books for our school library, but I enjoyed this enough and I like the premise enough to recommend our library purchase a copy.  Anytime I find a book that encourages kids to look beyond the labels society puts on them and does it in a way that is both entertaining and age appropriate I add it to our library purchase list.  And it is a Science Fiction novel to boot.  There are not that many good JF Sci-Fi books out there.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed reading book 4 of the Temptation Series about Hunter his twin Gunter & Dawn who have been friends since high school. Hunter & Gunter have only just recently re-united, it's been five years since the accident and according to the younger twin it's time to let go. Hunter went to the prom with his girlfriend of four years, they had a great time, he rented a hotel room and they both lost their virginity. It didn't go so well since it was their first time, Hunter was too quick on the trigger and was unable to satisfy Dawn, he promised it would be better next time. So they cleaned up and headed home, on the way there a car ran the light and ran right into the passenger door, sending Dawn to the hospital, never to wake up. Hunter didn't believe she would never wake-up so he paid for her care in a private hospital for over five years now, and every two week he brought new roses and a card and left it on her night-stand. Today is the last day he's going to come and visit, he will continue to pay, and in the event their is a change the hospital will call. Read this book it will make you laugh, cry and cum a lot. The author did a good job on the story, and the characters are amazing and sell the story. This book leaves the reader with a lot of joy and sadness. I can't wait to read book 5 Tara!

$REVIEW.: One can read this book on two levels--or perhaps two hundred.  It is smoothly and well written, and for one reading with just the conscious mind, it is fascinating, absorbing, and a wonder of a book.  On another level, I found myself reading it as a remembrance of things I had forgotten in the dust of ages past.  Things I had forgotten, things half remembered, lifetimes lived and not fully explored.  I found myself understanding the action in the book at levels far beyond the conscious mind.  Some might argue that the product of past life therapy is a group of mind fantasies, and if they do, nothing is lost.  As a past life therapist myself, however, I would question the mind's ability to produce something of the awesome depth of this book as pure fantasy.  Not only does this book have a profound depth and a wealth of metaphysical, spiritual and philosophical understanding, but it renders that wealth in a supremely readable format.  I would give this book 6 stars if that were available.

$review_text.: (Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis


Thanks to Entangled Publishing, LLC and NetGalley.)16-year-old Ellie is scared and confused by the blackouts she suffers from, which leave her waking up in strange places with no idea of where she has been or what she has done.What is the cause of Ellie&#8217;s blackouts? And what happens to her when she&#8217;s not in control?This book started out okay, but the last third was just weird.Ellie was an okay character, and I felt really sorry for her and the way she was constantly getting these blackouts
I totally got how upsetting it would be to wake up with a tattoo and have no idea how you got it, and to not be able to confide in anyone would be awful.The storyline in this was pretty good, although it did remind me of another book &#8211; &#8216;The Half-Life of Molly Pierce&#8217;

The girl in that &#8211; Molly, suffered from exactly the same medical condition as Ellie, and even had the same unnerving experience of coming out of a blackout to find herself driving a car.I did like this story for the most part, but the last third was just odd, and I didn&#8217;t really like it
In theory it might have been a good idea, but for me it just didn&#8217;t work out well, and I ended up feeling quite confused by the ending.There was some romance, but it wasn&#8217;t really a really good romance so much as just a part of the storyline.The ending was odd, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it

That last third of the book, and the strangeness and confusion of the ending really ruined this book for me.Overall; okay story, but the ending ruined it for me,6.5 out of 10.

I have been breeding clownfish with this and another book as my guides and this is the better one of the two. The other is more detailed but so scientific it is confusing. This one is reasonable as a resource. I have an M.A. in aquatic botany so I understand jargon, but breeding fish is a practical activity for many of us, not a scientific research endeavor. You'll like this as a resource if breeding these interesting fish.Good luckTim

Charlie is well developed, and the perfect heroine - vulnerable yet tough. As an ex-pat living in the USA, I loved how she confused the second floor - something I have done. And her line about Randy was priceless. I know I blushed when a person told me his name was Randy!The action is non-stop but believable, and a lot of research obviously went into the book. I loved how the book starts with the rollercoaster and we are thrown right into the action.I couldn't put the book/Kindle down and as soon as I was done, I ordered her other books. I am working my way through Book One right now.Bravo!!

$review_text.: In Dark Canyons, Bruce Blizard has written an unusually well crafted journey into the minds and perceptions of a vanishing breed of people -- the rugged individuals and nuclear families of the thinly-settled American rural west

 I have personally known such people through my own Grandparents.If the novel has one failing, it may be its title


 Teens or young adults raised in an era of television babysitters, Game-Boy mental anesthesia and Facebook cliches may have serious challenges engaging with this book


 Its fluid narrative moves several times from the interior thoughts and perceptions of the characters to an external point of sharp and unflinching observation -- a style rarely seen in modern writing and even less often done as well as we see in this book


 This is a book for anyone of any age who is willing to read for something more than entertainment.Fair disclosures:  I was gifted this book by the author and invited to review it for Amazon

 Likewise, I do not share Blizard's Christian perspective or beliefs
 My positive review occurs in spite of the traditions for which he advocates, not because of them.

It it not your average dystopian universe. It could be loosely compared to &#34;logan's run&#34; from the 70's. A shattered earth mixed with advanced tech, though in other respects the story line is not even remotely similar to that film.

$REVIEW.: Tim O'Rourke's journey into the "Adult" writing is a success! It only took me a few hours to devour WITCH. The characters were likable, the story line intriguing. While I have followed Tim's Kiera Hudson character from Vampire Shift on through all of the other books in the series', I think Sydney Hart is going to give Kiera a run for her money.In typical Tim O'Rourke writing fashion, he had me pulling my hair out brain screaming "WHAT???". I have enjoyed watching Tim grow as an author for almost two years now and WITCH is proof of that growth. Well written and in my opinion rivaling that of some published authors. Tim, a big well done to you friend. You have done a great job.I HIGHLY recommend WITCH! Get it, read it, share it with your friends!

$review_text.: Originally appeared on my blog, The Arkham Digest.British supernatural horror seems to be booming these days

Names like Adam Nevill, Simon Bestwick, Reggie Oliver, and Gary McMahon spring to mind


Nevill has been a favorite of mine and his fifth novel comes out this year

 Bestwick won me over with his short fiction and then had a hit with his first novel The Faceless which was published last year

Gary McMahon was another author who first snagged my attention with some of his short fiction and has been keeping busy, with an impressive output of novels in the last few years alone.McMahon has done something that is not too often seen in the field of horror fiction, and has delivered a horror trilogy


The Concrete Grove was published in 2011, and was followed by Silent Voices and Beyond Here Lies Nothing in 2012
They have all been well received, so I finally picked the first one up off my shelf and gave it a read.The Concrete Grove is a fine example of urban horror


At times I think it's better described as "dark urban fantasy", but the horrific moments are plentiful enough to classify it as horror

McMahon opens the novel with a bang, the first chapter easily grabbing the reader's attention and setting the mood for what to expect throughout the book.The novel follows a few different characters, all of whom have issues


McMahon does a great job making believable characters that each have their own flaws and weaknesses
Some aren't even all that likeable
The story follows Hailey and her mother Lana, who are forced to live in The Grove (a council estate, known in America as "projects") after their husband shames the family before committing suicide

To provide for her daughter Lana has made some shady decisions of her own, placing her in debt to Monty Bright, the local crime-lord/loan shark


Into this dubious mix enters Tom, who becomes entangled in their lives when he comes across Hailey one night and offers her some assistance

Tom lives outside The Grove, but sometimes his nightly jogs take him through the outskirts, which is how he becomes involved

Tom is a lonely man trapped in a loveless marriage to an overweight, paraplegic wife


This has meant years of acting as a caregiver and putting aside his own happiness, and the strain on him is finally reaching the breaking point.Tom soon becomes obsessed with the beautiful Lana and they begin a relationship, as Hailey grows more distant and involved with some sort of "entity" or "force" residing in The Needle, a decrepit, condemned tower block in the center of the estate
Tom also has the distinction of being the most convincing character, and McMahon expertly paints a portrait of a man struggling with guilt and desire
His plight seems a bit more realistic and every day than Lana's, which seems to make him all the more believable
Hailey is intriguing, but probably the least likeable character of the bunch.McMahon's biggest accomplishment with The Concrete Grove lies in his ability to turn the setting into a character in its own right

The filth, the gloom, the oppressive feel of the Grove itself is established from the first page
It feeds on all the negativity, poverty, and crime
It feels real, and even without the supernatural elements it is a horrific place

All the more so because places like this actually exist, and as someone who was raised in a place that's more rural than anything the thought of having to live in such a decayed, dirty urban area is enough to make me cringe.As to the horrors of the novel, I'm glad to say they are many and they are varied

The supernatural beings are creepy enough, but perhaps the weakest of the novels many terrors

The breakdown of the characters and their dark thoughts strike a deeper chord, and are what intrigued me the most, but perhaps most horrific of all were the horrors perpetrated by characters themselves


Monty and his thugs are vile, wicked, sadistic and disgusting

Setting usually plays a major role in horror, and as I've said previously McMahon does an excellent job with creating an oppressive, gloomy setting

 All of these horrors blend together smoothly and seamlessly, working in concert to hit all the soft spots of the reader.Overall McMahon has written a novel that's successful on many levels, and that it's the first of a trilogy (it appears each book follows different characters) about The Grove itself is quite exciting


The plot wraps up nicely, but McMahon has only scratched the surface of The Grove, and seeing more of its mysteries unfold is something I am eagerly looking forward to.

$REVIEW.: Packed into one tidy book, all of them linked with a letter theme.  I enjoyed the variety of stories and only wished I could have had more time with each character in each book.Story #1- The author did an excellent job putting you right with the people on the hike and made me wish I was there with them, or that I could do that hike and three day camp for myself!  The only negative I would say was that the book ending was a bit abrupt, BUT, I've never read anthologies before and understand that they aren't that long.Story #2- A wonderful story with a Bucket List vibe.  The main character ends up doing her grandfathers bucket list of things in Seattle after he unexpectedly dies.  I really want to be that 70 year old woman when I'm that age and still kicking butts and taking names!  Cute story and it ended well.Story #3- My favorite of the six stories, it seemed to be the one with the most beginning-middle-ending story line.  That one felt like I'd read the whole story with no missing parts and no abrupt ending.  The &#34;letter&#34; aspect of this story was a funny &#34;she did, he did, and it's all a big misunderstanding&#34;  enjoyable roller coaster ride.  Adorable ending, and ended with the feeling that nothing was missed in the telling of the story.Story #4-  Quite unexpected in the letter link, as the two main characters were both illiterate!  How can you have love letters being sent to each other, when neither character can read??  This author does a fabulous job of it, and I'm not going to give away her trade secret, you'll have to get the book and find out for yourself. :)  Again, kind of thought the story ended a bit abrupt, and would have liked to have had a longer story of them together and the life they would have led in the town they settled in.Story #5- This story had a fun ugly duckling, becomes the swan she was always meant to be in the eye of her beau, who after living and growing up together finally see's her for the person she actually is.  They become pen pals, but under false pretenses and have to reconcile the trust that is lost when the truth comes out.  Wished I could have read more about them, but I'm the type of person who doesn't think an 800 page book has enough pages in it to satisfy what I'm wanting in a book.  So that is no reflection on the parts of these authors.Story #6- The final story in the anthology was again a story I liked, set in a time and place that I just love to read about.  England in the early 1900's, the two characters families are linked through the past and events that are misunderstood by both families, and it isn't until letters are discovered that the truth starts to come out and both families can reconcile their histories.  You are rooting for these two people to come together and the heroin isn't going back to the cold, unfeeling &#34;almost&#34; fiance that she left behind in America to come and sell the family estate in England that was left to her as the sole heir.  All I can say is, I wish the story had been longer to satisfy my hunger to get to know the story.I felt that way about all of the characters in all of the stories.  I'm not disappointed, and thoroughly enjoyed all of the stories written by these authors.  Kudos to them all!  A good anthology with a letter theme written through all of the stories.

$review_text.: For all the genre's good, and bad, Without Mercy is the prototypical Western


Perhaps that should be stereotypical Western..
but for the most part it works
The 125 pages fly by as Morgan Kane loses a fortune in a rigged poker game, is ambushed and left for dead, and sets out on a course of revenge

The plot has been done a million times before, but the compelling characterization, excellent pacing, and credible dialogue more than make up for it


If you can get past a small dose of adverb poisoning and the occasional grammatical foible, the book is quite entertaining

Not perfect by any means, but well worth reading.

$REVIEW.: When I first graduated from college and moved to Arizona to become a teacher, a friend gave me a copy of "Educating Esm&eacute;" as a parting gift. Not sure about it (and wanting to stay away from my professional life when reading for pleasure), I let it sit on the shelf for many years before finally picking it up and reading it. I'm glad I waited; I don't know if it would have meant as much to me as a novice teacher as it does now that I have a handful of years under my belt.As others have mentioned, the book is Esm&eacute; Raji Codell's diary of her first year teaching fifth grade in Chicago. Fresh out of college, she is young, idealistic, and determined to change her students' lives. Being in diary form, it is also slightly narcissistic. Part of me wanted to admire her, part of me felt that I could relate to her, and part of me wanted to throttle her.I must say that Esm&eacute;'s book is no-holds-barred. It's reality, plain and simple. For those of you who don't spend every day in a classroom, let me assure you, this is what teaching can be like. Not every day, of course, but all teachers have stories similar to Esm&eacute;'s - frustrations with administration, with the system, students talking back, yelling, surprising you in wonderful ways. I admire her drive and passion, though I do think that she overdid herself. And, as other reviewers have said, I found Esm&eacute; herself to be a bit self-righteous. Yes, we've all dealt with frustrations in the profession. However, most of us don't go around blatantly defying our bosses. While I feel that she certinaly had her students' best interests at heart, I found her methods to be a bit questionable when dealing with the red tape teachers are faced with. Given that the book was published pre-No Child Left Behind, those not in the education field should know that the red tape she talks about is only a fraction of what teachers in this day and age are up against.Overall, I found "Educating Esm&eacute;" to be a funny, charming read that I could relate to. I'm not sure whether or not Esm&eacute; is a role model in the profession, but she definitely was successful with her students. And at the end of the day, that may be all that counts.

$REVIEW.: Life is rough in high school--even for dhamphirs.  Rose Hathaway is in her Senior year at St. Vladimir's.  In six months, she'll be a full fledged guardian, protecting her lifelong best friend, Lissa, a Moroi Royal.Rose is on her way to take her Qualifier.  She's going to be tested by one of the guardian greats, Arthur Schoenberg. Since he cannot leave the Moroi royal house he is guarding, Rose and her teacher, Dimitri, are coming to them.What they find instead is slaughter. All Moroi and Dhamphir members of the household are dead--apparently a plot by the Stigoi vampires and humans in conjunction.St. Vladimir's reacts with alarm.  The school won't be allowing the students to leave on Christmas break.  Instead, a ski resort will host all the students together and attendance is mandatory.Then--another Royal house is attacked and it becomes obvious the Stigoi are set to attack all the Moroi royalty and end the lines. While the Moroi are arguing defense, some of the factions are considering a more offensive approach--which, to this point, has been forbidden.Did I mention that Rose is having man trouble?  She's in love with Dimitri, her teacher, but she can have Mason, a fellow guardian-in-training.And--since the guardians in training need even more defensive training, guess who's come to teach special classes?  Janine Hathaway, Rose's mother, who'd given up raising her child for her career...What impresses me most about "Frostbite" is Rose's character growth in one short novel. You really read how events shape Rose's thought processes and can see how this young heroine is being shaped for her future in service to the Moroi.The intro to this book is one of the best I've ever read. In author parlance, it's a 'tell', but it's a great introduction to Rose's world and the three types of vampires inhabiting it."Frostbite" is the second book in Richelle Mead's 'Vampire Academy' series. It's written for young adults, but I promise you adult readers are going to enjoy every minute of the story.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next book.

$REVIEW.: After suffering through some lagging stories of late, Hot Sinatra`s readability was as exciting as ditching a polka band for a live showing with Sinatra, himself.My normal genre reading wouldn't lead me into a crime novel about Frank Sinatra's lost record, but it's refreshingly easy-to-read style, and endearing characters really impressed me. Hat's off to Axel Howerton, and his editing team at Evolved Publishing, for producing another book that reminded me why I enjoy reading.Hot Sinatra starts off with private investigator, Mossimo Cole, visiting an old folks' home to learn about a stolen, one-of-a-kind Sinatra record. For someone who prefers stories on an epic scale, that shouldn't have drawn me in as much as it did. The author's deft subtlety in blending humor with glimpses into Mossimo's good side, endear us to his imperfect nature, while chuckling at his whit and silly cohorts.In this opening page, he describes the old folks as "shambling out onto the front lawn like plaid-suited zombies," but, because of his grandfather's upbringing, honors him, and them, by taking a second to offer "a lazy wave back and shout, `Looks like a nice warm day shaping up there.' A terrible cliche, but what the hell else did they have to talk about?"The author's smooth prose continues to pull you into Mossimo's experience, and adds more layers onto his smart-mouthed humor as he takes a job from a stubborn old man. Soon after, the action amps up, and we see how Mossimo's humor gets him into trouble:I pulled my hands out from behind me, and half-cartwheeled to throw my still-bound knees and the chair they were tied to into his gut. The chair splintered and I was free, but the big Nazi was up fast, dragging me to my feet."Truce?" I winked. "I know some nice Jewish girls I could introduce you to."He heaved me up to his eye level and growled like a lazy bear at the zoo."Black?"Headbutt."Asian?"Gut-shot."Hispanic?"He tossed me like a rag doll over a heap of scrapped wooden chairs and table parts, into the corner of the room. As I struggled to my feet, he lumbered forward, hurling debris left and right like Godzilla clearing a path through downtown Tokyo.The story is vulgar at times with the language and sexual references, but I laughed more than I have at most books, with the worst part of the sexual aspect being dialogue description of hallmark acts of two porn stars you'll meet later. I could have done without these two elements, but I enjoyed meeting Mossimo Cole, and despite those hangups, really enjoyed the story.The reason why I enjoyed the story, other than the fact that I enjoyed the author's style of prose, was because of how he highlighted Mossimo's character flaws concerning booze, women, and controlling his tongue. He's a troubled soul who is trying his best, and I enjoyed rooting for him to succeed through his mistakes, cheering when he grew as a person.Mossimo is a very interesting person, from his way with kids, to his fluency in eight languages and thirty instruments, to a stubbornness of taking on sharks knife to teeth, or three different gangs,(whatever the day calls for in his crazy life), and on top of all that, is he's a smooth talking lady-killer. His cavalcade of qualities seemed a little too fantastic at times, but the author supports each of their origins through Moss's backstory, making you shrug your shoulders and say, "Dude's just got it going on." You don't want a dull main character supporting a series of stories, and I enjoyed how the author set up future books in this story's conclusion-kind of like my favorite TV show, Castle, with the humor to boot.

$REVIEW.: In the first paragraph of the introduction, Galvin clearly states what he set out to do:"This book has two parts. The first part is a fictional story of four twenty-somethings who are having major problems with bad bosses. Through the story, you will learn Biblical principles for leading and following well. The second part expands on these principles with more insight and references from the Bible. It is intended to help you develop your theology of leadership."The one word that comes to mind as I look at what Galvin has written is "disconnected." I actually enjoyed the first part far more than I thought I would. True, the conversations were a bit artificial, and the situations a bit unrealistic. I would have liked to have seen one of the four being in a situation where nothing worked, and had Galvin explore the options when faced with an impossible situation. But it is a story format that effectively teaches the principles the author desires to get across.The second part to me seemed a bit redundant. Much of the material had already been presented in the narrative section. I did not find that much that merited wading through this section. I think a far better approach would have been to have broken this section into smaller sections, and inserted them into the narrative. That way they would have served as review, and would have helped to drive home the truths that the narrative was teaching.All in all, I found this book to be helpful. Galvin has insights into authority levels that would help eliminate a lot of frictions that we often find in our daily lives. The weaknesses of the book does not justify not reading the book, which possesses strengths in excess of its flaws.If anyone would like more information about this book, they can check out the book website:www.tenthpowerpublishing.com/ivegotyourbackThis book was given to me for review by Handlebar Hub.

$REVIEW.: Would I recommend this book?  With qualifications.The author sets out to tell little known tales of Tahoe and the surrounding region, especially focusing on some of its literary residents and visitors.  It is the author's belief that this mountain lake had significant impact on America a number of times.Pros.  It's interesting.  It's not necessary to read the chapters in order and I suspect that a person might choose to dip back into it numerous times.  The strongest chapter concerns John Muir and his failed effort, working with other people,  to establish a national park in the basin.  This was part of the author's doctoral dissertation, so he had plenty of material to work with.  Another interesting chapter concerned Mark Twain, who spent three years in the West as he avoided the Civil War.  The author provides quotations about Tahoe from Twain's Roughing It, which most of us are familiar with, but also includes a couple of evocative passages from Innocents Abroad, where the author is comparing it to the Sea of Galilee, to the Sea's considerable disadvantage.Cons.  My most serious criticism of the book is that it has neither end notes nor a bibliography nor even an index.  The author is very opinionated, and makes numerous assertions which, due to this deficiency,  it is impossible to check.  His very liberal perspective  may be a problem for some readers and refreshing for others. I consider myself fairly liberal but compared to him I look like a John Bircher.  I found his focus on minority groups who were persecuted to be overblown.  For example, he goes into considerable detail about the forced labor, which he labels as slavery, of the Native Californian in the Central Valley.  His story is that this is necessary background to the particular tale he is telling -- for me it was a distraction.In summary, I think this is an important book about Tahoe for residents and those interested in its history. I checked it out of the library and will probably buy it.

$REVIEW.: I haven't actually ever watched a reality show, so this was an eye opener for me.  Rewarding people for selfish and deceitful behavior seems wrong, but not really surprising.  Admiration for cunning and "getting away" with bad behavior is what America seems to embrace.  It was a little discouraging to read about though. I got this as a free download.Abby is a book reviewer who is commanded by her boss to participate in a survival TV show to get a behind the scenes diary and generate interest for the show's ratings.  While on the island, Abby is paired up with super athletic Dean and after a bumpy start, begin to fall for each other.  But the environment is not conducive to a trusting relationship and despite Abby's belief in Dean's sincere feelings for her; she begins to fall for the other contestants' opinion that Dean was just using her to win.  How will she ever know if he truly liked her or was just using her for his own glory?This is a quick read with blatant descriptive sex between the two main characters. Neither of them seems to be concerned that their every move is being filmed.  Both Abby and Dean are likeable characters, but Dean's transformation from super competitive contestant to love sick puppy seemed wrong and Abby seemed way too aggressive to wind up crying so much.  I am not sure about the title either - Wicked?  The only person truly wicked was Lana and she was not even depicted as the villain or as someone who would get what she deserved.  That would have been satisfying.Would I/Did I buy it? YesWould I read it again? YesWould I recommend it to friends? Yes

$REVIEW.: I read the first book by this author,Highland Healer (Highland Talents)and quite enjoyed it except for the last part. I was willing to try the second book and took a chance despite the lack of reviews and despite the price. Firstly let me summarise by saying that the h is the 'laird' of her clan and she is a widow. Her clan is weak and vulnerable because most of the men, including the old laird and her husband were killed at Flodden. They are left with mainly young men who don't have the skills to protect themselves. The H comes with a group on behalf of their laird wanting to sign a treaty with the h's clan and they discover what a vulnerable position her clan are in.***Spoilers***The h is a seer and thinks (she isn't sure of his face) she has seen the h in her visions and she throws herself at him (several times) and wants him to stay and train up their men because he is the arms master for his clan. I really didn't enjoy this storyline because I felt the h should have had a bit more dignity. The H was very quick to refuse her and it made her come off as desperate, even though he says he's attracted to her. I'm not a fan of relentless pursuit of H's by the h's. In this book she is made to seem desperate even though she is beautiful and the Laird. The other big problem with leaving this storyline to drag on for so long (nearly 3/4 of the book) is that when they eventually 'fall in love', I was left wondering when that had happened. The H was so busy fighting the h off that there was no time for them to get to know each other or for love to develop.I will say that the last 10% wasn't bad but it felt like a little too late.

$review_text.: To me, the mark of a good novel is that when I'm finished reading, I want to pick up the phone, call the author, and say, &quot;Write more about these characters!&quot;. And, that's what I'd like to do here.Langer writes about quirky, interesting, people in a little visited time, the late '70's and early '80's. The book is set on the North Side of Chicago. The ten or so main characters intersect in wonderful and strange ways. Often a supporting name will pop up in a different mix than orginally set. There's very little plot to &quot;Crossing&quot;, but that doesn't matter.So, Mr Langer, pleae write a second novel and let us know what happens!PS - I'll never quite use the word &quot;which&quot; the same way again, after reading this book!

$review_text.: Beautifully, achingly honest, Hope's Journey is a realistic exploration of a teenage pregnancy.  Written from an LDS perspective, Worlton  emphasizes what a taboo subject this can be in LDS circles, how cruel and prideful we can be without realizing it, and how our snap judgements of others can be so very unfair and unwise besides.  Told through both Sydney and Alex's points of view, she explores subjects such as worth, worthiness, insecurity, accepting change, forgivness, and repentence.  Her characters are not only realistic but endearing.  You will wish you were one of their friends.As a general rule, I avoid books that look to be "poignant" or "heart-warming," but this was one I could not resist.  Admittedly, I was influenced greatly by the cover, which is one of the most beautiful and intriguing I have ever seen.  For me to enjoy a story, the writing has to be good, and the story has to be worth telling and worth the time it takes me to read it.  But most importantly, I really need to connect with the characters.I completely connected with Sydney.  Though having different outcomes, Sydney's experience took me straight back to my own high school experience, my own high school boyfriend, and my own inability to "break up" with my best friend even when I should have.  If I had truly loved him, I would have.  Working from both the male and female points of view, Worlton accurately describes the reasons why being serious with someone when you're both so young is so dangerously playing with fire, reasons I heard a hundred times as a teen and never, not once, actually interalized and believed--because I was like Sydney: a straight-A student, a good girl, and the exception to every rule.I liked Alex's comparison of girls to cars, of Sydney to a Porsche--gorgeous, desireable, but something he was completely unprepared to take care of and a committment he was completely unprepared to make.  But, when we take adult priveleges we have to accept adult consequences, and I loved how, when her options became limited, Sydney owned up, made a new plan, and moved forward.  I would have liked to see more of Alex's acceptance, as well as a few other ends tied up, such as how his mother responded to his decision!I enjoyed how all the terminology and references to sex were so tastefully and tactfully done, but I do think this would be a limitation outside of the LDS market.  Same to be said of the situation as a whole; most of the world would probably not see much wrong with teen pregnancy and even less wrong with premarital sex, let alone consider it a sin that needed to be pain-stakingly repented of.  Not taking this into consideration might even put us in the same boat as the judgemental old hags in Sydney's ward!I appreciated Grams and her words of wisdom.  She could view the Sydney's situation from a more eternal perspective than anyone else.  I loved Gabe's sweet devotion.  And Damon.  Oh. Man. (fanning myself with my hand).  Even Sydney's brother.  His own plans took a back seat when Sydney needed his support.  She inspired devotion in so many.  How could she really be as terrible as those who were judgemental believed her to be?This book is so completely a romance while the two main characters spend most of the book apart and misunderstanding the other's good intentions.  Usually misunderstandings, things that could be cleared up with a conversation, frustrate me, but this was just so sweetly done, and in truth, the relationship was much too complex to be cleared up with a conversation.  So many other factors came into play because Sydney and Alex had not lived enough of life (college, steady income, experience in general) for the relationship they had developed to work as it should.I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially teen girls and women.  An enthusiastic 6 of 5 stars (the extra one's for Damon).

While I would have really enjoyed each story as a stand alone novel, they were all fun, had well developed characters and were interwoven due to the common setting of Tangerine Street.The town itself seems quirky and like a cute place to visit and each of the stories fit in with that setting quite well. Each had its own focus and set of characters, but places in town, like The Fortune Caf&eacute;, were mentioned in more than one story. There was romance to be sure, but it was clean and fun. I just noticed the word fun in almost every sentence of this review, but the book was fun! I smiled while reading it a lot and there were places where I laughed out loud.I will look for other books by these authors in the future & am hoping that maybe more will be set on Tangerine Street.

$review_text.: *I received this book free from NetGalley on behalf of Random House Publishing Group &#8211; Loveswept in exchange for an honest review*This is a story about a sexy rock star so of course I had high hopes for it, and it held to most of them.A little girl with an obsession over one superstar grows up to work for the very agency that now represents him. Lacey is a junior executive at a talent agency, a job she enjoyed and wanted to keep, but an unexpected and forced assignment puts that in jeopardy when she&#8217;s forced to spend two weeks with the man she once obsessed over&#8230;still obsesses over. Dante. It surely puts her acting professional to the test.When Dante recognized a certain girl, who had caught his eye at his concert the night before, at a meeting that should have been boring he suddenly gets an idea and forces her to be the one who goes on tour with him instead of her unsavory boss. Why he wanted her he couldn&#8217;t exactly put his finger on, all he knew was he wanted her close. Very close.As Lacey fights for her place amongst the roadies and guys in the band, it doesn&#8217;t take long for other feelings to erupt.This book has a great storyline. It&#8217;s funny and sad and it&#8217;s full of rock star goodness! It alternates points of view between Lacey and Dante, which helped to get to know the characters better. The only downside is that although I learned a lot about the characters, none of the information was exactly shared between Lacey and Dante. There are things I learned as a reader that I wondered why were never discussed between the two of them.My Favorite Moments: The first night Lacey meets Dante in his hotel suite. I loved every second, all the way up to her waking up and him finally leaving. There is also this little thing with well-placed shower nozzles that make for interesting showers.

$REVIEW.: Entitlement: An Angela Masters Detective Novel by Mike Worley brings the Heat.  Worley writes this novel like a movie script.  It simply flows with mystery, suspense and action.  Detective Angi is a powerhouse character, strong woman, good at her job and her hunches are pretty spot on.  Worley provides background details at the beginning of the story, which I dearly appreciate.  Erica, a young woman has gone missing and Detective Angi is on the case.  This novel presents many twists and turns at times you think you know who did it and how, but Worley will throw a monkey wrench in your theory.  This book is reminiscent of CSI and Law & Order wrapped up in one.  But it is so much more than what you would experience in a 45 minute episode; Worley presents the reader with the whole picture looking at this missing person, a possible crime, all characters thoroughly defined in one novel.  Great job Worley excited to see what comes up next.

I should say no more than 20, probably less- is so short that the plot feels incredibly hurried: there is no time for any real narrative tension to develop and the only reason Bradley and Cooper seem to like each other is that they are "mates". A pity, considering that there was quite a potential for conflict.Of course roles in bed are rigid and unchangeable.It is good I got this for free otherwise I would be upset.

$REVIEW.: Devotional Boost for Time Crunched Days (a review of The 40-Day Devotional Challenge to Encourage Your Heart and Deepen Your Faith by Kathi Macias)Reviewer:  Janice S. GareyI was fortunate to read this devotional on my Smartphone.  It would be wonderful in other formats, but my phone stayed readily available for unexpected reading moments. The devotions begin with a scripture quote and related discussion. Kathi Macias hits the mark with examples of applications of the daily scriptures for current times.  For those who want to post their personal reflections, the book contains space for journaling. The length was perfect for reading on the smaller phone screen.The devotions are relevant to things people deal with in daily life. They point the reader to God&#8217;s standard of living. They are like a booster shot (that doesn&#8217;t hurt) for infusing your days with Godly thoughts and applications of scripture.The 40-day length of the book fits perfectly for a reading during Lent, but it works for all seasons. I looked forward to each reading knowing I would be edified by spending time with God through the writings of Kathi Macias.I received this book from bookfun.org in exchange for my honest review.  Honestly, you will benefit from any book by this author!

$REVIEW.: Desserts in Jars reacquainted me with memories of my Grandpa and our time spent together eating mini desserts and parfaits out of jars. The appeal of pies, puddings, cakes and more in little single serving dessert jars was one I could totally relate to. There's just something about eating dessert in your very own special jar that makes it all the more decadent.Desserts in Jars is full of a wide range of recipes and beautiful photos. The photography in this book is stunning and the recipes are well written with easy to follow instructions. So far, my favorite recipe I've tried is the Tres Leches cake. From the presentation down to the flavor, this was one recipe I'll be returning to time and time again.If you are looking for a cookbook full of fun ideas, delicious recipes and beautiful photography, you won't be disappointed with Desserts in Jars.
$review_summary.: A beautiful cookbook!

$review_text.: This is book 3 of the Modern Witch Series, and my favorite so far!  It's a very touching story of a young orphan finding a family in the "Witch Central" crew.  I couldn't put this one down!  I do wish the author would expand the romance side of the stories a little...I'm a sucker for a good romance and my only disappointment in these books are that the romances never are about the main character and therefore you don't hear much about them.  Lauren was a favorite from book 1 and while "A Witch Central Wedding" covers her wedding, I wished I could've heard more about the romance leading to it in "A Reckless Witch", where it begins.  However, still a great read and I definitely recommend this series!
$review_summary.: Favorite of the series so far!

$review_text.: The younger/older man romance in this particular book was touching and freeing because the older man felt trapped in his life's routine.  Then something unexpected appeared such as this young man visiting his grandmother and they connect. The story flowed nicely and I believed in the attraction and the feelings of both men trying to find happiness moving forward together.  This was the first book I have read by Vivien Dean and look forward to more books like this one.
$SUMMARY.: a sweet romance
