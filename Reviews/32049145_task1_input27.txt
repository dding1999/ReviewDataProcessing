$REVIEW.: This is a really great page turner


Loved Letting Go but I think I loved this story even more.This is Jane and Cams story


I was so happy that we got to read more about the characters we met in Letting Go

We get to read about Jane and Cams past
This has a gripping storyline full of suspense and steamy hot scenes.Be warned this has a kindle throwing cliffhanger- yes I was tempted


Highly recommend these two books and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

$review_text.: Feminism changed the way women felt about marriage.  Women started putting off marriage.  They believed the lie that women were better off relying on themselves and not depending on men.  The problem is that women discover, often too late, that being single isn't all it's cracked up to be.Suzanne Venker's bold new book, "How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace with Marriage", dispels the myth that women are better off without men.  In spite of the title, this book is not a guidebook in finding a spouse.  It's not going to show you where to go find a man who will put a ring on your finger.  The purpose of Venker's book is to change the way you think about marriage because you can't find the right person if you can't be the right person.If you are a young, single female and you've fallen for the lie that feminism has perpetuated, then reading this book will either offend you or change you.  You will either walk away with your heels firmly dug in or you will decide that maybe waiting until your 30s or 40s to get married may not be such a good idea.If you are older and have been married for awhile, you may still hold some feminist attitudes that have affected your marriage in a detrimental way.  By following the 12-step plan Venker lays out in her book, you may find a happier marriage waiting for you.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from PR By the Book as part of their Book Review Blogger Program.

$REVIEW.: Colleen Coble's books are soooo good ... my only complaint is that her historical novels come way too far apart!This book was actually a lot different than other books it starts out with her father dying ...(which we find out later that he was actually murdered) and Lucy has the care of her younger half-brother and half-sister. She thinks all will be find until she loses her job and she also has to move out of their home ... she is at a total lose of what she is going to do. Then out of the blue a man comes along that is an old friend of her father's and offers her a life-line. He has a proxy signed by his son ... and wants her to marry her son. She finds this certainly not something she is inclined to do but as she is in such a difficult position ... she is not sure what she needs to do. Then she starts getting threatened by a man and gets even more scared about taking care of her sister and brother by herself. Reluctantl, she chooses to do so ... and the story begins. To add to the drama ... Nate (the son) has no idea that his father has done this ... and is to say the least is most upset over him finding himself married and to all things ...to a City Girl!It is fun to watch her try to prove herself and to find out that she really needs to only please God ... to see them both fall in love (obviously) ... but then there are twists and turns that no one expects tht makes this book exciting and interesting. Any Colleen Coble fan will love it and if you haven't read her before ... this is a great time to start! Now, we get to wait a full year for her next historical ...
$SUMMARY.: Excellent historical with some mystery mixed in ...

$REVIEW.: J.M. Aucoin has an obvious love of classic pirate tales and swashbuckling adventures, and it shows in his debut short story. We've got quite the rogues' gallery of characters, and the author is able to fill his scenes with rich historical flavor. Although this story is a little light on swordplay, there's plenty of tension and drama, and some great character development. By the end of the story, there's definitely enough here to whet our appetites for more of Jake Hawking and the crew of the Night Howl.

$review_text.: The Lust of the Irish by Miriam Michaels is the first in a series of three romance stories.  It is an enjoyable short story about Will O'Hara, a 200+ year old vampire.  The story begins with a description of Will and then a flash back to 1800's Ireland to explain how Will got where he is today.  Will is a nomadic loner who does his best to control his urges to consume human blood.  He usually does a good job of this by substituting sex for human blood, but occasionally he becomes the object of suspicion and finds that he has to move on so he will not find himself being scrutinized to the point of having his true identity discovered.This book was a really quick read and I was eager to see where Will's adventures took him.  I found that I liked the characters and the overall style of writing by Ms. Michaels. My only criticism is the graphic sexual scenes that seemed to last too long.  While I do not think this book is appropriate for anyone under the age of 18,  I was not at all offended by the content.  I understood that the author was trying to show the intensity of the passion that was occurring in the moment, but I felt that it was at the expense of having the story progress.  I found myself skimming those parts because it felt like the story was too bogged down in describing each body part.  The author could have conveyed the same ideas with out spending so much time on those sections.  Despite that, I liked the story and I am eager to see what happens to Will and the object of his affection, Colleen in the next two parts of this series.
$review_summary.: Enjoyable, but definitely not for young readers

$REVIEW.: Lets face it, GIMP is a complicated program and can drive you nuts trying to learn how to use it


 This book can make that learning curve a little easier and make the program function the way you want it to
 There is still a lot to learn, but you just have to focus and you'll get there
 The program is great once you understand it

 I highly recommend getting the 'Printed' version, rather than the Kindle version, as there are pictures and stuff that you really need to see in color, plus it would be easier to search for specific topics


 Great book.

$REVIEW.: Shadowman: Birth Rites written by Justin Jordan with Art by Patrick Zircher and Color by Brian Reber has all the flair, action, gorgeous visuals and drama of a superhero cinematic experience.  Justin Jordan does a masterful job carving out an interesting and layered Magical corner of the Valiant Universe.  Patrick Zircher, one of the best superhero artists in comics today, brings this dark corner to life with some truly beautiful artwork.  Brian Reber's colors compliments Zircher's art perfectly.  This introductory trade paperback of the re-launched Shadowman introduces an updated version of Jack Boniface (aka Shadowman) from the classic early 90's version.  Jack is a 20 year old kid who grew up in foster homes looking for answers about the parents he hardly knew and ended up getting much more than he bargained for -  when the Loa, the Voodoo spirit that is part of the Boniface legacy, bonds with him and he becomes the new Shadowman.  At times this comic feels like a made for Hollywood Superhero movie and that is both the good and the bad with this Trade.  It is at times beautiful to look at with exciting action and imaginative plot but at the same time lacks some depth and insight with the main characters with dialogue that comes off as more cheesy than compelling.  Overall, its still an excellent and fun read and a great start to a comic that gets better and better.  .

$REVIEW.: I ordered this light after seeing it recommended on another retail site.  A few people mentioned in reviews that it can tend to be heavy, but as someone with moderate arthritis, carpal tunnel, and a physical disability that effects my grip, I find it quite manageable.  I barely notice it, honestly.I will admit that it's a good thing this light has a flexible stem, as you will find yourself needing to move it to illuminate each page.  However, it's again quite light and it will only take one finger to do this most of the time.  This isn't ideal for everyone, obviously, depending on level of mobility in your hands.  However, if something like that is not a concern this light can be great for you.  I was really impressed with just how easy it is to angle the light.I also appreciate that the clip-on mechanism, used with some trepidation on the spine and pages of my book, was firm and remained in place but did not in any way harm the book.  It's a very well-designed clip, and not only will it go on your book if you want, but you can also stand it up on a surface.  That's something many clip-on lights cannot boast.The light on your text will have a blue tint.  It was odd at first, but since I love this light I am planning to get used to it!

$REVIEW.: This is the second volume of what will be several reprinting the various Flash Gordon comic book series from different publishers.  At the time of this review, there are 3 out, with a fourth on its way, and probably atleast one more.This volume reprints the stories published by King Comics, a very short lives (1966-67) attempt by King Features Syndicate to have their own comic book line.  I don't know why it ended, can only assume they had distribution issues.  Prior to this, pretty much all their stuff had been published by Western (first with Dell, and later thru their own Gold Key imprint).  After this, all their titles went to Charlton (why there instead of back to GK, I have no idea).King Comics run of was Flash Gordon issues 1-11, and backup stories in The Phantom 18-20. The art included work by such veteran artists as Al Williamson, Wallace Wood, Frank Bolle, Gil Kane, Ric Estrada, Reed Crandall, Mac Raboy, as well as two issues reprinting Alex Raymond's 'The Tournament of Mongo'.  Just in term of the quality of artwork, this was the high point.As to the stories.As noted, there was a short-lived backup series in the Phantom comics, with art by Wally Wood.  This was a separate storyling of Flash against space pirates that sadly wasn't finished.In the main comic, the first issue gave a brief synopis of what had happened in the early comic strip with Flash and friends on Mongo, and had a couple of great stories in the style of those original ones.The second and third issue again had a variety of stories of Flash & company, one of which pitted Flash against Ming.The fourth issue started what would be a long series of adventures in the 'lost continent of Mongo', that would run thru issue 8.  Along with these were various other stories of Flash and company.Issues 9 & 10 reprinted Raymond' "Tournament of Mongo" storyline from the classic strip.  Am not certain when this originally ran, but know it was earlier in the series.And issue 11 leaves with another 2-part story of Flash and company in an adventure in the lost areas of Mongo.Overall, an great collection, despite a few low points.

$review_text.: This book was very gothic, dark and cold.  It is set in the 40K universe.  40K (for those of you who don't already know)stands for the Games Workshop gaming system called WARHAMMER 40,000.  It is set in 41st millenium (duh) where the forces of good (represented in this book by the Inquisitor Obidiah Roth) does battle agains the Archenemy (literally).  Presumably, they're Chaos Marines, but in this book, they just don't feel like it.  They feel more like renegades, or pirates or something - rather than worshippers of the Ruinous Powers.This is one of the things that makes this book a little bit more accessible to Non-40K fans.  The author uses non-40K language to explain things.  Sometimes, particularly regarding the heros, it's very descriptive and realistic. The plot is pretty dark and sophisticated.  It would appeal to non 40K fans as well due to the intrigues.An inquisitor has gone missing.  An Inquisitor (like Roth)is kind of like a cop/soldier/priest/witch-hunter -think of Hugh Jackman's VanHelsing - set in the far far future.  Anyway, Roth and his crew are sent to find the missing Inquisitor.  On the way they uncover the legend of the Old Kings of Medina.  Nobody really knows too much about them; it's another of the lost legends of the 41st millenium. (Blood Ravens will read this and cry!)  Both Roth and the Chaos Marines are searching for the Old Kings.  There is a bunch of Imperial bureaucracy trying to get Roth off of Medina before he finds it.I liked the book because it had a lot of action.  The fight scenes were short.  Some of them lacked believability.  Sometimes books like this will waste time giving background and exposition into the 40K universe that fans (or people who really like action) don't want/need.  Most of the time, the battle scenes involved Roth and his crew breaking contact and escaping.  Much of the time Roth was running around the planet avoiding being picked off.  Roth is an Inquisitor - not a Space Marine.  He and his crew are not heavily armed (by 40 K standards) and not ready for  serious WARHAMMER beatdowns.  The Archenemy, on the other hand, is incredibly  well-armed and they are ready to use it.If you like Inquisitor (I know not a lot of people play it anymore, but . . . .)then it's pretty good.If you liked the EISENHORN books, you'll like this.  If you're looking for large-scale combat in your SF novels, you might not like this.

$review_text.: A selection of bits and pieces of various lesbian novels from 1950 to 1965. The author writes a fascinating introduction to the world of lesbian pulps and then the selections come up. At first I was entertained and found it a truly interesting insight to what lesbian life was like back then. However it started to get tiresome. There's no real reason given why the author picked the selections she did. She mentions some in the introduction but not all. Also a lot of these books are the same thing again and again--two women in love and their friends. They all read like they were from the same author. The books started to blend together. There were no real standouts here. After a while I was frankly bored and just skimmed through the last few selections. This is a worthy subject but a shorter book (this runs over 400 pages) might have worked better--and more clarification on the choices.

This was truly a pleasant surprise in thriller reading that I am glad I took a chance on...Author McCarty Griffin has very sensitively and honestly portrayed a story of one young woman's ordeal in a tale that will take the reader through some tough decisions made by the main character that will either have you shaking your head as to why it took so long or nodding in approval when Pammy finally "grows a backbone"!A short read but one that will absolutely put you right there with Pammy and Bobby cheering her on and hoping against hope that her plan to rid herself of her ex works...My advice is to buy a copy of this tale and see for yourself what lengths a woman will take to be free of a man who made her 12 years of marriage Hell on Earth ! The ending will surprise you but I applaud the author's choice as sometimes revenge can come back to bite you when you are not looking!The book is available from Smashwords and Amazon among others to buy in ebook formats for any e-reader...I must disclose that the books author McCarty Griffin sent me an e-arc copy ofHalf-Inchto read for an honest review. I have received no other compensation from the author or publisher other than the pleasure of reading the book!

$review_text.: What if Nancy Drew had succumbed to one of those many blows to the head she used to suffer in her mysteries but refused to give up the case?  What if during one of the many abductions of Daphne, the villain had killed her instead and now only Shaggy could see her and hear her and thus had to handle all the communications between her and Fred?  Those are just a couple of questions raised by this multi genre mash-up that also borrows heavily fromGhostas well as from the politically motivated scaremongering about Yale's "infamous" Order of the Skull and Bones secret society during the presidential administration of one of its members, George W. Bush, scaremongering that exploded in the faces of its mongerors after it was revealed that 2004 election opponent John Kerry was also a member.  ("Explain to me how the conspiracy is supposed to work NOW?"  "Shut up!")A product of the foster system and adoption by a couple poorly equipped at expressing affection towards her, Olivia (Liv) Bloom has become an art prodigy and a rebellious, feelings hiding loner, an almost guaranteed misfit at the prestigious and nauseatingly pretentious Wickham Hall prep school she has received a scholarship to.  Much of it turns out exactly as she expected: elitist snobs, suffocating rules, and cruel traditions, but there are surprising bright spots: an almost worshipful art professor who recognizes her talent, an oddball fellow "scholly" or scholarship student who sees dead people, and most amazing of all, she finds herself falling in love, mutually it would appear, with a fellow artist and scion of one of the school's original families, the "Wickiest" of the "Wickies".  Though repeatedly warned away from him, Liv refuses to listen, following her slowly opening heart, right up until the moment she is viciously murdered and finds herself the latest member of a host of ghosts of murdered girls, all victims of a monstrous conspiracy that spans 150 years.  Refusing to accept her fate, Liv, Gabe the ghost seeing weirdo, and her heartbroken boyfriend Malcolm must find a way first just to communicate with each other and second to unravel the mystery before it claims another life.  All things considered, it was a surprising and satisfying read.Defects?  Well, I disagree with those reviewers finding fault with the romance.  Love at first sight between people so divided by status tends not to be a good idea, but it does happen in life as well as in fiction and in any case is arguably necessary here in order to move the plot along more quickly so that with Liv being murdered on page 88 it is plausible that Malcolm is ready to risk everything to solve her murder.  In contrast I must agree with those finding fault with the ultimate conspiracy, which is far more ridiculous and convoluted than anything I've ever heard of or could suspend disbelief in.Finally, author Amy Talkington takes the time to toss in a couple of criticisms of Christianity that have nothing to do with the plot and appear to be nothing more than personal PSA's placed here because she could get away with it.  Liv (and one assumes the author) take time out to condemn Bible-based Christianity for condemning homosexuality as sin and preaching the exclusivity of Jesus Christ as the only source for salvation....Well, OK, but neither of these teachings is in any way new or novel nor is either based upon torturing the meaning out of some obscure verse references.  Moderns who read the Old Testament, even those disinclined to argue with God, are likely to be astonished by the repeated and severe condemnations of homosexuality, coming from many different authors, writing hundreds even thousands of years apart.  It is almost as if, rather than being merely the musings of many ordinary men over the millennia, the Old Testament had been inspired by an omniscient God who somehow knew that someday homosexuality would become the first sin with an advocacy group and was determined that when that day came His opinion on the subject would not be in doubt.  Then Jesus came along to offer salvation to sinners, but note that He did NOT do so by announcing that sin was now "OK".  With a very few specific exceptions, mostly regarding Jewish ritual, what was sin before Jesus was still sin after Jesus.  Much is made of the fact that Jesus said nothing specifically about homosexuality, but it should be remembered that where Jesus DID speak about sexual sin, far from loosening restrictions, He actually tightened them.  Both polygamy and easy divorce for men, perfectly legal under Mosaic law, came under condemnation as God allowed but not approved accommodations to Man's sinful nature.  In addition Jesus offered up the astonishing concept that in God's eyes, desiring to sin was every bit as bad as doing sin, thus lusting was the equivalent of committing adultery just as hating was the equivalent of committing murder.  In short anyone who thinks the Jesus of the Bible could be "OK" with homosexuality doesn't know Jack about Jesus.Next, with regard to exclusivity, the problem is that Jesus states over and Over and OVER again that He is the exclusive way to salvation, and Christians have no choice but to accept it.  However, exactly what this means for those who never had the chance to hear about Jesus is unclear.  Children dead before the age of reason clearly have a Get Out Of Hell Free card, but adults are a different matter.  On the one hand the Bible says we are without excuse because nature itself proclaims its Creator; on the other hand the Bible says that God recognizes His own throughout the world and will draw them to Him.  The resolution of this seeming paradox for Christians is arguably to do everything we can to spread the Gospel and trust to God for the rest.In any event, the worst possible response to either teaching (or to anything else we might not fully understand or agree with for that matter) is to use it as a reason to tell God to go to Hell while proceeding to do so ourselves.

$review_text.: First off, let me say that this book stands alone easily.  I understand it is a prequel to Hybrid but do not let that stop you.  I have not read Hybrid (yet) though after reading Amanda's Story it is on my list of books I do want to read.Amanda's Story plays out in two distinct parts. The first part details the Honduras ordeal.  She is the newest member of a medical team sent to discover and contain a lethal, fast-acting agent with an unknown etiology.  The team and their security detail are overwhelmed by the disease and chaos that ensues.Eventually evacuated, the 2nd part of Amanda's Story is, in many ways, even more terrifying than the first part.  Amanda undergoes mental changes that drive her to the brink of insanity.  Keeping her mental aberrations reigned in and secret from the doctors and medical staff at a clandestine facility in which she is quarantined is a challenge.Secretly, she flexes her new abilities trying to measure and learn control.  Never a particularly gregarious person, Amanda withdraws even further as the changes continue and she fights to regain her autonomy.  Meanwhile, there are factions that wish her further harm and pull every political string to get unfettered access to her, all, of course, for  "the greater good". There were a few times I felt the pacing stagnated slightly; I wanted to move forward while the author recapped or reiterated a point, but I'm an inpatient reader who dislikes rehashing ideas.This novel kept me glued to my kindle, and a spectator in Amanda's world for a day and a half.  It is frightening, realistic and very addictive. I cannot wait to read Hybrid and find out what part Amanda plays in that story.This book was given to me by the author in exchange for my honest review.Reviewed by Laurie-J

$REVIEW.: I've followed Heidi's blog via email updates for about a year now. I have made a few recipes from there, and I picked this book up at the library.As other reviewers have noted, she has gorgeous photography, and her instructions are clear and helpful. She is artful in her use of the English language, I must say. She is my go-to source for tasty and creative vegetarian dishes. I should mention that I am not a vegetarian, although probably a third to half of the meals I eat each week are. (I did experiments with going veg that didn't work out for me, because I seem to really need animal protein to be healthy.) I do genuinely think veg food is tasty, but I don't think it is a healthy diet for everyone.So why three stars?PROS:-She stresses using organic, quality, whole ingredients. That is essential, in my mind, for healthful cooking.-She doesn't stray from saturated fats. Thank goodness! I was so glad to see that Heidi isn't part of the anti-saturated fat campaign. If you are skeptical, and believe that saturated fats are terrible for you, google the "diet heart hypothesis" and "women's health initiative" and you will see that in the past few years, research studies are showing that a diet low in saturated fat actually doesn't reduce your risk of heart disease or cancer. Even more interesting is that the whole idea was built on shaky use of data to begin with. Google "Ancel Keys".-Did I mention Heidi is an amazing photographer?? I want to eat the pictures.CONS:-Heidi does a lot of innovative work, and these recipes are testament to that. However, some of her methods aren't based on traditional cooking techniques. For example, there is phytic acid in whole grain flour (wheat, rye, etc). Phytic acid blocks nutrient absorption and causes other digestive issues over time. I am not going to go into a lot of detail, but it is important for flour to either be soaked before it is used (like the teff flour she mentions from Ethiopia--they always ferment it for a few days to make injera bread in Ethiopia), or the grains should be sprouted and then thoroughly dried before they're ground into flour. I didn't see evidence of her mentioning that in the book. (If I'm wrong, I would appreciate someone pointing that out.)-This may draw the ire of some vegetarians, but I have read a lot about soy foods being harmful to one's health. As a woman in my child-bearing years, I have chosen to remove soy foods from my diet, even though I had a happy love affair with tofu for a long time. Soy foods can mess with your hormones, ladies. I think traditionally speaking, soy was fermented or specially prepared to be consumed in smaller quantities (miso, soy sauce). And we generally eat a lot of soy here, either knowingly as vegetarians or often unknowingly in processed foods. So recipes in this book that are soy heavy, I just skip. That is a bummer. (And again, I recommend googling the subject for more info.) After I went totally organic in dairy and meat, and cut the soy out of my diet, my menstrual cycle is like clockwork now. Sorry if that is TMI, but it's true. This is after 14 years of it being unpredictable.So I give three stars to this book. What I do is take what I've learned about traditional food preparation methods (i.e. soaking flour/sprouting grain, etc) and incorporate those practices into these recipes to have something tasty and healthful--in a way that has stood the test of time. It's a win-win: healthy preparation + awesome Heidi taste!For more info on traditional food preparation, I recommend Nina Planck or Michael Pollen books for the theory, or Nourishing Traditions for the practicality.

$review_text.: A dating site, an intriguing first approach, the beginning of an impossible relationship?Right from the start the aura of mystery, secrets, and erotic emails will hook into a story like no other.  The emails between Catherine and Watts are incredible.  For a shy, self retrained girl like Catherine, the anonymity the Internet provides is her shield.  For Watts, Catherine's intelligence is so attractive, it encourages him to let loose and pour his thoughts and fantasies into his correspondence.Who is Watts?  Is that his real name?  What is his life like?  Why would it put Catherine in danger to meet him? Inquiring minds want to know!Remarkably well written, these characters come alive on the page to involve the reader in the mystery that surrounds them.  This is book #1 of the trilogy.  Although there is no cliffhanger, you will be hungry for more after reading this first installment.I love mysteries and thrillers!

$review_text.: A 3.5 rating is more accurate.  Vampire Warlocks & Exes is a good addition to the Karli Lane series but it was just too short and a bit less satisfying than the first book.  Moreover, this book was filled more with Karli's romantic emotional agnsts and recaps from the first book rather than action but I still enjoyed it.  There are a couple of love scenes that are pretty hot and some profanity that other readers might find offensive but this book was not trashy or sleezy as some claim.  I really like Karli's character, but she does whin a bit too much, and like her I still can't choose between Vance the Warlock or Leo the Vampire.  They are both simply delicious.  Every woman should have such a dilemma.  lol  Although, I suspect that the author will have her end up with Vance, at this point, I'm leaning more in favor of Leo.In this installment, we finally find out why there is so much animosity exist between Vance and Leo.  I don't think this book would make a good stand alone read since it pretty much picks up where the 1st book leaves off.  That said, the author does do a good job of summarizing the important events from the 1st book.  Nonetheless, I think that reading this book will be a more rewarding experience if one reads Book #1 'Pixie Dust' first.My second complaint is that I don't understand why we have to wait over a year for the 3rd book.  Quite frankly, unless one sets an electronic reminder regarding the release of Book 3 in "early 2014", which I did by the way on my cell phone, most people will simply have forgotten the Series and moved on.  Such long delays between books don't seem like a smart marketing strategy.Ms. Lee, Since fans have to wait over a year for the next book, I truly hope that it will better than this one and worth the wait!If your interested in reading a lite paranormal romance with a good helping of humor, spunk and sass then you should give this one a try.

 I was not lost  when reading it.I loved Marcus and Lisa

 Marcus' past is not hidden and easily found by goggling his name

 Lisa is hesitant to start anything with Marcus because she doesn't want to be in the limelight

$REVIEW.: When I picked up this book I knew what phpBB was (my main reason for getting the book), but the other two applications were foreign to me


So, let me start off by briefly pointing out what each application is and does:- Drupal is a CMS, content management system, (think Wikipedia) that allows users to input and update information- phpBB is bulletin board software (very much like Invision or Jolt from surface appearances)- WordPress is blogging software (do I really need to say more after 2005, the year of the Blog)The publisher has chosen to group what amounts to three separate books on three open source applications together based upon the 'community' aspects that they engender, allowing groups of users to come together to post, comment and counter-comment.The book is effectively a collected user manual for these three applications, but that does not really go far enough
Yes, the material for each is available online, but this book collects the documentation together in a user friendly manner


Anyone that has tried to install and operate a complex piece of software based upon the canned manuals can appreciate the complexity involved
Using this book is essentially like having an experienced guru looking over your shoulder offering advice as you go through the process


This can be the difference between 30-60 minutes of simple work and 5-6 hours of confusion, frustration and ranting.Add to this the advice on configuration and usage/management for avoiding pitfalls and achieving best case results, and this book can pay for itself in no time (I bill at $50 an hour and consider my personal time even more valuable).Bottom line, if you want to keep users on your site (i.e

not farm out these services), and want to use a CMS, bBoard, or Blog using open source software, it is worth your time to check out these options


If you then decide to use one of them, this book can save you a chunk of time and frustration.P-)

Read Love At First Bight, before you read this one


This one can be read stand-alone but it all makes much more sense if you read them in order
Also, the 1st book is better.The four mission-mates (my description) are off to travel the galaxy
The 'crew story' from the 1st book is fleshed out and the reader finds out what really makes all the characters tick.You finally get to see Emi in her position as crew doctor/empath/lover and she shines

You get a better feel for Aaron, at last

Caph & Ford seem to get more explanation in book 1, so this one is more focused on Aaron than the other two men.It's an enjoyable read and keeps you rooting for Emi's research as well as her healing of Aaron's wounded soul.This book also includes some of the other characters from book 1 who come to the aid of these four main characters.This is a menage, in EVERY way
All four characters offer 'equal love opportunities' so be prepared for m/m, m/f,& m/f/m/m

$review_text.: This is the third installment in the Rock Gods series and they just keep getting better and better! At the end of the the second book, Take What You Want, it's clear that something is gonna start brewing with Jayson and Cooper. Oh, and it does.....Jayson Keller is Chase and Danni's good friend who meets Ivory Tower's drummer, Cooper Rand, at a party at Alex Metcalf's (fellow band mate and Chase and Danni's lover).  Sparks fly immediately between these two, and there starts their east coast, west coast long distance romance. To watch their relationship unfold as they both come to terms with how to move forward, Jay and Coop learn the meaning of trust, patience, honesty, loyalty and true, undying love for each other instead of dwelling on any of their angst and uncertainty that could ruin them....the result is breathtaking....beautiful and sexy....the love scenes were scorching hot.....The thing I love about Ann Lister is that she creates all of her characters to be vulnerable and believable...every one of their feelings become your feelings as well....and, this is a biggie for me, I love how the acknowledgement and importance of ignorance and bigotry towards gay people is brought forth and dealt with in all her stories. Jayson's step-father, Ron, tops the charts with his hatred and verbal abuse towards Jayson. Jayson has a step brother, Eric, 17, with whom he's very close with and of course old Ron thinks he's gotta put a stop to that....you know, because Jayson's gonna turn him gay....things escalate badly between Eric and Ron which leaves Jayson no choice but to head back east to defend his poor brother. Jayson takes matters into his own hands in an intelligent and kick ass way....I also loved how Alex hired exclusive photographers for his, Chase and Danni's commitment ceremony and will have all of the proceeds from these pics sold, going to his favorite charity for anti-bullying of gay kids in schools....now THAT is keeping it real!!!!I hated to say goodbye to Jayson and Coop but at least I know they're in good hands with each other...! Next up, I say Wheland!!! And remember...love is love....it doesn't matter who we love but how deeply we feel...sigh.....loved this book so much.....love you Ann Lister&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;!!! You rock!!! &#127932;

$REVIEW.: Oh, what a completely fun, light-hearted read... JUST what I needed after the heavy read I had finished prior to this.I loved this story. I LOVED Wesley! I mean, goofy, adorable boy, really what isn't there to love about him? And oh, his reactions to Kayla were just too cute.And those kisses?! OMG. *fans self*... those were amazing.There aren't many times I actually want to be IN the book I'm reading. But I wanted to switch places with Kayla in a freaking heartbeat just to be near Wesley.Wes is officially my current favorite book boyfriend. I feel it will take a lot to dethrone him.

$review_text.: That One Summer is a fantastic third installment in the Summer series, giving us more of the incredibly sweet (yet sometimes painful) romance that I've come to expect from Duggan
She is definitely one of my favorite authors!!The negatives:Slightly less light-hearted.This book was a bit less light-hearted than the first two books, mainly because the leading man is the brooding Chris instead of one of the other, more bantering Onslow boys
Tammy is also a bit more serious than Tess and Amy were


Since Tammy hangs out with the group we've come to know and love we still get the occasional quip, but there is a lot less banter in this book than in the previous two.What I loved:Believable characters.One thing that I love about Duggan is how she writes characters that feel so real to me
All of her main characters are vulnerable in some way - Tammy has spent her life feeling just a little bit invisible and not always knowing where she fits in
She loves her best friend Amy and the Onslow boys, but she can't help but feel like a bit of an outsider around them, even when they've welcomed her in

I feel like I can totally relate to this type of character and all of her self-doubts
Tammy wants to bask in their acceptance, but she can never quite get over her own hang-ups in order to do so

Then there's Chris

He's the serious, responsible one in the group


The one who always takes care of everyone else and makes sure that the crazy antics don't get too out of hand
I could see how he fell into this role and why it makes it so hard for him to truly let go with anyone - even when he wants to - like with Tammy


When Chris' sweet side comes out, you just can't help but see in him what Tammy does!Slow romance.This was one of those cases where the romance between the two main characters is relatively slow to develop - which I appreciated

Tammy isn't instantly in love with Chris - not even instantly lusting over him (though she does have some stray thoughts that lead that way)
In fact, Tammy is pretty intimidated by Chris at first, and she has to get to know him pretty well before she really starts crushing on him


Yay!Road trip!Road trips are always fun, right? Even when they're miserable and crazy and full of disasters (which this one sometimes was)


This book had that classic road trip feel - where the main character takes a physical journey and also takes an emotional journey as well


Tammy's trip has lots of bumps along the way, but it's all worth it when she gets to that final destination!So, once again, I highly recommend this series
Go get it


Now


I can't WAIT to read the next full-length book in the series, which will focus on Adam and Ellie - Adam was one of my favorite characters in book 1 and I'm excited to see more of him!! That One Summer earns 5/5 stars.***Disclosure: This book was provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review

$review_text.: Christmas came early for me and I received an ARC for this book for an honest review.The story was super cute and heartwarming, especially since the characters are dressed up as an Elf and Santa.I loved Brooke's feistiness, her sarcasm and sense of humor as well as the playful banter between her and Chris (especially the part where they go back and forth about the &#34;big package.&#34;)He was such a good sport for putting up with her crazy family (which was a clear indication that he was truly interested in her) How could you not fall in love with Chris?!? He was clearly patient, didn't give up on his true love and pulled her out of the sadness/darkness she was experiencing, but most importantly gave her back some x-mas spirit. Chris was just so romantic!The book is a great quick read...loved it from start to finish and will definitely recommend it to my friends/family/FB....only thing I'm a little down about is that I want more of Brooke and Chris. Aside from that, the book is excellent!!

We used to go to the Bean Festival down in Tracy, CA so we never get tired of eating or learning about beans.Which makes this book one anyone who loves food archeology, or bean cuisines should at least read if not own. No it doesn't cover everything about beans, but it covers enough to make it worth a read.After all how many Americans know that virtually every culture has some type of bean dish? Or that beans as a food source goes back thousands of years?

I felt there was a rush to "get it over and done with" and that left me floundering.After enjoying my first Ava Stone I bought all her available books, so I'm a real fan. Believe me, this is written as a spur to Ms Stone to write the other characters' stories with a closer look into their hearts as was evident before.I hope first-time readers of this series will not be turned away from what has been a delightful collection of stories.

Though short enough to easily read in one sitting, the story of Appalachian Serenade introduces readers to the small town of Wise, West Virginia and the quirky characters that inhabit it. Thomas composes a sweet, satisfying love story, while creating an interesting discussion of dreams and family. I enjoyed every minute of this quick trip to Wise and cannot wait for the chance to return in Miracles in the Dry Season.

$REVIEW.: I quite enjoyed reading this book, my first by Laura Landon.  The premise was a little different than what you normally find in Regency Romance.  Thirty year old virgin seeks someone through a brothel to ruin her so she doesn't have to marry a depraved man.  Man chosen to ruin her has already lost two wives and children to childbirth.  He vows never to impregnate a woman again.  But guess what????  Yep, he impregnates the virgin.  He is then on a quest to find her and make sure she and his heir are taken care of.I liked the storyline of this book.  The main characters, Grace and Vincent, were likable.  I liked the fact the hero of the story, even though dashing in looks, had fears and struggled to face them.  The heroine of the story seemed the braver of the two.  She was no delicate flower that couldn't think for herself.  I did not like Vincent's cousin and was happy with the plot twist towards the end that involved him.This book had a good flow to it that kept me interested from beginning to end.  I like a book that you can start reading and &#34;get into&#34; right away. I also liked the fact the sex scenes weren't too steamy or vulgar. They seemed appropriate for the characters and the situations they were in.  I think they were written just right for this story.I have already wish listed more of Laura Landon's books as I have found a new author to enjoy!

$review_text.: If you had to pick one terrain to explore, which would it be? Jungle? Desert? Maybe even the air? Well fear not, intrepid explorer, because Lonely Planet has you covered, no matter what you choose. In their new How to be a World Explorer guide, all terrains and many situations have been dealt with so that you, soon-to-be-famous explorer, won't have to do it on your own. Though maybe famous in not a good thing for an explorer - that usually means there were....problems.Starting with Jungle & Savanna, then moving through Desert, Polar, Forest & Mountain, Oceans & Rivers and finishing with Air, this book has got your back. Even better, it finishes off with Navigation (always so important) and Explorer Bootcamp. Each chapter has an explorer's quest to start off with, then goes into the creatures to be found (along with the accompanying dangers), famous explorers who have gone before, some history, some science - it's a little bit of everything, all rolled up into one guide. Worried about quicksand? Don't be - swim on your back. Desperate for water? Skip the cactus and follow the mosquito. Lost at sea under a blazing sun? Smear oil from dried fish livers on your skin. See? All supremely useful tips for the World Explorer. Even the stories about the famous explorers (unfortunately, mostly dead) can teach valuable lessons.An excellent resource for the traveler, or even the armchair traveler. Lots of interesting facts and information in bite-size pieces with a lot of illustrations. A fun book to read, and an essential for those of you working on packing your bags!
$SUMMARY.: For your next adventure!

$review_text.: I usually prefer SciFi or horror novels. However, the paranormal thriller Aymaran Shadow by Hemanth Gorur was recommended to me by a friend. I am very happy that I picked it up as I found it to be a very gripping, complex, and sometimes even gory read. From the opening pages set in Bolivia, I was hooked to this suspenseful story. This novel was an intense read that spans across multiple times and places and delves into the theme of retribution. Beginning in the past, the book quickly switches the present day, focusing on a young psychology student named Sanya. Withoutspoiling anything, the novel wrestles with the concept of past-life through the chilling and paranormal experience of this young woman.Probably the most important thing to me when reading a novel is the quality of the characters. I enjoyed how the characters were not one dimensional or predictable. In particular, I thought Sanya was really well developed. I could feel her fear and confusion throughout the story as she questioned her own sanity. I also appreciated, that like her, I didn&#8217;t always know what was going on. Eventually, along with her, you begin to understand the full complexity of what has been going on and how the past came back to haunt her present day reality. She was a multifaceted and realistic character. Caring about her fate kept me turning the pages to find out what would happen next as she encountered increasingly dangerous and perilous circumstances.Aymaran Shadow is a fairly short novel at around 150 pages. However, this doesn&#8217;t take away from the breadth and depth of the tale. The description is vivid and you can easily imagine the world that Gorur has depicted. Overall the plot moves quickly with unexpected twists and turns. This all builds toward a nerve wrecking and intense finale, which left me both satisfied but wanting more.I noticed that some reviewers have critiqued Gorur&#8217;s English. Although there are a few grammatical errors, these didn&#8217;t detract from the story or distract me from enjoying the book. This is a sophisticated novel, which I&#8217;d recommend to those who like past-life thrillers with paranormal twists.

$review_text.: I don't know what to say. This was an adventure. I liked the main character, but it just wasn't my kind of book, I guess. I had high hopes that once the author introduced the Merpeople that I would care more. I just couldn't. Could it be that I am tired of male writing and male 'adventures' and male fighting? Probably. I am writing a book about pirates. I thought it would keep me in the mood. But it felt like the author read my research (or followed the same methods of research with the same results) and was educating the choir? And if I wasn't already bored when the Mer were introduced the word stunning was used twice in the same sentence. To me it felt like even the author didn't care any more.I thought carefully about how I starred this one. I wanted to give it one or two stars. But I decided that maybe it's just me, so I gave the extra star. Maybe others will find this quite exciting.

$REVIEW.: Note: I was given a free copy of this book in return for an honest review, which in no way does this alter my opinion.Sumit Dhar did a great job on this trivia book. The book itself is filled with forty "quizzes" with five questions per quiz in addition to a bonus quiz at the end. There is also an answer page after each quiz. All the trivia questions are based on a multitude of different subjects, like language, history, and music (just to name a few). The level of difficulty varies for each question, with some being easy, others hard, and some just "on the tip of my tongue".With the variations of both difficulty and subject matter, this book is great for any and all trivia lovers. Also, as a note, though the book is set up in a "quiz" manner, I find it hard to believe that most will be able to answer all questions right off that bat. As I know a few people who get frustrated at not knowing the answers to some trivia books (aka, the "these are too hard/impossible/frustrating" people). So, if you're someone who NEEDS to get the answer, this book may not be for you. The point is more to enjoy the trivia questions, not to mention you can learn a few things along the way. Some of the questions are even set up so that if you think on it long enough, the answer will be easy enough to figure out!Overall, this is a wonderful trivia book that will appeal to many people. I really liked the fact that the questions aren't something so obvious (at least for me) or over used. I enjoyed learning some new things I would most likely never have heard of before going through this trivia book. I had to give this book five stars for the ingenuity of the questions, though my mind wanted to give it four stars (just for petty me not being able to get quite a few of the questions). For $4.50, it's reasonably priced as well. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a trivia fan.Note to Dhar: Thank you for your Greek mythology question being a less known deity! (I'm pretty sure the majority of the population, at least in the US, knows who Zeus, Poseidon, etc. are these days -.-; ) It would be neat for an "urban legend" trivia as well~ (though I would most certainly settle for another (regular) trivia book in the future!)

 If love conquers all, these deeply loving parents will fight until they win their kids' recovery.With the incidence of autism now 1 in 50 and still soaring, you or someone you know, are likely to have a child diagnosed with autism or some other devastatingly related illness


 To protect this generation of children, EVERY parent must realize that what you can't see can definitely hurt your child and what you hear from "experts" may not be expert at all
 This is an ever recurring theme of The Thinking Moms' Revolution.I'd like to see this book in the waiting room of every OB-GYN and pediatrician, on the desk of every administrator, teacher and therapist in Early Intervention and special education, and on display in every library as a "must read" for prospective parents and grandparents.Read this book


 Discover the myriad ways children can become severely impaired
 Then, having been given the gift of this remarkable book's messages, pay it forward

 Protect your children and help others safeguard theirs.

$SUMMARY.: Read


Discover

 Protect.

$REVIEW.: Don't worry yourself that Sanctuary cannot seem to decide what genre it belongs in

Just let the story develop and enjoy what comes


I did.And don't sweat the science


There really isn't any

If something seems implausible, just remind yourself, "It's only a story." I did.Don't even fret about things that, when you stop to think about them, don't make sense - like caves that people can find their way through without a light, or critters that are somehow impervious to shards of glass and bullets


Just don't stop and think about them

I didn't, at least until after I had finished reading.Because a good storyteller rises above such trivialities and makes it easy for you to suspend your disbelief, like Donna Ball does.It's the story that counts, here
Read along, accept and enjoy what comes, and you'll have a fine time reading it

I did.

$review_text.: Bottom line: at $49.50 list price (and much less from Amazon and elsewhere) this book is a bargain that will get you up to speed much more quickly than the more typical $60 high-tonnage book on the same subject
Save yourself money and shelf space

HIGHLY RECOMMENTED.Authors Prince and Lowe do a first-class job of introducing you to ADO.Net as well as allowing you to delve into the more advanced concepts.The book follows the typical and very effective Murach style of a left-hand page of explanatory text on a specific concept and a right-hand page of code and/or illustration that is linked to the text on the facing page
I find this sort of presentation really helps me focus on the current topic

Also, eliminating the necessity of page-turning to find an accompanying example makes for a better learning experience.The book is about 550 pages long, excluding appendices and index
There are probably less text than the typical book on this subject, and that's a *good* thing
The authors were highly selective in what they included


For example, you don't have to wade through 300 pages of &quot;what is a form&quot; and &quot;what is an event&quot; before you get to useful information.



$review_summary.: Very good, well-witten treatment of ADO.NET

But I did enjoy the book

I liked the contrast between Trent's macho appearance and his real personality


I love the interaction with the kids


As for falling in love and saying forever in a little over a week..

I don't know, it happens


And when you fall, you fall, even if you realize it a lot later
Seeing how both men were love hungry to the core, lonely, and probably more than ready for a serious relationship, it does not seem that far-fetched.I honestly liked Texas Pride a lot more
But I enjoyed this one thoroughly.

$REVIEW.: Let's face it, we all get down in the dumps once in a while

This book reminds us that, above all, happiness is a choice


No matter what life throws at us, our perception of it determines whether we let the bad times defeat us

Without sugar coating life, this book explains how to make the correct changes within yourself


It even says that if you are surrounded by negative people, you should, and must, be willing to change who you have around you
In the end, you can only change your own attitude, and this book will help you realize that.What I enjoyed most about this book is the way the author doesn't talk like she has a PhD in everything


She speaks like a real human being with real life experience on this subject


Her knowledge comes through without making her sound like a scientist who has no clue what it's like to live in the real world


I appreciate that in non-fiction writing.This book gives advice for nearly every aspect of life


From relationships to work to physical health, this book guides us to take steps to improve it all
It's not a magic pill, and the author makes that known
This is something to work toward, and this book can help you do it
It's definitely worth having on hand to serve as a reminder when life is getting you down

Change your outlook and improve your life!

 There wasn't a cliffhanger (thank goodness - I HATE those), but it definitely left me going, &#34;Ummm..

$REVIEW.: I finished reading this back around April of this year. It is not exactly like the television version with the same name. Though it starts out like it does in the show, it goes a completely different way by the 2nd volume.However, this is an amazing graphic novel series! Kirkman did a fascinating job with the way he spent time focusing on the characters rather than the undead. It's not the type of read for just anyone, but it really is worth a read, once.I feel if you already have seen the show or haven't yet and wish to, then you should pick up a copy because it'll help fill in those gaps or answer questions that the show hasn't yet. It surely helped make sense as to HOW everything played out; where as in the show they kind of went a different route that from what I've read in articles and seen on the preview for the new season, they are going back to the comic series story line.So now is a good time to jump on the bandwagon for the graphic novel series.[...]

$REVIEW.: Intriguingly witty and fantastic read. Marmell did an excellent job of creating a sly but intelligent character in Adrienne Satti/Widdershins. She may be a thief but she is a righteous one, who just happens to talk to a god, Olgun, that is currently inhabiting her head. It's great to experience a story that is not about romance between two or more characters but rather building a relationship with the reader to want to envelop and invest themselves in the story. I loved experiencing the world through Adrienne's eyes because she has an innocence about her that's....inviting for a lack of better word, though this is not what I'm thinking. She is curious and reckless at times when she should just sit herself down somewhere. Now, this book is not all light and fluffy as it contains murder, mayhem, and lots of deception. However, it has many witty and comical moments as well. The plot was set in the present and would go back in the past to give background on how Widdershins got that point or how this character relates to a current event that is taking place in the now moment. Some people may not like this aspect of this book but personally it works fine and doesn't take away from the story at all. The characters are well detailed and developed effectively to bring this story to life. I like that Marmell has no qualms about killing off his characters, so don't get too attached, someone may go before you know it. But who is the question?I think this will be a great book for those that are into action-packed science fiction and fantasy novels with strong-willed female leads.
$SUMMARY.: Great beginning to a new fantasy series!!

I'm so glad I did!  I honestly think that Joe sets the standard for all Kristen's Alpha men.  Tragic pasts that will pull at your heart strings for both Joe and Violet, these two were destined to be together from the opening scene.  They are neighbors and start an affair based on sex only but it soon evolves into so much more.  Despite Joe constantly pushing Violet away he just can't help but get drawn into her life and the lives of her delightful teenage daughters and all their antics.  Violet is being pursued by a gangster and Joe and the rest of the hot Burg men rally around to protect her and her girls.  There is the usual suspense and action... tragedy strikes when you least expect it but a fabulous epilogue rounds it all out nicely in the end for a HEA.  Classic KA can be read multiple times and I'll never tire of it.  I can't wait for The Promise to learn Benny and Frankie's story!

$REVIEW.: This book is based on the true story of two girls. Sylvia Mendez and her family rent a house that is vacated when Aki Munemitsu and her family are sent to a Japanese internment camp in the World War II-induced paranoia.When Aki must leave, she can only take a few things. Everything else must be destroyed, lest the officials find something that would mark them as anti-American. She can't take her doll, but she can't bear to destroy her either, so she tucks her away high in the closet.When Sylvia moves in, she finds the beautiful traditional Japanese doll and tucks her on her bed beside her own traditional Mexican doll. The girls end up corresponding and and even becoming friends as Aki survives the uncertainty of the camp (Where is her father? Will they be reunited? When will they be able to leave?) while Sylvia battles segregation.When her aunt tries to register Sylvia and her brother for the school that her half-white/half-Mexican children attend, she is told that her niece and nephew have to attend the Mexican school that is much further away. Sylvia's dad fights for her to attend, all the way to court in a much lesser known -- but earlier -- court battle versus the Orange County school system in California.This short book looks at two groups that experienced discrimination during this post-war time in the US. It's a little heavier on history than plot, reading almost like that very engaging type of non-fiction that tells a story using the format of a novel, which might make it a good fit for kids who prefer non-fiction to fiction, and conversely it could introduce pure fiction lovers to the wonders of well-written non-fiction style.

$REVIEW.: I'd like to explain that I don't like the Republican version of this book for the same reason I do not like this version (the Liberal version) of this book--because instead of creating important and intrinsic discussions on people and their politiks, it goes down hill into basically just name calling.  No intricate discussion, just hate speech toward others--basically showing hatred toward anyone who goes against the politiks of the writer (in this case the writer being Huberman).  Now, if the book was, say, exploring A, B, and C points as to why the author disagrees with said person, I would probably be more favorable (even if I disagreed with the writer), but no, the author offers no analytical solutions, he just throws hate speech toward anyone whom he looks down upon.  For example, the author offers himself up as a prime example of the liberal Christianphobic.  Instead of showing why he disagrees with Christians, he is hateful toward Christians (which is ironic because he dares to call us -phobic, i.e., whatever is considered politically correct at the moment).  Hence, he doesn't give you or me, the reader, any solutions, he just acts on the level of a high school name calling contest.  Let's take an example, shall we?  Let's look at his "chapter" on God Himself.  While I may not be the biggest fan of atheism, at least there are atheists out there who know how to write and know how to examine the discussion.  Huberman, instead, just name calls God and anyone like myself who is a Christian, and calls us uneducated, unenlightened, and even nastier names.  This serves no purpose and adds nothing to the table of debate, it is childish in all its extremes.  Huberman even goes so far as to mocking and attacking Christian music, which is kind of funny if one thinks about it.  Let's see, shall we?  Christian music doesn't A) degrade women into merely sexual objects, like so many, many songs do today, B) doesn't use curse words so that obviously shows that you don't need four letter words to make a rhyme scheme, C) doesn't offer up the use of drugs and alcohol.  So, why exactly does he hate Christian music?  Well apparently it is because we Christians who listen to Christian music allow ourselves to be swept away in the inspiration and the awe of the music that is handed up to our God.  So.  Hm...this is worse, in Huberman's opinion, than teens going to a rock concert while taking drugs, drinking alcohol (under age), and having unsafe premarital sex???  I don't hate this book.  I pity the author.  You, Mr. Huberman, are silly and foolish and childish in your beliefs.  Your beliefs hold no coherency and no doctrine, all you are doing is saying you hate people, for example, just for their religious beliefs.  Where's the discussion, the debate, the considerations that come from that?  You are a sad, sad person, for your lacking arguments and I feel sorry for anyone who might actually think they are getting anything from your poorly written, poorly documented book.  I'd laugh at this book's pathetic attempt, just like I would laugh at the Republican's version's attempt, if it wasn't for the fact that there are so many people out there who think they really are gaining something from such works.

$review_text.: i had the first book as a freebie and enjoyed it so bought the next one. Its a good mix of characters we can empathise with - they are "real" people not flat one dimensional as so often in books. they have faults and problems and their actions are shaped by what has happened in the past. I was glad to see so much of Vaile in this one - he's a brooding charcter in book one but lightens up in this and we see another side to him. Rhett - its clear from book one how he feels about Indi and he's so careful with her as she's such a vulnerable person due to her past. Its lovely to see their romance gradually unfold.there are some good "nasty" characters here too - all books need a counterpart to the heros...some of the actions of the "nasties" are a bit stomach churing but fit with the characters portrayed so its not just gratuitous violence. the sex scenes are well done too - not too icky and twee, not overdone and in your face but just good honest hot sex. I'd be happy to re read and to read more from these characters

$REVIEW.: 4 Groomsman + 4 Bridesmaids = 4 Delicious New Brazen NovelsThis is the fourth novel is this wonderful little series that some of the best and hottest Brazen authors have gotten together to write. In the first novella we were introduced to Colt and Kady who discovered their love for each other.This is now their wedding where love is not only in the air, but is also happening to our 4 hot groomsman and bridesmaidsThis is Logan and Sophie's story. Sophie is the incredibly shy and introverted sister of the groom Colt. She has hidden for years behind her insecurities and misses out on the best parts of life due to it. Logan is a self made business man, who founded a successful company which he today runs by himself. He has been so busy running his company for the last few years that he has forgotten what he even started it for. He used to love spending every moment of his life outdoors, rock climbing, hiking etc, but these days he spends more time in his office and boardroom than anywhere else.When he arrives at the wedding, Colt asks him if he can take Sophie under his wing for the week as he want to make sure she enjoys the wedding, as he knows how shy she is and will probably end up spending most of it in her hotel room.Logan cant believe how grown up Sophie is and he has to contently remind himself that the lush beauty in front of him is hands off. However the more time he spends with her and the more she comes out of her shell, he realises that there is way more to Sophie than meets the eye, and he is more than happy to spend all his time with her....that is when he is not rushing off to business calls and running his company from afar.Can the shy and introverted Sophie be enough for the hot workaholic.. Only time will tell in this sweet and hot read.....

$REVIEW.: This book seemed like a detailed reaccount of an Iraqi mission, only set in NYC and involbing zombies instead of terrorists.I love books that include military and their poiint of view, but this was boring.  Many times throught the book I wanted to stop ready. But I couldnt get past the fact that I spent about 4 times as much on this as I had on really good books.  The other thing that bothered me was the fact that I couldnt give to craps about any charater. There was no, and I mean NO character development. No back history on anyone except a bit on the female doctor. Everyone else was a disposiable character. Even if they lasted the whole book, you didnt know or care to know anyhting about them.Dont buy it unless you want an all military op book with absolutly NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.

$REVIEW.: I'd been eyeing this book for a while and was out of good books to read so I thought I'd give it a try so I sent the sample to my Kindle and instantly fell in love with the story


I was so drawn into it that I'd forgotten it was a sample and when it ended I immediately bought the book and clicked as fast as I could to get back to where I was at
 This is just one of those stories that sucks you in and you never want to leave


 Halfway through the book I noticed I wasn't even seeing any of the words, I was there with Fenn and Peree, adventuring right beside them, seeing everything they see, or didn't see in Fenn's case and sharing their journey.I love Dystopian books and I absolutely love the type of setting in this book


 Even though there's horrible things going on, there's just something about a society that lives off the land that greatly appeals to me


 I'm too much of  a wuss to do it myself but I do love to daydream about it so this book gave me a lot to daydream about


 The Scourge is a very character driven story

 Sure there's action but the real meat of the story is in the characters and A.G
Henley does a great job of bringing them to life

 What really impressed me was the way she described the world through the eyes of Fenn who is blind


 I was wondering how a book could be descriptive with the main character being unable to see yet she handled it beautifully

 You get a full detail of every little thing Fenn encounters, not only through her sharp senses but also through the eyes of those around her

 I was simply amazed at how detailed this world is

I also enjoyed the fact that it's not just your average run of the mill zombie horde

 There's some nice twists in this book that fit so well with the overall theme of the story.It looks as if this was A.G
Henley's first book which impresses me even more


 Not only is it a wonderful story that's beautifully written but it's also extremely well edited
 I didn't find a single error or anything to distract me from my wonderful reading experience
 It seems all too often some independent authors take editing for granted so it's very nice to see those that put their heart and souls into their work


 It shows here and for that she deserves to be congratulated
 I will definitely be buying the next book and recommend this book to anyone who loves strong characters, a great storyline with rich detail and a bit of romance


 If you're looking for something a bit different then give The Scourge a try, you'll be glad that you did.

$REVIEW.: by Matt ReevesA Diamond in the RoughWhen TokyoPop began their ill-fated Japanese YA imprint, certain books were given more of a spotlight than others. Novels that had inspired popular and well-known Anime franchises were promoted more than original works that had little to no previous name recognition. Calling You, regrettably, was one of those works. The virtually unknown novel was one of the most scarcely promoted books by the American publisher.First published in Japan in 2001, Calling You was far from a debut for Otsuichi. Already a recognized rising star in Japanese literature--having written his debut novel while still in high school--his list of previously published works included bestselling titles such as Zoo and Goth, which were both subsequently turned into feature films.It wasn't long after picking up my purchase at the bookstore that I began to read the collection of pages.Calling You is a series of three short stories that revolve around young characters each finding themselves in situations that defy reality, but still question the meaning of each of their lives. In the first story, readers are introduced to a young girl who has a problem--everyone has a cell phone but her. Envious of her classmates' objects, she spends her days imagining a cell phone within her mind. Designing every aspect in minute detail, she obsesses over the imaginary phone for such a long period of time that she soon forgets at times it's not even real, finding herself searching for it in her bedroom. When her make-believe phone begins to ring, she starts to question her own sanity. Answering the calls, she discovers that there are others, others like her with similar phones. But when she tries to meet with one of her fellow callers, she soon finds her blessing turn into a race against time, a race that threatens to leave one caller in a dead zone.In the second story, the author introduces readers to two average young boys. Life seems normal for the two until one discovers that the other has a special ability: he can heal people's afflictions. By a mere touch of the hand he can repair horrific burn marks and any other affliction of the body. There's just one catch. In order to take away the affliction, the boy must accept it as his own. Unselfishly he helps those he can, slowly inflicting more and more damage to his own life and risking terminal illness. Eventually he discovers he has the ability to pass on the afflictions onto others. Will the boy's soul be able to resist the urge to inflict his pain against his hospitalized father or can his friend, who is willing to risk his life, stop him in time?The third and final story follows a young pregnant woman who is involved in a horrific train accident that leaves her childless. Coping with severe depression in a secluded clinic, she shares a room with two other patients suffering from the same issue as her. The three discover a strange flower with what appears to be the face of a baby, and they hide it from sight, keeping it safe in their room. But when the flower begins to hum a song that a past patient used to love, the young woman begins to uncover a mystery that may lead her to a truth she never thought she could find.There aren't many books these days that deserve to be called a masterpiece. In fact, in a market like we have today, the best you can usually hope for is an entertaining read. But without a doubt, I feel that is exactly what this inconspicuous book is: a masterpiece, pure and simple.Though small, and seemingly less important than heavier works, its message and delivery outperform even the thickest of paperbacks. Beautiful illustrations, gripping prose, excellent character development and thought-provoking twists fill the pages of this work. Otsuichi successfully creates a short piece of fiction that defies the expectations of those who discover it.Each story builds upon the next leading to a culminating message about love and the purpose of life that proves more than relevant for our daily lives. The book is short enough to be read quickly in a single day, and yet powerful enough to haunt your memories for years to come. The emotional and philosophical impact of this book cannot be overstated.This collection of three people's journeys to understand their world is nothing short of inspiring. Calling You is what Young Adult fiction should strive to be: simple, imaginative, powerful, straight to the point, thought-provoking and deeply meaningful. If there is anything negative to be said, it is that this book has not received more attention when it so rightly deserves it.

Phil has always been a brutally honest man, which I appreciate, and his straightforwardness comes through strongly in this book.  Minor date errors not withstanding, a sincere and heartfelt hockey commentary and insight from the early 1960's on in from Phil's point of view.  Definitely would recommend.

$REVIEW.: This fine volume from the wonderful Library of America, is a collection of the great Benjamin Franklin's later writings.  It is the second volume of what used to be a single huge book from the LOA.  This volume begins with Franklin's letters from his time as a diplomat in London, and then his pamphlets, political satires, and other writings when he represented our Revolutionary Government from 1776-1785 from Paris at the doomed court of Louis VI.  His writings from the Constitutional Convention and writings from Philadelphia after his return to the United States are also included.  Probably the most popular items included will be the Preface and Maxims of the Poor Richard's Almanac and the FOUR parts of his autobiography.  Franklin is simply an amazing man.Benjamin Franklin is one of the great icons of the American Founding.  He is truly one of the essential men who built our nation and deserves every praise we can heap on him.  When we see images of the founders, they are all shown as old men, not how old they were in 1776.  Franklin was really a generation older than most of the firebrands who led the Revolution.  He was seventy when he signed the Declaration of Independence (John Adams was 41, George Washington 44, and Thomas Jefferson 33 on July 4, 1776) and eighty-one when he signed our Constitution as a member of the delegation from Pennsylvania.  He was an amazing man.  He was a successful printer, inventor, philanthropist, revolutionary, diplomat, and all around student of the world.This book is interesting to dip into and read just those portions that interest you, as well as reading its more than 800 pages front to back.  It has great notes on the text that provide contextual and translation help as well as sources, a most interesting chronology of Franklin's long and productive life, and an index.This certainly is a must have for your shelf on the history of America's Founding.

$review_text.: `Sanctuary' is Daniel's recollections of his life and journeys in 9th century Britain. It all begins in a small village called Rogwallow, where the village was being raided. Daniel and a young bride-to-be were hiding out in the church when the raiders found them. A man, a warrior, found them and saved them from the raiders. In Daniel's eyes, this man is a savior and God's answer to Daniel's prayers. Daniel sets off in the aftermath of the raid to follow this mysterious stranger and along the way finds his true calling. Yet there are many set against him on this journey and he has to harness his true strength in order to defeat a chilling and powerful evil...In `Sanctuary', the author has brought the characters to life with ease. Even though it's told from Daniel's point of view, you get to know the other characters through his eyes. Daniel, for the most part, is a shrewd judge of character, even though he longs to feel the hand of God and the warmth of God's love upon him. I feel Daniel learned, as most of us do, there are a great many influences in this life but we must be the masters of our own destiny. It was interesting to see the development of Daniel's relationships with the others around him and his discovery of his abilities. His humbleness and honesty also saved him from imminent death several times, even if his genuine curiosity may have aggravated some. He seemed like a good guy, though flawed. The story itself flowed very well and you could see the research the author did into this time period. There were definitely a few loose ends by the conclusion, but as this is the first book in a series it's to be expected. `Sanctuary' is really a touching story of the human condition and what we are all capable of depending on the circumstances.Dominion Series: Sanctuary (1)

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC of this in exchange for my honest review!!This is the third book in The Nephilim Warriors Series and the books just keep getting better. I truly love this series and the characters. I keep thinking that sooner or later the author will add to much detail to something important losing you in the description or not enough detail causing the reader to go what the... No matter how much I read by K.A. Young her books are perfect with just the right amount of detail.Eli and Anna make appearances at times through out this book. Sometimes they are there in person and other times it's through a phone call. Even though they weren't the main characters of this book it didn't take away from love of the book. They do show up at the end for some family time and they happen to have some various bits of important news to share with people. Nyoka makes an appearance at the end of the book and Elise's life sounds like it will be getting interesting.This book is about Torch (YEAH) who we discover is half-vampire and half-Nephilim. I wasn't expecting that when I was trying to figure out what his secret was and I found it to be an interesting twist to the story. I've always loved Torch and thought there was more to him then the scary person he portrays to everyone. I love the chemistry between Torch and his mate Julie.We've briefly met Julie in the first two books in the series. She's Anna's sister and is about to discover that she's also half-vampire. Born not made and that is a big difference as you will discover later in the book. Drake the King of the Vampires is trying to convince her that he's her mate. She goes on the run with Torch who happens to believe that he's her mate. She's attracted to Torch from the first time she sees him. She can't fight the attraction she feels for him and finds herself giving in a couple of times. She knows that he's her mate but will it ever work out? They have so much stacked against them plus he doesn't think he's any good for her.Drake or Drakos is searching for Anna. He needs to find her before she bonds with her mate. He has all the vampires under him looking for her including Aliene. Aliene is loyal to Drakos but there's something about Julie that she likes. As I kept reading I found myself liking Aliene more and more. Her friendship leads her to side with Julie and she gets a promotion out of it. I look forward to seeing more of Aliene in the future books.K.A. Young has written another great book. I'm enjoying all the new characters we are getting introduced to. Each trip into your world draws me further and further in. I can't wait to see where this series goes next. Another definite must read by K.A. Young.

I tried to start Delilah Complex but it just was not &#34;my cup of tea&#34;.. Others might find both of these ok but I'll pin a note for me not to order any books by either of these authors unless I check to see what type of story they have written.

$review_text.: Amongst the famous American submarines who saw combat in World War II, was USS Parche. During the course of six cruises, SS-384 earned two Presidential Unit Citations, five Battle Stars and won her first CO, Lawson Ramage, the Medal of Honor. The history of this Silent Service stalwart is well-told in Stephen Moore's BATTLE SURFACE, a 2011 Naval Institute Press release.A Balao-class submarine, Parche was commissioned in November 1943 and first sailed in harm's way in March 1944. On 31 July, during Parche's second patrol, 'Red' Ramage took SS-384, running on the surface, into the midst of a Japanese convoy, savaging the merchantmen in an epic 45-minute brawl. Credited with sinking five ships for 34,000 tons, 'Ramage's Rampage' netted the skipper an MOH and the boat her first PUC. Following another patrol, Ramage turned SS-384 over to his XO, 'Mac' McCrory, who logged three more patrols before war's end. Parche was struck from the Navy list in November 1969, her conning tower being preserved and displayed at Pearl Harbor.BATTLE SURFACE is Stephen Moore's fourth Silent Service book. Moore does a good job of presenting each member of the crew, creating vivid images of living, breathing human beings warts and all. Likewise, his descriptions of Parche's patrols, and especially the various attacks carried out by Ramage and McCrory, make for compelling reading. On the flip side, there are a number of technical errors throughout the book.In short, BATTLE SURFACE is an entertaining history of a hard-hitting American sub and the valiant men who crewed her during two years of war. Naval warfare and Silent Service buffs should enjoy this book tremendously. I know I did. Recommended.
$SUMMARY.: An Exciting History of a Top-Scoring American Sub!

Also a terrorist group comes to Kansas City , Walt and Ox are on the job. While taking on these cases he meets a Veteran back from Afghanistan who has PTSD and is fighting off his war demons.A fantastic story with some heartfelt photos, Mr. Thornhill really captures the spirit and traumas of deployed veterans. Left a lasting impression (on me) which has me feeling more respect, pride and thankfulness towards our military men and women. I highly recommend to all.

$review_text.: Do you like zombies?Do you like Star Trek?If you answered "yes" to both questions, then this book is for you. If you LOVE both of them, then this book is totally for you. "Night of the Living Trekkies" is both funny and creepy in equal parts. I got it mainly because I couldn't believe what I was seeing, a zombie book that takes place during a Star Trek convention. I like Trek, it's awesome. Zombies creep me out, but they aren't bad either. If you know someone that likes Star Trek, then they need to see this book, my husband read it as well, and he loved it.It starts out much like a zombie movie would, a few incidents that seem to be unrelated and are largely ignored by the main character, are all freakin' important and he soon starts to put the pieces together and realizes that not only are the zombies real, they're from outer space. Yes, outer space zombies. They reminded me a lot of the Borg, in that the parasite takes over the host and they talk with each other telepathically. There's lots of Trek references and Star Wars refs as well, one of the main characters is dressed as Princess Leia in a metal bikini, for much of the book. Did I mention that a small group of survivors are trying to fight their way out of the hotel and they're doing it with a bat'leth (awesome!), a kar'takin, yan, a lirpa, a gun, tasers, and a can of mace?The book is not great literature, it's not meant to be taken seriously, but it is still damn funny and worth reading.

$review_text.: I spent 2 days in Bangkok on my way back from Nepal. I think I'd like to explore Thailand again, so I picked up this book. I have the March 2010 1st edition and have never read a lonely planet book before.Pros:-a paragraph on everything and everywhere in Thailand.-does a good job of drawing you in by putting the top 25 first and then having highlights at the beginning of each section.-well organized, divided into different areas of the country and each area has sections-maps and pictures everywhere-timeline information-if you're here for a day try this, but if you're here for 3 days try this, that, and that. Really helps you plan a trip-good culture and general information sectionsCons:-never more than a blurb on everything. I'm not saying this is really bad, but just so you know what you're getting. You're given a paragraph or two on everything. As I started looking through the book, I would google places in the book for more in-depth information.The book has a lot of great information that seems to come from a voice of authority. It seems like it would be great for traveling all over the country. The only reason I can think that you might want a different book is if you're only going to be in Bangkok or something like that (and lonely planet makes just a Bangkok book too!).

$REVIEW.: Sometimes Stephani Hecht really nails it with her stories. She touches on topics in thoughtful and empathic ways, or has compelling and interesting scenarios filled with unique characters. Here though, I keep feeling that a very large opportunity was missed. The two central characters are Walsh and Tate. Tate is a wolf shifter who works for the pack as a soldier. Walsh is a weasel shifter who had a troubled past and is slowly destroying himself with a drug addiction.And that's where the failed opportunity lies. Walsh had appeared in previous stories, and it was sad to watch how he was gradually self-destructing. Drugs had a hold on him, and he was getting sicker and sicker and slowly dying. There was a great opportunity to touch on the problems of addiction. Ms. Hecht had done that before with other characters and issues, such as delving deeply into a character's bipolar illness and self-cutting tendencies. It was painful following Riley in that story as he fell from euphoric highs to self-destructive lows and tried to ease the pain by cutting himself. But here, after several stories where we watched Walsh slowly destroying himself, the addiction is nearly absent. In what amounts to a single chapter or two, Walsh shoots up a highly-addictive drug while hanging out in a roach-infested drug den (and doesn't even really act like he is all that high), is found by Tate and Walsh, and is sent to a rehab facility. It then fast-forwards several months, and Walsh comes back all better and his addiction is a thing of the past. I don't feel like I'm divulging much of the story by explaining all of this because it all happens quickly at the beginning of the book. By the time you're a quarter way through, Walsh is fine and the story is just another &#34;two shifters fall in love and live happily ever after&#34; tale.It's interesting, the action scenes are all right, and the romance is nice. But it ultimately feels like filler until the next tale, and I was left wishing I could have had a glimpse into Walsh's rehab and the pain he must have endured.

$REVIEW.: If you enjoyed and/or were meaningfully affected by the DVD and felt inspired enough to make a change in your own life and the eating habits of your family, this book is FOR YOU.  If you are interested in taking your own eating choices to an even more deeply informed level, then this book is also for you.  Not for the weak of stomach--makes it hard to eat in places where you don't know the origins of the food (meats especially).  Restaurants don't hold the same appeal once you learn how the animals whose bodies supply their meats come to the table.  You won't be able to read this book honestly and with an open mind without being changed by it.  I think that's a good thing.  There are many difficult things to read here, BUT there is also a lot of super helpful stuff.  I like the fact that it's not just a list of everything that's wrong with the food in our world; there are several articles within this edited volume that offer things you can do TODAY to effect meaningful change in your own life.  The only reason I don't offer it 5 stars is that the readers who really NEED to receive the messages contained with Food Inc, probably won't be any more willing to listen.

 I finished it in a day or so
 Talk about an opposites attract story

 There was just something so captivating about the uptight, OCD, controlling professor being undone by the carefree, happy-go-lucky bar owner


 And&#8230; vice versa&#8230; the easy-going bar owner gaining maturity and control of her life with the growing relationship with the established professor

 I loved that while you are reading and thinking&#8230; oh there is no way the straight laced recluse and the tattoed bad girl would work&#8230; the characters are thinking the same thing


 The challenge and ups and downs of the whole thing just really kept me reading

 It was an addicting story.

$REVIEW.: Toilet training is a learning experience and not a disciplinary process. Every child is unique and parents should not force their children to learn if they are not yet ready. Mistakes are bound to happen. If it happens, parents should not get easily frustrated. Patience is the key to a successful potty training.Parents would know that potty training a young child can be a very tricky and tiresome experience. Nanny P's Blueprint for Toilet Training is an excellent guidebook to make potty training a fun and memorable experience for both the parents and the child even when he or she has an accident.I especially love the part that talks about dad's involvement in training. I have two adorable children. My little girl learned how to use the bathroom before she turned four. My son is not yet potty trained and I am not worried.  I think that my daughter learns faster because she sees me do it. I showed the book to my husband and he is very optimistic to help our son.I recommend this book for parents who are clueless on how and when to potty train their little ones.

$REVIEW.: I had difficulty getting into and reading this book.  Nerdy Nancy is on her own in college and goes to the frosh party, where she meets up with some unsavory males who also attend the school. The story starts but well enough, but I found it going downhill after that. I am not sure just who the intended audience is. I am not a prude by any means, but having the main characters involved in graphically described, steamy sex is not really my kind of thing when reading a book for enjoyment.  I found it difficult to read beyond the first chapter/section after that. I wondered how anyone reading this might feel.  I hate to become voyeur, but that is how I felt about the book. I think that author should have spent more time on developing the characters and less on trying to get someone to read the book (obviously the author has realized that sex sells!). I received this from Library Thing to read and review.

$review_text.: Sadly not enough pages to really build upon book one with.This lead to many missed opportunities for character and story development.Why did one battle changes everything?  They were to be this Juggernaut of power and strength, stopping for nothing.Who are the players on the "Enemy's" side?  Five are introduced, some are hinted at,  several "status or Title's" are also mentioned but no development of any of them.While it moved the story forward some, just too many missed opportunities.Looks like book three is longer, hopefully will get back to more character and plot growth.Cover Art is well done.

I like Kate because she is &#34;real.&#34;  Her life isn't perfect either; she has problems that have to be solved and dealt with along the way.  I am looking forward to the next book in this series.

$review_text.: Well what can I say?  A first effort by a new author and I hope he writes more and keeps trying, but...OF STAMPEDES, RUNAWAY TRAINS, & RIVERBOAT SCOUNDRELS In The Rip Roaring Days of the West.  The title says it all, the book is filled with run-on sentences and other aggravating things for this reviewer.  Does this publisher or the author have an editor/reviewer?  The use of quotation marks to emphasize but not quote repeats over and over.  The use of the term  - ol' - before a name or object happens often, for example twenty-two times in chapter four alone.  Annoying.The stories in the book are not bad, really pretty good but what is the author's point?  Comedy and tall tales?  Who is the target audience? I don't think youth readers would get it. The cover art appears to point to junior high or elementary school.  I think the author has talent but needs to step back and let professionals guide, edit and help.  Hope to hear from James O'Donnell in the future, talent is there.

ALL the women he has been with and had in his bed he is suddenly so much better than them.

$REVIEW.: Clara Benson wrote mysteries for her own enjoyment -- they were only published after her death. They are set in the 20s and 30s in England and have a quant charm to them but not much in the way of sophisticated plotting or characterizations. Still, they are enjoyable "cozy" reads.  While this is a subjective point, The Treasure at Poldarrow Point is my favorite.  Though it reads in parts like a Nancy Drew mystery, it makes up for this naivet&eacute; with an unusually plucky heroine and lots of atmosphere.  That is not the case with The Murder at Sissingham Hall.  The plot is the old "locked-room gambit," set in a stately house filled with a number of ne'er-do-well family members vying for a chunk of the inheritance and an array of friends with shady backgrounds. There is, of course,  an amateur sleuth in the house party who manages to get taken seriously by Scotland Yard. While improbable, this is all pretty standard stuff.  There is nothing too surprising or refreshingly different in this scenario when compared to many other such offerings from the Golden Age of British mysteries, but it is not quite up to the standard of the better ones from this era. Further, it is longer than it should be, with laborious repetition of events that the reader already knows but which get trotted out in conversations among the characters -- again and again.  Judicious editing would have been a great thing.  The best part of this mystery is the period detail and the stark reminder of what crime detection could have been like prior to forensic advances.

$REVIEW.: Inaccurate historical elements and unauthentic language, not to mention languishing in uninspiring details with hopes of connecting a series... Just some of the literary crimes committed by this book. Perhaps if more attention was paid to ONE nefarious plot, this would had been a better read. The second seemed unnecessary and had no bearing to the tale. The emotional relationship between the H/h seemed rushed; it lacked maturity and depth.I will say that the characters had a number of passionate encounters (best suited to modern romances) that possibly elevated my rating from a 2 to a 2.5.

$REVIEW.: I saw Fortunes of War with Emma Thompson and her ex-husband Kenneth Branaugh.  It so intrigued me that I decided to read the book(s) by Olivia Manning.  Olivia Manning captured the essence of refugees living overseas during the time of WWII beginning in Bucharest.  One of my favorite characters other than Harriet Pringle was Prince Yakimov - our dear Yaki :)  Emma Thompson portrayed Harriet exactly as the book - she is one of my favorite actresses.  Kenneth Branaugh also portrayed Guy Pringle as written, in fact, too well I thought, as if he was made for the part.I highly recommend reading the book as you get to know the characters better that way.  Olivia Manning is an excellent writer and I will be reading more of her books.

There is plenty here to interest a reader in the age range of about 9 - 12.It could do with a bit of an edit, there are mistakes throughout which a good proof could weed out and some feedback from an editor could improve the story's readability.

$REVIEW.: The story of Bear, Otter & the Kid begin to reach the end-point of the story.  LOVED Book 1 - the beginning; LOVED Book 2 - the tying of some loose threads.  I do admire and appreciate the writing of T J Klune - for these two books are excellent in all respects!Now for Book 3 - there was much, too much reminiscing over book 1 & 2 that is was difficult to determine ANY PLOT for this book.  By chapter nine, I'm skipping page after page searching for some type of plot - gave up and read the last two chapters!  I've read and reread the last chapters!  Tough to determine if this is about Dom and Ty (the Kid) or the author was on some type of tangent which I never got (&#34;Road TRIP!&#34;  tough to figure this out!)!  I was thorughly confused with the developing relationship between Dom (to be married - or not) and Ty (panic attack at the drop of a hat)!For the sake of the series, I do hope that T J Klune and the editor have a nice LONG DISCUSSION prior to the release of the final book (god, I hope so!).  If the series is about the three main characters (Otter, Bear, & the Kid), please - please develop a plot and sub-plots which address these; there are three minor characters (Anna, Creed, & JJ) which have been left &#34;dangling!&#34;Having Dom rise to the level of a MAIN CHARACTER - making him an integral member of the family - SORRY, I don't get it!

$review_text.: I really enjoy Sarah Woodbury's books.  She has a bit of mystery and a little romance all mixed together.  While there is some &#34;knightly&#34; fighting and bloodshed in the book, it isn't so much that it makes it hard to read.  There is suspense and surprises throughout the book.  The romance is sweet without explicit details.  I enjoy Sarah's books because she keeps them moving along at a good pace.  Sometimes when reading books I get bored with a chapter, because I feel it drags on a bit too long, but I never have that with Sarah's books.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to read about knights, castles, mysteries and a bit of romance.

Having read more than a few pages of the book, I'm not certain that its author speaks English.  The presentation of ideas, the of clarity of the writing, the flow of the whole thing...it's all really just bad.  Even the things he says that are good are swamped and muddled by awkward phrasings and generally unclear writing.  I threw the book away.  Didn't even give it away, just tossed it.I came across another book by the same author, and it had all the same problems.  Adjust your purchases accordingly.

$REVIEW.: The book starts out with action

Before you can settle in the characters are in gear and the twists and turns begin


So the story line drew me in and I wanted to know what happens next but then I found myself wondering how I could easily put the obvious pieces together but the detective and task force took until it was shoved in their face to get it! I really thought that I must have it all wrong and in the end it will be revealed but nope, no big reveal came


Other than being let down a little in the end I have to say that overall this was a pretty good read

I especially enjoyed learning how the police navigate from a crime scene to gathering evidence then finding suspects and weeding through them until they found the culprit

The author did a great job of getting into the detectives head and helping me to understand every step along the way

Oh and I just have to ask

What is with the picture on the cover? For one thing no woman is held captive behind bars and another the girl that is held against her will is blonde!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this book because I wanted to have the author's books on my Kindle. Just wish I could get all the Lensman series on the Kindle. I read all of Doc Smith's books as a youngster many, many years ago, and every so often return to them to read again.  While his books were state of the art when written, they of course, do match today's books tech-wise, but they are still a great read.  If you have never read them, but love reading SciFi, you have to try his books as they among the classics and originators of the modern SciFi genre.Well worth the money I spent, even though I have been forced over the past fifty years to purchase them several times. I keep losing them to people I loaned them to, or they been read so many times they no longer hold their shape.  I love my Kindle for that alone, maintains the quality of the material, and means I don't have to keep contributing the destruction of our forests.Enjoy your reading.

$REVIEW.: The helium-3 series part two continues three years later. Crater, Maria and now Crescent joins the team in this action packed lunar adventure. I love how Homer develops his charters. Their personalities, relationships, and emotions are captured with a level of reality that left this reader anxious to get to the succeeding chapters to learn the outcome as the plot and subplots build. I like the subtle approach to the way Homer treats the subject of discrimination and bullying with the introduction of Crescent. The lunar wars persist, Crater is a survivor and his leadership skills continue to grow. His relationship with Maria grows stronger and their love for each other matures. In the end, the adventure will continue in the third of the helium-3 series to be released in June 2014. I've already preordered Crater Trueblood and the Lunar Rescue Company and I am anxiously awaiting its delivery.

His mother tells him that the only way he can save her is to return to Isaura, the world they were banished from on the day of the fire and his father's death. When he returns to the world of his birth, his scars are removed, and he becomes the handsome boy he would have been if the fire hadn't occurred. He falls in love. Things are definitely looking up. Unfortunately, his mother will die without her seer skin, a special second skin that many people in Isaura develop when they reach their teens that allows them to see into the future, and he still has to recover it before time runs out. If Thomas is to save his mother, he must find what he came for and return to her on Earth, losing his new face and breaking his heart in the process. What will he decide?Pucker is the story of a boy who is judged by his blemished cover. In this brilliantly written novel, readers will discover the pain that people go through when they are ridiculed because of their appearance, and the joy they feel when they finally realize that somebody really does care about them. Melanie Gideon has created a novel that will teach readers to look beyond the skin to the heart beneath. Pucker's story is truly one that teens and adults can learn from and enjoy.Reviewed by a student for Flamingnet Book Reviews[...]Preteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations

Dave is a student in her class who has connections to the greatest gallery in NYC so she finds her way in through him. Does she let him use her like she wants to use him or is she greater than that? Then comes in Erik, the hot model that instantly captures Sienna's attention. Sienna doesn't want a mess but it looks like she got herself into one.I liked the story but I found some things to just be pointless. There should have been more chemistry between the main characters also. Some things were too rushed and Dave was just UGH! He annoyed me because he thought everything and everyone was beneath him because he has money then at the end he magically changed because of the small bomb that was dropped.In other words, this is a fast read that is kind of enjoyable.

The one wrinkle for me was the diversion into the abused dancing child's future - that should have been left for the epilogue in my view.

$review_text.: Must say I was surprised.. this book had quite a lot of passion and erotica to be a very hot read.  Its short but hits the spot.Jake and Jeannie are the typical married couple of 20 years ...and have adapted to the normal routine and lost the lust of marriage..  They meet Pothos who changes everything.  who helped them open up and recreate the spark.  It was excellent insight.

$review_text.: I hardly knew how to rate this book.  It does have a lot of good ideas, and I certainly can't begrudge the price.  However, in reality it did not really help me at all.  The only thing I have used on it so far is the information on free time limited books from Amazon.  Everything else was either extremely difficult to maneuver through, not in formats that could be read (and the converters were not all that easy to deal with), or most frequently, none of the sites had books I was interested in.  It does not impress me to have access to the classics from four different websites; Amazon has most of them free already.  The google option did not return one single book, even though I tried a wide range of topics and authors.  It seems that throughout all these sites, the only available books are classics, harlequin romances, or obscure authors.  Again, I can't begrudge the 99 cents; it was worth a try, but I don't think this book will be a resource I use on a regular basis.

$REVIEW.: Nikki part 2 was everything that I was expecting it to be and then some. Nikki had a rough life but she was finally happy expecting her first child with the love her life Prime. The love that Nikki had for her man would make her do anything to hold him down. She handled her business when she needed to. As for The Reaper that girl was deranged. The way it ended shocked me but I would like to see a part 3.

$review_text.: I have not read "The purpose Driven Life," but I always viewed it as suspicious.  Mr. Price's book is illuminating in that he is steeped in the fundamentalist "reasons" for the inerrancy of the bible.  He knows the bible and the theology.If only such books as his were actually read by fundamentalists perhaps minds would be opened.  But since most fundamedntalists don't read the bible, why would they read this book?  Give one to a fundamentalist friend.  This book should be a best seller, but I doubt it will be!!!

$REVIEW.: &#34;There are moments in life when you know, irrevocably, that you've given in, come undone. That you've slipped, lost your balance, and fallen over a cliff's edge, that there's no climbing back up, there's no slowing the fall. You never forget those moments. They get burned into the fabric of your soul, imprinted on you, tattooed on your consciousness.&#34; (Caden Monroe, After Forever).Bravo Jasinda Wilder...bravo. I am a mess right now. A hot, I can't believe that just happened, mess. I do not even know where to begin. I have so much to say.I guess I will address the big elephant in this room first. Yes, this book may not be for everyone. I get that. The content of this book was heartbreaking and I know many will find the behavior in this book one that will never, ever, ever be excusable. I agree with you. 100% agree. HOWEVER, there are times in anyone's life where they find themselves in such despair, their choices will amaze and horrify them. Its life and it happens. It is easy for any one person to say that will ever happen. But are you 100% sure of that? Is the behavior acceptable, no, but life sometimes sucks and we make horrible choices.So if you do not like love triangles, go ahead and not read this book, because it is obviously not for you. And that is your right. That is a far I can go without giving away spoilers.Now on to the story. This will be hard because its not easy to talk about this book without talking about the contents, as noted above. :) There are many reviews that give away some of the content and you are welcome to see them, but regardless, reading the story will allow you to understand how and why the above was referenced and what brought the characters to that moment and on.The story picks up right where Forever & Always ended. As a side note, you need to read Forever & Always before reading After Forever and as long as you have, none of this will be spoilers and it is really a continuation of that story. Caden has just woken up a week after the accident and is learning of Ever's condition and loss of their child. After finding the love he needed in Ever and her filling the hole he had felt since the deaths that occurred in his short life, he finds himself once again lost and alone. The doctors tell him Ever may be lost to him forever and he does not know what to do. He finds support and understanding from Eden, Ever's twin, the only one who might be able to understand what he is going through. Both lost and alone and trying to learn to live with Ever possibly being gone forever.The content of this book are heartbreaking. You will grieve with Caden, you will curse him, you will want to throw your book or eReader against the wall, but no matter what, you will feel. And that is Jasinda Wilder's true gift. She tells a story that makes you feel and touches you in ways you will not imagine. This story if filled with heartache and angst, but will also captivate you and hold you until the very end. All I know is that this series, so far, is wonderfully written and very captivating.I am not sure what will happen in the final book. I am so torn, but know that I will be waiting very impatiently for February 14th to get here. I want to know how this story ends and hope for the very best, though it is hard to imagine right now.Is the series worth reading so far, yes. I read this one in one sitting. I just could not help myself. This is Jasinda's best work to-date. You can feel her heart and soul poured into every word. But in fairness, be prepared to be a hot mess once you are done. :)Happy reading.

$REVIEW.: I was really excited about this book before I ever read it. Given its great title, I was hoping for a great read, a manifesto, an inspirational rally cry of reason that could sweep religion off the face of the earth. Instead, it's just another book that regurgitates the same ideas brought forward by other authors and speakers, packaged in a way that makes the author seem a little, I don't know, maybe egotistical or something. I'd consider myself a strong evangelist of atheism that spends a great deal of time and energy debating religion with the religious, and I couldn't help but think Boghossian has only ever &#34;dealt&#34; with a couple extremely liberal Christians in the Pacific Northwest.Like I said, I really wanted to give it five stars, but after reading it... Meh... :-(

$REVIEW.: Cathy Marie Buchanan's The Painted Girls is inspired by the real-life Parisian model Marie Von Goethem. It is the story of three sisters whose father died years beforehand and whose mother is an alcoholic. The teenage girls are trying to keep up with rent and put some food in their bellies, that's all. They go through more than their fair share of heartache and pain.The only worthwhile job in their arrondissement in Paris is one of a ballerina at the Opera. The oldest sister Antoinette works at the Opera as a stand-in/extra after having effectively failed out of the Etoiles (dancers for the Opera Ballet). Marie, the middle daughter, finds herself speeding through the ranks of the ballet classes and ends up being cast in a stage production. Marie models for Degas on the side, solely for the money he pays his models. The youngest sister, Charlotte, is an overzealous young ballet dancer with no true understanding of the financial straits the family is going through.When Antoinette becomes enamoured with a no-good street rat and ends up in jail herself, Marie finds herself as the sole provider for their family. She takes on a job at the local bakery AND another modelling job for a creeper who is exploiting her. Things are anything but easy in Marie's life and she finds herself quitting the Opera ballet to pursue a happier (albeit poorer) life.These girls! The story had it's icky moments, that's for sure, but overall, I found myself really looking forward to reading more and more. The characters are so flawed, but I still felt like I understood them and their issues. A great story!-Sarah[...]

$REVIEW.: I loved Logan's story...my heart broke for him, even though he could frustrate me to no end!  He had been dealt a crappy hand...he had the girl of his dreams only to have that life crumble right before his eyes.  He didn't know where he went wrong, what Drake had over him other than being a Rock Star.  Instead of trying to move on, he covers his pain with alcohol and countless women hoping to numb the pain.  In the end, he only feels worse...this isn't who he really is but he just can't seem to shake Chloe from his mind.But then Jade comes to try and help him put the pieces back together.  They had always been friends but he had never seen past that.  Now he is noticing her as the kind, beautiful girl she is instead of the hard-as-nails rocker chick she tries to portray to the rest of the world.  Jade has had her fair share of hard lessons, coming from a broken home, running away when she was old enough from the abuse she was put through at the hands of her step-father.  Together Jade and Logan face their past and must decide if the future can be their HEA like Drake and Chloe or they are destined to walk the tortured path alone.

$review_text.: I've been working on making "proper" macarons for awhile, and have been eagerly awaiting the English version of this book

 The book itself is beautiful and has amazing photographs and recipes ranging from traditional to way out there

 I've made a few batches of the basic, plain shells and the result is great IF you already know how to make an Italian Meringue

 I have made Italian Meringue many times, and know how to do so fairly well


 However, Herme's instructions for doing so make absolutely no sense

 I tried it anyway, with terrible results
 Luckily I had several "sets" of eggs liquifying in the fridge

 When I used my own method (which is well known and relatively simple, just Google) for making the Italian Meringue, the rest of the recipe was easy and produced awesome shells
 So, the ingredients are there, but the instructions for making the meringue are ridiculous


 Unless someone else's stand mixer and stove (and laws of physics) work differently than mine, I don't understand how this method could possibly work

 Anyway, I look forward to trying many of the different flavors and fillings

 But, you really need to have some baking experience to recognize the obvious errors and correct for them, or I imagine you would be very frustrated trying to follow the most basic shell recipe in this book
 Good luck!

$REVIEW.: What to say about this magical book. It enchanted me, held me spellbound... That doesn't even begin to describe how amazing this book is.  The beautiful descriptive setting, with full bodied characters make the words just flow off the page.  Walls has written an intriguing fantasy/romance novel that will enchant even the pickiest of readers.  And did you see that cover, I even find myself taken in by the sexy Prince Emane. I would let him protect me any day ;)Kiora is a girl about to embark on a traitorous journey.  She will face many challenges, but will she be strong enough to defeat the evil Dralazar?  If anyone can do it I think Kiora can.  She may be young but I believe that deep inside her lives a heroine waiting to be born.  I found it interesting the difference between Kiora in the beginning of Wings of Arian to her at the end of the book.  I don't think I have ever seen such character growth in one book before.  Kiora goes from being a smart mouthed, jump into the middle of things girl to a reserved (yet somewhat still smart mouthed ;) think before you jump woman. I can almost see how truly amazing she is going to be by  the end of the series.Emane was a character I was not too sure I was going to like.  With the first introduction of him he was very arrogant, yes he is a Prince it's expected, but I had my doubts about him.  I found out throughout the book that that arrogance was more a tough exterior hiding a warm loving boy underneath.  Needless to say my worries were for no reason.  I enjoyed watching him grow, and become the protector he was meant to be.  Even if the odds are set against him.  In all honesty, I believe that Emane and Kiora make a great team.  They truly are Ying to the others Yang.What I liked most about the romance of Wings of Arian is that it was not instalove.  We get to see Kiora and Emane develop feelings for each other over time.  Sure it might not be over a long period of time but it never feels rushed or unbelievable. It was nice to see dislike and annoyance turn to caring and protectiveness. Wings of Arian had a strong plot line that will keep you enthralled.  There was never a boring minute.  Tons of action and romance that had me staying up well into the night reading. Wings of Arian is a true jewels to its genre.  If you are looking for a good fantasy novel with the perfect amount of romance.  This is your book.

$REVIEW.: I gave A Perfect Mess 3.5 Stars.*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*I'm not going to lie, it was absolutely the mention of hot triplets that drew my attention to this book. And I can't say I was disappointed.Aubree Walker is called back to her home town after her aunt has been in an accident. Aubree had been avoiding this return for nine months. There were a lot of skeletons she did not want to revisit. And a certain Outlaw she wanted to avoid. Right from the start I got the eeriness of the scene (probably shouldn't have read it alone in the dark ;)) and the writing was really descriptive so it enabled me to have a clear picture in my head and it played out like a movie, Aubree scared and terrified while the wind and rain was lashing around her. It really started off strong.Booker Outlaw is soon introduced and it is clear both of these characters share a dark secret but also some strong feelings that they are not ready to admit. Booker was the perfect guy, maybe too perfect but I didn't care. He was rich but humble, sexy, talented and vulnerable all at the same time. Yeah he had it all going on. I got Booker's southern charm straight away and if Aubrey didn't give in as quickly as she did I would have happily jumped in ;) It was good to see Aubree's character grow, she had a lot of demon's to shed and to be the person she was meant to be. I really got the relationship between Booker and his brothers. I loved their camaraderie and they really did have each other's backs.My favourite scene would have to be when Booker and Aubree finally got it on, beforehand we were mercilessly teased with hot kisses and nothing more. I really felt their connection during their first time. I also really liked that we got to see it through Booker's eyes as we discovered just how long he had lusted after Aubree and just exactly how deep those feelings went. *Sigh*I did enjoy Zoe's writing, I loved the Louisiana setting, I really got a feel for the culture and atmosphere. For someone that has never ventured near that area, this book sure made me want to. I also want to go looking for my own Booker but that is neither here nor there ;) I liked the action and suspense aspect of the book, although it was clear who was behind Aubree's troubles you didn't quite know what was coming next and it was and interesting read in that respect.There were a few aspects that did stop me from loving this book completely. The main problem was the age of Aubree and Booker, now I am not doubting Booker's success I know this can happen but their 'voices' felt older than their nineteen years. Obviously neither Booker or Aubree had the best upbringing so that can account for some accelerated maturity but I felt their actions and general demeanour would place them at least 22+. Booker could even be placed as late twenties, I felt he had that authoritative edge to him.The storyline with Aubree and her aunt towards the end felt rushed to me, if this revelation was going to be told, I felt it deserved more time to be fleshed out. I felt it was to tie up a loose end and wrap the HEA up in a bow rather than adding to the story. It could have had a greater impact I felt if it was introduced earlier and talked about more. Then there was the aftermath at the end of the book, I know it is fiction so I will try not to get too hung up on the dismissal of serious actions and the characters brushing some things under the carpet. Again I felt this was to wrap the ending up quick and secure. I went along with it but it was enough for me to question the reality of it.The other thing that niggled me was Aubree's secret, she alluded to it for 75% of the story. I know the suspense was building for the big 'reveal' but as I was reading and we found out what she witnessed I didn't get what Aubree was so worried about, so I wishing she would tell Booker already. It wasn't until Booker found out that I realised why he was so upset and yes he had every reason to be but I felt this wasn't obvious when Aubree was dreading to tell him. I would have sympathised with Aubree's reluctance more if I had known it wasn't what she had seen that would have hurt Booker it was in actual fact her actions or in this case inactions that did the damage. But I felt this wasn't obvious until it all came spilling out.For some reason I feel like Booker is going to be my favourite Outlaw Triplet, he charmed me completely, but saying that I am looking forward to his brother's stories. Aubree's best friends Verity and River Pearl (the name became a bit tedious after a while) have a lot of unfinished business with Boone and Braxton respectively so I imagine more fireworks to come ;)A Perfect Mess was definitely a change to my typical New Adult read. I did like the "I know what you did last summer" vibe. I fell for Booker as soon as I read his POV. He was a tortured, misconstrued bad boy, just my type ;) If you are looking for something a little different then I would certainly give this a read. ~Ava

Some of the stories are stand alone, some tie in to the book where you go, &#34;hey, I remember that!&#34;.  It really rounds out the whole feel and immerses you deeper into the storyline overall.  And.... dogs.  There are dogs involved in some stories and one story from a dog's point of view.

Much of the story line has been written by other reviewers so I will just add that the author knows how to capture the interest of the reader and to keep the reader on the edge. I read the book without wanting to take any timeouts so that I could get to the next part of the story.There are many facets to this novel which made me wish that I had first read the author's first novel with the same lead character. Now that my interest has been piqued, I will make sure to read other books written by Mr. Rosenfeld.

So right away, this was a sure fire winner for me, BUT since I am a genuine fan of Angela Thirkell's works, and Madame Koska is so often referenced in her novels, this was a double winner!  Even if one has never heard of Mrs. Thirkell or read her novels, this can stand on its own as an original and fast-paced mystery - I just hope it is only the first in a series.  PLEASE!!!!!!

I really think I wanted to smack a few of them upside their heads. I guess that means I must have been completely emerged in the story and the setting.There are so many twists and turns and I am not about to give you any spoilers. I really loved the story and could actually picture this as a movie. It's funny, frustrating and a touch of the macabre and the feeling that greed is alive and thriving in every level of society.It's a good clean fun murder mystery with a side order of comedy everyone will love.

In the beginning it was just bizarre, little occurrences like Katy's locker opening on its own or a glass falling off of the counter. However, soon enough she learns that it's not just a lingering effect of Daemon healing her. She really is changed permanently. Then a new guy, Blake, shows up and knows all about what Katy is going through, but Daemon is immediately suspicious of him. I was, too! From there it is a non-stop, adrenaline pumping story!In Onyx we learn a ton more about Luxen and the DOD. The world building is taken to another level, and I loved every moment of it. Quite a few of the Luxen abilities had already been revealed, but Katy discovers that there's more than just fancy light shows and super speed. The extent of these new abilities? I have no idea, but I suppose the sky's the limit! The DOD is also far more dangerous than I had imagined. There is certainly more to them than they've been letting on, and even within the department there are those who are less trustworthy than the others. Of course there are several surprises along the way, and they are definitely going to change everything for everyone.The romance was even more wonderfully frustrating in Onyx! I did get a bit annoyed at the repetitiveness of it in the beginning with Katy blaming Daemon's attraction to her on their bond, but other than that, I was fully invested. I wanted to grab them both and lock them in a room together until they kiss and made up! There were a handful of steamy scenes, but I need more! I guess I'm use to the romance coming fully together in the first book, so taking this long is torture!I am loving this series so far! I still can't believe it took me so long to finally start it. Anyone out there who's also been putting it off: STOP! Read this series immediately! It's full of action, romance, and plenty of angst! And there's a ton of little references that are sure to being a smile to any book blogger's face!
$SUMMARY.: Even better than the first!

$REVIEW.: I'm not going to try and describe the plot, as others have touched on that already and I'm not even sure how I'd begin to do it justice. Suffice it to say, this book is sort of a combination of adventure, thriller, and historical novel that is distinctly different from any other book I've ever read (which covers quite a few tomes). While some readers may not have liked it, I found Hepple's technique of interleaving the plot of the main characters with the memoirs of La Malinche (Dona Marina) and the radio interview blurbs fascinating. It was different and unconventional, but it worked, and worked well.To give you an idea of how interesting I found this book, let me say that I currently have very, very little time for reading and have a huge pile of books to be read, but this one kept me interested for the two or three months it took me to finish it. Not only that, I immediately went and purchased the second volume.So check out the sample, and I'll wager you'll buy it!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome Story!

$REVIEW.: I had high hopes for The Sensory Deception.  This type of mix of tech, science fiction, and action is usually irresistible to me.Unfortunately, the idea was better than the execution.The idea is fabulous - a technological advance that can almost literally put you in the mind and experiences of another species.  Something that challenges your definition of humanity and what our role is on the planet.  And the VR technology in the book is thrilling.The problem is that the writing is less than thrilling.  From wooden and unlikeable characters, to long sequences that seem to simply be excuses for the author to not-so-slyly offer his own opinions on business, finance and socio-political and environmental machinations, the book is full of mind-numbing exposition bracketed by oddly placed action sequences.I found myself wishing that the author would pick a genre, any genre, and stick to it.

$REVIEW.: In The Golden Lily, we dive more into Sydney's beliefs that she's been taught her entire life by the Alchemists, but it's clear to see that she's beginning to question these beliefs about the Moroi and Dhampir's being evil creatures of the night. She's already put so much on the line for the three of them in Bloodlines and continues to do so in The Golden Lily. Aside from them wielding some sort of magic, Sydney is basically beginning to see them as regular people instead of these evil beings.Speaking of magic, in Bloodlines we found out that Sydney's history teacher, Ms. Terwilliger, dabbles in magic. In The Golden Lily, we find out that she's a witch. There's still a lot to be learned on the whole magic/witch front with Ms. Terwilliger and Sydney, but with what we're shown in this book, it's that Sydney will literally do anything to save those she has become friends with no matter what race they are, and that's including going against the Alchemists once again and using something that makes her completely uncomfortable.A good portion of the way through does the main plot of the book come to light. Sydney and Sonya were attacked by a group of strangers hell-bent on killing Sonya since they still believe she's Strigoi. After a sword is left behind and Sydney recognizes the symbols that are on it, we find out that they are indeed vampire hunters. Seems crazy old Clarence isn't all that crazy after all.But as the story advances we find out that these vampire hunters prefer to be called Warrior's of Light. Theses Warrior's are ancient, dating back to the 1800's, and used to be in league with the Alchemists. There's so much more that can be said on this, but I don't want to say anymore since I'll end up spoiling the entire thing, and no one really enjoys being spoiled.I've enjoyed the characters that were introduced to us in Bloodlines, and continue to enjoy them in The Golden Lily.Sydney continues to be one of my favorite heroines that I've ever read about in any form of media. She's a strong willed woman who's not all uptight like those who don't know her believe she is. She's extremely smart, and this even shows in her day to day activities and not just in the classroom. The friendships that's she's made obviously mean something to her, and that's including the vampire ones. Slowly, but surely we see her begin questioning these beliefs that are instilled in her, but they're hard for her to let go so she becomes slightly hypocritical. This isn't anything new as we've all been there once before with being hypocritical. Honestly, I adore Sydney so much that I could probably just write an entire review based on her alone.I also enjoy the fact that we finally got to see her dive into the dating life. The topics and discussions that happen between her and Brayden have to be some of the funniest things I've ever read. Obviously they aren't supposed to be since they're the type of topics that one would save for debates or the classroom, but this is Sydney we're talking about. Although, to me, it seemed like she was just glad to have someone to talk about this type of stuff to to a good friend.Eddie and Jill continue their own growth, too. Eddie being this serious Guardian who's main focus is to protect Jill from any threat that may come about. While Jill, being fifteen, still has a lot to learn. Angeline, the new Guardian in town (who we met back in Last Sacrificed) started out as this rough around the edges, country bumpkin who basically threw herself as Eddie and continued her wild way. But throughout the book, she beings her development after an incident which almost causes her to get expelled.And Adrian, oh where to start with him? Ever since Frostbite, I've loved his character. The witty comments and the snark. But even then, I knew that there was more that drew me to his character aside from the obvious ones. Throughout the Vampire Academy series, he seems to stay the same, but with slight character development. But in this series, we really get to see a different side to him. We see how much he's hurting from the breakup with Rose. We see him begin going through a transformation and changing his life with the help of Sydney. Just so much development that it warms my heart.And when Sydney agreed to drive him to San Diego to visit his father had to be one of the best parts in the book for me (aside from the Halloween dance part, the climax, and the ending) Nathan is still the jerk we all loathed from the Vampire Academy series, but in The Golden Lily it really made you stop and see how much of a jerk he truly is to his son. It does make you feel sorry for Adrian, and it's heart breaking.Speaking of Adrian and Sydney, I would just like to take this moment to say that these two will be breaking my heart and warming it all at once just like Buffy and Angel did. Their relationship is one that I've enjoyed immensely since Bloodlines and continues to do so in The Golden Lily. Their banter back and forth is among my favorite. Their friendship is one of my favorites ever, and I'm really glad that there's slow development between the two for more. But that last chapter, man, that last chapter had my heart breaking. But I can see the set up for the third book with their relationship and future installments.There are just so many moments in this book that I loved, there is no possible way I can do a review on them all without going chapter by chapter and spoiling every last thing. Not to mention it would be ridiculously long. (Longer than my Last Sacrifice review, and that was ridiculous as well)The Golden Lily did not disappoint me and was yet another book that I just could not put down.

$REVIEW.: ON SEAS CONTESTED: THE SEVEN GREAT NAVIES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAREDITED BY VINCENT P. O'HARA, W. DAVID DICKSON, AND RICHARD WORTHU.S. NAVAL INSTITUTE PRESS, 2010HARDCOVER, $39.95, 352 PAGES, PHOTOGRAPHS, TABLES, MAPS, CHARTS, APPENDICES, NOTES, BIBLIOGRAPHYAll seven of the world's largest navies saw action in the corse of World War II, and countless books have been written about the ships of those fleets and the battles they had fought. This book deals with those seven navies from a different perspective. It examines how they were organized, how they trained, how they expected to operate in wartime, and how they actually fought. Until now such information could only be found in specialized sources in different languages, and wasn't readily available for most naval history enthusiasts. But here a group of naval historians have pooled their expertise to describe each of the seven major combatant navies, using a consistent format to show the strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures of those fleets.The book consists of seven chapters, each covering one navy in alphabetical order: France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, the Unites States, and the Soviet Union. Each chapter covers the subject fleet in four main sections, each of which is subdivided into two or more sub-sections. The first section is backstory, divided into the history of the navy, and then the mission that was anticipated, including prewar plans and the changes that were made due to wartime conditions. The second section deals with the organization of the navy, divided into the command structure of the service and its doctrine for combat for each branch. These branches include surface warfare, aviation, antisubmarine, submarine operations, amphibious operations, trade protection, and communications.The third section on each fleet deals with material: ships, aviation, weapons, and the infrastructure of bases, supply and the industrial reserve needed for repairs and new construction. The final section is a recapitulation, describing how the navy being discussed evolved during the war, with a final summary and assessment of how effective the navy was in carrying out its missions. The writers of each chapter are clearly knowledgeable about the navy they describe, and in each case they provide the reader with a fact-filled, readable text.By including coverage of the French and Soviet navies, this book fills a major gap in English-language accounts of World War II at sea. This alone makes it something worth having available in a naval history collection. And by describing each navy in the same way, with the same pattern of divisions in the description, this book lets the reader compare the fleets in a way not easily possible before now. It sets out the strong points and weaknesses of each navy, and compares their effectiveness in a fresh and informative manner. Editor Vincent P. O'Hara has written three previous books on surface warfare during World War II, and his new book, ON SEAS CONTESTED: THE SEVEN GREAT NAVIES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR makes a fine complement to his previous published books. It is also an excellant item on its own, and is likely to become a standard source for future writers of naval history.Lt. Colonel Robert A. Lynn, Florida GuardOrlando, Florida

$review_text.: In this book, there's a chapter called &quot;Single Parenting.&quot;  The stories contained in this chapter are a perfect counterpoint to all the gloomy statistics painted by &quot;experts&quot; who claim that children of single parents drop out of school, become juvenile delinquents, become pregnant, wind up in prison, or don't have a chance for a bright future
 These stories prove that growing up in a single-parent home doesn't have to be that way

 Maybe that so-called expert Judith Wallerstein and others like her who doom kids in single-parent homes to gloomy futures should read this book, especially that chapter.

$REVIEW.: Wow this book really did a number on me. It came highly recommended by many. So I read the synopsis and figured good girl/bad boy romance this should be good. Well I was so wrong never in a million years did I expect this story to take the turn it did. I had to take a few breaks after reading some of the things that happened in this book. I cried out of fear for Patience I was scared from one chapter to the next on what would happen. I had trouble turning the page for fear I would have to read more if what she ha to endure. As I continued the beauty behind there love for each other drew me in. There love wasn't easy it was down right mean and sometimes ugly. What Zeke and Patience had gone thru in there lives made it hard for them to love unconditionally. I'm crying writing this review because this book really touched me. I will recommend this book for others to read but just be prepared for the worst.Patience: wow your strength an courage to endure all you did to protect your sister and spare your mother the pain is unbearable for most. Your story had me on edge and crying a lot. I'm grateful you found Zeke and were able to open your heart to him you deserve the best life has to offer and Zeke will love you till the end of time.Zeke: you holding your promise to your dying mother I am just in aww . You endured a pain like that no son should have to from the hands of his father . You shutting down your emotions so you would experience loss was just heart breaking . I'm glad Snowflake was your ray of light to happiness . Patience will live you always hold on to your Snowflake and never let her drift away.I'm looking forward to he next part of there lives together the epilogue gives me hope that they will make and have all the happiness two broken souls deserve.

$REVIEW.: This is a well-written and interesting story.  Along with the romance, the author delves into the role the media can play in the lives of the rich and famous.  Jake uses the media to enhance his reputation and his company. However, Siree, still coming to terms with a tragic event, avoids the media at all costs.  When the two meet, Siree realises she cannot have anything to do with Jake as it will put her back into the media spotlight; a place she has no desire to be in. Yet, the chemistry between the two pulls them towards each other despite her trepidation. The writing is descriptive and filled with emotion. There is some suspense involved which adds to the story, making this an enjoyable read.

$review_text.: lovely beautifully written expressive tale about what love really means." Everyone tells a story about themselves in their own head. That story makes you who you are, dictating all your actions and all your mistakes. If your own story is filled with guilt and fear and self-hatred, life can look pretty miserable. But, if you're very lucky, you might have a person who tells you a better story, one that takes up residence in your soul, speaking louder than the woeful tale of which you've convinced yourself. If you let it speak loudly within your heart, it becomes your passion and your purpose. And this is a good thing, the best of things. Because it is the very definition of love, nothing less."

Now this is her 4th book I am reading

The book is the sequel of Her Forbidden Hero, the story of Marco and Alyssa--Although both books can be read as standalone but it is nicer to read them in order.Brady Scott and Joss Daniels are two characters having deep emotional scars, having to fight their own fears and demons to be together.Brady Scott is an Army Special Forces soldier, back to the US in order to heal his wounds most of which in fact are from his youth and his abusive alcoholic father


As soon as arrives he leaves his few boxes in his new home and goes for a run
This is when he sees a beautifull mysterious woman crying


His body and soon his heart react and he is drawn to her, for a one-night only thing


Joss Daniels has never felt wanted or loved, rejection by other have ruled her life


When handsome, fun and intelligent Sgt


Scott flirts with her she wants to feel free and liked for one night at least
Moreover her body reacts strongly to his, so why fight her desires.When both find out that they are neighbors however and that their attraction was not only a one night thing they have to fight their own desires being convinced that they are not able to have a relationship


When Joss gets pregnant however things might have to change.I had a hard time with the fact that the sexual part is dominating the first half of the story and this is mainly on what their relation is built
They have a feeling that the other has scars as well, but I miss some real discussions
The story is fluid and fun to read and I also liked the basic plot about how they meet and how they can't avoid each other.Is a nice romantic erotic short story (about 150 pages) with very fun and deep characters and hot sex, but I missed some in depth discussion.Enjoy the read MBTM.

$SUMMARY.: Romantic erotic short story with some depth but somehow not enough...

$REVIEW.: This was so hard to write without spoilers, but I did it! Because of its spoiler-free nature, I didn&#8217;t get to write everything I wanted to write, but I got most of it down :)When I started this book, I had forgotten what it was about
I had gotten it so long ago and only just opened it up
I am mentally chastising myself for that, except I&#8217;m also happy I did it when I wasn&#8217;t as busy as I&#8217;ve been.Because this book will take everything from you
All of your concentration
All of your focus

All of your emotions


All of you.Naomi was interesting and so very complex

I felt like her wanting freedom resonated with me, but her parental situation was much different than mine


She was strong and knew what she wanted in life, but she also didn&#8217;t at the same time
She was a ball of contradictions and it made her the perfect character for this book.I felt like Lana was portrayed perfectly for everything that had happened to her, and I absolutely loved her character&#8212;even though my heart was weeping for her the whole time.Lachlan was a sweetheart


I loved his sweet and protective nature
I loved his character and his love for Naomi

He was the purest and truest love you might find for Naomi.And Max


The passion and heat he brought only made those scenes that much hotter
He was the lust and the passion that many would want to find.I was not expecting the ending


I kept waiting for a reason for Naomi to be in Fairfax; I kept wanting to know why


And I did end up knowing why&#8212;I just never thought it was going to be what it was


When the twist was revealed, I had to stop and go back and look at some scenes


Even now, I feel like I have to re-read the whole book after this vital piece of information was given to me.The end was left somewhat open-ended, which was how I expected it to be

Everything that Naomi is and had to through cannot be solved in merely one book, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s enough for a sequel


It was left how I feel was the perfect way to be left.This book is not for the faint of heart


This book will tear your heart to shreds and it won&#8217;t completely patch it up, but it will send it on its road to recovery.I beg you, though, to give this book a chance


It will bring you in and yes, you might have to step back from the book a little bit to process all that is happening, but you&#8217;ll be back before long

It gave me insight into how complex people can be and how horrible people can be&#8212;as well as how kind and helping people can be

This book is a very good one.There are, however, trigger warnings for this book: Incest and Rape.

$REVIEW.: Rarely does a New York writer spin a reverse tale; pulling up the stakes and leaving the city. Any of us here in Manhattan know someone who came here from outside of the city, because more than likely, you&#8217;re not originally from the city. We all love the &#8220;bright lights, big city&#8221; theme of The Devil Wears Prada, where a starry-eyed yokel gets swamped by the arts-food-fashion culture of the place. But in this hip collection of essays, it&#8217;s the other way around; they pack up for small towns and suburbs. Some will come back.Mira Ptacin is one example; she and her husband leave because it&#8217;s too expensive and they can&#8217;t stand the crowds, or the noise, or bureaucracy, the high rents, the rudeness, the distractions. If your list of gripes is that big, well then you definitely aren&#8217;t cut out for inner-city living. The part where she says &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t interpret direct and efficient communication as rudeness,&#8221; reminds me of the last time I was in Vermont. I got weird looks from everyone, but New Yorkers talk fast, what can I do? If you think my speech sounds terse, you should see the Italians in the East Bronx.But seriously, folks, this woman&#8217;s from Maine, which isn&#8217;t known for lightning-fast speech and the &#8220;come on, move&#8221; attitude of the sidewalk.  It&#8217;s no surprise that after five years she calls it quits, moves back to Maine, and loves it there.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean they all leave permanently. Melissa Febos moves to a college town for her job, but it doesn&#8217;t have all the excitement of the city. In her case, breaking up with her girlfriend is the spur to move back, because she has no other connection to the town. Living in the city can also distract you from personal troubles; you don&#8217;t think about your problems as much while walking down a noisy street. Since most New Yorkers have tiny apartments, we&#8217;re less likely to stay indoors much, and without cars, we have no choice but to walk.Compare this essay collection to Gunfighter in Gotham, about the life of Bat Masterson. This was a man from Dodge City who migrating to New York to become a writer, just like Willa Cather coming here to write about Nebraska. For some reason, there&#8217;s always been this feeling that to be a writer you have to move to New York, and only New York, not Boston, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, they just don&#8217;t seem to have the writer&#8217;s reputation (though Chicago does, sort of.)  Then again, maybe that&#8217;s not true; Stephen King didn&#8217;t write in New York, neither did Hunter Thompson, Robert. E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, Pat Conroy, William Falkner or John Grisham (hey, this list is getting long) and none of their works have anything to do with New York. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget M.R. Kingston (author of The Yearling) and her tales of the Florida swamps. If you&#8217;ve watched the movie Cross Creek, you&#8217;ll see there&#8217;s no way she could&#8217;ve been inspired by inner-city living. Maybe leaving the city isn&#8217;t so bad for a writer?But this collection of essays, it&#8217;s something that we don&#8217;t see often. Few would write about leaving the city, because it doesn&#8217;t happen much. Traditionally, New Yorkers left the city if they felt they couldn&#8217;t raise kids here, which is exactly what happened to my parents in the late 1970&#8217;s. But the writers who contributed to this book don&#8217;t all have kids, so there are other reasons for the moves. Like I mentioned before, some left because of high rents, others left because they just weren&#8217;t meant to take the culture of a city.Maybe this book is indicative of the average American. Unlike the English nobility, with their &#8220;family estates,&#8221; Americans change addresses all the time.

$REVIEW.: How to Vertical Garden, by Jonah Green, was somewhat of a disappointment to me.  I enjoy reading anything about gardening, as I am always looking for new tips or ways to work on my own garden at home.  I have read many books about gardening, and grow my own vegetable and herb gardens as well.  Vertical gardening is a new concept to me, one that I know nothing about, and though this book was packed full of information, I feel like I didn't learn anything from it.  SOme of it was actually a little confusing to me, and I feel that if there were maybe pictures to help explain where the author was going with the advise that was being given, I may have better understood the concept of vertical gardening, and therefor better enjoyed the book.As far as this book goes, I would recommend it to someone that has an idea of how to vertical garden in the first place, as tehre are no pictures or diagrams to help explain the process of it.

$review_text.: This is a brilliant, top-notch book!, Not the full on romance that I had expected, but a light- hearted comedy/ romance that had me laughing so hard my ribs ached. Alan Helgasson has really captured that moment in everybody&#8217;s life when they simply just &#8216;snap&#8217;.  Howard and his friends have come to the realization that they&#8217;re getting older and there are many things they wish they had done. Most of the scenarios that take place are hilarious with great dialogue. I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that we&#8217;ve all had friends like these and I almost sure I have even had some of these conversations before. The author really has managed to bring these characters to life each with their own humor to add to the mix, with something for everyone to relate to. An absolute pleasure to read!

$review_text.: Annalise has been running from Remy for the last seven years.  He had done something unforgivable and Anna left Texas and ran as far as she could from him and still stay in the states, Maine.  But, Remy&#8217;s little sister and Anna&#8217;s best friend, Libby is engaged to be married and she want Anna to come for the wedding.  In fact, she wants her to come down and spend the summer before the wedding.  Anna just can&#8217;t do it.  She wants nothing to do with Remy.  Remy decides that he is going to Maine to get her.  He doesn&#8217;t tell her he is coming and Anna is pretty surprised when he shows up.  But, she agrees and they start the long car trip to Texas.  Along the way, there is a lot of talking and a lot of spanking.  And, as with every Carolyn Faulkner book, there is a HEA.  I really liked this story.  There are lots of spankings and a very dominant man.  Also, Anna is not a wimp.  She is a strong woman who happens to be submissive.  And, she loves Remy even though he was an ass.  I highly recommend this book as I do all Carolyn Faulkner&#8217;s books.

$REVIEW.: I received a pre-released copy of this latest addition to the After series, I think it is an excellent addition to the story thus far, I  didn't want it to stop: the story continues to unfold and you get further and further sucked into the characters, the action, and unfolding mysterious behavior of the Zapheads. In this series, thankfully Scott has written something that was not just another zombie series, obviously it has similarities but the Zapheads are anything but zombies, as a result I look forward to each installment as it is released, the characters continue to remain interesting, the issues they encounter remain challenging, there's really nothing not to like with book 3 or the series as a whole, well, other than Scott is only one man and can only write so many books, so fast, waiting for the next installment can be rough!
$review_summary.: Great follow up/great continuation of After series

$REVIEW.: I am truly amazed at Ms. Grey's talent. I practically begged for an advance copy of WTH because I couldn't wait. There is SO much emotion contained within these pages. When I first began reading, I wasn't prepared for the subject of the plot. I had to stop reading and catch my breath after sobbing uncontrollably for nearly 2 chapters. At that point, I had to share my story of heartbreak with her. Being the gracious and friendly person that she is, she listened to me while I spilled my little heart out. I don't know if this story has affected me more profoundly because of my personal experience, but I honestly believe it is the most beautiful book I have read. It felt real, raw, painful, passionate, and innocent, all at the same time. I can't say enough words of praise for WTH and R.S. Although I admit I was skeptical about Abby taking a road trip with a complete stranger, I'm so glad that she did!!!!You must give this story a try. It is well worth it! Just be sure to keep a box of tissues next to you. :)

$REVIEW.: Yesterday, I started Skin in the Game by Jackie Barbosa. My goal was to finish it last night, alas it wasn't in the cards. However, I finished the story today. I must say that it was one hot read. Come on anytime you add a football player to mix it's going to be hot (let's be honest any athlete).Other than the hotness, this was a fantastic story. How often to do you find a female football coach at anytime. Practically never, but Ms. Barbosa had Angela Peterson being a football coach for her local high school team. Which is unheard of and especially in a small town like Harper Falls. Yet the girl knows how to call plays and happens to be the perfect person for the head coaching job. Yet there's a couple things standing in her way, one being Cade Reynolds.When Cade and Angela get together man talk about some heat. Seriously, they are scorching hot, but that's not the only reason I like this story. I love how the heroine wasn't always a hot little thing, but she had a ugly duckling background. I love that she carries a piece of her past on her heart which really shapes who she is. Cade, I mean there isn't much to say other than he's a hot football player. I think that's all that needs to be said.Honestly, I really liked the storyline. I think the author did a fantastic job with the story. I really can't wait to see what the next story will bring from this collection. So, if you are hankering for some football or player, I would suggest checking out Skin in the Game. Just don't forget to turn the fan on.Copy provided by the publisher

$REVIEW.: Every few years or so the famous proven forgery known as "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion", relied on by Hitler and other philosophical Nazis, rears its ugly head to deceive new generations not exposed to its proven lies.  It consists of a series of facts carefully woven together with false conclusions and the omission of tons of other facts that prove the premise false.  It, and its ideological descendants such as the propaganda piece at issue here, were created by the "White Russians" as an attempt to scare the masses away from communism by claiming that communism was part of a world conspiracy foisted on an unsuspecting public by conniving Jews.  Academics already have taken on and proven this nonsense and racist lies conclusively false - starting with the fact that throughout the whole of the 20th Century, NON-Jewish bankers, financiers, and industrialists ALWAYS outnumbered their Semitic cohorts.  Never mind the racist assumption that Jews are somehow always conspiring against Gentiles no matter how different their ideologies may be (Jonah Goldberg, Roy Cohn, and neocons like Perle and Wolfowitz REALLY in cahoots with Karl Marx, Al Franken, and Jeff Cohen (liberal creator of FAIR), thousands of Jewish labor organizers and liberals?  My God, is there any limit to stupidity?)How the deceased and greedy Rothchilds of the 19th Century are linked to other capitalists of various Jewish backgrounds in the 20th Century is assumed and never proven.Anti-Semites such as billionaire (many times over by today's standards) Henry Ford propagated this propaganda in order to counter the threat of organized labor (which he attributed to being part of the same worldwide Jewish conspiracy that Hitler used as boob-bait to sucker the masses (aka Big Lie)).  Hitler attributed Henry Ford's hateful, fascist, racist rant, The International Jew, for his anti-Semitism.  Damage that the Ford Foundation continues to try to undo.Of course, tens of thousands of non-Jewish capitalists and big business power-brokers have to be ignored, or somehow just too stupid to notice.Strange how the religions of billionaires such as the Protestants Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller are never linked to their crimes and greed, but having Jewish ancestry does.  I believe that regardless of one's creed, ethnicity or religion (or lack thereof), the camaraderie of greed makes for surer bedfellows than any religion or ethnicity, and even if there is a greater percentage of greed pigs belonging to one ethnicity than another, the brotherhood of greed takes priority over all other considerations.  For the greedy, worship of Mammon takes priority over any other religion, including those of their ancestors.Please read instead the much more accurate, well-researched, and correct dealings with this proven-wrong subject, and get an understanding of why it was created in the first place (to sucker the masses):"Who Financed Hitler" (Pool, The Dial Press (and others), 1979)"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany" (William L. Shirer, Simon and Schuster, 1960)."Trading with the Enemy" (Charles Higham, Barnes and Noble, 1983)"Hitler's Table Talk" (Adolf Hitler, London, Weidenfeld & Nicholson, 1953) also published as "Hitler's Secret Conversations" (New York, Farrar, Straus & Young, 1953)."Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?..."

$review_text.: The challenge in writing &#34;brief&#34; histories of such broad targets is that so much glossing over is required that invariably some important events are glossed over and complex issues are subjected to oversimplification. This is not the first of the &#34;Very Brief History&#34; products I've read, nor do I suspect, will it be the last. I am always impressed by the massive amount of information provided in such a small amount of space. Such brevity is certainly out of the realm of my own writing talents so I tell myself I'm merely &#34;admiring&#34; the skill and not envying or coveting it. That way it's a good thing, right? RIGHT??? Why is my nose growing?Anyway, the amount of information crammed into this short expose' on &#34;the War to End All Wars&#34; is certainly enough to whet one's initial thirst for knowledge of the subject while encouraging a desire for additional details. I did deduct 1/2 star because of a couple of grammatical/formatting mistakes. I also feel that this series should provide at least a brief selection of more detailed books for readers interested in learning more about aspects of the War. In this particular volume, perhaps suggested titles regarding Galipoli, The Sinking of the Lusitania and its role in drawing the United States into things, The Assasination of the Kaiser, and of course a title or two about how the Treaty of Versailles provided the means for Hitler to rise to power and set the stage for WWII a scant 20 years later, would suffice. The lack of such a &#34;suggested further reading&#34; list is the reason for the deduction of the second 1/2 star from the total.Overall however, this book, like the others in the series, does a remarkable job of compressing a massive amount of information into a small, short, read without turning it all into a boring litany of tedious facts. I definitely recommend it for any and all readers over the age of 12 seeking an introduction to the subject.

$review_text.: When Barbara Briggs Ward writes about sleighs, bells and pine boughs be prepared for a journey into the depths of the human heart


After Ellie's husband Ben learns that he is adopted, Ellie and Ben, along with their son, Andy begin a quest to find Ben's mother, Sophie


During their quest, Ben is reunited with other people from the orphanage where he lived until age six when he was adopted by a childless couple on a cold, wintery Christmas Eve
Evocative descriptions of dark winter nights with full moons, sparkling stars and blustery winds in northern New York State are the setting of a story about the choices we make in life and the pain and redemption that often accompanies choices motivated by love and sacrifice

The Snowman Maker adds new meaning to the word "family"

Whether in an orphanage or in an old stone homestead, family is about people living together in an enduring kinship that binds and connects them.The Christmas spirit of love, hope, and renewal is expressed in Ellie's and Ben's holiday traditions which anchor the family and at the same time provide the support for individual growth and achievement

Daughter Maggie pursues a career in Europe in a line of earth friendly cosmetics, while son Andy leaves college to play guitar in a successful rock band

The family overcomes every obstacle, however, to be together at Christmas.The author's observations about deserted farms and boarded up shops in small towns and villages is a realistic portrayal of challenges facing small rural communities
Reaching out with Christmas cookies and gifts to a young family whose home burned in a fire just before Christmas reinforces the holiday spirit of giving and the importance of community support


Sophie's handmade snowmen are the symbols of a mother's love and faith and a reminder that a child stays in a mother's heart forever.The softly-hued painting of pasture, woodland, house, and snowmen nestled amongst gently rolling snow covered hills on the book cover created by graphic designer/illustrator, Suzanne Langelier-Lebeda, adds to the quality of Snowman Maker as a holiday keepsake.

$REVIEW.: I was doubtful in the beginning, but my tune changed quickly.I have to give it to the writer in a good way because you find many books where the lead character talks about there thoughts for ages and i find that very annoying. It was not the case with this book. There was always interaction between characters which i loved.And Kale, wow if anything more sweeter come out of his mouth, he would transform into a pie! He has a way with words and subjects.This story definitely kept me on my toes.Worth the read. Brilliant!

Although the main focus of the story was based on dealing with and the survival of child abuse which I find to be a very disturbing choice of subject matter.

While it was not new material for me, it was nice to finally have a book with everything I've learned from classes and workshops all in one place.

$review_text.: While in most cases, hugs do brighten people's days, hugging is not a panacea for all challenges.  Not EVERYBODY likes or wants hugs and this book can be very misleading.  One size does NOT fit all.  However, hugs are and can be wonderful if all parties involved like and want them and are comfortable with each other.  That is the heart of the matter.In some cases, hugs are viewed as restrictive and punitive.  I knew a child who used to flee a relative who was known to swoop down on children with raucous displays of affection.  The child thought the hugger looked like an attacker and would run.  Many people with autism find hugs unpleasant and just another way of being forced to endure something unpleasant.  Hugs can also be intrusive.Very rarely has the very real issue of people who dislike hugs and don't want them in the first place been addressed.  Their rights should be honored.  Donna Williams does an outstanding job of discussing this in "Autism: An Inside-Out Approach."  Having an aversion for hugs is not limited to the autistic population.Some cultures encourage privacy and hugging is not the cultural "norm."  There is also the very real issue of individual tastes and needs.  Not all individuals find this a desirable method.  Being forced to endure hugs or being coerced to hug and/or be hugged by somebody one dislikes and/or does not know well is a disservice to all.  Hugging on cue seems scripted and unnatural.  How unfortunate that something which has traditionally been touted as positive can be used as a way of making people compromise their wishes and submit to appease others.  In the examples provided above, hugging appears to be a self serving act that just meets the hugger's needs.I didn't like the bear costumes the people were drawn wearing in this book.  That just reinforced the need to be covert when forcing hugs on people who'd rather not have them.

$REVIEW.: I was expecting this to be a boring, academic treatise on Allan Savory's grazing plans, but there was actually much more hidden in the text.Along with Savory's revolutionary (to "modern" man) idea of using Nature's tried and true methods of land management, there is other information about others who have done great things with the same kind of philosophy, as well as information about various studies and work on topics as diverse as politics and Genetically Modified things.Although I found the book's style a bit difficult to read (jumping back and forth in time and across continents without following a clear, overriding arc), there was still enough good information to make the journey worth the ride.While the author gave a certain amount of time to the latest mind control meme of "carbon" nonsense, that is probably a good thing in this case, as that will make the book more palatable for the brainwashed masses hypnotized by that Big Lie.Fortunately, there is enough real science and actual, practical experience in these pages to make up for that. This is one of the most balanced ecological pieces I have read in a long time. It will certainly upset some eco-types' cherished beliefs, but reality has a way of doing that.Well worth the read.

$REVIEW.: As I continue my reviews on this series I have come to Vol


2

Nausicaa has left the Valley of the Wind to go to war with Princess Kushana of Tormekia, but on their way to the front their attack group is attacked by Asbel of Pejite
Asbel is shot down and Nausicaa goes to save him, only to be stuck under the Sea of Corruption


As the first book ends Nausicaa and Asbel are seen trying to fly out of the bottom of the Sea and get out.This book, for those who've seen the movie, covers closely the events that take place in the second half of the movie

Here's the difference


One of the Doroke tribes, mentioned in the first book, has been driven from their lands by the Tormekia invasion and has been sent to conquer and settle the lands of the Periphery, where the Valley of the Wind lies
To do that they must first destroy Kushana's army by luring the insects out of the Sea to attack
Of course Nausicaa finds out about this and manages to not quite foil the plot, but she does save the baby Ohm larva


Much of the Tormekian army is destroyed but the Dorokes are forced to retreat
By the end of the story Kushana takes what is left of her army south to join up with the rest of her men already engaging in battle, and she takes Nausicaa with her to find the stone that controls the God Worrier.halfway through this book it goes in a completely different direction than the movie, Nausicaa goes off to war, Asbel and Yupa foil a Doroke plan to conquer the Valley, and we are introduced to knew characters such as the Doroke Priest, who is known as the Holy One, and Ketcha, a Doroke girl who serves him
The part where the Ohm attack the Tormekian army is one of the highlights of the series, but the ending was a little odd and might feel rushed


Not the best in the series, but it is a good follow up to the first.If you have seen the movie then there isn't anything new in the first half of this book for you


But don't just skip this book to save money, there are enough differences to make buying it worth wild.

The latter parts get into the author's suggested way of treating the issue and preferred equipment, but doesn't qualify that it isn't necessarily a great solution for every dog.

$review_text.: This classic has a very slow start
 Losing his mother and father at very young age, Philip not only has to deal with said losses, he lives with affliction of club foot
 He stays very alone, rejected over and over by peers

 From my point of view, he becomes so accustomed to rejection and loneliness, that he subconsciously seeks abusive relationships with both women and men
 Sad and somewhat depressing, Philip continuously meets and overcomes obstacles in his life
 I do recommend this book; however, there is no laughter or any relief from the bad decisions, bad relationships and self-loathing.

Yes, I basically am lazy in that I don't want anything too complicated but still want results.  One reason I love this book is that it is modified.  You have the protein water drinks but you also have a dinner with real food.  I plan to begin this diet in the next week.  Her writing really motivates me and makes me believe that I can do it and get results!  Another reason I love this book is her honesty and answers to questions.  She also talks about how this diet compares financially with buying food for 3 meals and snacks.  There are extra bonuses at the end.  You can't go wrong with this book.

$review_text.: Guest review by the hubby....Ok, I just want to state that this has only happened ONE time before, I read a book and it hooks me into the rest of the series so much that I had to find the previous books in order to find out how it all began. That series was "The Last Herald-Mage" by the wonderful Mercedes Lackey. I could not wait to go back and see how Valdemar first started and devoured the rest of her books.This happened again.This time, Lizzy Ford has presented an absolute fantastical world that takes place in our own back yard and combines it with the elements that made Valdemar so great to me. She has interwoven elements of the classic "Incarnations of Immortality" series by the great Piers Anthony and presented it in such a way that makes it relevant to today's audiences. Full of action and romance these books kept me enthralled in such a way that, yes, I devoured them, once again making my wife think I had abandoned her.With characters so vivid that they leap off the page, Lizzy has crafted an adventure that I for one could not put down. When we first got the Advanced Readers Copy of the Soon to be released "Deidre's Death," I found myself so enamoured with the characters in the first few pages that I knew I had to start at the beginning. Thus became my quest for the next several days.When I first got into "Katie's Hellion," I was immersed into a world that started to remind me of something but was just different enough that I couldn't quite grasp it. I had to read more. By the end of the first book, I needed more.Into the second book, "Katie's Hope," we go and more of the same fantastic writing. More action and more romance makes a very good read. Throughout these 2 books you were kept guessing if the 2 main characters were going to be together, that continues in the third book, "Rhyn's Redemption," while keeping up the action and characterizations as well.The third book was a great conclusion to this series but made the audience want more. I think this is what Mercedes Lackey went through with her Heralds of Valdemar. She kept going with them, as did Lizzy Ford.Book one of the Rhyn Eternal series, "Gabriel's Hope" offers the reader a slightly different view, as well as going in a totally different direction. We are still immersed in this world but concentrating on different characters. Same great writing style and totally worthy of the whole series. I couldn't put this one down either. When I got to the end, I was lucky to have the ARC in my hands."Deidre's Death" starts out where "Gabriel's Hope" left off. I love the little twists Lizzy put into these books and hope that this series continues after the third book in this trilogy, "Darkyn's Mate." I am currently awaiting (reading, snicker) that one. Once again, though, "Deidre's Death" continues the fantastic writing style that has made me love these books. All the characters are just as vivid as they have been and the story keeps you captivated to the end.

$review_text.: Rusty Santoro, ex-president of the Cougars, is having it rough. Real rough.His shop teacher has been helping him break free of his gang. He is one strike from prison. His sister has joined the Cougars as a female auxiliary member. He is friendless. His father is a drunk and his mother desperately trying to keep it together. Of course all of this is nothing when compared to the fact that the new president of the Cougars wants him gutted.Web of the City, originally published in 1958, outlives its slightly dated version of New York delivering one of the most frightening depictions of post-war teenage life ever recorded. Of course it should. First, it is written by Harlan Ellison; A man who pulls no punches and for whom literacy mercy doesn't exist. Second, it is culled from the ten weeks he spent as 'Cheech' Beldone in New York's Barons. The prose is gritty, remorseless, and yanks the stints from the heart of darkness.For those whose knowledge of 1950's youth culture is Happy Days, Web of the City will rip your eyelids open and force you to see why and how teenagers were America's biggest fear in the years following World War II. But there is also an honest feeling of frustration and angst as we watch Santoro fight to stay on the right side of law. Like watching someone dig on the beach, every time Santoro makes headway the walls cave in trapping him with no way out.Hard Case has done an amazing job repackaging Web of the City with three additional tales of violence and dread. These alone are worth Ellisonphiles adding another copy to their collection as the men's magazines they came from are either impossible to find or secured by collectors in steel strongboxes.

$REVIEW.: I've read several in this author's Zombie Bible series, so I knew I liked his writing. Now I'm convinced I'll enjoy any genre this guy writes, short or long.This shorter work sucked me in just as completely as his full-length novels. I found myself in the mind of a future traveler, and her confusion, panic and desperation were so tangible. As a reader, I enjoyed &#34;becoming&#34; this character, though I would not want to &#34;become&#34; her in reality, given her terrible situation. There are scenes painted so vividly that I will never forget them, and I am tempted to draw some fan art, they are so worthy of illustration.To top it off, Stant managed that trick I love most in short stories: the little twist at the end, that kicker that leaves me thinking about what happened for days afterward. After finishing the story and looking at the whole thing, I just have to say, &#34;Well done.&#34; And, &#34;Can I please have some more?&#34;I think anyone who likes the old classic horror of Lovecraft and Poe will enjoy this story, as well as anyone who likes the classic science fiction masters such as Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury.

$REVIEW.: Somewhere in storage I have a couple of mementos from my daytrip to Iwo Jima: sand and bullet fragments in a film canister, photographs, and a Coast Guard LORAN station patch I bought off one of the Coasties for five bucks.  After recently reading a Kindle book on the famous WWII battle, I searched for some more Iwo-related books on Amazon and stumbled upon "One Year Below The Tower", a fun memoir documenting a Coast Guardsman's tour of duty on the island.  I'd wondered what it was like to be stationed on Iwo, and I certainly got the full scoop from the horse's mouth.The twentysomething Michael Krueger volunteers for Iwo Jima as his first duty station, and he begins his year-long tour on the small, hot, and smelly island in 1980.  From there, we follow him as he acclimates to his new post and its colorful cast of characters.  Beer-fueled parties and island explorations help make the time pass as fast as possible, but the station's isolation and uneven leadership are tough on morale.  Unlike many others, the author valiantly tries to ditch a negative attitude in favor of a more enlightened view of his Iwo tour, and by his own admission he mostly succeeds.Unfortunately, this somewhat sedate account of military life will probably become lost among the deluge of Iraq and Afghanistan wartime memoirs.  True, the author saw no action during his peacetime enlistment, but it would be a mistake to dismiss this book as a dull REMF diary.  I laughed long and loud at the story of Bones & the Admiral, found the inevitable clashes between the enlisted slobs and command staff eerily similar to my own time as a Marine Corps POG, and was touched by Mr. Krueger's emotional encounter with a Marine veteran of the WWII battle reliving the horrors of the invasion during a tour.Although not the most elegantly written or exciting military memoir I've ever read, Mr. Krueger's account satisfied my curiosity about LORAN duty on Iwo Jima and managed to be entertaining at the same time.  The glossary and personal photos were a welcome addition, although as a military history buff I was hoping for more detail about his island explorations.  The Iwo Jima LORAN station was decommissioned in the early 1990s, which means that "One Year Below The Tower" might end up being one of the only written accounts of a Coastie's Iwo tour.  Recommended.

$REVIEW.: "To Steal a Highlander's Heart" is a suspenseful romance that also blends in a little magic, humor, and some definite spice. Morgann and Alana are childhood friends from different clans, with the possibility of romance between them--until Alana's powerful father marks Morgann as a thief and banishes him. This ends the peace between the McRaes and the Campbells, and Morgann spends the next eight years as an outlaw warrior.Yet he and Alana are meant to be together, and the faerie Teile is determined to use her magic to help push them back together. When Alana finds herself wandering the countryside with little memory of how she got there, she's the perfect target for Morgann to kidnap--and fall in love with. She becomes more than a bargaining chip as they face off against a more sinister enemy than anyone expects.Fans of the romance genre--especially period romances--will enjoy this novel a lot. Morgann is a sexy, strong hero and Alana is a spunky yet feminine heroine. While their attraction to each other is evident right off the bat, the romance develops in a way that keeps you turning the pages. I also liked the touches of whimsy Teile brought to the book to lighten the suspense/danger of the situation. The author also does a really good job of painting a vivid picture of the time period, the characters, and the settings, which pulls you in as a reader. If you like books like Diana Garbaldon's "Highlander" series, you will love this book as well!

$review_text.: I have seen these types of body scrubs at the local farmer's market every year and just can't bring myself to pay the high prices that they are asking
It doesn't look like there is much going into the bottles and there can't be a whole lot of work involved either I thought


It is a good thing I found this book! There isn't much work in making these yourself at home and the ingredients, which almost everyone has, are inexpensive
Right away, I made a couple of them before I was even finished reading the book and they were really good for a first timer! The recipes are easy to follow and I think anyone can start making these the same day, you might even be the next person selling them at the farmer's market


The best thing about the book is that it doesn't just give you some recipes and let you go, it actually goes through what some of the ingredients do and how they can help your body


Many of the recipes can be made in ten minutes or less so you don't have to make large amounts and leave them sitting around for weeks
This is a very well written guide to body scrubs and I think anyone can benefit from it.

I am an advid reader and usually read at least three books a week, and am sorry to say that a good bit of the books end up in my 'never read again pile' or even worse in my 'can not for the life of me finish' pile.

$REVIEW.: Whilst I enjoyed reading Hannah there are a few flaws that I found hard to overlook.The tale of Hannah, her voyage from England and her life in the colony, particularly in the Hawkesbury, was thoroughly enjoyable
The author presented the story of his ancestor with accuracy to the era and in a compelling way that made me look forward to seeing how her life and the lives of her family members resolved itself
His description of their life on the land and the trials and tribulations of doing so whilst raising a family in the tough Australian bush was presented in a heartfelt manner that made the characters endearing.What I found difficult about the book was the way it was written
On occasion the plot lacked continuity and flew from one occurrence to the next with no explanation of how the story was propelled to that point.Once again, I cannot understand why one would present a work for public sale without the use of spell check or proof reading


As a result of the lack of both, on dozens of occasions two, three or more words often joined together to make one large nonsense word


This is especially seen when reading italicized words which often join into the words following it.In one instance the author lists the date of the birth of a child as 1924 which of course is impossible as the death of Hannah herself pre-dates this date.To some degree I find this lack of proof reading of Kindle novels and the like, far too common and not just particular to this author.Overall, a nice story of one of our country's pioneer families.

$REVIEW.: Even if you are not a Doctor Who fan, Tom Baker's autobiography is a fascinating and delightfully entertaining story of a remarkable, (and humble) man making his way through life.  His real adventures are in many ways, stranger than fiction.  His candid, and often humorous retelling of his story, will strike a cord with anyone who has struggled with finding their true calling.  Baker's description of the many varied paths he journeyed is told with a charming honesty towards good fortune, and a modest underplaying of the remarkable talents that were to inevitably be discovered in his dramatic roles. His skillful storytelling captures his sense of wonder at all the strange coincidences and haphazard fate that color the twist and turns of life. I have rarely enjoyed a book more than this.  If you were lucky enough to grow up with Tom Baker as your doctor, you will enjoy this all the more.

$REVIEW.: Number 36 in the Osprey "Essential Histories" series, this account of about a hundred years of classical-era warfare is fascinating. I couldn't put the book down till I finished it.  The (mostly color) illustrations, including several helpful maps, provide depth and context for the historical account.  Some of the war scenes are so vivid, in fact, I felt I was watching them as they happened.  The central chapter is "Xerxes' invasion of Greece," which covers the pivotal battle at Thermopylai, the fall of Athens, the sea battle at Salamis, and the decisive defeats of the Persians at Plataia and Mykale (I use the book's spellings).  What struck me the most was the arbitrariness of who sided with who in the course of the hundred years recounted.  At times Sparta sided with Athens, at times with Persia. De Souza makes clear the unreliability of some of Herodotus's account of these battles.  This concise read comes in at less than 100 pages, and is suitable for getting up to speed on this material.

$review_text.: Wow! I really don't know what to say about, Destiny Gift. It's definitely an intense read. You have to truly dedicate yourself to the reading of it. It's not a light-weight book you can just skim through. It requires serious attention and contemplation. There's so much going on at any one time, that you really have to pay attention to keep up. I mean this in a good way. I just want you to be prepared to be totally immersed.The world has ended, as we know it, and the only safe place in New York City, is inside the gates of NYU, where Nadine, our heroine, is a student. Just traveling outside the gates of the university to go home, is unsafe. The streets are full of criminals and the skies are full of huge, flying, killer bats. The sky is no longer blue, it's dark as night all the time, and pollution has fouled everything. Inside their homes, people are relatively safe but there are guards at the doors of the buildings and people travel by car so as not to be attacked by the bats.Nadine begins to have visions where her, and a handsome boy named, Victor, are in love. She starts to hope the visions come more often as she only feels truly happy in them. Victor's a sweet, loving boy, and he lives in a world where the sun shines, there is clean water and flowers bloom in the meadows. In her real life, Nadine meets Micah. He's very handsome and intriguing but he's not Victor. Nadine knows it's silly to love a boy only alive in her visions but she can't help herself.Soon, she runs into Victor in real life, but he's nothing like he is in her visions. He's cold and rude, and wants nothing to do with her. Strangely, both Micah and Victor feel consuming pain that only Nadine's touch can relieve. Suddenly, the three of them find themselves linked, whether they want to be, or not. Even when both boys start to be nice to Nadine, she doesn't know if they're really interested in her, or only how she can help with their pain.Also, once Victor shows up, Nadine's visions change and she begins to 'see' ancient gods and goddesses. She learns their names, who they are and, most importantly, which ones are good, and which ones are evil. She's not sure why she's suddenly seeing them but she feels that she's supposed to do something. She just has to figure out what that is. After a deadly bat attack at Nadine's apartment, Micah, Victor and Nadine flee, and start on a journey together to try and find out what the visions mean.As I said, this is an intense book. There's a bit of romance but the true center of the book, is the relationship between Nadine, Micah and Victor, and how they help each other figure out Nadine's visions, and what they're meant to accomplish. Unique, a bit overwhelming at times, and totally encompassing.

 It's absolutely wonderful


 I put my headphones on and my productivity takes off
 I've bought it on tape twice, and now on CD, and I can't recommend it enough


 I've written at least ten published novels listening to it (among other music cds).It gives you that quiet bubble to work in that life usually denies you
 Might not work for everyone, but it consistently works for me.

$review_text.: The author skillfully builds the tension in this murder-who-done-it by  graphically showing the residents of Bear Creek brace for a raging storm and face the destruction caused by the rising river and mudslides. Finding the murderer and cleaning up after the storm occur in parallel. The net result is a fast-paced, satisfying mystery.This mystery would especially appeal to those, looking for writing that reflects Christian values, and those, wanting a realistic view of modern native Americans.
$SUMMARY.: Tension builds at several levels

$REVIEW.: Along with The Information Diet, this is an important book that, in detail, describes how our media system has rotted at the core

Being first is more important than being accurate

Page views are what matters above all else, etc.A caveat is that Holiday seems to have used some of the same tactics he criticizes others for in writing his book


Irin Carmon, a google search reveals, is not guilty of all the shoddy journalism practices Holiday suggests (though she herself admits to using some of the dubious strategies Holiday says she did)


Reaching out to her could have helped clarify some of these issues and boosted his credibility


Of course, doing so would have damaged his "Irin Carmon embodies everything that is wrong with blogs" narrative.Jim Edwards, on the other hand, a quick Google search reveals, really is a hack

He seems to deserve the criticism levelled at him.Herein lies the problem: Holiday is guilty of doing almost every single thing he complains about in the book

One can be forgiven for doubting whether he really "got religion" or if he just wrote this book to make money and build a bigger name for himself


Ten minutes of research online showed that one of his biggest targets isn't quite as bad as made out to be, while another is really that awful

1/2 is not a good score

Admittedly I haven't independently researched other targets of Holidays ire such as Nick Denton and thus am going on a small sample size.Regardless of what you may think of Holiday, this book will help you become a wiser and more discerning consumer of mediaLastly, as Holiday admits himself, his tactics don't work in the long-run


If you despise the tactics he writes about (as I do), and are looking for the antidote to all this garbage, may I suggest subscribing to Seth Godin's wonderful (and free) blog.

$review_text.: Although this books was hard to read at times because of the era in which it took place, it was overall, worthwhile.  Some of the characters were aggravating probably due to their Victorian way of looking at things. Still it was an interesting look at how society was in those days. A few punctuations of unexpected hilarious humor  made the book much more palatable.

$review_text.: When I started reading the first book of the series, I was a bit disappointed. It read like a "Race to Witch Mountain" story with 3 teenagers finding a spaceship that changes their lives. The author gradually steps it up and there is a fair amount of violence and "adult" action. This second book is a much higher step. This book has violence and gore to rival Stephan King. It moves fairly quickly and goes in some interesting directions. Those who wrote that the violence was to much should stick to the "young adult" section or read some real stories that come out of Mexico or Columbia about narco terrorists. Then you won't think that the author went too far. I'm looking forward to his 3rd book in the series.

$review_text.: This whole series is great.  It's worth taking the time to pick up and read the tales of a humanoid rabbit struggling to make his way in a society that doesn't see him as more than a menial laborer.This story maintains the theme from the early part of the series.  David is placed in a situation where any commander would struggle to succeed, but his good nature and friendship with the slave rabbits of the navy allow him to turn the situation around and win a great victory.  This is nto one of the more memorable stories in the series, but its good and helps bridge the gap from Lieutenant where David first came into his own and Commodore where we start to see just how much he means to others.

 As I probably won't read any more in the series, I wish there was a little more 'wrap up' to this first book - I didn't realize it was part of a series,  Maybe I will have to read some more of them; I can't seem to get the book out of my mind.

$review_text.: Reviewed by Stephanie OReview copy provided by authorHaunting, Intriguing, Sensual, Curious, Lustful, Spellbinding, Hot. All words I could use to describe this collection of short stories.Ok, so I didn't get the chance to sit and read this one by candle light, with glass of wine. More or less, I was privileged to read it sitting in my car in the parent pick up line waiting for school to let out. A few times I wondered if I was blushing. At times I even had to set the Nook down, so I could let the short story I just read sink in. As with any multi story book, you run the risk of some being out of the park home run hits, while others seem to be a foul ball. With this grouping, each story made its way to a base . . some made it only to first base, while others were out of the park home runs.The two stories that just completely rocked my world were: The Blood Moon Kiss and La Belle Mort. The Blood Moon Kiss finds us on the set of a popular "Vampire" show. The amount of heat that oozed off the pages of this story should have melted my Nook, I'm so glad it didn't. However, La Belle Mort, a story that finds us in a cell with a young lady awaiting punishment (hanging) for something she didn't do . . well, this story was one that I had to set my Nook down after reading. I needed a moment to just let the story sink in.There is something here for everyone. With 15 different short stories, how could you not find something that tickles your "fancy".

$REVIEW.: One thing for certain in the complex decisions on business strategy is the element of uncertainty. And it is certain that this cannot be managed or eliminated. What is important is the extent to which we are able to quantify the error in alternate scenarios and possibly arrive at decisions that are optimal. Had there been an "ideal toolkit", we could have avoided all business failures and planet earth would have been the safest place to live in for all entrepreneurs. Mankind would have awarded such a discovery with nothing less than the Nobel Prize. To expect our naked eye to have a clear picture of the universe will mean the demise of all telescopes and investments in space exploration. Strategy needs vision and this vision needs tools.This book provides a framework to classify uncertainty into 4 basic types and links it to major strategic decisions facing the Organization. It is a one to many relationship and situational in character. To make the understanding better, lots of examples ( Detailed case studies would have been even better) are thrown in. In the end our comfort in understanding Strategy certainly improves. But the exploration of this largely unmapped terrain will continue in the coming decades as we discover new lands. This is for certain.Highly recommended.

I skipped to the last couple chapters to hurry up and wrap up the story. Also Chloe's random rants and cazy behavior got old 50% into the book. She's very flaky and all over the place. I didn't hate her as a character but I wish some of her internal rants were cut out out of the book. Overall its a nice romance but a long read.

$REVIEW.: Charmaine has a very unique talent. She knows when someone is not telling the truth. When she gets a job in the Prosecutor's office she is thrown right into an investigation of the death of one of her great-aunt's dearest friends who had died in the hospital. When Charmaine or Char as her friends and family call her gets too involved in the "official" police investigation she is told to step away from it by her long time next door neighbor Detective Steve Sixkiller but as you will come to know...Char never does what she is told to do and gets more deeply involved especially when there had been other deaths in the same hospital of other elderly patients. The cast of characters in this story are a fun and loving bunch...each bringing charm and wit to the story. Ms Delaney delivers a wonderful story full of fun...romance...murder and mystery. This is the first book in the Working Stiffs Murder Mystery series and I am so looking forward to all of the future books. This is such a unique story line that has many possibilities and it will be fun to follow along with the author on what is surely going to be a fun and long running series! Kudos to you Ms. Delaney on such an awesome debut story and I for one will be a long time fan!

She organizes her recipes by season, from spring's first asparagus through tomatoes, "the star of summer," to winter squash and pumpkins; each chapter opens with information on growing, cooking, nutrition, and other useful facts. She also includes "Master Formulas," recipes that can be varied according to the vegetables in season.

A little predictable, but I never was able to guess who did it so that was good, it was never the person I thought it would be. The one thing that really irritated me about these books is the over use people pursing their lips. Every chapter at least 2 or 3 times, someone was pursing their lips. Please stop.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy from the author in exchange for my honest review, so here it is. I read part 1 back in August but read it again to remind myself of the story. After Rachel takes Emma to a swingers club and she meets James Carter. Emma runs from him, knows he is bad news. He can't stop trying to get her to go out with him. He even searches and finds out where she works and lives. Finally she agrees to spend the weekend with him and things seem to be going good until his brother Eric shows up. Eric tries to cause trouble for James and James is trying to keep Eric from Emma. Emma doesn't know what to believe is true.  There is a lot going on in this one to keep you glued to the pages just to see where it will go next. I wanted to slap James, Eric and Aubrey. They all seem to be lying and who in the hell is Liam? Now Emma has finally that she is going to put James in her past. Can she move on without him? Will James tell her the truth? And what in the hell kinda game are they all playing? Another great part to this series. Looking forward to finding out what happens next!

$review_text.: Chris McNab's fascinating HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 100 WEAPONS offers a unique take on how our world developed and the role various weapons played in that development

As the foreword states, "warfare has been the driving force of history" and how better to consider that history than by highlighting those significant weapons that impacted societal development.McNab's book is a hefty piece of work, topping off at 384 pages


The book takes a chronological look at weapons throughout history with chapters covering 'The Ancient World, 5000 BC - AD 500;' 'Medieval World, 500-1500;' 'Early Modern World, 1500-1800' 'Imperial Wars, 1800-1914' 'World War I, 1914-18' and so on.The first weapon described is the Flint Axe; the last, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
In between those two, you'll find entries for chariots, siege towers, Greek Fire, pikes, English longbows, matchlocks, bayonets, ships of the line, Colt M1911s, hand grenades, Dreadnoughts, Zeppelins, Fokker D VIIs, poison gas, land mines, aircraft carriers, MP40s, V-Weapons, atomic bombs, USS Nautilus, AIM-9 Sidewinders, ballistic missiles, etc
Each weapon rates a three-four page write-up that describes the weapon's development, use, evolution and impact.The entries are an entertaining mix of technical specs and operational use

What's especially interesting are the discussions of why certain weapons succeeded while others failed and the various factors that played a role in that

The T-34, for example, could have been an even greater success had it not been wasted through poor Soviet tactics and training.In short, A HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 100 WEAPONS should appeal to both nuts-and-bolts military hardware buffs and warfare enthusiasts

McNab is an engaging author and the eminently readable text is nicely complimented by hundreds of b&w; and color photographs, artworks, illustrations, profiles and diagrams, many of which have appeared in previous Osprey titles
In any case, McNab's book is an excellent treatment of an intriguing subject and, at $29.95, a steal

Highly recommended.

 It was fun to meet a young Jonas Taylor again

 And going with him on his haunting early journey was very rewarding.The previous reviewers said much of what I'm thinking and I hate to be redundant

 But I must concur..

once you read this book, you're going to go right back and re-read Meg and all the rest.Now we just need to hold out until Meg 5: Night Stalkers.Thanks for an awesome birthday present, Steve!!

$review_text.: I bought this book because of the reviews and I've found myself getting very bored with it, even falling asleep while reading it. There's an entire chapter of her life growing up and that's what put me to sleep and I couldn't figure out how that was relevant to changing my marriage. It made me not want to continue reading. Maybe I need to give it another chance, but I thought by the way the reviews were that my life would be changed through this book. But just doing what God instructs us to do will change my life. I'd recommend " A Women After God's Own Heart" 10 times more. That book is life changing.

$review_text.: "Tears of Tess" completely blew my mind. I normally read paranormal romance, but while browsing around Goodreads one day I found a list with this book on it. The concepts of kidnapping and Stockholm Syndrome really interested me. Add that with the fact that it was considered "erotic romance" and I had to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did! Ever since I finished reading it I've been looking for similar books that can satisfy me the way this one did. I did read the first book in "The Dark Duet" series and about half of the second one, but the leading man is such a sociopathic prick that I took a break from that series for now.That is a another review for a different time.Here's my brief synopsis of "Tears of Tess:"Tess's boyfriend Brax surprises her with holiday (vacation) to Cancun, Mexico. Although she loves him, he isn't able to satisfy her sexually. She has fantasies of being tied up, doing it in public places, and simply being able to have sex any other way than in their usual missionary position. Apparently Brax is a good boy and wants Tess to be a good girl. Tess doesn't want to be good though, she'd rather be bad.Their first day in Cancun is cut short when Tess gets kidnapped by human traffickers. She soon finds herself trapped in a small room with several other female captives. There is one distinct difference between her and the other girls: Tess isn't willing to give up her life without a fight. And fight is exactly what she does. She punches, kicks, scratches, bites, and screams bloody murder all the way to her new Master - Q's house.Tess isn't fooled by the beautiful mansion and the fact that Q, unlike the Mexican traffickers, doesn't seem all that interested in her. She wants out and she'll do whatever it takes. So she makes the decision to raise as much hell as possible.What she doesn't realize is that Q is becoming enthralled by Tess's mettle. Soon he starts acting like the Master she expected him to be upon her arrival. She wasn't prepared. She certainly hadn't anticipated the dark pleasure she feels when Q takes matters into his own hands. If Brax somehow finds her, will she want to return?This book sucked me in and I needed more. Winters has created a phenomenal story with a couple of the strongest and most intriguing characters I've met to date. If erotic romance one of your favorite genres, and you don't mind some BDSM I highly  recommend "Tears of Tess."Note: some parts of this story include disturbing situations of abuse.

$review_text.: Most everyone has a Grandpa or a Great Grandpa, who was cursed to live through interesting times, as the Chinese say
This short book is an engaging and playful summary of the author's great grandfather's life

My own grandfather probably never sculpted a bush, but he did fight in a war, marry and love his wife, and accomplish much; this book reminds me of him, as it will most people with beloved grandparents.There is not much in the way of text, the text is barely a caption for the fanciful pictures that fill the pages so this might be the kind of book to look at the little details of the artwork and giggle


It certainly doesn't take long to read all the way through, perhaps 2 minutes, so the value equation is only there if you take the time to admire the scenery.A quality children's book with delightful artwork which I was left wishing there was more.

$REVIEW.: It sounds a little crazy to say this, but this book really opened my eyes to the possibility of using one piece of furniture in multiple ways, in multiple rooms of the house. Of course I knew I could do that in theory, but since reading Good Bones, Great Pieces, I am actually looking at my furniture in a whole new light--almost as if each piece is brand new, with no history of being in &#34;that same old corner.&#34; I suddenly feel a lot more freedom to change things up and move things around. And I don't even have most of the pieces of furniture featured in this book!Overall, this book was a great read--start to finish--and I will definitely be consulting its pages again!

I only finished the book because I wanted to see where the story was going and I really was hoping I would turn a corner and suddenly develop some affection for the characters.  I really want to love the characters and be drawn into their lives and that just did not happen for me with this book.  I got this book free and I think if I had paid for it I would have been even more disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Unbelievable! Author R.K. Ryals is genius! Oh my goodness I loved this story!Where expectations and responsibilities are all we have had and it's shaped you into who you are, but leaves you with a hope of needing something more...then there's nothing left to do but leap for faith and reach for something better!That's what this story brings. Two people from two different worlds. Both fractured with past circumstances. But both holding on to something that is at the brim for release to complete their own happiness.Haven is a beautifully written female lead. She is strong willed, hopeful, she is a fighter and a dreamer. She hasn't been handed a life of luxury but she is luxuriating in life. Absolutely breath taking to read a character like this. Gives you hope.River has a powerful effect on you. He is tied down to being everything his last name holds. Everything he works for is to please the family name. What you find with him is someone who has had to be strong for so long he needs someone to let him find release from the pressures. Haven may just be that person.Entwined is also a story of nature. A story of the singing river. Are the stories true? could it be about death or will some finally see truth...This novel is enchanting and full of a great cast. With flaws and all you find every character important to the story. The author paced it just so your interest continues at every turn of the page...just a beautiful tale of hope and love. Not only for family, but for a stranger that takes a risk to join you on a journey to a river. I give this book my thumbs up! Loved it!(

$review_text.: This book contains a good number of projects--86 is stretching it a bit, since many of them are multiple uses of the same pattern (ie: Change the only ears and facial embroidery, and a cat becomes a bear, or change the applique and one bag pattern becomes three separate projects). However, I don't have any problems with that, as paying close attention allows you to learn how to tweak a pattern or design yourself.So far, I've stitched the deer (what I really bought this book for! I have desperately wanted a pattern for those darling kawaii fawns I've been seeing all over etsy and blogs!!) which came out better than the solo pattern I spent almost as much on, the small kitty at the beginning of the book, and used fleece instead of felt to make those cute little bags for my daughters.  All patterns came out very nicely with little to no adaptation.A good number of the patterns are on the inside of the dust jacket, and although they overlap quite a lot, I found them very simple to trace and transfer to cardstock. There were only a few that weren't full sized; mainly the patterns for the bags (which I figured out easily enough without running to a photocopier), and the appliques for the larger bags (which I would need a photocopier for if I chose to do them). Everything else is already full size, unless you want to make a bigger version.I have moderate experience in reading and sewing to patterns, and already know all the basic stitches of hand sewing. That said, I think the patterns in the book could easily be understood by a beginning, though a bit of experience will certainly go a long way to helping you understand it. That could be said of any book though, could it not? XDOne nice thing to be said for this book is that every item that she shows you in the gallery has a pattern and instructions given--even the appliques, eyes, etc., are given in the pattern section, the only exceptions that I could find being the little mushroom and the trees in the background on the cover. Both of which would be easy enough to figure out given the techniques explained in the book.All in all, I'm very pleased with this book--I really can see myself making most of the items in it--just be prepared for all the items to be basically like what is shown on the cover!  The patterns for felt flowers to be made from scraps are intriguing--I bought this book early spring and I can certainly see many of my friends getting pretty little felt flower displays as hostess gifts over the next little while! I like giving seasonal handmade stuff, since the recipient doesn't feel the need to keep it on display forever! LOLNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a whole host of little felties and sock creatures to make--the hazards of ordering a good number of craft books in one go! XD

$review_text.: I read this book after hearing it recommended on NPR.  It was hard when coming to the book to disassociate Kauffmann's incredible and horrible experiences as a hostage in Beirut from my appreciation of the book itself.  Every piece of ennui, every flat, sad phrase seemed to take me back to the chair in which he was blindfolded and chained for three years.  I think it would be impossible not to attribute some significance to his past, but it is something Kauffmann fails to address in any way at all.  (It is mentioned only in passing on the book jacket.)What we find instead is a troubled man coming to terms with a troubled place.  But here his insights aren't very deep.  He seems utterly amazed that this place, so far away from anywhere, is still France.  This is an glimpse into the Gallic mindset that perhaps only an Englishman could appreciate.  He also feels very impressed with being there.  He seems to pinch himself a lot.  Wow, I am in Kerguelen!  Apparently, it's windy.His attempts at a back story -- his attempts to show why this place has haunted him for so long are unconvincing and rather dull.  He includes what history he could find about the place, but, sadly, there isn't so much.  For an example of this type of writing at its finest, I would check out Bruce Chatwin's In Patagonia and Kevin Patterson's excellent The Water Inbetween.  Both of these books come from similar emotional places, but engage the reader in more interesting and varied ways.

She gives you the lingo, the expressions, the plants, the personalities--it's really immersive. Very much an &#34;I felt like I was there&#34; experience.

$REVIEW.: The PlotJulie is unhappy that her parents are making her move from her life in Chicago to her father's home town in Michigan's Upper Penninsula. She doesn't want to leave her best friend Marie-Do, and she knows that the lack of swim team at her new school will kill her chances for swimming in college. But when her mother explains that her father is dying, Julie has no choice but to give into her family's desires. But she only has to spend a few days in the UP before she realizes that something is seriously wrong with this town. The other children in school are Children-of-the-Corn creepy, and she has no way to make contact with the outside world. As time wears on, Julie realizes that her parents may have brought her here for a far more nefarious purpose than she ever could have imagined.The GoodThe Devil You Know was more horror-y than what I usually read, and it did that effectively. At every turn, I didn't know what was going to happen to our characters, whether they were going to escape or fall victim to the clutches of the evil. The set-up was quite scary. Julie's parents were in total control of her life and were able to block off every method of communication with the outside world, including any physical way to leave the town.The BadI had a hard time finding The Devil You Know as plausible all the time. The story definitely has an atypical setup: parents plotting to kill their children. I wanted there to be a more complicated dynamic going on, like where one of the evil people has a more complex emotion, like regret over killing own children. But it was pretty much straight up horror without the emotional complexity. Which is fine for the genre, I guess.I also found the book to move rather more slowly than I would have liked, especially at the beginning. We go through every day in Julie's life from September 29th until the sacrifice on October 31st, and important stuff doesn't happen on all of those days. And then when we get toward the end, she often does very little on these urgent days. And I keep wanting to know why she isn't spending more time trying to GET THE HELL OUT OF DODGE. But, then, I guess it's not horror if the heroine doesn't spend some time running up the staircase when she should be heading out the front door.The RomanceJulie meets Paul, the only other normal person in town, and they fell in love in a time frame that can only be described as way too quickly. I do think it was actually more than three days before they were declaring their love for each other, but that doesn't mean I actually bought it. I did spend much of the book wondering if Paul was going to secretly turn out to be evil, which added a level of interest to the story. And I'm not telling you whether he is or is not. You will just have to read it. Bwahaha.Will I read more?The Devil You Know is, I am pretty sure, a stand-alone novel. But I honestly don't see myself picking up anything more by this author, at least partly because I'm not a huge fan of horror.

$REVIEW.: From the blurb I figured the book is very much what I like to read, so I had high expectations for it. The beginning of the book was promising, but it watered down from there. Around the middle I got the impression the author was a bit lost and didn't exactly know where she was going with it -- to be short, it was rather boring without any real context or connection to the actual plot. In some ways the middle seems to be part of a fully different book than the beginning and end.Pine got the story back together for the grand finale, and in my opinion she did a good job with it. I do think the blurb promised a bit more than what the book delivered. Though it is a series, so we might get more of that on the latter books. However the main event on this book wasn't getting his brother back.Devi was a likable enough lead character and Pine managed to make her a believable hot and cold teenager without being too annoying. Kim -- Devi's best friend -- brought a little spice, but she was kind of forgotten after the first half of the book. Oz is a strange but nice guy demon who seems to do a lot of things for the sake of the plot, rather than for his personality.The premises was an interesting take on the Christian mythology -- devout believers be aware, that it might be offensive to you. I wish some things would have been explained a bit more in the book, since for example I had to go and google the difference between spirit and soul to fully understand what was going on.I think the story has a lot of potential, but it's quite clear it wasn't ready for publishing and still requires editing. For example there's a scene where Devi and Oz goes to have some pancakes and after they've ordered their delicious carb bombs, they are suddenly back in Oz's car driving to the pancake place.To be honest I thought quite often, that I'd just mark this book as DNF, but I stuck through it. I think the author has talent, but this novel could've used a lot more work.

$review_text.: This is a gorgeous collection of images from some of the leading landscape photographers in the world today, including some well-known photos by the late Galen Rowell.  While no book can ever be a substitute for the actual experience of viewing the original prints, as I learned from a few visits to Galen and Barbara Rowell's gallery in Bishop, California, the reproduction quality here is quite high.  And some of these images are simply stunning!  One of my personal favorites is an image of desert geysers by Michael Fatali where the sun and moon are both present.  What an unusual photograph!  It was so refreshing to realize that I had never seen most of these photographs before, despite my frequent perusal of photo books.  In keeping with the tradition of landscape photography, most of the work here was done in 4x5 or 8x10 format, though there is also a smattering of medium, panoramic, and 35mm formats.  This is definitely not a how-to instructional book, but does serve as an excellent source of inspiration for any budding nature photographer.  Sure, there are a few omissions of great landscape photographers today, most notably the large format work of Carr Clifton.  Nonetheless, this is an outstanding overview of the best landscape work being done today, a small percentage of which is still in black-and-white.  As anyone familiar with this art form already knows, the most important quality of a good nature photographer is an obsessional love of the land itself, a love at least strong enough to compel a person to drag themselves out of bed at the most unspeakable hours to be in a position to catch the first rays of dawn.  It is interesting and instructive to read the various stories accompanying the photographs that describe the incredible lengths to which these photographers will go in an effort to capture their finest images. Their sheer persistence, patience, and resolve in trekking untold miles to a predetermined location, often in cold and inclement weather with several pounds of large format gear strapped to their backs, can make a rank amateur like myself feel shamefully lazy.  If you think you may have an interest in landscape photography and the images in this book do not inspire you to hit the hiking trail,  perhaps you should consider selling your camera on e-bay.

 I laughed.Through her demonstrated love for her heroine, Leah Gabriella Allen, the author showed her heart and compassion for women who endure the harshness of living in abuse
 She helped her fight her way out and gave her the determination to live and love again


 Through Leah Gabreilla, she showed warning signs of abuse

 Shayna, Gina, Nurse Mona, LuLu and Crowley noticed the signs that others where to busy to see and offered her love, acceptance and a chance to start over again.What courage it takes to write such a compelling book

 For those who are in abusive situations the author offers courage, love and acceptance
 For those who live among those with signs of abusive relationships she challenges to stand up and make a difference.I will definitely be waiting to read more from T.I
Lowe!

$review_text.: Couldn't really give it less than five stars.This and the other novella in Marks POV, The Master Undone, have made me love Mark.This short read is a perfect look into what happens in the US while Chris and Sara are in Paris. It also gives you something to read while wating for No in Between. Leaves you wanting for more even without Lisa Renee Jones' trademark cliffhanger. Will be very interesting to see where Mark and Crystal end up.I suggest you read the previous books in the series first as well as Master Undone. Because this one will spoil some of the fun if you read it first ;)
$SUMMARY.: Like being inside Mark's head

$review_text.: Angel in the WatersWritten by: Regina DomanIllustrated by: Ben HatkePublished by: Sophia Institute PressThis book shares the story of a baby in his/her mother's womb. The baby is accompanied by an angel who is there with the baby answering questions and offering comfort. This book is published by a Catholic publishing company, and I am not Catholic, but I found the book appropriate and beautiful to me just the same.I chose to review this book simply because I love children's books, but a couple of days before I received this book I found out that my sister is expecting my third niece or nephew, now this book suddenly has much more meaning for me!Who the book is for:This book is nice for babies and toddlers and young children, this would especially be nice for those who are about to become older siblings for the first time. This book would also make a great gift for parents who are expecting.What I liked:I think that the story is beautiful. The pictures are cute. This book is simple, and yet long enough to be a good read.This book is written in first person and therefore does not ever share a certain gender that the baby is supposed to be, therefore this book can be shared with baby boys or girls.What I didn't like:I don't especially like the binding of this book, but that is a small problem. While I prefer board books for little ones, paperback books have their place as well.I will admit I thought I was going to like the fact that an angel is so involved in the story, but I actually found that adds to the beauty of the story.My conclusion:This is a beautiful book that is very special to me. I will either cherish this book myself or pass it along to my sister to cherish in this special time in her life.I received this book free to review from Sophia Institute Press. The opinions expressed in this review are my true thoughts and feeling regarding this book. I am disclosing this information in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255.

$review_text.: I received an ARC of this book in exchange for this honest review.I loved how all 4 books took place in New Orleans & Madame Ysabeau makes an appearance in all of them!1. Share Me by Julia Kent- I LOVE Julia Kent's writing & she certainly didn't disappoint me. She always makes you fall for her characters & want more. And that's what she did with Miki, Emma, & David. It was a hot, sexy book filled with fun friends & great sayings: What happens in New Orleans, stays in New Orleans!2. Shake Me by Sara Fawkes- is about a Cassidy, who's a good girl & resident bad boy Travis. Cassidy thinks she has her life all figured out until a road trip to New Orelans makes her see the light. Go along on this ride with the virgin Cassidy & Travis & you'll see how unbelievable HOT these two are for each other.3. Show Me by Cathryn Fox- Eva's on Spring Break with her friends. She's a nerdy physics student who gets her brothers best friend, Luke to help her become hot & land a guy. In the process Eva & Luke fall for each other. Bring on the SEX!4. Shock Me by Lauren Hawkeye- The sex scenes in this book are HOT! Callie thinks she's in love either best friend Ryder, but at a masked party she meets Liam.  And the sparks fly between them. You'll have to read this to find out what the story is with Callie, Ryder, & Liam!!

$REVIEW.: Let me start this review off by pointing out the obvious: Holy freakin' moly the cover is amazing! I more than love it!BENEATH THE SURFACE had me from the overview and  I couldn't put it down! M.A. Stacie grabbed my attention and refused to let go. From the outside Kyran Reese is all alpha male but once you continue reading and get to see glimpses of the true him we find that he's more than that. Dale Porter is a whirlwind of character. The girl has spunk and all that sassiness made her even more relatable to me. Their chemistry was like a drug. I seriously couldn't get enough of them.Every character within BENEATH THE SURFACE was well-developed and readers can't help but be connected to them. The story-line was solid and I was left wanting more from M.A. Stacie. The heat between Kyran and Dale was magnificent and I was left scorched.I hope to read many more books by M.A. Stacie.

$REVIEW.: 'Metal hurtled out of control. Drivers slammed their brakes to the floorboard. Vehicles skidded in all directions. An ear-piercing scream went out, laying down an eerie quiet...'Seventeen year old Darcie and nineteen year old Ian lost their parents in an auto accident caused by the combustion of a tire. Ian was now head of the family. He alone, had to make all of the decisions regarding the future of his sister Darcie. Three weeks after the funeral Ian made his first major decision which was to move Darcie to their mountain home located in the North Carolina mountains just outside of Franklin. This decision was made due to a secret that Darcie carried around with her. A secret that she had no idea her brother knew. A secret that would change the lives of everyone around her, including her own.As I read The Long Night Moon, I could feel the compassion and closeness between Darcie and Ian. I could also feel the spirit of 17 year old Darcie and her lack of respect for others. She was a person who had one desire in life. That desire was to have fun no matter what the long run cost may be. She was selfish, self centered and very much on the wild side when it came to relationships with the opposite sex. She was a character that, as I read about her "adventures," I really didn't like. And when she met Wa'si, a Cherokee Indian whose family had lived in the NC mountains for ages, I formed an even stronger dislike for her. Wa'si lost his wife and child after her car went over a mountain. His emotions were still raw and Darcie's plans for him were nothing short of more pain.As I read deeper into The Long Night Moon, I began to understand Darcie a little better. I followed her as she grew into a caring, mature young woman. And I followed her as she was faced with even more tragedy which again made her into an even stronger woman.The Long Night Moon has everything needed to make a great read. It's filled with love, pain, sorrow, happiness, tragedy and a shaky ending. It's also filled with places and sites in the NC mountains that I didn't know existed. I've lived here for 15 years now without seeing that much of the state. After reading The Long Night Moon, I plan on changing that. To me, this was a very enjoyable book.

$review_text.: I absolutely loved the first book in this series Flesh. So needless to say I was highly anticipating the sequel. Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed.My main complaints are about the h and pretty much the first 50% of the book. She was awful. Whiny, immature and repeatedly putting herself and in turn the H, in danger. She was almost TSTL on several occasions. It was frustrating to say the least. Now the H was no peach and the circumstances of which they were together were less than ideal but come on, chicky! Most of her actions were along the lines of cutting your nose off to spite your face.The H was actually quite endearing. Once you get past the kidnapping and keeping her chained and such, that is. He did his best to make her happy and take of her. And in his caveman way it was all well intentioned.The other problem for me was the lack of action in the first half. It got kind of boring and only made the h's idiocy all the more obvious.Now, the second half was great. Definitely had that &#34;Flesh&#34; feel to it. The h's character changes drastically in the second half of the book, which is a good thing, but also a complete 180 that came across as unbelievable. There are some dramatic events towards the end that were exciting to read and it was awesome to get a chance to revisit the characters from Flesh.All in all, it was just okay. If you enjoyed Flesh I'd definitely recommend this one and I will still be reading any more she writes in the future.

$review_text.: I kept reading this book until the end because I wanted to know what happened, but the writing was not great

 I think the author was too wordy, language was too over-simplified and the descriptions on what the characters were thinking all the time just came off cheesy to me


 The book cover and title were deceiving since the story did not take place in Scotland or a castle, although the Scottish elements were there in the town they were living in


 I think this author has potential and if she reads this review I hope it may be helpful for her next book.

 The author ran with some ideas that were in the back of readers' minds while reading the series (also with some that didn't cross your mind at all)
 Best part: the section on Panem names; part that could use a little work: maps at the beginning

 The author stays away from elitist wordiness, which makes it more enjoyable for a larger audience.Improved maps or not, this is a fun must-read for anyone who loved the trilogy.GoodReads-FirstReads-Giveaway[book:The Panem Companion|13555385]

$REVIEW.: When I was a 14 yr old kid in the Bronx, I was MUCH more interested in Baseball than in Politics (LOL .. the more things change, the more they remain the same for me!!) BUT.....when Krushchev visited the US, I could not hear or see enough about his visit -- and of course, what kid would not delight in seeing an ADULT bang his shoe on his desk -- way to go, K!For the past 49 years, I really didn't think much about his visit, with the exception of the shoe thing, of course, but when I heard of this book, my interest prompted me to check it out of the library and read it, and......I could not put this book down.Nikita Krushchev, back then, with his rotund jovial face, body to match, and very bald pate, reminded me of those Herblock Cartoons of Mr Atom Bomb -- check out the facial expressions when you G--gle the Herblock cartoons -- and you will know what I mean. And yes, K was the walking, talking embodiment of that scarey possibility, those many years ago.Carlson's book, so carefully crafted, so painfully researched, so chronologically and anecdotally precise, tells the reader a world about this man, who so many here in the US thought to be inferior, unlearned, pedantic...Well, not so.Krushchev was brilliant -- the ruler of his country, visiting here on US soil -- a master of a quick retort, a man who could growl and set the whole world on edge with his temper and threats, but who, despite his of-times cold and calculated demeanor, showed another side --  he was also the man who loved to visit with Ike's children and grandchildren, the man who loved Disneyland (unrequited love at that), and the master of a fine spur-of-the-moment joke. He held his own against Ike, Nixon and Lodge and anyone else who tried to one-up him.And although the world heaved a huge sigh of releif when his plane going back to Russia cleared those tree tops, his visit, his presence, not only broke through alot of that "ice" covering the Cold War, but he left an indelible impression on us -- witness the voracity with which this book is being read today.I recommend this book for budding historians, for budded historians, and anyone who wants to remember everything else that happened above and beyond the "shoe incident", when Krushchev visited the US way back then.

$REVIEW.: Hands down, this is the best young adult book I've read all year.Oh my goodness I loved this book! It is this crazy mix of history, suspense, espionage, and mystery.  I really didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it really surprised me.Yulia is a mind-reader. She can see memories and thoughts with a touch. She gets captured by the KGB and forced into working for them. The whole premise surrounding the book is unlike anything I've ever read. It's a gripping, heart pounding thriller. I could seriously gush about it forever. The characters are all really interesting, and I love their individual strengths and weaknesses. All of them are flawed in one way or another and they each have their own struggles they have to deal with.Other than the dystopian-like violence aspect and a bit of innuendo, the book is clean. It's so difficult to find clean young adult books that are also well written and engaging. I really enjoyed every page of this book and I can't wait to see where the story is going next. Even though it ends with the possibility of more books, the story is mostly complete and resolved, which makes me very happy.

$review_text.: Our earth, zoom ahead a couple hundred years, subtract God and you'll have the basic idea of where this enchanting story begins. Science and Technology is very advanced; medical woes easily repaired, diseases all but eradicated, starvation and poverty controlled and corrected--what's not to like? Well, hardly anyone turns to God anymore. Those who hold on to any vestiges of faith are sequestered off by themselves, outcasts because of their intolerant religion. But this issue is merely a side-story in one of the grandest Future-World Tales I have ever read.Science can only take you as far as your earth and nearby solar system can provide resources for your burgeoning population. The solution? Travel through a newly discovered trans-dimensional portal in space in a special spacecraft designed for the purpose and seek out new resource planets. A Horse-Racing Enthusiast best friend, a top-notch female mathematician, a capable but hotshot astro pilot, and a Westie Terrier named Little Bit take us on an unforgettable journey through space, time and dimension.To Eden.A Biblical Eden where Adam and Eve didn't eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, Cain never killed Abel, and their families grew many generations without staining their perfect world. Everything was perfect, that is, until after-the-fall earthling Major David Saunders crash lands on their Eden planet and changes things up by his presence alone.Author David Gelber spins us a yarn that will wow as well as entertain. His world-building skills are out of this galaxy, expertly explaining the conditions of this future world, detailed histories that got them where they are today, military and civilian governmental proceedings, character medical issues, and space-flight complexities--all expressed to the reader with flair and aplomb. I was spellbound and unable to poo-poo any of his futuristic predictions of what we might be like then.But more than all of this, I love the book because of the last few chapters...I love the resolution. I won't give it away, but I guarantee if you enjoy books in this genre, you will love it too.Nicely done, David! Bravo and a million thumbs up!Ellen C MazeAuthor

$REVIEW.: I've long been a fan of this author's work, but Esther the Queen just jumped to the top stop when it comes to Moore's writing. This story was absolutely beautiful. I've always loved the biblical account of Esther, and so I was excited to read a fictitious retelling of it.I was immediately drawn in by the rich setting and likable characters. I actually reread the Book of Esther in the Bible while reading the first few chapters of this novel, and I'm very impressed with how hard Moore worked to keep the story as close to the biblical account as possible. I also was impressed with how likable she was able to make the king, and how realistic his motives seemed. Reading the biblical account, the king comes off as easily swayed by others and not very strong. However, he is a very strong character in the novel. He's likable, and I believed everything he did.I also loved Esther. She was so strong, so brave, and so kind. Moore managed to show Esther's incredible faith in God without having her come off as a pious, hard-to-relate-to character. I was fascinated with the love story Moore created between Esther and the king, and was rooting for them as a couple from the very beginning.Moore did a fantastic job at taking the biblical framework, which is pretty vague at times, and breathing life into it in novel form. I was impressed with her research and her attention to detail the whole way through. She stuck with the basics, but added so much more. I especially loved the story's heart. Even though this is a fictitious account, it felt like a very believable way events could have actually unfolded. I felt for Esther's plight, and even though I knew how the story ended, I was rushing through those last few chapters with my heart in my throat. A job well done!

It touched me so much it is hard to express.The hate and feud between the Irish and the red road was hard to read about and see. So many different groups at different times have this hate in history. Even today in groups of opposites. Made me look at myself and realize that I have felt a little of it at times. We need to stop hating differences where ever they lie and make peace.The characters seem so real to me. I had lost hope for some of them to ever get along. I loved the ending.Kate Macauley had such a hard life and so much suffering. She still loved and cared for those around her. She made a big difference in small and big ways. By giving, sharing, hard work and her music.Tavish made people laugh and lightened their loads. He also helped those he could when he could.Joseph used his money to help and to try and keep the peace in town. He is a loving and caring father. He understood people's pride. He tried to be seen fair to all and not pick a side.Their was life lessons for me with all the characters. Some I want to be more like and others to be opposite of them.The plot the town was divided on two sides. The Irish had to live on one side of the river. Everyone else on the red road. Even the church was divided. So much hate and they were passing it down to the children. Their was even differences in the price of food and supplies. The Hate was growing all the time.Katie liked both Tavish and her former boss Joseph. She felt torn between two good men.The setting for this book is Hope Springs, 1870 Wyoming Territory. Small town setting.I was given this book by Netgalley and Shadow Mountain Publishing for purpose of honestly reviewing it.

$review_text.: This book is very creative, and leaves alot to the imagination. But seems to drag on and on and on, and jumps around alot - this maybe due to it being written for 9 year olds to help hold thier attention? There was just so much going on at once that the main character needs to do and she does fit in well, is lost on island where things are way different then home - and she finds herself dealing with one issue after another, after another and always in trouble, and there seems like there is no one to really help her out she is just tossed into the mix and left to surive on her own. This is an okay book - worth reading if you dont have much else to do - I am just the type who needs to finish a book and normally it only takes me 1 week to read but we are on week 2 now...

$REVIEW.: I don't necessarily dislike this series but there are some very annoying elements.  First, it is just a mix of other stories from other authors.  But that is not the biggest problem.  The story is disjointed is the problem.  There is heavy use of Earth/human language, terms and concepts (borrowing from Battlestar Galactica)but without the underlying explanation from that story.  Also the creation of an AI (character?) as somehow separate from 'the computer?'  The second problem is the editing, or rather the lack of.  I can overlook a lot, but there are simply too many very basic errors which at times makes the text confusing.  (An example is "were" where the author intended "we're.")The third problem I have, and the one which may keep me from continuing the series, is the characters.  Great authors create great characters, and so on down the list.  Unfortunately this author is down on that list.  The author attempts to add depth to the characters but instead diminishes their intelligence and makes them into whiners. As is all too common writers tell the reader how great and qualified the characters are, only to have the characters completely fail to live up to the stated qualifications.With better editing, more research and better characters this series could be quite good.

$REVIEW.: "Guardian of the Mountain" is a stand alone short story  by David Dalglish. This Kindle only e-edition is a 201 Kb download.*SPOILER*Rumors of gold, and lots of it, have lured two down-on-their-luck adventurers to seek their fortune. A strange elf warns them to turn back while they can, but the gold, unfortunately, is just too easily available. As night approaches, with pockets stuffed with the yellow metal, they decide that maybe they should leave...but by now it's a little too late.*END SPOILER*Author David Dalglish has written a spine chilling short story...a late night campfire ghost tale if there ever was one. Well written and superbly paced, the story slowly unfolds giving the readers an increasing sense of impending doom as our heroes blunder ever deeper into a situation over which they have no control.Dalglish appears to have a gift with these short stories*. It must be difficult to pace developments within a story of this type without dragging it out and thus lulling the reader to sleep, or by being so quick to the points that it prevents the tale from developing the necessary atmosphere and tension. Especially important in a ghost story such as this. But no worry here, the story proceeds at just the right speed, resulting in a sense of foreboding and terror that will have the hair on the back of your neck standing up.Conclusion:A creepy, scary tale...well done. 5 StarsRay Nicholson*David Dalglish has written other short pieces in the anthology to which he contributed and also edited, called "A Land of Ash" (also recommended if you like Dalglish's style).

$review_text.: Finn McDuff, Edinburgh chef extraordinaire, is at once charming and exasperating. After three wives divorce him, Finn begins to wonder if the hours and energy devoted to winning accolades have been worth the sacrifice of a personal life. When he is awarded a coveted third star, two young journalists compete for stories about the handsome, charismatic chef as a way to boost their paper's circulation and their own reputations. Horton describes the ongoing race for the story between Raine and Ross in a way that brought a smile of recognition to this former reporter's face.Humor, pathos and romance bring the reader into Finn's world and what a world it is!

$REVIEW.: Utterly charming, as a re-told Cinderella should be.  The heroine is a smart mouthed cyborg teen, with brilliant mechanical skills.  The prince is her equal in the sarcasm department (and this makes him utterly charming &#8212;no pun intended) though he is also a pragmatic and patriotic young man.  The setting is China after WWIV, in a plague ridden world.Though the story's villain is the typical heartless step mother, I found her cruelty to be more hateful then usual.  There are, however, other people in the story who are equally fearful &#8212;perhaps even more so.  Happily, there's a comic side-kick in this book who is one of the most lovable characters I've yet to see.To those who complained that Cinder's &#34;Jane Doe&#34; identity was easy to guess, I think there was more than just one possibility amidst multiple rumors.  Moreover, I'd like to remind those reviewers (in a &#34;DUH&#34; sort of way) that it's not necessarily a flaw in this story, considering that we're reading a beloved fairy tale, which has been told in almost the same way for hundreds of years.  So how is such a story diminished when we're allowed to latch on to some familiar characters or plot devices? That should be a tribute to the author's skill.So, to these short sighted party poopers, I'd suggest chilling out with certain expectations: This is a fairy tale! It's not the Hunger Games. We can be annoyed when a book is badly edited or too short; we can be disgusted when it's a weak &#34;Twilight Wanna-Be&#34;; or if the book is too superficial or the main characters are predictable or generic.  But when you know you're reading a reimagined fairy tale, take it as it is.If you acquire this book (and I highly recommend that you do) just be prepared to be delighted.  But you also can feel at ease with this author's skills in welding the parts together a bit differently, and giving us a 3-D set of characters. The final choices for these young lovers are a bit more serious than just finding the proverbial glass slipper. This is a keeper!

$REVIEW.: Wow finally an original idea! I'm a huge fan of both paranormal and urban fiction and if you add a dash of romance then I'm more than a happy bunny so it was with great interest that I read ths book. I've seen this authors Immortalis Carpe Noctem series recommended but will confess to not actually reading it yet . Just something about this storyline though really fired up my imagination and happily I was most definitely not disappointed.Set in a future where humanity is all but wiped out we meet those that have survived. The few humans that have crawled out of the mire have had to accept that vampires exist and although initially the two species had worked together unfortunately as time goes by mankind's greed and distrust has seen the vampire race subjugated . The situation has worsened and now any vampires caught are imprisoned.  Mira is a vampire and has been used in barbaric gladiator type games to entertain the humans for more years than she chooses to remember. The pathetic and sadistic humans think she's there to entertain but they are wrong as Mira is there to survive! She's killed countless of her own kind but all she wants is freedom. Whilst making an escape attempt Mira meets the city's Regent Lucian and for some strange reason captures his interest. Mira will do anything to survive but giving her trust to a human might just be a step too far. As Lucian try's to find out what makes Mira tick he comes to realise that not everything he believed about vampires is true. Humanity has believed that vampires are killers but what if it's mankind who are the true beasts?O wow this was an incredible book. I'm so pleased I read it and will admit I did not put this down until the final page. It's clearly just the beginning but the world building here is absolutely fabulous. The author doesn't rush and gives the reader time to get to know the heroine Mira and she's not the most lovable character. Mira is an arrogant hard headed woman but she's so full of heart that it's impossible not to be bowled over by her. There's no amount of pain or degradation that will see her bow down. Mira is smart and courageous and I was so routing for her .There is action within this book as well and I thought the fight scenes were very well described and it was so easy to picture the action in my head. This story is peopled by characters that we are only just getting to know and I still have so many questions. There is an end to this story but it's clearly setting up for much more to come and it's going to be an interesting journey. Mira has so much more to give as a heroine and Lucian is certainly no one dimensional character either.  Set in a post apocalyptic world Dissension is an amazing piece of fiction and for this reader far too short! Filled with action and a central character that I really cared about I cannot praise it highly enough. I will search out Ms Sadidas back catalogue and strongly urge lovers of a good story to read this book.

$review_text.: The first half of this book is actually pretty good. The characters are well drawn and the storyline is interesting. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, there are an increasing number of nightmare sequences until it is unclear what is "reality" for the characters. Apparently nothing. About halfway through, the plot breaks down, and the story loses cohesion. The ending is weak and contrived. I'm sorry I wasted time reading this.

$review_text.: Review of "Quiet Teacher: A Xenon Pearl Martial Arts Thriller" by Arthur Rosenfeld.Backstory & plot:For the six months following his fiery showdown with South Florida's Russian mob boss, celebrated neurosurgeon and secret vigilante Dr


Xenon Pearl has kept his avenging sword sheathed and his dark secret hidden
Suspended from surgical work by a boss who won't tolerate his loner style, "Zee" spends his nights pining for the wisdom of his dead teacher, and his days caring for his crippled girlfriend, victim of a horrific attack.When a multi-car accident occurs on the road in front of him, he finds himself with a scalpel in hand once more


With a renewed sense of purpose, he sets out to find out more about the teachings that made him what he is by seeking a new teacher


The journey brings him face-to-face with secrets of his childhood, lessons learned from lives already lived, and a grand wizard of a man whose clandestine biological research into animal venoms may be the key not only to his own redemption, but to winning back the lover who has spurned him.As the story unfolds, deception, revenge, hidden passions and burning hatred conspire to turn Zee's world upside down.Review:Rosenfeld's "Quiet Teacher" brings a new recurring character into the Xenon Pearl series, the man who will be the Moriarty to Zee's Holmes, and explores the meaning of love and the power of guilt in the page-turning fashion devotees of the sword-wielding brain surgeon have come to expect

I don't think that the worldview of the martial artist been more deeply plumbed than in this novel of suspense, action, romance, and betrayal, and even more interesting, rarely have more high-level, real-life martial arts secrets been revealed

 Rosenfeld is truly a master of his craft.Well done!  Five stars.

$REVIEW.: Sweeney lays out a large number of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes goings-on from his 20 or so years working on "The Tonight Show", mostly during Carson's reign.  Bear in mind that Sweeney's job centered around the show's music, performance fees, band wages, etc, so that is the sphere around which most of his stories revolve.He spends a great amount of time talking about some of his music experience outside "The Tonight Show" too, though much of it involves personnel from that show or gigs that he got directly or indirectly as a result of working for the show.Structurally, the time line of his stories jumps around quite a bit.  It is almost as if he typed these anecdotes in the order in which he remembered them, not in the order in which they happened.  He also gets a few dates wrong (e.g., the George Burns/John Denver movie "Oh God" was NOT released in 1973, as he says.  I think it was '77 or '78).This book should not serve as a definitive look behind the scenes, but rather as a "Gee whiz, what a cool job I had" diary.  Still, one can tell it was written with a lot of love and fond remembrances.Worth a peek.

$review_text.: Honestly, when reading Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, I did not know what to expect.  It did take a little while to get used to the abilities and Hollows, but nevertheless it was an entrancing read.  The second novel, I believe, did an equally good job.The novel starts where the first left off, with the peculiar children making their way to mainland England during WWII.  From the start we are set on an adventure with twists and turns at every page.  We find more peculiar children (and animals) and jump from time period to time period.  The children's main goal is to find someone to help Miss Peregrine return to her human form.  They are thrown into the middle of a war between the peculiars and the hollows.I loved the pictures that tied into the story!  They were just as unique as the last story.  I also enjoyed how the ending set-up for the third book in the series (no spoilers).  The only thing I found difficult was keeping track of who had what ability, but there is a picture character list in the front of the book to help out with any confusion.  An enthralling read for any age!

Maybe deep inside we already know the things Mike Pakulski is telling us but it's so helpful to see it spelt out and consider the solutions offered. I especially like the idea of going out into nature to get fresh ideas. What a lovely way to get creative.The only reason this helpful and inspirational book didn't get 5 stars was the use of the English language. At times the sentences did not sit right and I wonder if it has been translated from another language.Otherwise it's a great book to have as reference for those times our creativity feels blocked.

$review_text.: Angels and demons warring on an Earth decimated by Judgement Day, fighting over the few humans left? How could anyone NOT be interested in this premise?Barber doesn't disappoint with her writing, either, hooking me immediately with her description of the heroine's fall from grace. I felt like I was in this madhouse of a mind from the very beginning, feeling with this wingless angel as she struggled against the massive forces arrayed against her, attempting to salvage the few humans left.There were scenes that got me viscerally angry, and ones that made me feel like I'd been punched in the gut. In the end, the best thing I can say about this book is also the most important - it made me want to keep reading, turning page after page into the wee hours and finishing it in less than two days (which, given my schedule, is frankly amazing).I'm not a religious person, so some of the more esoteric and spiritualistic nuances of the book were lost on me, but Barber skillfully maintained my interest through the entire book. I'm also a post-apocalyptic author, so I'm much more critical with this genre than others, but I found very little to fault with "Fallen."Overall, an excellent read, well-edited (a MUST for any self-published book), and engaging. Two thumbs up from me!-Jason Kristopher

I felt like I was either in the room with them watching what was going down or a spy was going to find me and take me out! It's really a fun read and people in this story aren't always what or who you think they are. I couldn't wait to get to the next book! GREAT JOB BLAKE! Keep writing and I'll keep reading.

$REVIEW.: This is another example of why i love novella's, all the great action and story with none of the boring unnecessary bits in between.Spinoza is a private investigator who specializes in missing children's cases. A forte he discovered after his own life tragically fell apart.His latest case revolves around a missing teenager of an unknown name and origin with very odd interests. He questions the grandmothers sanity when he hears all the details but a missing child is a missing child and his heart goes out to her and the runaway Veronica.Fast past paranormal mystery that leaves you wanting more and wishing it was a full length novel. I honestly could have read another hundred pages as the details were in-depth and the story gripping.Characters were well developed and you can see there's more to come from them.Would even welcome a mini Veronica side series *hint hint*

I found the story to be engaging with various plot twists.  I enjoyed the twists that left me guessing.  The mix of suspense and romance was the perfect blend.  Books that leave me wanting to know more about the characters are always my favorite.  I look forward to the second book in this series because of that!

$review_text.: I had no expectations when I started reading this book. I read no reviews or spoilers because I wanted to approach it with an open mind. It's so hard to do these days with spoilers floating around the Internet. I was instantly intrigued by both Jason and Cara on the first page. This story takes off fast, and I was trying to wrap my head around the plot very early on.Red Flags are signs that show up in certain situations during different points in a relationship. All too often women get wrapped up in a relationship with a guy, and he turns into a manipulative control freak. Even the strongest of women feel that they can change these types of men, and they fail at the attempt.I really enjoyed Cara's character, I felt like I connected with her the most. She was real. I will admit there were times that I wanted to scream at her through my kindle, but I sympathized with her more than anything. All too many times I read books where the heroine can just turn off her feelings in a relationship, and that's not realistic to me. It's hard when you are emotionally and physically so invested in a relationship, and you are blindsided by events that take place.I did not like Jason at first, but by the end of the book he was alright. The book was well written, and I couldn't put it down. The cliffhanger at the end left me speechless. The emotional roller coaster of a story left me dizzy when I finishedI enjoyed Red Flags, and I do advise to anyone reading the book to give it a chance and finish. I will admit, this book is not for everyone. Once you get through some pretty nerve racking parts, the character's will start to develop, and you're questions will start to be answered. There will be a sequel, and I will be reading it!I give this book a 3.5-4 stars.

$review_text.: Have you ever read a book to which giving 4 stars, seems like a crime.. because you enjoyed it so much more than any other recent reads? well that's exactly what happened with me while reading and reviewing this book. "You and Me against the world" by Raymond Esposito is "The" book for any zombie apocalypse or general End of the world genre fan.Raymond Esposito is the man with many talents; In earlier days he worked many jobs. Raymond always had an inert aptitude towards Human psychology and also the crave to create mark on the world which ultimately resulted in the story of The Creepers Saga. As in with any other book in this genre; this book also come with readers discretion tag.Story starts with Dr thorne and his yet another day at hospital. No one realizes that this was the last day of `life as we knew it'. I liked the way story moved throughout the book, there were twists and turns and sudden jostling but all fueling towards central theme of the book. I also liked the way Mr. Raymond kept the core idea of zombies simple. There are few things to look forward to in this book, like How well youngsters adapt to whole scenario. The way people turn on each others.And the tension between the sexes is nice pauser between major action scenes.. Ending of the book leaves much room for next book to start which I am hoping to read soon.Although the book name is mouthful and book-cover doesn't help it any better, but as this one came in as an recommendation. I gave it a shot, and I am glad that I did. The language used is easy to read but sometimes there are jumps in-between the dialogues and on others it seemed like hurried through but overall It's one of the best book in it's genre.So on concluding notes, (although I don't want to be side taker here) I love this book second to The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman. It's a 4 out of 5 stars for me, and a deserving candidate for second read. Thanks.For more reviews of many other good reads, please visit soulkeeper720 on blogspot.

$REVIEW.: With all that is going on in the world and a definite will to try and understand the particular reality depicted in this book's blurb, I started the book with real enthusiasm and have gotten some insight from reading it: the future ofyoung people, especially young men in this reality is quite bleak and the sense of hopelessness  becomes the central theme ....in order to drive this through to us over and over, however, the author shifts from one character to another, from one plot to the next without going into a deeper layer of feelings ...I kept waiting, hoping for a fuller development of the theme rather than the shift in situations that occurs without being fully explored.  Pulling the action together in this case becomes forced ...and so stereotyped...how unfortunate!

$REVIEW.: This is a well written and very realistic romance series. I was certain I would not like this series but by the first chapter of the first book I knew I could not tear myself away. I love the style that she writes these books and then also to be a gay man to know how a femaie was able to write the feeelings a gay man would have to know in these situations. I am convinced that Marie Sexton is a gay man trapped in a woman's body.This third book is to make us see more of Zach, Ang, Jared and Mike.  Again you must realize the book series has a underlying theme that everyones version of love is different.  This book tries that up front but if you give the series a chance keep this theme in mind.  Toward the end of the book we meet Jonathon that shows up in the next book.  He is Zach's ex and attempts to get Zach back after 10 years.I recommend this book and the full series to escape to another world.

$review_text.: If you count yourself a fan of Clive Cussler, Michael Crichton, James Rollins or Jeremy Robinson and you haven't discovered Boyd Morrison yet, you really owe it to yourself to give him a shot

I discovered him through The Ark several years back and I've been a fan ever since


His previous novel 'The Roswell Conspiracy' wasn't even published here in the US (which really makes me disappointed in the publishers here) but thankfully I got a copy of the UK version and devoured it rather quickly.The hero for the bulk of Morrison's novels is Tyler Locke
Go ahead, get to know him, you'll be glad you did

His stories really accelerate quickly and usually has one foot in reality, despite how hard it may be to believe
This time the story centers around Loch Ness, and there is plenty to keep you on the edge of your seat
We start off in the United Kingdom and Charles Darwin formulates his famous 'theory' based in part by what he encounters in a mysterious body of water in Scotland

Next we move to a party being held ON the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which quickly turns into a terrorist attack which threatens much more than just a few lives
The technology featured is either real or very CLOSE to being real, which only helps the story flow in a more believable manner, despite all the supremely close-calls which Tyler and his former Pro Wrestling giant of a partner, Grant find themselves in.From one place on the globe to another, reading the Loch Ness Legacy is kind of like a cheap way to see the world without being hurt in the process


Bullets fly, unmanned drones attack and deadly science all play major roles in how the action continuously moves at the speed of a runaway Tomahawk missile

If you truly enjoy a few hours of pure escapism entertainment sprinkled with a healthy dose of adventure, mixed with a stellar plot which will hardly give you a chance to catch your breath, then this book really ought to be on your MUST READ list
The sooner you discover Boyd Morrison, the better


Trust me, I'm a reader...no really.

$review_text.: Kali D'Angelo is not normal. Well...let me rephrase. She is a normal human being every other day and something else the other days. Every other day she becomes a hunter of the preternatural, the zombies, the hellhounds. She becomes a sort of being that does not feel pain, does not get tired, heals fast and is virtually indestructible. She is at a new school and during one of her human days she discovers a girl is marked for death. She must race to save her whilst she is stuck on her human days.The first 20 pages of this book were a drag. I could barely get through them and then BOOM! All action and plot went haywire. The book started out all action and then we moved in to plot development and that is when I became invested in the book. This was a good book. Really! It was good! It was exciting, it was interesting, it was engaging. The story had a good and interesting premise: a girl that is human one day and something else the other. The preternatural is part of the daily life and some are even considered endangered species.The writing is good and engaging. The book has a lot of action and it keeps things moving. It is a super fast read (read in 2 days) and it keeps you entertained. The book does have some issues with the description of action scenes. i sometimes found myself a bit lost and having to reread certain scenes to clearly understand what happened.One problem with this book was the qualification of what Kali is....it just does not make sense...not a little bit. Either the author has to revisit our cultural definition of the term (don't want to say due to spoilers) or she she to relate it a bit more. I hope the next book in the series explores the backstory and explanation of Kali's species a lot more.Overall, a really good book. Worth a read, especially if you like some of her other books.

$REVIEW.: It's been a long time since I've read a children's book and I wasn't sure what to expect from Finding My Place. After the first few chapters I was hooked and could not put the book down. It's an excellent review of the Battle of Vicksburg, but what I loved most was the main character, Anna. To many of us history can be boring without a personal angle. This book was not boring at all.I found myself in 1863 living each dreadful event with Anna. I grieved when her mother died, worried over her father and brother fighting the war, wondered when her food would run out, hated her evil neighbor and each time she entered the cave I was right there with her. Finding My Place deals with many powerful issues - war, slavery, death, hunger, betrayal, adolescent love and faith. But Anna is a fighter and a survivor. She faces each crisis with faith and courage. When the battle is over, she's not the young girl that she was at the beginning of the book.Reading the book I was transported back in time to my childhood when many enjoyable hours were spent at the local library reading children's books. Finding My Place brought me this same kind of pleasure. It is well written, easy to read, gripping and highly recommended by me.

$review_text.: We&#8217;re back in the world of Alex Fletcher and the EMP blast/Atlantic tsunami/possible meteor strike/possible Chinese Attack on the US for a further romp through a US tearing itself apart.  If you haven&#8217;t read the initial novel in this world, The Jakarta Pandemic, and the first book in this series, The Perseid Collapse, you should &#8211; they&#8217;re good.In this world, there was a major pandemic last year in 2013 that killed millions around the world.  It&#8217;s not an End of the World sized event 99+% is killed but a pandemic like the ones we've been warned about over the past years that could cause a partial societal and economic collapse.  In the 6 years after the pandemic, the US is more internally militaristic than it is today, there are more prepper types of varying degrees around and more anti-government militia types as well.So this book opens with Alex trying to find his son and son&#8217;s girlfriend in Boston before it completely falls apart in the wake of the EMP blast and tsunami and get them back to the relative safety of their family safe house in rural Maine.  Meanwhile, Boston is being overrun by a paramilitary anti-government intent on protecting it from the government&#8217;s black helicopters.  On top of that, Alex is being reactivated in the US Marines to help make Maine a safe zone to start reclamation.  AND a Maine militia lead by a serious nutjob is intent on carving out his own post-Apocalyptic kingdom on top of the not quite corpse of the United States.I've mentioned it in my reviews for the other two books and it&#8217;s worth mentioning again, if I have a complaint, it&#8217;s that Alex as the main character is a super prepared ex-special forces marine who&#8217;s  a little too well prepared to feel real.  Now, that&#8217;s a bit par for the course for thriller protagonists; he&#8217;s not a perfect little gung-ho Mary Sue character who can kill all the bad guys without breaking a sweat.  Konkoly is a much better writer than that.  But, Alex Fletcher is a bit of superhero.While the first book in the series had a lot of character building, this one is majorly action packed.Konkoly&#8217;s secondary characters can be killed and his characters get hurt.  They suffer mental anguish.  For the most part, they are decently rounded out characters.  I only started reading this series because it has an apocalyptic bent to it, but he is a thriller writer and has been at it for some time now.  I may well start reading some of his other works, but I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the next book in this series.

Recommend this for people who enjoy a strong, smart female lead, and werewolf fans.Not as erotic or sensual as Anita Blake books, but solid plotting and a real feel of suspense and danger in the book.On the plus side there are two leads, the main lead is the female police detective who is secretly a werewolf, and her new partner, a very human male who's also a very good detective. Maybe too good as he gets close to his partner's dangerous secret.This is NOT a romance. It's mainly a mystery with some good werewolf culture woven in. A good read.

$REVIEW.: This book is about self-acceptance. Wynn a sweet six year old boy overhears his teacher say he is quiet and does not fit in with the other children. So he goes on an emotional journey to discover himself. He tries to figure out how he can fit in with the noisy rowdy classmates. Maybe, just maybe he can join in on their games and still be himself. I feel as if the story shows instead of him being traumatized by the comments made about him he analyzed his situation and overcame with flying colors.This was a touching story about learning to fit in with the world but yet remain true to yourself. The illustrations clarified the story of this child's journey into the world of his peers. I loved this story.Some of us are just introverts. I don't think it means we have some disability. It just means we are big thinkers. We can learn a lot about ourselves by interacting with others. It doesn't have to mean we loose who we are.I highly recommend this book.I rated this book 5 out of 5DisclosureI purchased a copy of this ebook for review.

$REVIEW.: This is book is a good primer for those who have questions or difficulties with "traditional" or liturgical worship.R.C. Sproul does a decent job of relating the Old Testament priestly system to worship in the New Covenant, but the book lacks focus, and fails to really tie the Old Testament to the worship of Heaven, which is where I believe is the best argument for continuity in certain elements of the Lord's Service. This seems an odd lapse, given the title of the book.Also, I wish R.C. Sproul had given more Scripture references and had made more practical application for how what we know of the Old Testament worship could possibly be applied to worship today. Of course, lacking a full eschatological focus in the book, this could be difficult to do.Nevertheless, the book should be thought provoking for those thinking about how worship ought to be done. What manner of worship is glorifying to God? R.C. Sproul has some good insights on this, based on what he does present. The book is short enough to read in a day or so, and is worth reading.

This new book of hers is refreshingly less dogmatic than her first book, &#34;Raw Family&#34; and it really shows how she has grown in knowledge and experience.Victoria's information on Omega 3s & 6s is eye-opening - I honestly didn't know the difference before! Now I know that we should try to get more 3s & less 6s (which is abundant in many more things) in our diet. Elaina Love's notes on balancing raw and cooked food for our health was really helpful also.Chad Sarno's warnings about too many 'fractionated' foods, like coconut and olive oil, agave, and maple syrup, was VERY valuable! Like him, I couldn't understand why I had high cholesterol when I was mostly eating only raw foods. Now I know to stay away from ANY oils, even so-called virgin raw ones, and instead substitute natural fat like avocado.Some of the recipes are good but many of them are heavy on walnuts and walnut oil, and flaxseed oil, which seems to me to defeat the purpose of reducing oils!All in all, a very enlightening and helpful book.

$REVIEW.: Rock Island Rock is a simple easy read that ultimately didn't satisfy me. The first half of the book was enjoyable, I liked the pacing, and the story was engaging. Something happened about half way through the book, the pacing changed until the story became a bit shot gun rapid fire. Ultimately, I didn't care much about the ending, I was just happy to finish the book. This is part two of a series of books, the first being Blues Highway Blues, (Blues Highway Blues (Crossroads Thriller)).The first half of the book is pretty good. The story line is fairly simple; it is an easy mystery to read without a lot of twists and turns or complex thought. Frankly, it is one of those wonderful beach reads, sufficiently mindless but still enjoyable. Every few chapters a new character was introduced, giving me exactly the time I needed to know the current characters and add a new one. I liked that a lot. The book felt like a movie or television series. I thought a lot of Burn Notice, except the television series has a ton of style and takes some complex turns that require paying attention. I can live with simpler language and a simpler plot line for the beach. My tastes really run toward more complex mysteries, like the Wallander series.By the second half, the book took a turn for the worse. Something happened to the pacing; several characters were added in a wide shotgun fashion. About three quarters of the way through, it felt like the author was now racing to finish his book in a certain number of pages, or meet the forty minute television episode deadline. This didn't translate to a dramatic effect; I can understand how things might happen quickly as the story climaxes. Instead it was simply an annoyance.Mysteries are a delicate story. Details are incredibly important. The author lost me twice with detail misses that were unforgivable. At one point the lead character Daniel removes a CD from a Macintosh computer. He says Daniel waited for the drawer to open, Daniel was in a hurry. Unfortunately Macintosh computers have never used tray loading CD's, they have always been slot loading. In most books this wouldn't be a big deal, and I'd be accused of being a detail-miester. In a mystery, details missed are a crime. Later in the book there is an extended road trip. I would have to go back and read very carefully, but I could swear, or it was so in my mind, the group was driving a car. Later on, the car becomes a pickup truck, and then turns back into a car again. I may be mistaken. But here's the deal, this particular crew would have never taken or used a pickup truck for whatever they were doing. They would have a car. To even think there were high speed chases with a pickup truck against a high performance car is silly at best. The author lost me in messed up details.The whole thread of rock music was forced; it didn't fit naturally in the story. The music should have been another character; instead it was somebody bludgeoning me with references to music. The made up Taco Shot group was too convoluted. The people associated with the group stretched too far and weren't well developed. It seemed like some new hanger on or another member of the band appeared out of thin air. At some point it would have been nice to read, the band members were this group of guys, here are their wives / girlfriends, and here are the managers. Instead every ten chapters somebody new came up.The music piece is odd; the author appears to be a massive music fan. He even wrote a whole set of songs for an album and a greatest hits release (included at the end of the book). The book has two lives, that of Daniel and his entourage with all the people trying to kill him; and this music thing floating around in the form of a made up group, Taco Shot. They just didn't work together.Up to the middle or three quarters of the way through this book, I really liked it a lot. I would have highly recommended it. Sadly, the last quarter and ending simply ruined the book for me. In hind sight, I feel like I wasted my time powering through to the end.The book ends with the first chapter from the next book, Pop Culture Pop. Daniel is supposed to find out who murdered Jimi Hendrix. Please tell me how that has anything to do with Pop music. Not sure I'm looking forward the next installment.

$review_text.: COVERThe Cover is sizzling hot. It sets the scene for what the book is all about! Love It!STORYLINEWhat starts out as a innocent night out for Alex with the boys to celebrate a promotion ends with falling for Cassie with the unexpected leaving without her name or number.When school starts back on base, things got a bit awkward when they realise that Cassie will be one of his students! However within the Marines, Fraternizing is forbidden. The feeling for the one person that they each want at a time you cannot have would be a overkill with frustration. You can feel both characters frustration levels skyrocket due to the evil people that surrounds them, that they fight to keep the secret and for them not be found or all Hell will definitely break loose. How can you continue on with the feeling that everybody is watching what you know you are doing is wrong against all rules?  Some back and forth throughout I thought could have been avoided however it was a story I enjoyed.HOTNESSThat electrifying want what you cant have, you certainly felt it throughout this book. The sizzling heat certainly got the feeling throughout! Who wouldn't loved a Hot Marine Sgt Swooning all over you. But also don't forget about Alex's best buddies. Yowza!OVERALLIt took me a while to settle into the book, but eventually I found its flow. From the attraction that you just want to be together but the consequences are just too great, were certainly felt from both characters POV!Ending on a Cliffhanger with this one killed me! I kind of wished it ended with a HEA. However, will still look forward to reading Book #2 when released to see what unfolds.

$REVIEW.: While the book does not break new ground in conspiracy thrillers, it did  a good job in holding this readers interest. Someone is employing an effective killer to blow up vital links in internet communication. Opposing him (or them) is a primary and a secondary pairing of male and female, one set for the West Coast and the other on the East Coast. The first is the center of the opposition, the second, frankly, seems an afterthought with relatively little character development expended on them. Some familiar tools are utilized to isolate the West Coast team from utilizing law enforcement agencies, which, of course, are countered by the ingenuity and daring of the team.One need not take a position on the likelihood of this sort of conspiracy being launched nor the potential for its success, to enjoy the unfolding of the plot and the efforts of the Good Guys to thwart the agents of the Nefarious Forces. There is relatively little of the complexity one finds in the most successful plying the genre; however, that fact makes for easier reading, suitable to travel and other light reading situations. Those who desire heavier fare should turn to the heavyweights readily available for kindle reading (at a less desirable cost).

$review_text.: Suzannah's Gold is a wonderful book. For me it was a great find. I enjoyed walking through life with Suzannah in the early days of Australia's settlement. The story's historical background added interest to the fast paced action. So many unexpected events, tumultuous relationships and gut-wrenching dramas! Yet like a golden thread her faith held her to the last page. This book doesn't follow the expected trend, nor does it gloss over life's problems. It gives a realistic portrayal of the struggle of faith while exposing the deep depravity of mankind.I would liken this saga to Francine Rivers books with the freshness of Australia's early history.I really enjoyed 'Mary's Guardian' and [ASIN:1921633328 Charlotte's Angel], also written by Carol, but this book surpasses them both!

$REVIEW.: I've inherited my hubby's D80 & I remember buying this laminated reference for his camera bag. I'm only on the first page but already I find the info confusing. The info given doesn't match up to the box of info it refers to.For instance, under &#34;White Balance, ISO, Image size/quality (the purple page), the box lists settings of Auto, Incandescent, Flourescent, Sunlight, Flash, Cloudy, Shade, Kelvin & PRE (preset).Yet, the examples given of photos of a parrot using 4 different settings speaks of 2 settings that I could not match to the setting in the box. (one was &#34;setting for daylight&#34;, the other was &#34;tungsten setting&#34;) Neither of those is mentioned in the box.I am a beginner, but have used this camera for over a year. I now want to learn more about the settings when not using the &#34;auto&#34; settings, so I need to read the books and refer to this nice little fold-out card of info.I just wish authors/publishers would proof-read by giving the materials to someone who doesn't already know everything so that person can find the obvious errors to edit. This one is a no-brainer. I should not have to go outside of the card to figure out what tungsten is, and the &#34;daylight setting&#34; used for one parrot shot is likely the &#34;sunlight&#34; setting&#8230;but it could also be the &#34;auto setting&#34;.Yes, I'm nit-picking, but I just find that even fiction & non-fiction books are loaded with errors that proof-reading is missing..I will update as I continue reading, but hope these isn't more to report..

$review_text.: So far, I think as an overall contribution to the Dark Horse Clone Wars series, this has been the weakest book


 I really enjoyed everything but Yoda: The Best Blades at the end.The first 3/4 helped advance the storyline with Obi Wan and Alpha, but then the entire story-telling experience changes with Yoda: The Best Blades
 The style and tone of the story is dis-similar to anything so far in the series


 There were basic elements that helped define Yoda and his support for the war, but I really couldn't get past the Japanese drawing

 If I wanted that style of storytelling, I would've bought The Best Blades as a stand-alone.Of course, whether I loved the book or not, it is book 5 of 9, and the story must continue

 You can't leave out such big plot points as introduced here.

It is the first in the "A Hickory Ridge Romance". It is written with depth and details.The plot is intriguing,easy to follow,exciting with the charm of the old South.The characters are enchanting,charming,engaging and will capture your heart. It has romance,faith,healing,the struggles of the aftermath of  the Civil War,trust,community,dreams,forgiveness,painful past,betrayal,the charm of a small community,misunderstandings, fear,hate,h,and finding love after the sacrifices of war. Ada Wentworth,is penniless,and has lost that she holds dear.She must find a job and travels to Hickory RidgeTennessee from Boston to become a Lady's companion. Ada stills has dreams of her own. Wyatt Caldwell,local lumber mill owner,kind,ex-war veteran,a,his Aunt Lillian is who Ada is  a Lady's companion,and he believes Ada coming to town was Providence,but he has dreams of his own. While Ada and Wyatt fights their attraction,they must learn to trust each other and let go of the past. This is my first time reading this author but it will not be my last. While this is a Christian historical fiction is not "preachy".It does have the underline message of faith,hope and God's plan for our life. A must read for any historical,romance,inspirational,post civil war,and Old South readers. A keeper. This book was received for review from the author.Details can be found at Thomas Nelson and My Book Addiction and More.

$REVIEW.: This is the third piece of writing from Francis Hagan that I have read. If for nothing but the knowledge and research that goes into his late Roman Empire books, I would give him four stars.As has been said in other places, sometimes the level of detail gets in the way of the story but, in my opinion, it is worth the effort.  The late Empire is a much neglected area except for the immediate geographic area of Constantinople and I applaud Mr. Hagan for shining much needed light on the subject.As for suggestions, I would like to see a glossary of terms and expressions at the end of his books, especially with respect to the various ranks and duties to which he refers.The Janus Eagle: Book One - The Shattered Frontier

$review_text.: This author was recommended to me and I took a chance on this book and I'm not sorry
 What starts out as a classic alien abduction for the purpose of mating/furthering the species/marriage becomes pleasantly twisted by the author's attention to backstory
 The previous reviewer's complaint about love at first after-sex-experience is misplaced because the author clearly explains that although Aria is unhappy at being taken from her life on earth, she can't ignore the feelings building in her that started back before her abduction with erotic dreams


 So she already felt there was someone for her, only one person that would do and she finds that person in the king's brother, Tai
I  won't spoil the book, but it's great.It is novella length, but at a low price and well written, I didn't mind at all

 Except that like any book I enjoy immensely I wanted it to go on forever
 The pictures painted by the author of the ship, the alien species, and their mating habits are unique and interesting and I could easily see this book becoming a full length novel or several more novellas in a series
 Since it's my first book of Ms


Carew's, I'm going to dive right back to her author's page and download some more.Short and hot, overall a great sci-fi, alien abduction erotic romance with excellent timing
 Well done!

$REVIEW.: I'm always terrified of second books. There's this sense of uncertainty, wondering if it will measure up to the first book that got you hooked. Well, um, let me just say that A Million Suns has that same breathless suspense that Across the Universe has. From start to finish, I was totally absorbed in Amy and Elder's story. Their voices resonate so much that I felt entirely wrapped up in what happened to both of them.Now Elder is in control of the ship, attempting to rule fairly without controlling people with Phydus in their water and without other dictatorial measures taken by Eldest. However, with their increased self-awareness, the people of the ship start hungering for revolution against the whole Eldest system, and they are beyond unwilling to accept a sixteen-year-old as their leader. When someone starts killing, leaving messages that say "Follow the leader," everyone assumes that Elder is behind it all, secretly as dictatorial as Eldest. Things become dangerous for him and for Amy, the freak who doesn't look like everyone else.Furthermore, Orion has left video clues for Amy, letting her know why he acted the way he did before he was frozen. Although Amy hates him for the intended murder of her frozen parents, Amy and Elder follow the clues to the most shocking revelation yet. I'm going to come out and proudly say that I called it from the last book. I don't know why, but I had already guessed it. This makes me feel proud, especially since I hardly ever do that! However, although I knew what was up, I had no idea why... And that is the most disturbing part of what Amy and Elder uncover.I still love the bloody pants off Elder, too. He has sacrificed everything he has believed in to do the right thing, only to be unappreciated and challenged and threatened. Glimpses into his childhood also make me want to just give him a hug. Living with Eldest was no picnic, but he managed it with strength. His feelings for Amy mixed with his uncertainty are a powerful combination.This book is just so amazing, I considered immediately re-reading it when I finished. It's part of a series that cannot be missed.

$review_text.: I didn't particularly like this but was impressed with Gloeckner's multi-modal storytelling.  Other than that it's rocking a sort of Heather Lewis "House Rules" "how bad will it get and how nasty can I tell it" vibe. Wierdly and sordidly shallow content. I know I am probably expected to feel something for this narrator, but I don't.  I hardly look at the book anymore.  Now, Jessica Abel's "La Perdida", I do pick up from time to time.

$review_text.: Highly readable and informative Waffen SS memoir that deserves to be read and thought over.  One man's journey through life and consequence of being born a German in 1923.  We all have Fatherlands that we are a product of and are molded by.  This is only the story of one German soldier and there were 70 million different stories wrought from a WW1 defeated, post WW1 depression-ridden Germany of anguish and Bolshevik/Right Wing terror and civil war but it is a story from Erwin Bartmann's heart and soul and honor.  A vivid personal memoir that pulls few punches.  He remained a Waffen SS soldier until the day his long life ended.  This defined him right or wrong.  Worth the read, most definitely.
$SUMMARY.: An amazing memoir!!

 The book is an uplifting read
 If you are in need off a good laugh definitely get yourself this book


 Pull it out when you're down in the dumps
 It will bring you back up


The book is very well written and has a variety  of short stories that go into the different relationships of one man
 You will certainly remember the times you have been in the same situation as the story you're reading

 I know I have

 Anywhere from finding the person you'll spend your life with, to raising a family

 We all know what predicaments a family can get into


 This book is screenwriter Marc Prey's hilarious and wonderful debut


 The book grabs your attention once you look at the cover

 When you open the book to the first page, you will be hooked

 You might as well figure that this book will be read in one sitting and then put on the shelf
 You will want to keep this one so you can pull it out when you need a smile or laugh


 I would suggest this book to anyone, not just moms and dads


 You will find when you're done that you may have actually learned a thing or two about yourself


There was one chapter that I couldn't help but laugh and think back
 ARE WE THERE YET?How many times have you heard that?  I know I have heard it many, many times
How about THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER.How many times have we all thought that? And one more we probably all have experienced at least once,  RUNNING ON EMPTY
That gas gauge is always wrong.GRAB A COPY AND LAUGH, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!!!I would give this book 4 SPOONS and 1 FORKI was given a complimentary copy of WHEN IT COMES TO SPOONING, I&#34;M A FORK by the author, Marc L

$REVIEW.: The title of the book promises a history of the 1861 Western Virginia Campaign.  This little covered campaign propelled McClellan to command of the Union armies and pushed Robert E. Lee into obscurity.  Only Jefferson Davis' faith in Lee rescued him from build fortifications along the Atlantic coast.  Politically important, West Virginia succeeded from the Confederacy and became a state due to Union success.  The infighting between Wise and Floyd provide a look into how poorly the CSA command functioned and how two petty people could bring everything to a halt.The author attempts to cover all of this and provide unlimited human-interest stories too.  He fails, as one part of the story elbows another out of the way, while tripping over a third part.  This is not a poorly written book.  The problem is origination and discipline.  No story is completed and human-interest keeps interrupting.  A major problem is maps!  In the Illustrations section are three useless maps.  First, they are in the wrong place, second the two dealing with battles have to little detail, lastly if you have not looked at the illustrations you will not know they are there.This is the second book I have read on this campaign.  I have not improved my knowledge or understanding by reading it.

$review_text.: This is a great book and reading it is like having a private coach.  Allyn always roots you on.  Basically it is Allyn's story, her personal journey that in fact has universal value.  For she tried on many roles, thinking, as we lead ourselves to think, that becoming meant becoming something else than what we are.  Since she was in tune with her feelings however, each new attempt of defining herself brought her more unease until she stopped to ask herself what it was she really needed and wanted.From her outer journey she changed directions and went on an inner one, an archetypal journey you might say.  Inspired by many well known self-help and inspirational works, she came to know her own truth.  Only when we come to know ourselves can we serve others or function correctly in the world.Now she was ready for the outside world.  Yet none of the functions she had previously tried appealed to her.  So she created her own way to serve.  And that was, to talk about and encourage others to take similar journeys to create their own rather than scrunch themselves into pre-defined purposes that very often don't fit.  We all have our gifts.  Learning to identify these and to make the most of them is not always easy in a world that is still heavily reliant on a patriarchal-based  system.  But Allyn shows us it is possible and necessary.A refreshing read for anyone.  A great graduation gift as if can help young women at this important age make the necessary shift in their thinking to better prepare them to be truly co-creators of their lives and worlds.

$REVIEW.: What an ending! Bold Tricks had me on the edge of my seat, gripping the blankets, hyperventilating, crying, throwing my kindle, picking it back up (glad it was not injured!), and cuddling with it at the end. Yes, all those emotions. And more. So let's try and dissect that a little shall we?It is no secret that I love me some Javier. No, it really doesn't make sense. Yes I know he is a drug lord and kills people for fun. No I haven't had my head checked recently, why do you ask? That being said, I was never sure he was the right one for Ellie. I always described my love for Javier as - vacation boyfriend. You know, the guy you meet on vacation, that you have a steamy week or so with, you do things together, you get to be someone else for a time, and then you go home to your life.  He is a bit unstable for a long term relationship.Poor Ellie is certainly put through the ringer in this last installment of The Artist Trilogy. She learns some things, looses some things, and is not sure where things stand between her and the two men in her life. Even though she sometimes sees herself as weak and not worthy of love, we really see her pull up her bootstraps and face down some things I hope none of us ever have to deal with. She turns out in the end to be the strongest character in the series.And Camden, sweet sexy tattoo covered Camden ... well, after some of the things that went down in Shooting Scars he isn't so sweet and innocent anymore. But I still hurt for him. After everything he went through to get back to Ellie, and then the things he saw ... well let's just say he starts off a bit confused and shaken. He doesn't know where things stand, where he wants things to stand, with him and Ellie.And then everything goes to hell in the ways you and I have come to expect from reading Halle's books. Does it end in an HEA? Who does Ellie end up with? Does everyone even survive? You will have to read it to find out. Perfect ending to a fabulous trilogy. Well done!

$review_text.: I totally enjoyed Blood on the Bones by Geraldine Evans. I understand it's #9 in a series about two detectives--Rafferty and Llewellyn. Obviously, I have some catching up to do. This book had a very good plot centered around a suspicious death in the grounds of a Catholic convent and offers all the mystery that an enclosed order has to offer. Rafferty was a lapsed Catholic so it also brought several memories, good and bad, back to him.Running right along with the murder was another mystery more personal to Rafferty that must have begun in an earlier book... another reason for me to go back and catch up. Her theme and characters remind me of those done by Elizabeth George, so if you like her, you'll like Blood on the Bones. Blood on the Bones has excellent characters, plot, and execution. Well done, Ms. Evans.Carol Piner, from The Kindle Book Review.The Kindle Book Review received a free copy of this book for an independent, fair, and honest review.

$REVIEW.: This book follows the mystery over the death of a young twenty-two year old girl, whose body was found in a bungalow. It's written in first person, through the eyes of tha main character in the face of a private detective, named Nick. This first person setting, can be considered as a plus, since it makes the reading more dynamic and helps the reader visualize things more easily. I also liked the way how the story is structured - one clue led to another and you have to keep guessing, who the murderer was. A very well-rounded story, deserves its positive rating

Ray was a police detective until a gunman fire two shots at him, leaving him crippled, and another shot that killed his partner and fiance. Since then he has worked as a security guard and now has opened his own private investigation firm.One of Orlando's richest businessmen hires Ray to find an employee who has stolen valuable client data from him. The thief is a former cop, one Ray knew, who had worked undercover and been fired for unethical and illegal conduct. Can Ray find him and who is worse, the thief or the businessman who hired Ray?I've enjoyed both of the Ray Quinn books. Ray's character is believable. He struggles with the losses he has gone through, his constant pain, with alcoholism which is his way of dealing with the pain. He is a good investigator, thorough and rational in his approach, and still has good relationships with some of his former colleagues. The character of his assistant, Crevis, is more problematical. When first introduced he seems a comic character, a total goof. Now he is developing as more simply young, impulsive, and poorly educated, and that transition doesn't always feel real.Overall, though, this is a good solid series with good plots and characters one can like and want to read more about.Publication date 2011Publication Multnomah Books (2011), Paperback, 352 pagesISBN 1601420749 / 9781601420749

I liked the story and read it in just a couple of days.  I thought the plot believable and there are issues relative to modern life and goverments.  I am sort of a fast reader and tend to skim a lot, especially if I am not engrossed in the story but that wasn&#8217;t a problem for me with this book.  I look forward to a sequel that could finish the story although this book can stand on its own.  I don&#8217;t think I noticed more than a handful of editing errors which is unusual, especially for an e-book and considering the length of this book, very unusual.  I consider this a well told story and look forward to more of the same.  If Chris ever needs the help of an amateur editor, I would love to help out.

$REVIEW.: I greatly enjoyed Darkness Haunts, the first book of this series, and so I had some pretty high expectations for this sequel. Did it live up to them? Mostly.Melena remains a great heroine, with interesting abilities that she has to use in creative ways to address the problems raised by the supernaturals around her. Her backstory makes her both interesting and convincing, especially knowing how to handle herself thanks to her time in the military. The love story also picks up in this book, and although it's somewhat predictable in the game of approach/withdrawal she plays, it still adds to the overall experience. My major complaint is with the ending; things are left in such a way as to beg for the next book. I'm not against the idea of next book, mind you, it just gets my hackles up sometimes when authors are too bold in leaving too much up in the air with in an obvious--&#34;you have buy the next one now!&#34; kind of ploy, and that's how I felt here. Still, Darkness Haunts and Darkness Taunts were both strong enough that I can't help looking forward to the next chapter of Melena's story anyway.

$REVIEW.: First off let me invite you to recognize that different schools teach different parts of the mathematical spectrum for this course. But a very comprehensive course will essentially review the end of algebra II, some trig., then introduce some parts of calculus to give you an idea where your gonna be going with this stuff. Really though one could say it's just advanced algrebra dealing with new forms of functions.Also let's understand that this book is not meant to be a textbook and thus will not be loaded with practice problems. That's not generally included in a study aid/self teaching guide like this. However, I do admit this book was short on the examples as well as practice problems, so I say this tongue in cheek.So how does this book stack up? It's great! Really it is. It covers nearly everything that you'll be looking at in Pre-calculus. One thing it does skip though is Polynomial Functions. It does cover polynomials, even the fundamental theorem of algebra, but not the functions of polynomials. I've noticed that Forgotten Calculus (Barbara Lee)  as well as Pre-Calculus Demystified (Rhonda Huettenmueller) do cover these.For those of you looking for help in Trigonometry there is a small section here, which is helpful for most of trig. However when you get to identities this book won't be too helpful because it doesn't even cover the half-angle identities, sum-product identities, nor the very basic quotient identities. The last of these is almost too obvious to worry about (you'll see when you get a basic lesson on trig.), however the other two are very useful tools for proving two trig functions as being equivalent to each other. Also this section of the book should have several examples as the only way to really get to know how to work identities is to do large quantities of them, yet start doing them several examples are helpful. However you could always buy a solutions manual for trig textbooks that cover these so you could see several worked out examples. Honestly, don't expect to find any self teaching guide filled with enough examples on this particular subject.Also I think it would be appropriate to introduce some information on Limits here and then review (and go more in depth in his calculus book). However Limits are not talked about in this book which is likely due to the fact that he talks about them in his next book The Complete Idiot's Guide to Calculus. I don't know how much detail he gets into on these in his next book, but I can tell you they're not talked about here.It also would have been nice to have had a small introduction to sequences and sets here. But alas the book is found wanton.I won't detail what the book does talk about since it's able to be previewed here on Amazon when you're logged into your account. However, I must say, those parts it does discuss are easy to understand. In order for this book to make it to a "self teaching guide status" it would need to have some more examples and practice problems (as mentioned earlier), but overall it will help you if you are trying to learn on your own or just need some clarification on lecture. I recommend it.Overall I'd give this book a 4.7 if I could because I think that some parts could use a bit more expansion, like more examples as noted earlier , but gave it 5 stars because (can't choose 4.7 anyhow) it still is a worthy supplement.

She has written this epic novel that is so engaging I felt as if I was right there in 1896 with the August Price family.  I felt like I was in Esme's dressing room, getting ready for the ball, at the ball with her, and more.  I could relate to Esme much more than I could to Jinx, her sister.  Susan May Warren has such a gift with her characters that she pulls the reader right into whatever story she writes about.  She can write about anything and it' as if you are right there!  It makes the book go by so fast, that is the only downside.  I'm ready now for Book 2 in this 3 book series!This book is an epic saga taking place during the Gilded Age, which starts on 5th Avenue in New York City, in 1895.  It is about a prestigious family, the newspaper magnate, August Price.His oldest daughter, Esme, is the first Debutante of the two sisters, whose name is Esme.  She is the main character in this book, along with her younger sister, Jinx.  Esme is the oldest daughter, and the first to make her debut as a Debutante.  It is desired by her family to marry first, and her mother already knows who she wants her to marry.  Foster Worth.  Esme is not so sure she wants to marry Foster Worth.  As we read this captivating story, Esme has very high hopes and aspirations for her life of becoming a Journalist and traveling the world.  She is bored of just `being' where she lives and sees herself traveling the world as the Journalist she so desperately wants to become.  She does not want to marry, even though she must so her younger sister can.  If she does not marry, her younger sister cannot.  Esme and Jinx, both, wish they were born the other way around especially since that way she would not feel so much pressure to have to marry.  Esme finds the events the other prestigious families' in this area host as being tiresome and boring.  Esme has much bigger and better things planned to do with her life rather than playing this dress up game night after tiring night, wearing tight corsets in which she can barely breathe, wearing the heavy ornate ball gowns, having her mother check her dance card continuously, and never stop talking about whom she should and should not marry.  Esme wants much more out of life than what is at her feet at this moment.  She is already sneaking articles into her own father's newspaper without his knowing it, under a pen name.After Esme proclaims she will marry Foster Worth, an old friend comes along and professes his love for Esme, going back to childhood.  She considers this and decides she loves him as well.  She goes after him.  She ends up finding him in the tenements, of which do not smell good, the people are less than desired, as well as the rooms inside.  This is where he lives?  Regardless, she still loves him.  She ends up disappearing.Esme's sister, Jinx, is especially happy to be able to get to go in to her father's office at home and break the news to him that Esme is missing.Thus starts the epic tale of these two sisters.  Each going separate ways, and much later in life, coming back together again, after many trials and tribulations the two of them have endured.This is a "can't miss" book, and one of my favorites of 2011!.  This book is a page turner.  You want to know what happens next.  I found this book very difficult to put down.  When I did put it down, it was all I could think about.As I said above, Susan May Warren did it again!  She can take `any' story and give it her magic touch, and `poof'!  There you are feeling like you are `in' the story!  I can't WAIT until Book 2!5 out of 5 from me!A HUGE Thank You to LitFuse for allowing me the PURE ENJOYMENT of reading this book!

$REVIEW.: I was so impressed with Henry Welp, he's a complex character who's sensitive, tough, smart, & determined, and very much haunted by the crimes of his father and what it means about the savageness of his baser nature. I wanted to roll around on his fur and  live in his universe. It's an amazing and richly complex new world that's grisly, gritty, and unflinchingly-Grimmly-violentKeeping in the spirit of the more sinister side of the Brothers Grimm, Dust City is gritty and hard-boiled as it is fantastical. When I began to read and it was as if I'd suddenly fallen down the rabbit hole, the next thing I knew the sun was coming up and I felt as if I'd only just blinked! It's a fast and fascinating ride full of characters that are so full and colorful you either love them, fear them, or you really really want them to get what's coming to them.Even though I feel that this story is complete, there is a lot of life and mystery to be explored in the Dust City Universe. I'd love to be allowed to take a new peek into this enthralling world. Yet the author has said he has zero plans on a sequel. But let me tell you this  Mr. Weston, I haven't had enough of Henry, Fiona, Roy, Detective White (she's a real doozy!) and Jack, hell even Siohban and her super cute grandma would be entertaining!This is a magical world, but there's no wand waving making everything perfect. I respect the maturity and seriousness infused into a book based on a fairytale world. The funny and sweet moments of the story endeared these characters into my heart.What a wonderful and awesomely talented author. Please read this book, read the prologue and if you are able to put it down I will be shocked.

$REVIEW.: I discovered Lisa Kessler when I read her excellent novella, Across the Veil, and could hardly wait to read Night Walker. I love paranormal romances and Lisa does not disappoint with Night Walker. She masterfully weaves Indian mythology and vampiric lore into a romantic thriller spanning multiple lifetimes. Calisto is a Spanish priest who falls in love with Tala, a native at the mission where he was working. The lovers are tragically torn apart by the betrayal of a trusted Church confidante. Inconsolate, Calisto gives up his mortality to become a Night Walker serving humanity while fervently hoping to find his beloved Tala again. Alas, the Church misguidedly continues to pursue Calisto believing him to be a follower of Satan even as the couple falls in love again. Are they doomed to have their past repeat itself? Don't miss this tale of star-crossed lovers... This will be a keeper on my bookshelf and it's an excellent start to a new series.

$review_text.: First off, I'm not a journalist or an English professor

I'm just a guy who wants to improve my writing

Ben Yagoda's "How to Not Write Bad" seeks to help people do just that, being a short guide that covers the key points on how to write well
If this sounds dull, it's not; the author throws in hilarious writing samples from his students, and other examples of bad writing that make this book an educational but funny read (perhaps until the reader realizes he or she is guilty of some of these common errors).Mr


Yagoda covers many examples of bad-writing we're all guilty of, from the more basic:- "Don't use a long word when there's a shorter one that means the same thing."- "Avoid word repetition

Do not avoid it by means of 'elegant variation'--the use of a synonym for the express purpose of avoiding word repetition."- "Never use whomever."To the more advanced:- "The trick is, when there's no readily apparent way to avoid repetition, it often works to find a word referring to a broader or narrower category of the first one


So painting/work is okay (broader), as is painting/neo-expressionistic portraits (narrower)


But paintings/canvases is elegant variation."- "Shark cage diving is a compound adjective--that is, a phrase made up of two or more words, that modifies a noun--and compound adjectives before a noun (experience) get hyphenated: 'my shark-cage-diving experience.'"Some questions you may have always had about writing, but never bothered to ask, are probably also covered: Should you capitalize after a colon? (Only if what follows is a complete sentence, like what I just did.) Do commas and periods go inside or outside of the closing quotation? (Inside if you're American, outside if you're British.) Can you use parentheses inside of parentheses? (Yes, although you need to use brackets [like this] instead.)In fact, the paragraph I just wrote is based on this tip from the book: "When you ask a question, answer it immediately." If not, "that question just lies there, unanswered, puzzling or bewildering the reader."The most important piece of advice on how to write better is one word: read

Before going into anything else, Mr
Yagoda dedicates the first of the three main sections to the importance of reading

"Trying to be a not-bad writer without having read your share of others' work," he writes, "is like trying to come up with a new theory in physics without having paid attention to the scientists that came before you, or writing a symphony without having listened to a lot of music." In other words, reading this book alone won't turn you into a professional writer overnight
You need to read, and that doesn't include text messages and status updates

He writes: "How much reading will do the trick? The writer Malcolm Gladwell has popularized the notion that, in order to become an outstanding practitioner in any discipline, you need to devote to it roughly 10,000 hours of practice
I'll accept that in terms of reading."So this book is hitting two birds with one stone: reading about writing

If your goal is to become a better writer (which should be everyone), you should definitely give this book a try.

$review_text.: I really wanted to love this story however...The heroine was a hypocrite and annoyed meI gave the book 3 stars because I liked the story and the Hero was a great guy (for the most part). He only annoyed me once when his mother called him on a derogatory word he used in her presence an instead of apologizing like an upstanding adult (who respects his mother) should have done, he responds with as he is 27 years old he should be able to say whatever he likes. He came off sounding like a preteen jerk in that moment.Unfortunately I had a real problem with Emma and spent most of the book wishing I could reach through my computer and slap her.So the book is about two sisters, Emma and Layla who are two years apart in age with Emma being the younger of the two. They are also as different as night and day with Layla being a cheerleader, outgoing, and popular while Emma is shy and a bit geeky. They both develop a crush on the boy who moves in across the street, Cole. He is a year older then Layla an three years older then Emma. He takes Layla out a couple times in high-school and he takes her to his senior prom. That night Layla tells a devastated Emma that she lost her virginity to him.Years later Emma runs into him (literally) in a coffee shop. The accidental meeting leaves an impression on Cole who is now an attorney as is Layla. Emma is a graphic artist. Emma and Cole start seeing each other. Layla has a list of goals and next on the list is to get married. She sets her sights on Cole.when he shows up at their parents house with his parents.for dinner. Emma decides to keep her relationship with Cole a secret. First because she's afraid Layla will take him away from her, then because she doesn't want to hurt her sister, then because she's afraid to make her sister angry.I was okay with her deception at first but then became irritated when she became a fanatic about it. At one point when Layla was trying to insinuate herself into Cole's path so he would take notice of her she called Emma an told her that she joined the same charity board that Cole was involved in. Instead of warning Cole Emma says nothing leaving it so Cole is completely surprised when Layla shows up at a meeting he's having with the directors. Layla then twists his arm to have drinks with her so he can catch her up on what the charity is about. When he texts Emma and asks if he can see her that night he is upfront and tells her he's meeting Layla or drinks. She responds and asks him why he's having drinks with Layla and he tells her about Layla joining his charity. She then had the audacity to get mad at him when she knew what her sister was up to. UG!So I mentioned earlier that I thought Emma was a hypocrite and here is why...Early in their relationship Emma tells Cole when she was in Paris studying art she had a LOT of casual sex. With all the guys she slept with she only had one serious relationship which she later tells Cole wasn't that serious even though they lived together for a short time.So one of Emma's biggest problems with Cole is that she believes he slept with Layla the night of his senior prom. When she finally confronts him about it he tells her he never slept with Layla. She calls him a liar because her paragon of a sister told her otherwise. He tells her several times he never slept with Layla and that he has never lied to her. She then throws his sister in his face because she knows he hasn't been completely honest about the sister Emma only met once and whom Cole has always been secretly ashamed of. They argue and Cole tells her they are through and walks out.Later when Emma has a conversation with her friend Dani, Dani tells her being as Cole slept with Layla in high-school maybe it didn't mean anything to him. Emma tells Dani that if Cole can have meaningless casual sex then maybe he isn't the man for her. At this point I'm like HUH? what about all the meaningless casual sex she had in Paris? Pot calling kettle much?Later when she finds out Layla lied to her about sleeping with Cole I so wanted Cole to tell her where to go and how to get there. But of course he didn't.Then my last issue was the hair pulling drag out Emma and Layla got into on Christmas Eve at their parents house. We got the F bomb more then once as well as several others and then Emma throws all the guys Layla has slept with in her face in front of their parents. I couldn't believe these two were adults and this wasn't happening during one of the many flash backs to their teen years because neither of them were acting like grown women. not to mention neither showed an ounce of respect for their parents. Emma should have showed Layla some compassion knowing Layla had had a crush on Cole and Cole wasn't interested, after all she had been there herself. She also should have apologized for deceiving Layla for months and Layla should have acted like an adult and moved on but IMO I think she was reacting to Emma lying to her more then she was in losing a guy she never had to begin with,I was a bit surprised that after ten years of friendship the Marlowes didn't trust the Carsons with the truth about their daughter and the Carsons didn't feel the need to share Mrs. Carson's health scare with the Marlowes.Lastly .I correctly guessed Cole's sister Shay's issue the first time Emma met her. ;). I'm glad he made peace with it.I am going to say I do recommend this book even though it irritated me because I still think the story was good

$REVIEW.: Astounding 5 star reviews are horribly misleading.  This story is beyond unbelievable.  I won't give you anything here that you don't get from the italicized beginning of this book (which I recommend you don't read unless you want the whole story laid out for you before you read it-what is that about?)  That said I guess I should say SPOILER ALERT!  The hero in this book is a milquetoast who can't deal with the loss of someone he "loved".  Only you find out later he didn't love her at all.  He is sick in body over a loss many years ago and thinks he is going to die.  So right away I wouldn't give him the time of day.  But the worst part of this book is there was NO proof reading.  The errors are so bad that you have to reread sentences repeatedly to figure out what the author is trying to say, missing words, missing articles, "helped" instead of held, "reigns" instead of "reins".  It was hard to finish.  Thank God it was short.  I read another of these books a loved it, so look at the review for each one don't just assume they are all good.

He's my fave Skeksis, and he even looked a lot like his movie creation look. The other Skeksis, hardly looked like their movie looks.The Gelflings were all there for each other. Great friends. And it was cute how the two main characters were asking each other to be married at the end. I wonder, if they were Jen's parents. Jen looks like his dad then.But the Gelflings better enjoy their time while they got it. But I felt sorry for them that they were such a peaceful race, and were all killed all because of a prophecy.

$REVIEW.: With or Without God, is written more in the style of an autobiography than a religious doctrine. Which I found refreshing and unexpected. I greatly enjoyed this book: the history, the science, and the author's outlook on life all blended together create a unique novel that leads the reader on a fulfilling journey. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Zimbabwe, as I knew little about the country that the author grew up in. The illustrations are also nicely choosen as they either help explain a point Mhalaba is making, or help visually describe a discussed paragraph.

$review_text.: Historical research has found that African-Americans had a visible presence in nearly all walks of life, including cowboying, all over the West. Reading most western fiction, back to the turn of the last century, you would not know it. There was, however, no Gideon Miles on the payroll for the feds in the Wyoming and Montana of 1885. So Edward Grainger has had to invent one.Thus there are the particular pleasures to be had in a Gideon Miles story. Miles embodies the fierce independence celebrated in the western hero who not only stands up to criminals. He must remain untouched by undisguised racial prejudice, and the color of his skin means he can trust no one--not even another law officer. Add to that another complication: as an armed lawman, he can fire only when fired upon.Miles to Little Ridge articulates all this very nicely. Suspend your disbelief about black U.S. marshals on the frontier, and Heath Lowrance takes you on a journey that honors what you surely care about--eliminating hardened criminals and upholding the law, without making a single compromise. Not only that, Miles represents the saving importance of personal integrity. That's a value that has been celebrated by the western since the beginning. To the extent that we can learn such a thing from fiction, it's here to be learned and learned again.

$REVIEW.: I am so happy I chose to buy this book about Pope Francis.  I knew nothing about this holy man.  How did I decide he is truly holy?  Well, I trust the movement of the Holy Spirt but also this book presents enough of his history, of the events in Rome in March 2013, and his early homilies in March 2013 that I feel that we have much to learn from this Pope as he witnesses to Christ.  Each Pope brings his special charism to the See of Rome.  Pope Francis is open to witnessing as a Christian, as a pastor, as a Pope to the Truth as taught by God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, and to the wisdom of the teaching arm of the Church.  Get to know this man.  All Christians, atheists, agnostics, persons of other faiths will learn from his witness.  See for yourself.  And a bonus--the author offers an engaging writing style.

$REVIEW.: I don't review children's books often (if ever), so my thoughts might not matter here. This story has great potential, but I didn't enjoy it as it stands right now. It seemed too dark and the words and images too complex for children's literature, especially with its Christmas theme.  On the other hand, it was too short and simple for adults. I loved the theme that some people in the world feed on the fear of others, even to the point of telling lies to scare them. The idea behind this story is a good one, but it needs to be tweaked to meet a specific audience. I felt it tried to be both for children and adults...but didn't quite work for either. I would love the story to have shown more tension and suspense as the main character grew and figured out truth for herself (even if it's truth according to a kid).

$review_text.: The problems with this book are part formatting, part source material. The fomatting is the worst part. There is no reason this book needs to still be in archaic english, complete with nonsensical spellings and grammar. It's incredibly distracting. And there are no quotation marks, meaning the poem goes from narrator-speak to character-speak with little warning. If your focus slips for even two seconds, you will be lost.This would be more forgivable if the poem itself were an engrossing read. But unfortunately, it isn't all it's cracked up to be. There are definitely some moving passages, but there is also a LOT of dull exposition and scenery description that goes on for far too long. And while some of the characters were interesting, 17th century women's studies hit Eve hard and drag the whole story down around her.This has some good parts to it, and for a free book, you can read those parts and delete at will. Have fun.

Although growing up from a very affluent family, Isa's family life isn't the best, especially her relationship with her mother.  Their relationship is more of a role reversal and Isa ends up being the care taker to her mother.  Isa wants a loving home, family and sense of belonging.  During this time she meets Jesse and Alex.  Isa falls in love with Jesse and befriends Alex.  As her relationship with Jesse stalls, Isa's relationship with Alex strengthens.During this time Isa drove me nuts!  She wanted a relationship, but with whom...she just didn't know.  Jesse was her first everything and Alex was always just there for her.  Her heart was truly torn in 2.  Isa WILL drive you crazy with her indecision, but it's relatable.  It's real.  I think most women have been in her shoes at some point in their lives and like Isa, they just don't know what to do.  But there comes a time when you MUST chose and Isa finally does.When she does, it's the best decision for her.  It isn't a pretty, perfect love story, but a real love story.  Great debut novel!  Solid 4 stars!*ARC given for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: I'm not into hardcore BDSM, so I was very iffy about reading this book


 I'm really glad I did


 It was very engaging and enjoyable

 I had a hard time getting in to  Drake at first, he takes persistance to a whole new level, but by the end I was rooting for him


 This was a sweet love story with light bdsm elements that didn't take over and dominate the entire storyline
 I liked that this book was a light and easy read, it was't dark and deep and depressing, and I didn't feel that yuck factor that I get with a lot of these books

 The characters are fun and believable, the dialogue is witty and their interactions are humorous and also touching


I enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly.

$review_text.: This maybe one of the weirdest books I've ever recommended


You have to read it all the way through before judging some of the crazy/creepy things that occur in the beginning
Not to worry though, this book is a fast read and I had trouble putting it down.I finished in less than a week and was glad to have invested the time
A great chance to escape reality and venture into "the unseen" world of the unseen.Not for the faint of heart or conspiracy theorist though!

$review_text.: "Blood Spatter -- A Short Story" is a short horror by author Guy James

This is a Kindle e-book that was a 61 Kb download (approx 10 pages) and was free at the time of writing this review.SPOILERS throughout...General theme...Logan Jennings is a serial killer who uses his incredible gory crime scenes as a photo-op for his fairly success business of providing Cover Art for some about to be published horror books
However, it appears that most of the 'inspiration' for the creativity is not really his own, rather the skill in taking these unusually 'stunning' pictures comes from an old demon's mask he had in college...a mask tainted with some evil magic.A few thoughts...some pros and cons1.) an unusual plot that was original and had definitive possibilities for an intriguing horror tale.2.) some use of repetitive words ('crispy' comes to mind) and some dialogue seems contrived and forced


 The conversation between with his daughter and wife reminded me of a talk between friends rather than family.3.) the time sequencing used within the story seemed odd...within a space of nine minutes, Logan has called Detective Labrusca, then goes and hacks up his victim, and finally the detective arrives at the scene of the crime...all in 9 Minutes!!!3.) I could not quite figure out what really happened to Detective Labrusca.4.) the last paragraph...a comment from the Demon's mask
Was this the end or just the beginning of a new series of killings?5.) Cover Art...bland and unappealing

Given the nature of the subject matter, one would have expected something a little more imaginative.Impression:I read this tale a couple of times (a few sections several times) and I still came away not really comprehending what was actually happening...yes the murders were quite obvious of course, but some of the details surrounding these horrific events left me puzzled (some mentioned above)

I'm not sure, but I assumed Logan knew what he was doing under the influence of the mask...but let's say he didn't, would he not wonder where the grisly pictures that appeared on his camera came from?Conclusion:I liked this story and its basic premise.That being said, I think James' biggest shortcoming is in his character dialogue and the lack of tying up loose ends so that the reader can get some sense of conclusion at the end of the tale...something I was unable to find with this short work.As it is...3 1/2 Stars (but had potential for more)Ray Nicholson



$SUMMARY.: Intriguing tale...but a few concerns 3 1/2 Stars

In the hands of a rational supreme commander the Panzer may have been unstoppable.

$REVIEW.: Keeping this short and sweet in order to not have spoilers but honestly, this book was great. Kept me hooked from the beginning and just when you think you've figured things out there's another twist. I will say that if you're gonna read this you really should read rock the viper first as it is a continuation of the story. It is all I hoped for and more. There were some very familiar faces and some new ones. Once again the characterisation is done really well and Peppa comes across as a much stronger person. There were those I loved and those I loved to hate. The authors writing is clearly evolving and looks like things can only get better for her. Looking forward to reading more from this author in the future.

The dialog is very snappy and fun, especially between our lovers.

$review_text.: Ms. Freedman has mind-boggled me with this one. I cannot fathom how a first-time novelist was able to come up with such engaging characters and such a complex storyline, and somehow still manage to hold onto all the strings and weave an amazing tapestry of words. From the beginning, I was drawn into the book, wanting to know all the who, what, and why of the story. Past memories and a current storyline, a wide range of realistic (and insanely supernatural) likeable and detestable characters, creepy moments along with deep sweetness, annihilation and hope, I never knew which way the author would lead me, but I was always willing to follow. How far would Ms. Freedman take me? How far was she going to push the limits of her imagination? Told from various points of view, the book, though easy to read and follow, has many hidden layers and a depth beyond what I would typically expect from this genre. Well done, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes supernatural/suspense/thriller/mystery books. Even to those who don't-- because The Faithful really is an engaging and thought-provoking read.This book is currently entered in the ABNA contest and you can download an excerpt for free.

$REVIEW.: Since 1980, the Thomas Cook Travel Book of the Year has been considered the travel writing equivalent to the Booker or Pulitzer, and this Stewart's second book to win the prestigious honor. The book's framework is Stewart's plan to travel from roughly the western edge of the 12th-century Mongol empire to the mountain in eastern Mongolia where Ghengis Khan was buried. The first quarter of the book covers his trip from Istanbul to the the Crimea on a decrepit Russian cargo ship, across Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan by train, and by air into Mongolia. This is all warmup for Mongolia itself, as he intersperses the history Mongol conquest with that of a proselytizing mission made by a Franciscan monk to the Mongol court in 1253, as well as his own encounters with a gun-toting teenage Russian smuggler, a Dickens-loving Russian procuress, and various lonely souls.Once in Mongolia, Stewart switches to horseback, as his plan is to ride over 1,000 miles across its breadth. With a succession of translators, guides, and horses, he find that the happiest and healthiest Mongols live virtually the same nomadic lives as their ancestors of five centuries ago. Even accounting for a certain degree of romanticization of the countryside, it's hard to find anything redeeming about the settlements he passes through. Virtually all are crumbling towns with few permanent residents beyond a mayor, policeman, and a few other caretakers. These regional centers are ugly concrete legacies of the Soviet era which have been largely abandoned since the end of Soviet aid and seem destined to return to the earth.Out in the countryside, Stewart meets innumerable nomads, takes part in a wedding, visits a shaman, goes to a festival which includes horse-races and wrestling, and generally finds the people to be friendly and curious. Of course the landscape features prominently, and people with horses may find themselves yearning to across the world to ride next to history's most famous horsemen. The real pleasure of the book is that while Stewart does all these fascinating things, he writes about it in simply stunning prose liberally sprinkled with humor and heart. [...]It's a fascinating and funny book, and one that should read by anyone with an interest in other cultures. One interesting footnote: in discussing the book, several professional reviews have said that the Mongolian nomadic life will likely "die out in our lifetime." This is directly opposite to what Stewart describes! He is very clear that the nomadic lifestyle is the only one which makes much sense in a country like Mongolia, and that the vast majority of people prefer not to live in urban areas!

It left me feeling like I was friends with each and everyone one of the characters. Brenna (heroine) wasn't one of the whiny biker bishes you usually meet, she was head-strong and so gosh darn lovable especially all she has suffered through. She broke my heart with how she carried on after finding out about being pregnant but if she hadn't, I wouldn't get to read her amazing story, her beautiful journey through healing. And don't get me started on Dragon? Bad ass biker who wasn't perfect not even close but so perfect for Brenna...gosh I just finished it, and it has me wanting to go at it again...*sigh*

$review_text.: If you aren't familiar with Robert Bevan's satirical fantasy series, Caverns and Creatures, it would be worth your while to do so with Clerical Error. The story continues the often sophmoric misadventures of four gamer friends who become trapped in the lives of the characters they play. While the constant clowning of Cooper, the crude, incontinent orc barbarian is often the source of the problems faced by Tim the halfling thief, Julien the elf sorcerer and Dave the dwarven cleric, this story focuses on the particular problems of Dave, an atheist n our world, as he confronts the philosophical issues of living with an without divine power in a setting where the gods are real enough to cause trouble.

Only if those word  are artistically used as they are in this book. Great authors don't receive enough praise for the world's they create. The film world may reach us visually, but the world of words use the best back drops, sceneries, and actors available...those imagined by the reader. Great job. I'll read on.

 After all, it is written by the person who has spent much of his life studying and trying to understand these individuals

Cheryl Holt novels tend to have very EVIL character and this novel had the element but less than her previous books. The concept of the &#8220;Reluctant Brides&#8221; trilogy are that 3 women who have lived and worked at the Miss Peabody&#8217;s School for Girls are left with a weird inheritance when Miss Peabody dies. They are each told she left them a fianc&eacute; and because they are someone alone in the world they take this leap.Rose arrives at the home of her fiance Stanley Oswald who is older man with no physical and is written as slimebag. He can't father any children and suggests that James ( a man who raised from orphanage) and Rose attempt to have a child and then he will marry Rose and claim the child/heir.  The secondary characters are just as creepy.  This book was very interesting as always I read Cheryl holt books with look of disqust on the edge of my chair.

$REVIEW.: On one last family hunting trip, a young man and his father, uncle, cousin, and grandfather, go off for what grandpa says he's got "one more" in him. Rely on Mike Dellosso for the subtle humor. The problem for the men is... things will not go as they'd hoped. And, if you've read Dellosso's previous horror blockbuster Darlington Woods, it will get creepier. Yep, it takes place there. And it does get chilling, and not from the snow either.In the middle of the night, this one young man and his uncle hear something guess it to be a bear, only for a blood-curdling scream to be heard, waking everyone up.Using a warning system of their own, they go off to find anything of note and import. It's very sad what all happens (even implied), yet it gets downright scary when the main character describes what he sees. And I dare not spoil even one slight description. In the end of the story, the man feels hope in the decision that he feels his father would be proud of, and yet has questions about what he saw, and why him? Read the story to find out what I mean by that. It actually makes me glad I'm not a hunter.

This is a story over the course of three years.  We get pieces here and there but its' enough for me to fall for Ryan.Ryan is an athlete with a crush on an older girl.  He's shy and cute as he watches her from afar only to have her approach him.  I love how they become friends despite the age difference.  Everyone sees how he feels but she only sees him a friend.  It really had me loving Ryan more.  His reactions to her, to his own life and his own relationships all had me loving him.I didn't like Brooke as much.  I'm sure it's because she hurts Ryan so much.  She doesn't get what she's doing to him - at least at first.  What I did like about her was that she made friends with Ryan.  He's so shy around her that he never would have made the first move.  She did.  She encouraged him with baseball.  She got the whole male ego thing.  She was a good friend to him.  But she was just a friend.  When she dated other guys it tore him apart.  When she encouraged him to have a girlfriend it hurt him.  She didn't mean it that way but it happened.This book is written in third person from Ryan's POV.  I always struggle with third person writing but I can see why it worked for this book.  The book focuses on the parts of Ryan's life that were important to his relationship with Brooke over about three years time.  First person writing would have been odd here.  And even though it was third person, I really did connect with Ryan.The pacing is good.  I liked that we didn't get too much extra so the story of them flowed well.  It's a novella of about 90 pages, so I read it in a couple of hours.I was kinda thrown by the ending. Things may have happened a little fast there.  I wanted just a little bit more too.  I guess that's a good thing.  I felt like I didn't want to let go of these characters.  I spent some time thinking about them and added a own little bit more.  I like that when I can't quite let go of a book.

$REVIEW.: I will tell you my thoughts about this book really quick.My response to this book was WOW!Unlike most of erotica with the same story length that I've read, Double Saute wasn't a book where there was no plot with a 'wham bam thank you ma'am' story.  It was quite surprising, that in 102 pages, it seemed like Tamara Hart took her time in building and developing its story and characters. It was not only  deliciously sexy and arousing, it also contained some mystery.And I didn't expect the ending, at all. However, it opened the opportunity for a series. I do hope the author will give a chance for the journey to continue.For erotica seekers who appreciate good writing and good story plot, I'll recommend you to give this book a go.
$SUMMARY.: Good writing + good story = good words from me.

The storyline is okay, although it could have been executed better. There is a lot of repetition and I got tired of the main character whining. All in all, it could be a great book with some revisions.

$review_text.: This book is straight to the point and gives you the fundamental elements of screenplay writing. My only caveat is that the book is more focused on general screenplay writing for the "general market" than for those "high-concept" screenplays you may see get Oscar nods. However, the fundamentals are the same. The author also seems to have a hint of being jaded by the industry in that his focus is more about the million dollar screenplay and appealing to the mass audience than niche specific. So...pick this book up for the fundamental screenplay writing techniques but you don't have to follow his career path exactly. It all depends on what kind of movie you want to produce.

$REVIEW.: I met Cal before he became a porn star, and I remained an acquaintance until his death.  Yes, I shared some sexcapafes with him in the early years; but mainly he was an occasional friend who came to dinner every so often. He was an able,intelligent,educated man who never achieved his goal of being a legitimate theatre star. For example, I had no hesitation about using him as an invited guest speaker at some of my university courses. I was also always a little saddened about how he let people use him.  I know he tried to create an aura for the public but I would have expected a perceptive author to uncover more of the real man.  This simply is not the Cal I knew.

$review_text.: We're designed to go all the way, to really live happily ever after as married couples
Young adults perceive pain, fear, cheating, adultery and divorce as "normal", because of failing relationships among friends and family
Craig Groeschel, founding and senior pastor of LifeChurch.tv, recently ranked the nation's second largest, wrote provoking books likeChazown: Define Your Vision

Pursue Your Passion

Live Your Life on Purpose.,Dare to Drop the Pose: Ten Things Christians Think but Are Afraid to SayandThe Christian Atheist: Believing in God but Living As If He Doesn't Exist.He strives to put the bar on the highest possible position

Just as Christ loves his Church, we as man should love our wives


And in submission to their husbands, women do rebel against the current morals.Groeschel starts with priorities

God is the One, your husband / wive the Two
Not the other way around and no others should replace this ranking

Next is marriage preparation, where the pastor gives his point of view on finding the One, dating, courting, attracting, sexuality, communication, forgiveness and growing relationship with God

There's huge difference between a wedding and a marriage.Love, Sex & Happily Ever After tells about Groeschel's own choices before he came to know Christ

And yes, these were radically different from the pursuing of holiness afterwards

In my humble opinion not all will agree with Groeschel's strict advices on dating: just talk and walk, not getting physical in any way, even abstain from kissing! The author think it's possible to save physical intimacy to the time after the wedding day.Large parts of the book deal with sin, grace and forgiveness
Recovery and understanding each other


Short chapters `For him" and "For her" describe the differences between men and women in communication and acting


 Groeschel and his wife have 6 children, so don't expect the "happily ever after" to be a quiet time, without any distractions, fights and disagreements

The author's goal is not to condemn or withold anyone to get married at all


First, he offers a different perspective on a marriage that lasts a lifetime
And second, he plans to offer you hope.The book was released in 2007 as Going All the Way and now contains a study guide as well.

$REVIEW.: I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from this story, but I have heard wonderful things about this author so the chance was irresistible: and I am happy to report that I loved this story with a perfect blend of heroine, fae, legend, shifter and sexy moments.Evelina is a half-human daughter of Jack Frost, and a full time guardian of the Snow Maiden and Santa&#8217;s staff


 But the Snow Maiden was spirited away by the ice zombies, taking the staff with them


 And only Evie, Guardian for Ded Moroz and her husky dog Maddox can recover the maid and the staff, so off she treks to track down the wayward maid and with less than 21 hours, time is not on her side.Kameron is a Scotsman, living in this wilderness in an old abandoned cathedral
 Boldly decorated in the Orthodox style, Evie awakes to find this naked man speaking to her


 While the man isn&#8217;t answering a ton of her questions, the attraction between the two is palpable: even Maddox doesn&#8217;t seem to sense ill intent


 Rescuing her from the ice zombies, feeding her and then patching her wounds, she starts to relax, and let their attraction take over.The story unfolds at a beautiful pace as it mixes legend and action with the ever present threat of zombies and the quest to find the Maid and the staff


 Told in a manner that brings memories of story hour as a child, the plot twists and weaves like a folk tale, with insets of incredibly hot sex to show you this isn&#8217;t for the kids: even though it brings similar rapt attention and hold your breath moments

 Descriptions and information weave seamlessly throughout mentioning mythological, fae and other fantastical elements that enhance and place the story firmly in the &#8216;otherworldly&#8217; yet maintain enough conflict and concerns that are wholly human so readers can relate
 Far more than a fairy tale with erotic elements, or a romance, or even a Christmas tale, this was a fun ride from start to happy ending: with enough twists, humor, action and heat to engage readers.I received an eBook from the publisher for purpose of honest review for the Jeep Diva


I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$SUMMARY.: this isn&#8217;t for the kids: even though it brings similar rapt attention and hold your breath moments.

$review_text.: It's finally here! The conclusion to Vaughn and Keely's tumultuous and sexy story
With the way things ended in book 3, it was really up in the air what would happen with them next.Remember that quiet girl was back in book 1 that was walked all over by her boss? The girl that kept to herself and never spoke up? Yeah, well, that girl is long gone and dammit if I'm not proud of Keely and her growth
She didn't ask for all of this and had no time to prepare but yet here she is handling it all so well
She has been forced to toughen up and the new confidence looks good on her.Vaughn has made mistake after mistake in each book but I still love him despite it all
Now it is time for him to man up and make things right
Even if that means begging on his knees for Keely's forgiveness
But can she ever trust him again? Can there  be a future for them after all of the lies and deceit? It won't be easy, that's for sure, but at least we can enjoy more of Vaughn's filthy mouth along the way.It was a bittersweet moment for me when I started reading this


It was kind of like "Yay, more Vaughn!" followed quickly by "Oh no, the last of Vaughn!" However, it was the perfect conclusion to this juicy serial


All your questions will be answered and your panties will combust in the process
I am beyond sad to say goodbye to Keely and Vaughn, and yes, I may have even shed a few tears

But with the conclusion of The Seduction means Roxy Sloane can work on something new and I cannot wait to see what her brilliantly dirty mind gives us next


Perhaps a side story on Cam? Cam and Isabelle maybe? Just a thought Ms

$review_text.: Hot Pink made me say "Really?!" and "Is that out there...?" many times. It has a back alley, behind-the-scenes, love story flavor throughout. Since I'm not a writer, I'm flooded with cliches to describe Levin's work (i.e. 'there's something for everyone!').  But that is why I'm writing this review.  There really is something for everyone.  Whether you're an intellectual or a huffer or just someone that recognizes the world's beauty doesn't always get captured in pretty colors, you'll like Levin.  He flies off a bit, that's what makes reading his stuff kinda fun.Actually, I should recognize that not 'everyone' likes grit. So if you need blue skies and sun throughout your stories, Levin is not for you. But maybe just give it a try. Like jumping into freezing cold waters, it's a little painful, shocking, and refreshing all at the same time. I promise you'll be enriched a least a little bit after finishing the stories.

$review_text.: SECRETS by S.L. Pierce is an exciting thriller/suspense set in present day high tech world of computers. Gwen Michaels,(AKA) we never learn her true identity,she an retired assassin.She left the assassination business because she was starting to enjoy it to much.She is happily married until someone tries to kill her.Bad mistake on their part. Jack Michaels,Gwen's husband,doesn't know of her past secrets,but he is about to find out. Gwen is a kick butt kinda girl,who will her answers, and only believes in black and while,no gray areas. While,Jack gets pulled into this secret life of his wife's.To keep him safe until Gwen can find out who and why someone is trying to kill her.It has nothing to do with her past. This is a high octane,action packed,kick butt story with high tech secrets,betrayal,a few killings,a husband who is simply amazed by his wife,and a heroine who is a kick butt girl.I would have liked to have seen Jack more manly,he only sees the good in people and is an all around good person.Overall,this is a good story with an interesting plot...a female retired assassin..you don't read much on them.The characters are interesting.Although,Gwen,does kill a couple of people and doesn't get caught.She worked with high powered people within the government,so all is good. The bottom line is you try to kill Gwen and you don't get to live..This is a good read that will keep you turning the pages.This book was received for the purpose of review from Nurture Virtual Book Tourz and the author and details can be found at My Book Addiction and More.Available at Barnes & Nobles,Amazon, Smashwords.

$REVIEW.: William O'Brien has written a book of Poems that is magical


Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems (Peter: A Darkened Fairytale 2) if you have read  "Peter: a Darkened Fairytale", you should try these imaginative and fantastic poems


They make you feel like a child again and each one is unique and creative.As with any poems there are always favorites

Some I liked were carefree and fun like "Wildflower Valley" and some were more dark and sinister like "Madie." Whichever you may prefer the author does not disappoint.Words from these poems will stay with you long after you have read this poetry


Phrases like, watchful magic, Breath of fire, engulfs fierce and true and linking hearts forever saved


I liked so many more but you should really read these fairy tale poems and enjoy them yourself.I was gifted this copy for an honest review and I will gift one to my son to read to his children


Imaginative, fun and creative with dragons and elves, fairies and creepy crawlies there is something for everyone
Highly recommended and I look forward to many more delightful poems and fantasy books from William O'Brien.

$review_text.: Ever wondered what it'd be like to live through a war?Well, in Unjust Cause you can witness one first hand through the eyes of Emily and Annie when General Manuel Noriega takes on the United States presence in Panama.If you're a little squeamish when it comes to blood and injuries, perhaps this might not be the best book for you, as Jaclyn does a very good job of dropping you into the action in full force


It almost felt like you were copping a face full of blood and guts along with the nurses.Some of the plot twists were almost blindingly obvious, others not so much, but despite the predictability of them, they seemed to work and didn't leave that irritating sting that visible plot twists sometimes leave behind.I quite liked the characters; I especially appreciated the dialogue between Emily and Annie

It was very real to me, which helped to make those two characters more like friends
I didn't feel so attached to Dan, which caused a bit of a lack of emotion at a pivotal point in the storyline, but Pat grew more as a character and that meant I ended up liking him a lot more.The emotional reactions to the situations they found themselves in was very realistic
I liked that a lot


It made the book more real and believable.Ultimately, the reason the book didn't get 5 stars, came down to a few typos (below) and the fact that what should have been a gut wrenching scene just wasn't because I hadn't come to love the character in question


I was getting close, but it seemed too early, too rushed and just didn't quite work.I strongly suggest this for anyone who wants a strongly written, descriptive story that showcases some legendary leading ladies in some horrible situations, some sizzlingly sensual situations and pretty much just kicking butt the whole way through.I will be checking out more by Jaclyn A Wilson.Things I noticed:41% - '...had grazed Pat's his(remove his) shin.'59% - 'Way to (too) close.'87% - 'She wondered if it was it (remove second it) possible...'NOTE: I receieved a copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review

$Helpful?.: [1, 1] $SUMMARY.: I strongly suggest you read this book!

$review_text.: This book sounds so so so good to me, I love me some paranormal m/m romance.  The plot/story line was good and the characters were well written and I love how you got to hear/read from both the main characters.  Wild I thought was awesome, he told you how he felt and never held anything back, even when he should have kept his mouth shut.  Though I just love how he was honest about what was going on and how he felt, put it all out there.  Caleb was a good character too, strong loner type but with a good heart.  With Caleb though there were too many LONG flash backs.  I like some back ground on the characters we're reading so we really get to know them, but geezz alittle too much with Caleb.  I kept thinking  to myself, &#34;ok ok we get it enough&#34;.  The pace of the relationship with these two was ssssooooooo ssslllloooowwwww.  I would have LOVED LOVED to see their relationship moved a little faster and for Caleb to get over his problem and embrace Wild.  It was a ok read for me I wouldnt read this again though.

The information on tools, preparation and organization is wonderful
Excellent information on stabilizing your fabric squaring your background block, preparing your pattern and overlay and all of her photo's are extremely helpful

This book was a great refresher course for me as I haven't had time to do much applique in the last few year's plus I learned some helpful new techniques


I don't think you could go wrong with adding this book to your library
I've purchased two other books in the last month on applique and this one has to be the best of the bunch
I'm glad I was able to check it out at a quilt shop in Santa Fe before buying it


The price at the shop was $29.95 but I just knew I had to check out the price on Amazon and I wasn't disappointed $10 less at good old Amazon


LOL and I love shopping with my points!!

$REVIEW.: I'm too lazy too read all the Dick Hardesty Mystery and so I asked for the books where the relationship between Dick and Jonathan first started and then developed into a family with the addition of Joshua, Jonathan's little nephew.At the beginning of this novel, Dick and Jonathan are having a pretty good "bachelor" life together: they travel, they work, they have enough money to spare and enjoy the life; nothing apparently bad, if not that Dick is not really still convinced this is the life he really wants. You can understand his indecision in the way he ogles all the pretty boys he comes upon to, even if he has a good fine boy, Jonathan, at home all for himself. Dick in a way would like to play the field, and the "ifs" are still plenty in his day-to-day routing, even if he doesn't actually follow any of them.Then suddenly Jonathan is appointed guardian for his nephew Joshua, a four years old baby; to Jonathan, aside for the pain of losing his brother, is like the realization of his dream: he has always wanted kids, but he was not expecting for his dream to come true, and above all not so soon. But Jonathan also knows that, even if he was joking with Dirk on building a 2.5 kids family in the suburbs, Dirk is not ready, or willing, to be the other half of that dreams.Dick in a way surprised me: I was not expecting for him to put his feelings for Jonathan in front of his own personal desire. Actually both of them do that, Jonathan not wanting to force Dick, and Dick realizing that Jonathan and Joshua are an item and that if he wants one he has to take also the other. But Dick was even more surprising in "really" accepting Joshua: for Dick is not only doing a favour to Jonathan, he really likes the kid and while it's clear that Joshua is Jonathan's responsibility, it's also clear that Dick is more than willing to share the burden.In the end, I think that Joshua, instead of destabilizing Dick and Jonathan's relationship like the most common plot would have implied, helped on the contrary to make it stronger, giving it a chance to last that without Joshua was probably less likely; as in an old fashioned romance, the kid in question worked as cement to the relationship.Again, the personal subplot for me was more interesting than the mystery main theme; and again I'm not really able to summarize it without spoiling the fun for the mystery lovers. Enough to say that Dorien Grey put together a good numbers of possible suspects and that me, like him, until the end were not sure of who really was the one who killed Jonathan and Dick's single mom neighbour.

$REVIEW.: SUMMER'S BOOK BLOGHis To Claim is an erotic novella series by Opal Carew comprising of six short stories, all six must be read in order to get the full story. I highly recommend that you read His To Possess first because that is where all the characters first appear and reading it will you give you a much deeper understanding and greater appreciation of Rafe and Melanie. Melanie is Rafe's former secretary who left her job for a few reasons including the very strong feelings she had developed for her boss. Rafe is a sexy rock musician who also happens to be a billionaire CEO, once Melanie quits Rafe is finally able to see her in a different way. She is no longer just his employee she is a woman who is seeking to explore her wild side and circumstances align to send them on a wild ride of lust and possibly love.As with all her other novels I bow down to Opal Carew and her amazing abilities to write captivating, addictive and scorching hot erotic fiction. I first fell in love with Rafe in His To Possess and was secretly hoping that he and Melanie would somehow find a way to get together. When I first saw the blurb for this novel I was beyond excited and His To Claim lived up to all of my wildest fantasies! This book manages to combine many hot fantasies, sexy rock musicians, boss and secretary and even a deliciously sexy foursome. This story is so much more than just erotica, of course it has intense passion, panty melting sex scenes and sexy men and women but it also has an interesting plot line, drama, emotion and terrific, well developed characters. That is why I love Opal Carew, her books can't be put into one category, they are erotica, romance and drama all rolled into one engrossing story. Rafe is an amazing character, he is complex and interesting. He is tortured by some things in his past and he has trouble allowing himself to explore certain sexual fantasies but works his way through them. Rock stars are my favorite fantasy characters and he is perfect, Rafe is the ideal sexy, tattooed, motorcycle riding rock star! I also enjoyed Melanie's character, she is set off on a journey of self exploration and with the help of Rafe begins to find herself not just sexually but also who she really is. The reader will enjoy watching their relationship progress as they both work toward self discovery all the while having mind blowing sexual encounters. Once I started I wasn't able to put this novel down until I finished, the conclusion was perfect and not traditional which was exactly as it should be for these interesting characters. After some angst and some self exploration Rafe and Melanie work things out and find their happily ever after.

It was just, I can't even describe it. I am not a classicalmusic afficionato. I don't even know how to read music. But I havenever wanted so badly to go to a symphony as I do right now. I googledevery song. Every. Single. One. And I have never felt so &#34;in thestory&#34; before this book. The way that you two wrote this... it's justsimply a masterpiece. You both deserve to move to first chair in thesymphony of indie authors. Psshhh. As if you aren't already there! Iloved it. I loved every word of it. This story really should be amovie. I have always enjoyed the descriptive nature of both of yourwriting styles but this story, these characters,... you have trulyoutdone yourselves.I was a little caught off guard by how attached I got to Savannah. Ifelt for her. I cried for her. Not teary-eyed. Full on CRIED! In themiddle of the nurses station at work. As soon as I was finally able tocompose myself, the story brought me to tears again. It was souncomfortable, and yet needed at the same time. Love is sometimesugly. It is raw and compelling and powerful, leaving people in itswake. I hurt for Karin but I ACHED for Savannah. And Gregory? What asmug, arrogant, pretentious, entitled, jerk. Until, you really gothim. There was just this moment of clarity during their journey when Iall of a sudden understood him. And then I ached for him. I made atotal blubbering-mess fool of myself in front of my work peers. Sodarn you, Andrea and Charles! But then I got to explain. I got todescribe the beauty of this tortured tale to all of them. Let's justsay that you'll see a few more one-clicks show up tomorrow. They aresold! And I continue to be sold on the both of you. Well done, yetagain. And thank you!

$review_text.: This awesome book is very informative, packed with quotes, details and info you can't find any where else. But the grim future of EUtopia (It's also where Liberals in Canada and US would like us to follow) is making me scared. According to stats, by 2025 France will be a majority Islamic country. Russian army will be a majority Muslim army by 2020. These are scary, not because radical Muslims are scary, but because this change is being forced upon the rotten continent of Europe so fast that it can not keep pace. And as it is clear, the Eurabians have two option: 1- Submit to the will of Allah and become Muslims at once, 2- Start a civil war again and run concentration camps (That's where Eurabians are best at). These two options scare the hell out of me and makes me very sad. At any rate, this book is an eye opener for the naive Westerners in Canada, UK, US and western EU countries. Europe is a mess and hopefully it won't need America to save it again. As for this book I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: This cookbook really is a vibrant, colorful effort with excellent recipes and simple methods of instruction. I can see why this restaurant is so popular in the Big Apple. Is everything in here groundbreaking? No. Will it give you certain inspiration, both in preparation and in plating? Yes. It is also nice when the author(s) include personal stories or experiences, and in this case, a bit of background on the how's and why's of Candle 79. Kind of personalizes the effort and makes it a more familiar read. The only part i actually didnt like was the intro. I dont really need to know that somebody doesnt eat meat because it is animal cruelty...nor do i believe this. Is there animal cruelty in the food industry? Certainly. I wouldnt want to be a cow or chicken forced to live a sedentary life in a small cubicle or cage. However, is eating meat actually cruel. No. It is the natural order of the world. I just dont think it is necessary personally, and basically just slows people down and makes them both heavier and more inclined towards such pleasantries as cancer and heart disease. So, having just ignored my own distaste for personal crusades by listing mine lol, i cant be too down on the intro, but i feel it is a bit of misinformation and kind of out of place with the rest of the book. Fortunately, it only takes up two pages, lol.I think if you own this book, you will find great ways to utilize vegan product, prepare vegan food, and present/plate it in an simple, attractive, and mouthwatering way. What more could a person ask from a cookbook? I am glad to have bought it.Enjoy!

However, I got the feeling the way it ended that it was setting up the next story.  I would absolutely recommend reading this book if you are a follower of Juliet Henry.  There are things that you learn about her present and her past which I feel are going to be important as the story progresses.

$REVIEW.: Aiden's betrayal is a good vampire romance.  Elle's best friend talks her into going clubbing one night and that changed her life forever. She meets Aiden and there is an immediate strong attraction between the two of them.  Although she had no plans of having a one night stand, she changes her mind after one look at Aiden.  Unknown to Elle, Aiden is a vampire and she finds out after he has no choice but to kill rogue vampires in her presence.  Elle's parents were killed by vampires and she has to deal with her attraction to Aiden and realize the difference between rogues and vampires.  There were a couple of discrepancies in the scenes but it did not take away from the story.  For instance, in one scene they were about to have sex against the wall, but in the next sentence Aiden was placing his knee on the bed to loom over Elle.  So now you have to flip the scene in your mind from wall to bed, no indication that they had even made it to the bed.  On another note, Elle's best friend Anya is a slut and I don't care for her character at all.  First, I thought Anya and Nicholas (Aiden's cousin) had something going on when they met at the club, but then they ended up separated and screwing other people like bunnies.  Second, I thought Anya and Lucian (Aiden's son) had something going on because they had lots of sex and he turned her into a vampire.  But that was just another screw also.  Toward the end of the story, the author left something hanging between Anya and Nicholas after all.  WTF? I think it would have been better just killing off Anya's character.  I don't care for possible mates to meet, don't realize it and continue to have sex with other people.  Although this was the first installment to the series, there was already another couple mated (Jodi and Ethan).  I don't' care for this either, because after about two to three books in the series, the author will most likely go back and tell Jodi and Ethan's story.  Why not just start with them first?  All in all, I did enjoy Aiden's story and will continue to read the series.

$review_text.: Now that the shock from a diagnosis of dementia for my father has gotten a little easier, I went looking for educational information and ran across this little e-book.  I'm not sure what I was expecting to find since I am new to this, but the amount of information it gives in all the different areas is very helpful.  Right now I am focused on creating a timeline for the disease so we can be prepared as possible during each stage.  Although the doctor gave us a general idea of how long until the worst times come, I don't remember much of that conversation.  This book gives the different stages from early onset all the way through and the average length of time we have in each stage before he gets worse.  While it is a scary disease and we will deal with a lot of suffering, just having the information on what is happening and what comes next makes it a little easier to think about the coming years.  On the practical side, it offers many suggestions for safe-proofing the home that we may not have thought of until too late.  Very grateful I ran across this book to help manage a very painful time in our lives.
$SUMMARY.: So helpful when dealing with such a painful disease.

$review_text.: I bought this as an audible book.  I thought since this author had historically wrote about his own extra terrestrial contact experience, this book might echo some of the fresh experience that his first book "Communion" had.  Considering that his encounter with "The Master of the Key", I expected some kind of revelation and a greater understanding to the Extra terrestrial phenomenon.  Sorry Mr Strieber, I wished it were better.  Truly.  To ME (and perhaps only me) it was a very big disappointment.First, the "Master" provides evasive answers to pointedly direct questions.  The conversation as well as the answers are completely from  religious standpoint.  The fact that all the questions and answers are related to the major religions of the world and their respective theories I found this book to be full of rhetoric and a clever medley blending of religious ideology.  The "Master" doesn't say who he is.  He also says the extra terrestrials are here to help in one chapter and then says they are enemies and implies they are demons.  I get the impression that  the author steers clear of direct answers that might be invasive or offensive in some ways so the answers are cleverly designed to answer with another question or a interesting spin to divert the conversation in another direction so that no one can pin down a clear concept.  It makes me feel that Mr. Strieber is having a conversation with himself.  It sounds like he has written a play in which he plays both the curious human and the mysterious Jesus like/angel like human looking wise one.  Sort of like the Melchizedek of the old testament.The book claims that UFO's are demonic.  The author draws his answers through superstition and fear without any basis for his answers.  Selectively ignoring the scriptures that indicate demons and fallen angels are earthbound, he makes fear mongering statements about UFO's that are sheep skinned over with philosophical conversation.  They conversation goes round and round and round again, through a maze of dogmatic perspectives.Early on in the book, almost like a waiver of reliability, the author states he could have imagined the whole thing.  Sorry, but this whole thing smacks of religious preaching shrouded in a blanket of contemporary sci-fi mystery.Clearly the author struggles to make peace with all religions by indicating the original message of religions in the world changed the original messages of insight not long after their original inspirations.  That much is true.  However banding these religions together and quoting scriptures and riddling every point into shades of grey, then condemning the UFO's and Extra Terrestrial Contact experience as demonic, seems by design, a ploy to confuse the suseptible readers into accepting a fearful point of view.  It is clearly designed for a knee jerk fear response.  Is he doing this to perhaps distance himself from his original Contact experience he had when he wrote Communion? The  "Master" and the author soundboard each other almost too well.There are some interesting comments about energetic sciences and quantum physics, the nature of our spirit as being physical which challenges the average person's concepts of life death and the soul.  If reading this helps people get out of their limited reality box for a different perspective, I suppose it might be worth reading for some people.I have had Contact experiences all my life.  I am presently working on my own book about this subject of which I have had much experience and I will tell you - the Beings I have been in contact with are gentle benevolent, extremely wise, and are here to help.  Whether they are golden haired and carry a regal beautiful countenance or they are the short humble looking Grays it has been my experience that these beings have a great deal of harmony and peace with each other and are working on different missions in order to help peacefully advance our intelligence while helping preserve the planet.  There are beings who also do not have good intentions and they do influence the world around us.  But these are in the very small minority and are not in the skies above us flying around in space ships.  There is so much more to the Extra Terrestrial equation than what meets the eye.  I think Mr. Strieber has missed the whole picture here even though he claims the Master has the key.  One thing I have learned is that being exposed to these advances beings will clean out your own closet and make you see yourself.  If you are looking for truth are willing to let go of the social brainwashing that blinds our society, and you grow beyond your own instinctive fears, this book is NOT for you.  This book creates fear and continues the pattern of "us" verses "them" which has plagued mankind for thousands of years.  This book preaches fear and obedience to a judgmental god at its roots.  If we follow its ideas, we will be right back in the stone age throwing rocks at each other doing the same fear game all over again.So it is up to you about this book.  If you have some religious predujudices that nees fixin' and some lingering fears and suspicions that the world is being invaded by demons flying in UFO's, this book may be for you because it follows that pattern. If you have overcome your fears and want to look truth in the face, you probably may want to pass this book up for something a bit higher on the spiritual evolutionary scale.There are other authors like Jim Moroney, Steven Greer, Jeff Becker, and many others that have a very fair perspective on the subject of our own evolution and the influence of Extra Terrestrial and UFO involvement.

$review_text.: I liked this book. I thought the artwork was marvelous and interesting and well executed, and you certainly couldn't have a more fascinating and exciting topic than the battle at the Hot Gates; but all in all I couldn't see giving the book more than Four Stars.My principle difficulty with the book was the story itself - and no I'm not bothered like others are by Miller's wandering away from historical truth.  My objections instead stem from the sometimes lame conversation, and by the rather silly addition of the betraying hunchback. Why that was necessary I can't guess. Perhaps the need to add some gruesome character at point 'b'.  In any case, it took a rather well-done, shall we say, fanciful retelling of the Persian-Greek battle and made it puerile.Four Stars. [B-] Fun read. Excellent artwork. But with a plot that is undermined here and there by less than adult turns.  Violence, of course, but not nearly as graphic as some would have you believe.If you would like another fictionalization check out Stephen Pressfield's book "Gates of Fire".Gates of Fire - An Epic Novel of the Battle of ThermopylaeFor the real thing, check out Herodotus' history:The Histories (Penguin Classics)Bradford's bookThermopylae: The Battle for the WestPeter Green's bookThe Greco-Persian WarsPam T~

Its not the typical Amish storyline & i almost felt sorry for Becky, one of the main characters. But i am coming to find out by reading these Amish stories that they don't express their feelings as freely as Englisch. I will admit the ending was rather abrupt to end but still an excellent read.

$review_text.: My Superhero Sister by Toni LoTempio is a light, fun read

One you could probably read in one sitting

I loved all the aspects of a traditional superhero story, with the story not actually being about the superhero, but her very normal little sister


Holly is the focus of MSS, but she is a wonderful character
She's smart, funny and has a little bit of an unusual hobby
She likes to collect bugs
Her fascination with them plays a pivotal role in the story too
Her and her sister Ellen have a normal sibling relationship, it's just Ellen has super powers


Holly is of course sometimes slightly envious of her sister, but realizes being a superhero is not as fun as she thinks
She has a great relationship with her parents


Her mother is very loving and worries about her little half superhero family


Her father is a vet in his downtime, being the other superhero in their family


Anti-hero is the bad guy and is of course bent on world domination
He's one of those smart-dumb people

You can't help but dislike him


It ends up being Holly who mostly saves the day with an unexpected transformation
She has the help of her best friend Mona, and Mona's uncle Professor Kane

I would say this is a book for younger readers, maybe the 10-15 year olds

The story is engaging and the characters are fun


There is a little romance, but it's only G rated and is very cute and sweet

I found quite a bit of the story funny, it made me smile
If you're after something for your younger readers then grab a copy of My Superhero Sister, you won't be disappointed.

The thematic arrangement of kinds of collectors  and the manner in which the artist/collectors utilized their collections is  both inspirational and delightful to look at.

They just leaped off the page at me and became my friends. Mac was really so blessed, except for one thing, his mother. His Mother leaving influenced all the decisions in his life, and not in a good way. Jordan had to work very hard to tear down those walls. Jordan had to make some major changes in his life to love Mac, and he wouldn't  let Mac  sabotage their life. Jordan was strong enough to chase after Mac when he ran. Oh I loved him too... Mac was very lucky with his Dad and brother too, the accepted him without question.

I guess I'm too much of an optimist....I know retail can be hard...the hours, the moods of every single person affected by the tides and the moons and well, HORMONES...but, still...in every job there is a silver lining. These horrifying retail chronicles were a collection of many story tellers from all walks of character, life and career...but they just didn't have enough positive spin for me. Maybe I'm a dreamer...but I have always thought there is more to this adventure we call life than our superficial immediate response to the obvious. "

$REVIEW.: Intriguiing, captivating, suspenseful, love story, eye-opener.  Jihad has skillfully captured the political and street warfare of the 70s and 80s as black power rises and judicial power suppresses and destroys the black communities.  This story reveals that the people have to have faith, be steadfast to withhold what the government throws and plants in the way of progression.  Moses King is a King and for the people, but he is caught in the midst of political warfare and has to be de-throwned.  His Disciples are strong and when the vision is distorted and split, it divides those close to him.  Rhythm being in college is intrigued with Moses and offers to help him get justice.  Picasso is true to the form as a brother and friend to Moses, moreso than Solomon who has not contacted his own blood since being back from war and spreading the Word of God.  When Moses meets the LAW, he is enlightened to the judicial system and the change of events for his street gang "The Disciples."  As the story unfolds, you find that what seems one way is really another and you have to be clever and knowledgeable, have the unshattering faith, be trustworthy and patient so you will be able to move mountains.  In war you always have some casualties, but you must believe in the cause if you are willing to die for the cause.  Jihad has encircled a life of black people trying to be suppressed, with the skillful power of street smarts, along with book smarts, and of course the Undeniable Faith in the ONly GoD and dreams become reality and visions are clear.  You will not be able to figure out the outcome of this tale, you will not be able to know what is on the next page until you get to it.  Very well structed and captured true essence of out government and our people.  Much Love to Jihad for covering ground that people have forgotten,the corrupt government and the ignorance of people.  You will fall for all the characters and be shouting "One free" and talking back as if you are in the book.  Solomon, Picasso, Moses, Rhythm, T-Hunt, Momma King, Law... you will feel like part of the family when it concludes, understanding the drug ring, the streets, the government, aw man I forgot another character that is enlightening "Juicy".  Go get this book and then tell me what you think.  I dare you to read it and write a review.

$review_text.: Sydney Green is a publicist fighting to keep her clients from being stolen by an associate and doing everything she can to keep lover/client actor Blake McKinley happy, going above and beyond what most people would consider reasonable. When he decides he wants to better his image by supporting a cause, they pick one that other celebrities haven't yet touched. Sydney heads off to a Foundation volunteer camp for one month in Alaska in order to produce a short documentary about walruses, figuring she can work from there.She questions what's the big deal about some walruses dying off due to the effects of global warming? We find out in a lighthearted manner as Sydney, definitely out of her element with none of the amenities she's used to, gets more involved than she ever expected. What she learns and experiences change her life and give her the chance to reevaluate what's important to her.It's obvious the author has done a great deal of research on the subject, but the way it's presented to us is far from textbook format. I found the characters and story enjoyable as Sydney adjusts to the primitive living conditions and the prejudices others have towards such a greenhorn. But it really took off for me when Sydney gets more involved and learns why the work they are doing is so important.I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of information we're provided in this book while still maintaining such a fun story.

$review_text.: I received this book a while back for review from the author and though it took me quite some time to actually get to it (you know, so many books, so little time...) --and trust me, I wish I had read it sooner now -- I finally read it! I just want to thank to author again for being so nice to send the paperback version to me. This book was quite a ride for me and I really feel like I found a new favorite series to add to my shelves! &lt;331-year-old Zoey Porter who works as a PR person. Every since her husband died, she puts up a wall trying to keep people, especially men, at a distance. She doesn't even let her boss, Ethan, who she's sleeping with, get close to her. When her firm sends her to the winery of a new client, Andre, she's startled to find out he's the one she had an almost one-night stand with him over a year ago. Surprisingly, Andre ignites feelings within her she thought died along with her husband. But Andre isn't an ordinary man and has secrets... Secrets that will change everything for Zoey and that will drag her into a world of blood, passion and possibly love.Age-old Andre Maras is a vampire who has been driving from his homeland in Croatia a long time ago and suffers from the wasting disease but thinks to have finally found a cure in the wine he makes. He wants to not only cure himself but also his fellow refugees. When Zoey arrives at his estate to help them with the PR of the wine, he has to control his urges to bite her in fear of blood bonding with her. The one thing he vowed to never do again is bond with someone after the dead of his wife. But the thing about Zoey is, he can't stay away from her.Zoey was an engaging main character to read about. I liked her from the start and all her reactions to Andre, also when she found out what he is was nicely done by the author. I also loved how she made friends with the women in Andre's household. I liked that she opened up a little to them too and not only Andre.I must admit though as a character on his own Andre wasn't my favorite character from everyone in the book but it wasn't like I disliked him or anything. I did love him and Zoey together. They had so much chemistry and some very passionate romantic scenes. Gotta love that! And, damn, I loved the ending!I haven't been this excited about a vampire book in quite a while, obviously. Lately all vampire books I read were mediocre to say the least. But Blood Vine? It was amazing! I was really surprised by how good it was and how fascinated I was by the story. Amber Belldene did such a great job making the book so interesting to read, not only about the vampires but also about all the other characters and the winery too. Blood Vine is definitely different compared to other vampire books. It's such an original story and it does not only feature Zoey and Andre. And though I love reading about both of them, I am also so intrigued and excited to learn more about the other characters like Andre's sons, Kos and Bel. I admit I was the tiniest but obsessed with them. *fans herself* I also loved Pedro (he's a riot!) and Lucas (who's Ethan's brother) so so so much. I can't even start to explain how much I hope they're going to end up together. With some unexpected events their whole relationship has become very intriguing.Ethan is a whole different story. He's what we would call the bad guy in the book. And being a vampire hunter he has his own twisted reasons for wanted Andre, his sons and his whole household dead. Basically, he's a bastard. But damn it if I don't love reading about bad guys. I wonder what he's going to be up to next and how it will continue all!There were a lot of facts about how a winery works that I never knew before. I loved the aspects about it and how it all fits together with vampires and what they discovered about that wine. Obviously the author knew a lot about stuff like this and did good research and that's what every author should do.Amber Belldene's writing was flawless. Yes, it was. I have no negatives to say It was fast-paced, always entertaining and I loved the multiple points of view so we could learn more about the others too. Much love for that!An imaginative, romantic and absorbing read, Blood Vine by Amber Belldene had me quickly hooked with its intriguing story about vampires and vine yards. In short; I loved it. I was captivated by the story and the characters the autor created. It was one of the best books I have read so far this year and can't wait to get my hands on the second book because I just need more. I would highly recommend Blood Vine to everyone!

$review_text.: I read this book specifically to better understand a CEO's perspective in starting a company and then coming back to save it. Howard Schultz's very personalized account demonstrates the commitment needed to keep a vision and mission statement going as later leaders start to vary from the initial vision and as the economy inevitably affects the business. Schultz casts some blame on leaders who succeeded him, but most of Starbucks' issues seemed to be caused by the recession more so than internal decisions. If one recalls how many personal finance experts were recommending to skip the $4 latte as a way of saving money, this loss of business they suffered through 2008-9 shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.With that said, the book was still interesting in seeing the difficulty of micro-focusing on each individual customer experience while simultaneously macro-focusing on growth. There are definitely advantages to being on every street corner, but the more spread out the company becomes the harder it is to make that experience unique but consistent for those who want the same product and experience in any location, fast but leisurely for those who aren't in a hurry, and successful for the company that can't help but focus on growth when opening multiple stores every day. Schultz effectively describes all the variables he considered through this time period to "thread the needle" to get the best of this small and big focus.While it's hard to recognize that the successful companies we depend upon are typically short-lived, this book does a good job of showing why. A founder's focus and commitment to the original vision for a company is difficult to pass on to successors who have to be equally if not more committed to pushing it forward and adapting to changing customer tastes and competitive threats. As Schultz points out here, his successors couldn't accomplish that even though they were good people. Like Michael Dell of Dell Computer, Schultz cared and resolved to come back and make the necessary adjustments to carry Starbucks through. The average CEO probably wouldn't do that. And--as other reviewers have observed--what will happen the next time Schultz retires. It's why so many businesses don't last over extended periods and inevitably submit to competitors who come up with better ideas.Even several years after it was published, this book is a good read to understand these long-term challenges that all businesses face. Today--as Sears, J.C. Penney and (gasp) even Walmart--seem destined to fail, "Onward" helps to explain why killer business models must be constantly tweaked or else they will eventually stagger and then fail.

Book four does not put a lot of focus on how book five is going to come together and I was prepared to stop reading this particular series depending on how Cooper worked out.The scene with the ex- girlfriend seemed to come out of nowhere which is why I gave four stars instead of five.Kudos to Ms. Sloan.  She did a great job on turning it around.  I really like this series and look forward to reading more (provided there are not many more scenes like the tragedy that occurred in book 3).

$REVIEW.: A killer is on the loose near the small town of Huntsville, Maine. Four months ago, he ritualistically killed two people and kidnapped three others. Unfortunately, he escaped and his whereabouts has stymied the police. Danny Sullivan's sister, Jayne, was kidnapped by the killer and narrowly escaped. Jayne is again at home in Philadelphia but lives in fear that the killer will find her. Frustrated, Danny returns to Huntsville determined to track down the killer.Although Danny did not rescue Jayne, he did save Mandy Brown, Hunstville's bed and breakfast owner, from an attack by the killer. Danny is attracted to Mandy. Nonetheless, Mandy is the logical person for him to begin his investigation. He is perplexed by her unwillingness to answer his questions. What does she have to hide?Mandy does have a secret that could destroy her family. She unwittingly had an affair with the killer about which she is ashamed. More importantly, she is receiving threats of harm to her ill mother and mentally challenged brother if she reveals the relationship to anyone.Mandy continually rebuffs Danny, although it becomes obvious that the attraction is mutual. Regardless of the the growing feelings between them, she must keep her secret from the charming, sexy and ever persistent Danny. She wants to trust Danny but fears what he will think of her because of the affair.People begin disappearing and it appears that the killer is preparing for another of his ritualistic murders. It soon becomes apparent that the killer is obsessed with Mandy. Will she be able to keep her family safe? Will Danny be able to protect Mandy? Will the killer deprive Danny and Mandy of a future?Jayne's story is told in Midnight Exposure, the first book of this compelling series. I prefer to read books in a series in order but it is not necessary. Midnight Sacrifice is a stand-alone read.I highly recommend Midnight Sacrifice to any reader who genuinely enjoys Romantic Suspense, that is, a balance between the two genres.I received an ARC of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: At the foot of the Lincoln Memorial's statue, a solitary figure held the gathered mixed race audience enthralled as they listened to her extraordinary voice soar above them.  World renown contralto, Marian Anderson delivered an Easter morning performance that held the crown spellbound.  When she sang her final notes there was silence, then an enthusastic crowd pressed forward, many believing they had seen a once in a lifetime event..  As Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes said as he had introduced the artist..."In this great auditorium under they sky all of us are free.  ...Genius like justice is blind.  For genius has touched with the tip of her wing this woman....Genius draws no color line."Much is known of the refusal of the Daughters of the American Revolution's refusal to allow Marian Anderson to perform in Constitution Hall and the extraordinary efforts made in Anderson's behalf to find a venue for the Easter morning concert.  First lady Eleanore Roosevelt tendered her resignation from the DAR as a result of this refusal.  Not as much is known about the constrained, refined, articulate woman who was in the eye of this storm.  Marian Anderson began performing at an early age. The Anderson family was of modest means and her father's death made the chance of musical instruction remote.  Local churches attempted to assist, but her father's death required Marion to quit school and go to work to help the family.  Through contacts with other black musicians she slowly began to study and develop her gift. As many blacks found in the first half of the 20th century, Europe was more accepting and there she found her first sustained success and audiences who embraced her as an artist. The refusal of the DAR was one of many refusals to allow Anderson to perform with  racially mixed audiences recieving equal access to her performances.A marked trait throughout Anderson's career was her fierce sense of privacy and independence.  That very trait makes an indepth biography of the singer difficult. Through a simple timeline of Anderson's life, education, travels, development as a singer and performer, family life (what little was made available for the public) and her influence on the civil rights movement and furthering education for other blacks.  Raymond Arsenault has culled countless sources, magazines, newspapers of the era, recollections of others involved and interviews of some who were in the audience that historic morning.  Anderson had no children of her own, but other remaining family provided a glimpse of this " powerful presence, charismatic, radiating grace and compassion." who forced a country to look at itself and to try to change what it did not like in its reflection.

$REVIEW.: I originally picked this series up because of a recommendation from a trusted friend and I am so glad that I did. I was in a reading slump and really needed something to help pull me out of it and I became so immersed in these that I ended up reading all three of these books over the weekend and I must say, they really pulled me out of my funk.These were such cute and fun reads and I have loved watching Dylan and Cami grow together and even though nothing ever seems to be easy for these two I am was so happy with the way this ended.They can be predictable at times but the romance and sweet moments between Cami and Dylan are worth every second of the time it takes to pick them up and dive right in.

 A tragic waste of the life of an unknown tree, and of a publisher's capital, for naught

In Sept

2005 Steven Carlson published a rather brilliant debunking and analyzis of Smith's clever literary hoax


Turns out Smith was subtly satirizing the pretentions of biblical scholarship for 40 years

$review_text.: This is a great book

I give it a high recommendation

I'm an application programmer, not a systems programmer nor a software engineer
VB and SQL are just my speed and most 4GLs and scripting languages are too
I may not be a progamming genius but my attitude is 'how hard can it be?'


I will try to hack anything I can before I ask for help, but when I ask for help, I want the full complete definitive answer


That's why this book is for me

I have never coded a lick of javascript before, then one day I had to write some cookie stuff
Fine, how hard can it be? I go out onto the web and look for (and borrow) other cookie code


I find a little bit here and a little bit there


It looks very simple but ultimately none of it works for my problem

Finally I say, I'm going to have to learn this stuff
Might as well by the O'Reilly book

My attitude is that I may never have to do anything with Javascript again, but I'm also not about to waste money on a book if I'll have replace later if and when I get serious


And this book was worth it

I now have industrial strength overkill cookie code in my application plus I undertand why everything works as it does
If you have to ask, you might as well ask for it all

This book has it all

Now I can't give it 5 stars because it's outdated
There's a lot of stuff in it that doesn't apply to the latest browsers

There was nothing about Mozilla or IE 5, so that all needs to be updated


But what's there is good so you get to understand the development priorities of those browsers and what effect that has on ways you should code
All in all it's another home run for OReilly, but Flanagan needs to step up to the plate again

BTW you'll note that this book is often referenced in other good progammer's guides

&quot;Definitive&quot; is right.

Maybe it was me but I was confused along the way.  I understand that the story/plot was about lasting love overcoming at least that is what I thought it was suppose to be about.  So I stuck to it, but it seemed like it was all over the place.  One minute it was talking about how she hated him and what not then the next they were kissing.  I really don't want to get to deep into the story because I don't want to give anything away.  Again if I had to chose all over again I would have just read the sample and let it go.  I was looking @ the price and the length of the book and going off the sample.  I had to stop to write this review maybe it will be better by the end like another reader advised but this is my take on it.

You are taken on a journey through his eyes, thoughts, and emotions as he takes you on his personal journey through his military life. It's very enlightening and entertaining. It almost makes one want to jump in a time machine and go back to that time and enlist so you could experience it all yourself first hand. He makes you feel like your almost there sometimes. It's living history, the kind you don't have a chance to aquaint yourself with in this day of super heroes and special effects. He also adds in his brand of humor which makes all the better.

In chapter after chapter, I could see the enormous efforts these writers went to in order to find what's interesting and important in the rabbit's story, and to lay out its most controversial elements fairly.  Hooray, hooray.  This is truly a gift to people who raise animals--and a badly needed moral weathervane for the industries that do business with animals.

$REVIEW.: After the first Breakers book the next book started out with all new characters
And, like George Martin you could never figure out who was to be zapped
Finally, the 3rd book kind of caught most of the characters up


Then came the prequel...wowser

Cool short story
Then reapers added a character but took the prequel the next stage

All 4 1/3 books are well done and in toto a good 4.5 or so


This one will get a five but remember some of the 4s I give deserve a half star...2 bucks for the trilogy, free prequel and maybe $3 or thereabouts for Reapers
Hard to imagine that many good books for about $5

Buy em and give em a try...it is just 1 less starbucks or 1 kid with a value meal.

I REALLY enjoyed most of the book. The writing is excellent and I loved the story my problem is that while that is perfect for audiences of all ages there is language and adult content that is absolutely inappropriate for most young adults. I do realize that what is written is nothing more than many teens hear or are exposed to in their schools, however, that doesn't make it something they should all read.My advice is that if you and your child are not bothered by this - absolutely grab Josh's books! He's an amazing writer.However, if you're on the fence get one of his books and make your own decision. As for me - my children won't be reading this.More...Author: Joshua SilvermanSource: AuthorGrade: BAges: There is some quite graphic and inappropriate content.

$review_text.: As a whole, I thought "Cracked Dreams" was written well.  You can tell that the author took his time to make sure the writing was on point.  But then that leaves the storyline.  There was nothing new here to make this book stand out from the oversaturation of urban fiction out there right now.I, like many other fans of this genre, have been reading the urban fiction of the new millenium where Iceberg Slim and Donald Goines left off.  I'm talkin' since Sister Souljah had to fight to get the "Coldest Winter Ever" in major bookstores and Terri Woods was selling books out of the trunk of her car while  staying "True To The Game".  Since those 5 or 6 years have passed there have been many books put out just to jump on the "hood tale" bandwagon.Now with that said, I'll repeat that I feel "Cracked Dreams" was written by a true author that did his homework but he gave you nothing new.  Boy lives in the hood, boy has a crew, boy and crew decide to make money in the drug game, boy and crew live it up, boy and crew die.  Tell me what's new about that.  I don't mind reading these books as long as there's some type of new spin on it.  You have to keep these storylines fresh.  I think that Michael Baptiste is a promising author and challenge him to do better next time.  We all have to start somewhere.

$REVIEW.: This is an outstanding novella. I loved how each chapter was told from the POV of separate characters. Sometimes this can be boring, because you end up reading the same scene several different times from only slightly different perspectives. But this didn't happen at all.The beginning of the story was sweet. The relationship between the father and the daughter came across very cute and believable. The father clearly adored his little girl, and it definitely came through in the book. He (John) was only moving to the place named Paradise because of his love for his family. He wanted them to be safe and secure.But after a while, I started getting the sense that perhaps going to Paradise wasn't going to make his family any safer. And it concerned me. As I continued to read, the sense that something wasn't quite right grew in the back of my mind, just as it grew in the minds of some of the characters. I found myself hoping that Michael Judd would hurry and save John's family, save all of the people being sent to Paradise, which might possibly be just another name for Hell.I loved the mystery surrounding the futuristic Earth. I got bits and pieces of it's history and it's laws, which were cleverly woven in throughout the dialogue and character's thoughts. I found myself trying to fill in the missing pieces and I love when books make me do that.My only problem with this story is that I felt a bit cheated at the end. After all, I didn't get to find out what happened to John's family and I wasn't able to figure out exactly what was wrong with Paradise. But then I realized that the author seems to be seriously considering a sequel. So now I just have to play the waiting game. And after I re-read the ending, I realized that it was actually a very good way to end it. We know the rest of Earth is safe from Paradise (for now) and we know that John's family is alive. But where are they? And what will the rest of Earth do about Paradise? I guess I'll just have to wait for the next installation.

$review_text.: Peter Block's book is one of the most interesting I have read in a very long time


It is a gold mine of practical insights that will assist us in our quest to bring kingdom transformation to our communities


I will attempt to give you a brief summary that contains some of the key thoughts that impacted me


In some cases, I will simply use quotations from the book and let them speak for themselves


Block has brought together the thinking of several key people in the area of community development and transformation, which makes it all the more valuable and a real time saver.A few years ago, Mark Medley introduced Masterbuilders to Strengthsfinder assessments available through the Gallup organization that are extremely beneficial for team building


The premise is that we can achieve more as a team and as individuals by focusing on our strengths and delegating our weaknesses

Block quotes John McKnight: "...the act of labeling [people as to their limits or deficiencies]...is what diminishes the capacity of people to fulfill their potential

If we care about transformation, we will stay focused on gifts, to such an extent that our work becomes simply to bring the gifts of those on the margin into the center." (p.13) The Bible calls this "encouragement," whereby we use faith and prophetic insight to identify and activate what God has put into people, without feeling the need of pointing out what is missing in the individual

The Law points out our deficiencies, but grace is always faith and gift based.Block writes: "This is in no way a denial of our limitations, just a recognition that they are not who we are


I am not what I am not able to do

I am what I am able to do, my gifts and capacities." (p.140) I am convinced that we sometimes err by trying tell people what they can or cannot do by placing labels on them from the top down

Instead we should encourage people to follow God and step out in faith


The top-down model of leadership is a bottleneck for the move of God's Spirit

None of us who are in leadership are immune from this tendency to control


Instead of trying to label and categorize people up front, why not reserve that until later, if we like, more as a matter of looking back and celebrating the grace of God.Block lists five strategic principles that can lead to true transformation in our communities

(pp.30-31)The essential work is to build social fabric
When citizens care for each other, they become accountable to each other
This is nothing new

When we put a face on a need, it becomes personal and we cannot ignore it any longer
We have always known that relationship building is the key, but when it comes to planning, we usually revert to what we have always done by limiting input to a small core of leaders which effectually works to break down the relationships we so long for among the rank and file
Unless people have a sense of ownership, they are not as likely to commit themselves.Strong associational life is essential and central

 Creating connectedness becomes both the end and the means
Associational life is volitional aspect of community - how citizens choose to build connections for their own sake, usually for a common purpose

This is in contrast to forced participation based on retribution, censure, or exclusion.Leaders use their power to convene "citizens" are able to create an alternative future
Unless citizens [church members] take ownership of the process, nothing transformational will take place
Citizen participation and ownership is more important than decisions by institutions and formal leadership.The small group is the unit of transformation
It is the place where people's uniqueness can be valued and engagement takes place

We must set aside the demands of scale and speed in interest of building relationally.All transformation is linguistic
If we want to change the community, we must change the conversation
The conversation is directed by the leader or convener who is able to ask the right questions to lead people to engage and take ownership.Block contrasts what he calls the patriarchal, corporate, top down, or retributive justice mindset that focuses on problem solving, blame casting, and punishment with the transformative mindset that focuses on possibility [read, faith], generosity [read, grace and hospitality], and gifts [read, our using what God has put in us]


The former mindset seeks to control the future and make it an extension of the past and present; whereas, the latter is not afraid to embrace the possibility of very different future

I found that Block's thoughts in this area are quite instructive and illuminating regarding the nature of faith.Regarding the role of leadership, he writes: "The search for great leadership is a prime example of how we too often take something that does not work and try harder at it


I have written elsewhere about reconstructing leader as social architect

Not leader as a special person, but leader as a citizen willing to do those things that have the capacity to initiate something new in the world." (p.86) "The core task of leadership is to create the conditions for civic and institutional [church] engagement

They do this through the power they have to name the debate and design gatherings." (p.86) Later in the book, Block shows how asking the right questions can lead people into taking ownership rather than continuing in the consumerist-entitlement mindset in which we expect others to take care of things on our behalf
This is where the book is truly ingenious
I will not try to explain how it is done, just whet your appetite."This [view] is very different from the conventional belief that the task of leadership is to set a vision, enroll others in it, and hold people accountable through measurements and reward...[which] creates a level of isolation, entitlement, and passivity that our communities [churches] cannot afford to carry...The world does not need leaders to better define issues, or to orchestrate better planning or project management


What it needs is for the issues and the plans to have more of an impact, and that comes from citizen [church member] accountability and commitment." (p.87) But lest you think this happens through pressure from the top down, it does not
I will not spoil your joy of discovering his breakthrough thinking on this matter by revealing it here


You need to read the book!One of Block's chapter titles is "Questions Are More Transforming than Answers." He writes: "The future is brought into the present when citizens engage each other through questions of possibility, commitment, dissent, and gifts

Questions open the door to the future and are more powerful than answers in that they demand engagement
Engagement is what creates accountability
How we frame questions is decisive
They need to be ambiguous, personal, and stressful." (p.101) If this does not pique your curiosity, this is not the book for you! "The point is that the nature of the questions we ask either keeps the existing system in place or brings an alternative future into the room." (p.104)  "[Improper questions are] a response to the wish to create a predictable future
We want desperately to take uncertainty out of the future
But when we take uncertainty out, it is no longer the future


It is the present projected forward


Nothing new can come from the desire for a predictable tomorrow." (p.105) Is that not a clarion call to living by faith?Block writes: "We have to realize that each time people enter a room, they walk in with ambivalence, wondering whether this is the right place to be
This is because the default mindset is that someone else owns the room, the meeting, and the purpose that convened the meeting....The leader/convener has to act to change this...The intent is to move the social contract from parenting to partnership." (p.128) I believe that Block is getting at the heart of the difference between grace and legalism
Legalism has always elevated leaders over the people, something that Jesus taught against by saying that the greatest leaders are the servants of all

Grace elevates everyone to be kings and priests and ministers
If the Spirit of the Lord is going to accomplish through his church everything he desires, our leadership mentality must change even more than it has

Unless we engage people in such a way that motivates them to take responsibility to obey God, use their gifts, and fulfill their callings, it will probably never happen

Unless we abandon the consumerist desire to have people in constant need of us, we are not going to bring in an alternative future


Block is giving us some wonderful keys to help this happen, if we are willing to learn and put them into practice

This is scary, but only if we do not trust God to be our Keeper, Provider, and Shepherd.The last part of the book shows how leaders can bring people together and ask the right questions to help people engage, take ownership, and commit themselves to work in partnership to see something new take place

Even though this is a "secular" book, it is chock full of biblical truth and well worth a careful study
I hope you will read it and let me know what you get out of it.You can purchase the reviewer's book on Amazon:Seeing God's Smile

$review_text.: I had high hopes for this novel based on all the hype I read about it

 What a disappointment


 The writing is good but the story reminds me of an episode of 90210


 The tease in the beginning regarding the reason behind Thea's banishment is what kept me reading, but it doesn't take long to figure out what she did that resulted in her being sent away
 The characters in general are shallow and mean-spirited, especially the girls at the camp
 The horses in the book are more finely drawn, with personalities and likable characteristics, than are the people
 Thea herself starts out pretty interesting, but her overwhelming preoccupation with sex is off-putting, and her acting out on her raging hormones is unattractive
 The male figures are weak and uninteresting and, note to the Headmaster, sex with an underage girl is called rape.

$review_text.: I gave it 3 stars cause it was more than once I wanted to throw my kindle across my room. I just dont understand this author and her thinking. when someone finds the love that her and david has why destroy it. why make her fall in love with so many other men. why make her feel at home wit david but then have these damn feelings for jason. I really just dont get it. she needs to understand what a vampire is and what they eat. she also shouldnt keep things from david dont agree to marry someone and then always argue with them because ur so damn stubborn to talk about whats wrong. she is so weak I don't she where anyone can see shes strong. I think its wrong that I have a feeling in the next book shes gonna be a slut and try to sleep with anyone and poor david has to suffer to know that is mon amor was touched by another vampire. if u truly love someone u will not no matter how much u want something will u give into it. another thing she seems to forget is how vampires have powers of lust so they all could b making her like that of always wanting them. I really dont like ara much and its annoying me. im debating if I should even read the next one bc I know itll be so much drama imma want to throw my damn kindle again.

All the characters were well rounded. Jass and Laurie were likeable but very real with flaws and foibles. Susie was a believabled 5 year old - not written too young or old for her age.

$review_text.: This book was recommended to me and now I'm recommending it. It is filled with real life drama - there is definitely adventure and more. By sneaking aboard a Dutch ship that is headed to the New World. Many will be able to relate to this in the sense of something new being conquered. We live in a world to where we all often think about starting over and I am one who thinks that if we look more at what has happened in our past/history we can learn more about ourselves.Alfred is disheartened by the attitude of the sailors that he has set out with and he decides to stay in the New World for a new start. His story continues without being over the top, which is good. He wants to find himself in his own way and not be defined by what his family states he should be - a part of the new spirit of going to somewhere new. I felt I was still a viewer to history and not that I was purposely being entertained like on television.I'm wanting to know more and hope that this story continues. If you are a lover of history you will want to read this book.

$REVIEW.: What an unbelievable series. I am speechless at the heartfelt agony the characters go through.I can't even count how many times I was close to tears or how many times I did cry. But it's not all sad. There are tons of times my heart lept for joy for Emily and Paul.Emily's strength is so strong. I couldn't imagine going through all the pain and fevers she goes through and she still had the strenght to say "I'm ok,I'll be fine". She is the strongest willed soul in her situation,that alone makes you love her character even more than you already do.And Paul,for everything he did for her to make her dieing wishes come true.You fall in love with his character right from the start.He is her hero.He ends up falling in love with Emily.And to watch him go through the fight with her will make you love him even more.The part were she was at her worse on the brink of dieing like to rip my heart out!I felt his pain,I grieved with him,I felt connected to him at that point.Because I know the feeling of helplessness.When it came time to pull the plug on my 24 year old son,I know that pain all to well. The feeling of failure,of loss,of letting that person down.There are no words to explain that deep feeling of nothingness.This series is must read! I loved it and am so glad I came across it.

$review_text.: Drought follows Ruby, a girl with blood that heals.  Ruby is the Daughter of Otto, her cult's leader who has left his flock.  The congregation willingly allows themselves to be enslaved and beaten as they gather Water (water pulled off plants with a Drop of Ruby's blood which makes it magical so they can live almost forever).  The group takes a drop of Water as communion and wait for Otto's return.I was excited by the initial premise of this book but after a hundred pages of rolling my eyes at the implausible (the group is just accepting of their slavery and does not try to change things even though they know that the world around them would be kinder) and the bratty behavior of a girl who is supposed to be 200 years old and the constant talk of Otto I finally decided that I couldn't force myself to read anymore.This is not a dystopian but rather a book that takes place in a dreary cult like situation. It is not a quick and easy read and not one that I believe will speak to a wide range of readers.

$REVIEW.: This book is rather different than the comic books. In that Batman, painted by Alex Ross, is portrayed as if he were real. In the comic book Batman/Bruce Wayne is supposed to be in his mid 30's yet he looks as if he were carved by the hands of Michelangelo.  Whereas in this book he looks more in synch with a large man in his mid 30's with thinning hair, portly physique etc.  The costume is also more realistic in the comic book (as in all comic books) the fabric seems to mould every muscle of the body. In this book the costume envelops the body more the way that clothes usually do.The story appears to fall more realistically than the comic book too. I still prefert to read the comic books, but if you are a Batman fan this will make a nice addition to your collection.

$REVIEW.: My Cousin Jeremy is one of those books that grabs you right at the beginning and keeps you there right to the end

 Jeremy and Clarissa are cousins who fall in love at a very young age but are torn apart by Clarissa's cold and domineering father

 In an effort to deny their feelings and to do the right thing, the two fall into other relationships, often disastrous ones

 But no matter what paths they take away from each other, they always seem to circle back.The characters were very easy to relate to, regardless of whether you liked them or not
 Clarissa was very easy to love, as the doting woman to Jeremy
 I often had to remind myself that I was reading a story set in a very different time in society because I kept wanting to tell her to stop being a doormat!  Jeremy as a sympathetic character, but one I was often very frustrated with because of his behavior

 One of my favorite characters was Dickon, although he wasn't a main character


 He was such a sweet and gentle man in the story and I really liked him,  Caroline was also a very sympathetic character, although not always the most likeable
 All of the characters, regardless of their role in the story, were very well developed and made very real.If you like a good historical romance, I definately recommend this book

 It was very emjoyable!

$REVIEW.: Wow---reading this memoir is an experience!  You get tossed straight into the world of the author---the Texas gulf coast in a shrimp fishing community.  You aren't introduced around---you just gradually figure out the relationships.  I moved at 7 from suburban life to a small lobstering town in Maine and it was a lot like reading this book!The main story here, which you gradually figure out, is that of a double murder, of the author's uncle and another man.  There are millions of distractions, though---mostly times in church, where different types of religious leaders fight for the faith of the townspeople.  Finally, a snake handler provides sort of a resolution to both strings of the story.I liked this memoir, and felt it was certainly unique writing.  However, I couldn't help getting a bit confused at times, and wishing now and then the tangled relationships were somehow explained better.  It took me a very long time to even understand that a main character, Chief, was the author's grandfather.I also sort of wished for more parts of Silver's (Diane's) life to be covered.  What was school like?  Exactly how many kids were in her family?  What even was the decade we were dealing with her?  I guess life where she grew up was somewhat timeless, and that is reflected here.  I can't really want this book to be what it isn't, because it wouldn't be the same book.  But it takes some getting used to, and it's for that reason a bit of a challenging read.

$review_text.: Katee Robert hits it out of the park with Wrong Bed, Right Guy! There's just no other way to put it. This book is sexy, hot, passionate, and flawlessly written.We meet Elle who is your normal straight laced girl. She keeps her house spotless, works in a art gallery, and is looking for Mr. Straight-laced to settle down with. To most people she appears to have a stick up her ass, and heavy on the snobby side, but the truth is she's been hurt by the bad boy type and she is trying to protect her heart. That's why her boss, Nathan, looks to be Mr. Perfect. He owns his own art gallery. He seems on the straight and arrow. He is the type of man you take home to meet the parents. Only things take a drastic turn when her plans to seduce him wind up with her in bed with his brother, Gabe. Gabe being the epitome of bad boys, and the opposite of Nathan, is pleasantly surprised to have this girl in his bed. What neither of them realized is that it's the start to something more. After all...opposites attract!My heart pulled for Elle. Even though she comes off as a frigid, stuck up chick I couldn't help but like her and root for her and Gabe from the very beginning. They are just perfect together. Even when they are arguing, which they are most of the time. Not to mention that Gabe, with all his tattoos, is super scorching hot! Like For The Love Of Hustler HOT! LOLOverall Katee Robert has proved that she can, hands down, right a sexy bad boy that you'll never be able to get enough of. I devoured each and every page!

$review_text.: I really enjoyed 'Defenders of Ulthuan', the first novel in this two-parter. As you'd expect from a sequel by the same author, Graham McNiell mimics the style he established in the preceding novel. Hence, most of my praise for 'Defenders of Ulthuan' carries over to 'Sons of Ellyrion'; vivd descriptions, emotive language, intriguing plot.A lot is left to be answered with the cliffhanger &#34;conclusion&#34; (I deliberately use that term to invoke a little irony) to 'Defenders of Ulthuan'. It all gets answered, but I felt nothing was as shocking as I expected. Sure, most of the revelations in the fist novel were predictable, but I think they were more interesting that the answers given here.The majority of the positive aspect of the plot come when I view both novels as a whole story, which they are. The homeland of the Elves is explored in enough depths that you get a feel for the varying landscapes and, to a lesser degree, the varying cultures. The characters are well developed and I feel the major ones have unique personalities. I like meeting the villains and getting to know them a little. The descriptions of battle are solid.The big let down is the ending. There is a Latin term, Deus Ex Machina, that translates to &#34;god from the machine&#34;. It is a literary term used to describe when a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved, with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object (I stole that explanation from the Deus Ex Machina entry in Wikipedia). It's a bit of a cop out. McNiell does exactly that in 'Sons of Ellyrion'. It's probably worse because two whole novels worth of investing in characters and situations comes down to a &#34;by the way, it's all suddenly solved by...&#34; type of ending. I should have known. The battles were still being fought when the pages left to read were getting very light on. It almost amounts to what I like to call an &#34;Adam Sandler ending&#34;, because in all his films everything it happily resolved in the end. Bad guys are punished and good guys are rewarded. This wasn't exactly the case in 'Sons of Ellyrion', but I would have liked to see more costly sacrifices.Another minor gripe is the lack of time spent with the famous characters. They feel like supporting characters, which they are, but I enjoyed their scenes and wanted more of them.Overall, the experience was pleasant, soured only by the terrible ending.
$SUMMARY.: Compelling story... until the ending ruined all the good work.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of this book in return for my honest review.  'Dag' is the story of Dagney Morgan, an infertile woman working for the department of agriculture.  Some rather strange and hilarious happenings result in Dagney's motherhood dreams being realised while she investigates toxic chemicals.This book is massively entertaining from start to finish.  The witty banter and amusingly bizarre situations, together with a fast paced story and some interesting and likeable characters, make this book a fantastically compelling page-turner.This story is truly unique and wildly funny.  I will warn that there is quite a lot of swearing, but this didn't bother me and I thought it added to the humour.  An open mind is definitely required so that you can enjoy the story without thinking too much about how realistic it is. It is pretty zany throughout so if you like unique reads and love to laugh you should really enjoy it, but if the most important thing to you is a realistic storyline it may not be your thing.All in all this is a fantastically entertaining sci-fi read. If you're looking for something smart, funny, and different I would highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: [NOTE: I have a close personal acquaintance with the author through various social media platforms and he has favorably reviewed my novel


I submit this review on my own initiative, and not as the result of any request of the author.]This is the third of McNabb's novels on espionage, love affairs and general roguery in the Middle East, following Olives, and Beirut.McNabb has a real knack for description, once again
The violence and danger that lurks under the surface - or right in the open - is so tangible and real
I can feel the dust in my sinuses, squint from the overbearing sunshine

The desolation is palpable.As in the previous stories, there is an excellent melding of the violent chicanery with the touching love story, two story arcs that cross all too tragically in a devastating ending.

Inspiring and an eye opener to horrific challenges Christians face in speaking their beliefs in certain parts of the world. Not a book to sit down and read straight through but to savor, maybe a story here, a story tomorrow. Feeling a bit insecure or persecuted about your faith?

$REVIEW.: Resurrection in May, by Lisa Samson is truly a remarkable book. I could not put it down. Ms. Samson takes you through the life of a spoiled young woman, May Seymour as she experiences the horrors of Rwanda. She is never the same again as you can well imagine. We journey with her as she must struggle to find the meaning in her life and the will to survive as she recuperates on the farm of Claudius Bourne. We even visit death row. This book is a page turner you will not want to leave for too long.The characters created by Lisa Samson are incredibly deep. You really get to know them, their feelings, and you even start to feel as if you could react for them. The characters remind me of those we see in The Secret Life of Bees and Pride and Predjudice, two of my favorite novels that exhibit characters of incredible depth of personality. As I read through the novel, my heart ached for May as she struggled with life, but especially with her faith and reconciling it with what she had witnessed and lived through. Then again, my heart rejoiced at what God can do for those he loves and those who turn to him in need and in faith.All in all, I believe that this novel is very inspiring and a must read. This is the first book by Lisa Samson that I have read. She has many others, and I cannot wait to read more. I may have found a new favorite author, and I highly recommend this book. I recieved, read, and reviewed this book compliments of Thomas Nelson Publishers.

$REVIEW.: Where to start this review? This book is unlike anything I've read recently. It is the story of a young boy, Landon Hampshire,coming of age in turn of the century North Carolina. It is a complex story filled with well developed charaters. The writing style is unusual and almost has the meter of the dialect of North Carolina. At time I felt as though I was reading Huck Finn. It is filled with beautiful descriptions, mysticism, ghosts and Native Cherokee legends mixed together to form an unusal storyline. The story is slow to start but as the author weaves his story you are drawn further into it. During the story, Landon finds that coming of age is not mearly surviving an extreme adventure, it is more the movement from egocentricity to an understanding of the world as a whole and your relationship with family as being your world. Granted this was a slow read but that allowed you to savor the descriptions and feelings that the author described. There are a few spelling mistakes, ceil rather than sill as an example, however, these did not detract from the story. This book would make an excelent long winter vacation read

$REVIEW.: I had such high hopes for this thriller. The promo ads caught my eye. This book andCombustionby the same author looked very action packed!  But for several reasons I was a little disappointed with Velocity:a. The hero (Judson Bell) cried too much for me to consider him an as action figure.....it was actually a bit awkward at times. I mean, did John McClane cry in Die Hard? Maybe tears of joy after the bad guy was blown away. I am pretty sure the author was trying to show us readers that Judd was not a muscle bound hero like Arnold or Sly. But Judd came across too much as a 80's-90's man, with too many touchy feely emotions (won't even mention the early scene outside the apartment). This guy is like light years away from John McClane (who was not muscle bound either). And speaking of wimps, what about the former astronaut/pilot who was VERY afraid of heights? Are there no real heroes anymore?b. The French bad guy (Henri), not a bad choice, very ruthless. But his method for taking his revenge was WAY way over the top. Did this guy never readPatriot Games (Jack Ryan)?  But his end & who actually got to him put me off.c. The conspiracy plot.....As an American I did not like it (the reason/person behind it). But even then, the author did not really do anything with it, he just let it fizzle out. The evil mastermind plot never really got anywhere. He was never shown to be anything other than a horny old man (okay, he had a secret, but again that was never played out).d. The actual ending of the book? I rolled my eyes and kept turning pages, just hoping this was not the ending. But it was. I guess the author was trying to be cute? Refer to the ending of Die Hard. Sigh...If I referenced Die Hard too many times, I am sorry.  But the book promos refer toDie HardArmageddon [Blu-ray],Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol [HD] and so on.  An of course being from Austrilia, Steve will be compared to Matt Reilly.  Oh yeah, I never rememberScarecrow: A Scarecrow Novel 3crying as well.  But Scarecrow could be described as a tough as nails, muscle bound action hero.  Judd did many amazing things in his attempts to locate the stolen shuttle and rescue his former girl-friend.  But I could not warm up to him......Things I did like:a. The action. This I did like. Very over the top! But I went along with it. This is why I am giving the book 3 stars.b. The very off-beat Australian pilot Corey. What a character...and oh yeah, his dog Spike. They added greatly to the story.

$REVIEW.: We left Lydia in the previous book, ready to embark on an adventurous summer in North Carolina. This story picked up at the end of the summer, which was fine, since she didn't do much besides reading and eating. I know how that feels--sometimes I'm all talk and not brave enough to follow through with my big plans. A chance meeting with Blake and a canceled flight led to an exciting couple of days and the fun was crammed in.Like I said, I could relate to Lydia. I live a lot through books, just like she did. I loved the reoccurring theme and the pep talk she gave herself over and over again--be brave. Sometimes, it's hard to break out of the box, but Lydia realized that sometimes a person has to do that and the satisfaction that comes from doing so is very fulfilling.Blake was awesome! His grandfather knew him well and the lesson he learned was really important. I loved how aware and thoughtful he was, not only towards Lydia, but towards Frankie, too. He was very chivalrous and thoughtful. I loved all the little things he planned to help Lydia out.I've mentioned before how much I enjoy seeing the way this stories connect to one another. They're all so cute, different, and romantic. There were quite a few parts that had me smiling.Content: kissing; Clean.*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*

 The plot twists and turns as good mysteries do, and his characters have depth
 I appreciated the fact that he never descended into soft porn with explicit sexual details, but I grew weary of hearing about the main characters' overdone sex life, and the episode with handcuffs and a blindfold really put me off

 Darren never experiences any negative effects from alcoholism, either, which seems unnatural and a bit irresponsible on the part of the author.

$REVIEW.: Bella Darcy and Mr. Pettifor do not have a conventional boss-employee relationship. They share more than an office and they do more than just work. As you can imagine, if you have a sexy, hot, wealthy man who enjoys sex with her assistant, you can expect for her to fall in love with him.In this novella Bella finds her caring and feeling more than she should for and Mr. Pettifor. However, the moment she decides to resign and go away from him things take unexpected turns.A fast and interesting novella. A story that really lives up to the warning because it has a great number of sexual encounters and many of them with a strong component of submission and control.The characters are fine, we get to know more of Bella than of Mr. Pettifor but it is ok for the story. The dialogues and descriptions are excellent which made me enjoy the story, of course it has a great writing style.A story with a medium rythm and a lenght that makes the story easy to read in a few hours.Overall, a great erotic-romance novella.

$review_text.: In the interest of full disclosure: I am a former gamer, and although I no longer play Dungeons & Dragons or other role-playing games, most of my friends still do and I remain a staunch fan of fantasy fiction, films, comics, etc.I really enjoyed The Elfish Gene until I got about  two or three chapters from the end


Barrowcliffe's memoir is fast-paced and funny, and I defy anyone male (gamer or otherwise) who grew up in the last quarter of the 20th century not to find at least an anecdote or two that they can identify with
But this whole "D&D; is the worst thing you can possibly get into as a young adult" conclusion is just beyond the pale


I realize he's trying to be amusing, but I doubt anyone who has a child who has gotten into hard drugs or gang activity will find themselves laughing.At the risk of sounding like a humorless blowhard, we (gamers/fantasy fans) get enough of this crap from people who've never been involved with our hobby


I guess I'm still puzzled at the mentality that supposes it's okay to get obsessed with fantasy football or old cars or American Idol, but getting involved with role-playing games makes you an agent of Satan.End of rant
I'll conclude by saying that I'd give the book three and a half stars if amazon would let me, just 'cause the funny parts in the book are really funny, but as there's no way I'll go up to four on it, it gets three.PS Heavy metal doesn't suck

Sebastian and Julia are both strong characters that do not overwhelm each other. What she does to protect her sister Sarah is ingenious and sets a great tone. The connection between Andre and Sebastian was great because it allowed me to reconnect with some favorite characters. I love how Keswick talked in the plural, it is not something that you would expect from a stable master. Readers will hate Adolphus Lynton from the beginning which works well. I cannot wait for Book 2 and I have to wonder if maybe at some point Sarah might get her own story or maybe Keswick.

$REVIEW.: I don't know about all of you, but I loved to watch The Price Is Right when I was growing up
I have vivid memories of watching it during summer vacation with my mother while lunching at the kitchen table, or with my grandfather when we were visiting my grandparents


He and I would eat our lunches in the living room so we could watch the whole show and not miss any of the fun


I actually listened to the audio version of this book, and while I usually prefer to read an actual book, I have to say that I did enjoy listening to this one, probably because Bob Barker is the narrator.You can't help but smile when the first disc opens with the theme from The Price Is Right
Bob Barker goes on to talk about the many facets of his life, both personal and professional


I found it to be an interesting listen, and I think I probably enjoyed it more as an audio book than I would have if I had been trying to read it
Barker shows a fair amount of his personality when reading, so it engages you more than words on paper would


For me, the only negative was the amount of time he devoted to animal rights towards the end--sometimes there was more detail than I wanted to hear, though I certainly understand how important it is to him

Hearing about the awful things that are done to animals makes me sad, and it was hard to listen to that.Barker really does have some amusing anecdotes from his career as a host of "audience participation" shows and some of the people he met along the way

You really get a feel for what he accomplished in his long career as a game show host and more


Some parts, such as his brief stint as a naval aviator, are a bit dry, but overall I found his stories to be interesting
I think anyone who is a fan of The Price Is Right (and Truth of Consequences) will enjoy listening to Barker recount his favorite memories.



$SUMMARY.: I enjoyed most of this book, except for the end...

$REVIEW.: another great book by George Sherman Hudson!  Real once again finds himself in a position that he doesn't think he'll be able to get out until he comes across the right people who literally open doors that make him a free man
Given another chance to rise to the top this time with a woman he's grown to love Real finds himself in the middle of a war that doesn't involve him until people from his past decide they want revenge


What I especially loved about this book was that Silk, a character from another of this authors books,makes her return and we find she still just as vicious as before and even more determined to get hers


Will she take Real along for the ride or will he become just a means to an end?? Every time I think this author can't get better he surprises me with more  twists to his already great plot and keeps you wanting more.

She goes thru hell to get him back safely  along with the help of some friends.  They are all on the run when a tragedy occurs, changing them all for the rest of their lives.  Very, very sad what Norah tells Josh when they are in the car trying to excape.  It does have a HEA ending for most, but I don't know how to feel about what happens with James at the fountain.

$REVIEW.: BRIEF SUMMARYJane is Miranda's friend, and they are usually out together during their nights out


Jane helps fending of the men for Miranda, because she is gorgeous and every guy's fantasy

With a hot girlfriend like Miranda, Jane wonders how is a girl like her suppose to find her happy ending.THOUGHTSFlirts! 5 Romantic Short Stories, is a small collection of stories by the author

Some of the books in the collections are free and the whole collection can be bought together.This was such a cute and funny story

It almost had a feel and humor of the movie, 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'


And the title of the book says it all as well
Jane and Miranda are friends


Jane always plays wing-man to their nights out, while Miranda is on the prowl


Miranda is the six feet tall blond that's hard to miss in a bar or club, so, on a particular night out; Jane meets Brady, a bartender.Brady was just such a nice guy, mixed with sexy and the guy next door description mentioned in the book


Jane, was just a regular girl who expect nothing when out with her friend
Their chemistry was fun and enjoyable to read

 Brady took Jane out to prove she's hot, but selfishly derails her invites from guys interested in her

I have to applaud the witty excuses and humor in this book, it was the added bonus that made this book interesting

With Brady's derailing tactics, this leaves Jane, a little confuse because he doesn't seem the least bit interested in her

Though this book seems predictable, everything about this short novella was sweet, cute, funny, and even sexy.Story: GOODEnjoyment: GOOD

Just makes you mad at what some people can do to others for a measly amount. What a true hero Samantha is. As the title states resilient and courageous - both Samantha and Laurence. I can not believe Samantha was able to overcome the injuries and go back to work. Makes you realise how you should be grateful for every day and not complain when ill, as someone else is probably worse. Such an inspiring people Samantha and Laurence are. Great read.

$REVIEW.: The 2012 edition of Lonely Planet's USA guide mostly lives up to LP's usual standards. The guide contains a blend of practical advice, historical facts, travelers' stories, and inspiring photographs. It is the sort of guide that can be used both for trip planning and for taking along on the trip itself.Long-time LP readers will quickly see there has been a substantial redesign of the look and feel of LP guidebooks. Most of the information you've relied upon in the past is still there but there are several new features as well. One of the best is a FAQ of sorts near the beginning of the book called "Need to Know." It gathers together critical information that is frequently needed both pre-trip and intra-trip. Also, LP has done away with the glossy-paper photo sections and now uses color throughout the entire book. This change has especially improved the local maps by making them immensely easier to read.Those who are unfamiliar with Lonely Planet should know a few things before purchasing this book:* LP targets independent, do-it-yourself types of travelers (who often have backpacks, railpasses, and youth hostel cards).* Travelers who are focused on staying in top-ranked hotels and eating at expensive restaurants probably won't find LP's sleeping and eating recommendations to be extensive enough. While there is some coverage of high-end, trendy, and luxurious places in this guide, it is not LP's strength.* Most LP guides that cover large regions, including this one, are written by a team of contributors.* New editions of a guide usually are updates of previous versions and are not entirely rewritten from scratch.So, how useful is this guide to the United States? As with most things, it depends. If you want to travel around the US in DIY style or you want better coverage of cultural and outdoor activities than is offered by more mainstream guides, such as Fodor's or Frommer's, then LP is a good guidebook for you. On the other hand, if you aren't interested in straying off the beaten path much or aren't open to trading off comfort and predictability for character and the unexpected, the LP ethos may not be a good fit for you.Also, if you are only visiting a single region or just a couple of cities, this guide might be overkill because it covers the entire country. There are plenty of city and regional guides from LP and other guidebook publishers that will cover, say, Chicago or the Southwest in much greater detail than a national guide and omit several hundred pages of information you won't need.Bottom line: I have used LP guidebooks for many years and have always found them to be very useful. This guide to the USA is no exception. However, some sections that used to be included in all LP guidebooks were removed in the redesign. While the omission of these sections won't have much effect on trip planning, the missing information, especially from the old Dangers & Annoyances and Health chapters, was often invaluable during a trip. In addition, LP has not included a pullout street map of a popular city with this book as it does in virtually every other of its redesigned country guides. For me, this brings what could be a 4 or 5 star rating to a 3 star rating.

$review_text.: Having been kicked out of sport he so loved for his violent behaviors, Tommy is a bit down on his luck. As the book opens, Tommy is racing back to his house because it is engulfed by flames. The only thing he was able to save are the clothes on his back and his faithful dog, Warrior. Faced with this unfathomable loss, on top of his career low, Tommy turns to his best friend, Julie.Julie has loved Tommy almost her whole life. When fate forces her to allow Tommy to live with her, Julie can no longer hide her feelings. As they spend time together, Julie sees a side of Tommy she hasn&#8217;t seen since they were children. The cockiness of his professional fighter days has disappeared and her truly caring friend is back. As they grow closer, Tommy is thrust back into the fighting world and just as quickly, Julie wonders if they can really stand the test of time.First and foremost, I was impressed by how quickly I was thrown into the world of MMA. This was the first Abbi Niles book I had ever read and I want to tip my hat to her, having never watched the sport myself, as I read the different fight scenes I literally felt like I was there with them. I could hear the heavy breathing, feel the tension, it was perfect.That said, I really fell in love with this book from the first chapter. This is the second book in a series, but can absolutely be read as a stand alone like I did. Julie and Tommy were excellent characters, and the indecision on both parts was excellently calibrated. I could understand Julie&#8217;s hesitance of getting involved with Tommy considering his offhand behavior before. Plenty of steamy scenes but the emotional connections were pretty spectacular between these two characters. The book ended beautifully and in my opinion was one of the best romance endings I&#8217;ve read in quite a while.

I love how for every subject the author brings up he uses an historic corollary for better understanding. Being a fan of American history, this was right up my alley, and it will be yours too---the perfect gateway drug to all things U.S. It's great to have an author such as Mr. Ragone write in plain english the things you didn't know, did know, and think you knew. And with the Declaration, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights and the rest of the Amendments at the end of the book, they make it a must buy. Think, how many American citizens have these important documents at their disposal, along with the knowledge that helped shape them? You can, if you buy the American Government Book!

$review_text.: THE SCIENCE OF GOOD COOKING is a cookbook with wonderful recipes, but it's also intended to be READ by science-minded cooks.  If you've ever wondered WHY a recipe calls for a specific ingredient (e.g., Russet potatoes for mashing), or tells you to use a water bath (e.g., when you're cooking custards or cheesecakes), or is silent about whether the dull or shiny side of aluminum foil faces up (e.g., when you need to make a tent for a roast turkey); then this is the book for you.  In the examples above, the answers are, respectively:  Russets are better for mashing because their starch molecules burst during cooking and make the potatoes fall apart; water baths cook slowly and evenly so that custards don't heat up more at the edges and then brown or crack; and, it doesn't matter which aluminum foil side faces up because the two sides work the same.The book's subtitle, "Master 50 Simple Concepts to Enjoy a Lifetime of Success in the Kitchen" is probably overstated.  I'm sure that there are more than 50 cooking concepts worth mastering, and the book certainly does not discuss every single thing that a science-minded cook would like to know or need to know.  One concept that is missing is caramelization of sugar, a subject that interests me because my family loves caramel ice cream.  But I'm still excited to learn the things that it does discuss, and to correct some of my own misconceptions--one of those misconceptions being that mayonnaise is the culprit in potato salad food poisoning.Each of the 50 "concepts" (e.g., "All Potatoes Are Not Created Equal", "Gentle Heat Guarantees Smooth Custards") is discussed in three parts:  (1) how the science works, (2) a test kitchen experiment, and (3) recipes accompanied by explanations of "why this recipe works", as well as extra "practical science" explanations.  The first and second parts may be a little TOO scientific and technical for some cooks, but the "practical science" tips are accessible to everyone, and are by themselves worth the price of the book.From the index, here are only a few of the many "practical science" topics discussed:  avoiding splotchy pancakes, best fire for barbecue, best rice for risotto, choosing canned tomatoes, clarifying butter, cold-start frying method, double leaveners for cookies, eliminating gas from beans, how gelatin mimics veal, natural vs. Dutch-processed cocoa, preventing curdled dairy products, removing odors from cutting boards, safely handling chicken, salting fresh-ground meat, smoke points of fats and oils, stand vs. hand-held mixer, storing bananas, tempering garlic's bite, turning bread dough as it rises, why brisket is pink, wild vs. farmed salmon.This is a marvelous "science of cooking" book, and I really do love it.  It's going onto my permanent cookbook shelf, right alongside my old favorite, the great classic technical cookbook (without recipes)On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.

I am a fan of this genre and had high hopes for this book, but it has so many plot holes and is disjointed story lines that it took me three months to finish reading.No plot spoilers from me: The story starts out fairly strongly with the murder of the heir to the powerful Kraken Corporation and what follows is a very unrealistic tale of revenge and corruption, peppered with a lot of cursing and blood. The writing style is fairly good at the start of the book but changes a few chapters in to the point where it seems the author got rushed into just getting the words written.This could have have been great but the plot holes and weak writing makes this vacation reading, at best.CFH

Although a Christian, I don't normally read Christian romance, mystery etc. This author brings it all together in one novel and it was great. Many of us have had a hard time coming to grips with 9/11 and Ms Morel deals with a part of 9/11 that could actually exist and the characters are so real that you just want to strangle Lewis for using such a tragic event! Can't say anything else as I do not want to post a spoiler. You will have to join me in waiting for the next book!

$review_text.: The spate of zombies appearing in novels, movies, and now television is an interesting trend

The Introduction and "Deaditorial Note" in this collection attempt to provide context and explanation for why so many are devouring the genre (pun intended)
Personally, I am not searching for deeper meaning in zombie tales (e.g., loss of personal identity though mass consumerism = mindless zombies returning to the mall)
My loyalty is relatively straightforward - imagining a world where the dead walk and pursue survivors is just campy, good fun.So I am a traditional zombie fan who enjoys the formula tales of a small band of people surviving against insurmountable odds
This collection delivered on that for me including Lebbon's Naming of Parts, Wellington's Dead Man's Land, and McMahon's Dead to the World
And there are many stories that explore the genre from different angles which should appeal to a wider audience
My only complaint is I had read eight of the twenty-two stories in other collections.

$review_text.: The temptation exists to toss off a story involving a new type of &#34;backwoods Bigfoot,&#34; but that would be a mistake. There's more here than the expected: not devolved humanity, but realistic issues and an undercurrent of true evil. This author KNOWS character and how best to elicit it. I'd read some of this pseudonymous author's other works, and was eager to try this one. It's short, but packs a potent punch. Don't blow it off: read it.I reviewed an ARC provided by the author/publisher via NetGalley. No fees were exchanged.

$review_text.: I love John Locke's books and I certainly was not disappointed in his latest addition to his Donovan Creed books. The fourth in the series, Creed sets out to spend a relaxing vacation with his girlfriend in Florida. The mystery and suspense that awaits them there is certainly not what Creed had wanted. Pursued by a killer out for revenge, the plot is masterfully written as Locke takes you on a journey of intrigue, romance and mystery. I recommend this book to anyone that loves a good mystery novel.

The advice of Mr. Nicholson is fresh and not based on trends or methods of yesterday. Publishing has changed dramatically in the last few years. Scott was there, learning, writing, marketing, and being successful. His advice is based on today's publishing world.The additional essays are also from authors who are currently very successful in their self-publishing endeavors.If you want advice from authors who have been there - who ARE there and succeeding, pick up this ebook.

$REVIEW.: The Bible has many instances in which it talks about the glory of God and how it shone so bright. Many who gaze upon it fall out in fear, even the people Moses led would not look at his face after he'd been in the presence of God.Jesus said He is the &#34;light&#34; of the world and when He was transfigured, his face &#34;shone&#34; so bright the apostles with him were in awe.This book made me wonder if the various Rays of Light are sum parts of the whole of God?Something to think about...Whether you agree or not, this is a wonderful tool through which you can connect with the higher frequencies of light energy present within all of us and the universe at large.Definitely a keeper as this is one book I'll want to read more than once. It will sit on my bookshelf alongside those by Dr. Wayne Dyer, Marianne Williamson and Neale Donald Walsch.*I received this book from hosting a blog tour, the review is my opinion freely given*

$review_text.: Before reading this book, I read _Once Bitten_, _The Basement_ and _The Bestseller_ by Stephen Leather and enjoyed all of them and was delighted to find a new author of suspense.  Surprisingly, _Private Dancer_ is more expensive than the other books *and*, unbelievably, rated higher!!!  I cannot fathom how anyone would rate this book higher than one or two stars and have to question the credibility of the majority of reviewers of this book.  I very, very, very rarely give up on a book and simply quit reading it because it is just terrible, boring or whatever.  About five times during the reading of this novel, I got to the point of giving up on the book, but BECAUSE it was rated so highly, I persevered on, thinking it MUST get better.  Well, it didn't.  There is no plot to speak of and the entire book is utterly boring, going on and on and on about a Thai prostitute's attempt to convince a foreigner that she loves only him, while betraying him at every turn, and he getting suckered back in time and time again.  The same words are spoken over and over by the Thai -- "Me love only you, you number one", etc., etc.  I found it utterly boring and tedious and will have to think twice before picking up another Stephen Leather novel.  I use ratings quite a bit in deciding which products and which books to order and most of the time, I agree with the majority, but definitely NOT in this case.  I have, in fact, deleted the book completely from my archive.

$REVIEW.: *I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*I was really looking forward to the final installment in the Wrecked series.  I thoroughly enjoyed Wrecked, so I was very disappointed at the conclusion of Rescued.  I felt the Hunter and Lorrie&#8217;s story wasn&#8217;t consistent with what we had read in Wrecked.  While I know there were much tougher issues the characters were facing in Rescued, if felt like the banter between the two characters and the intensity was completely missing.  Hunter seemed to be less of a focus in this story and the connection between the two of them was lost.  While what the issues they both have to face are extremely heartbreaking, it left the story progression very slow and at time repetitive.  I was definitely expecting much more from this story.

That said, her story is very creative and a wonderful start as a writer.

$REVIEW.: I've just finished this very, very interesting book. It is more of a murder mystery than anything else, but covers the background of the JFK assassination as well. Mary Meyer was the last great favorite mistress, a helluva woman by all counts. Even Jackie knew about her and still liked her. Apparently she had developed a great positive influence on JFK, who comes off as more human and vulnerable than most descriptive biographies have ever portrayed him, and in the months before the assassination she was bending his ear (while smoking pot and dropping mild acid with him) on the potential for him to become a real power for world peace. His movements in that direction are well-documented in James Douglass's book, JFK and the Unspeakable, what with the back-door secret correspondence with Kruschev (I didn't realize he--JFK--was also making overtures for peace with Castro too), and how this really pissed off the CIA and the Pentagon. The CIA takes him out (and this is beautifully laid out, albeit circumstantially, by Janney in this book), and once Mary puts two and two together, she confronts her CIA ex-husband, the cold and overbearing Cord Meyer, who tells his boss, the evil-by-all-standards-including-his-own James Jesus Angleton, the real architect of it all. Now Mary's got to go, she knows too much and won't be quieted down--she's going to rat out the CIA--so she is dispatched in a make-believe &#34;senseless&#34; murder. This book discusses that murder at length (sometimes too long) and the coverup(s). (Yes, there's a lot of hearsay, ergo 4 stars out of 5, but Janney backs it all up pretty good, hunting down leads and picking up on research that got &#34;sidetracked&#34; when other investigative authors cracked up, killed themselves, or disappeared--could easily have been him too.)I've got to admire Janney. It's his first book, the guy's just a psychologist, and he knew Mary and her kids. He knew most of the players, and even has the balls to stand up and nail his old man, also a CIA agent, as one of the conspirators. Considering how many of the people discussed in the book die suspiciously, Janney went out on a limb. It's interesting to note how many of the &#34;bad&#34; one-star reviews (not the idiotic one-liners, but the ones who seem to really care) work very hard (too hard) to discredit him. It's Janney's first book for crying out loud, and the subject is both monumental and cloudy (on purpose). He did a great job, considering. It gave me a whole different perspective of how things went down, but it doesn't take away anything. In fact, it adds several important pieces to the jigsaw puzzle (Mary's mosaic) that is finally coming together now, fifty years later, so we can make out the complicated picture behind it. Highly recommended.

The descriptive, captive way, in which the author, Jana Petken wrote, left me feeling as though I were in the story.The well researched and harrowing account of a civil war where family members fought against each other was brilliantly portrayed. Add that to the decisions these characters made, the way , in which they grew from these decisions, the evil of Joseph Dobbs, and the passion of Maria and Carlos, and you have a well rounded, excellent piece of historical fiction. If you love historical books, you won't find better than this.

$REVIEW.: Be prepared to laugh. This book reminds me of an adult version of the Amelia Badelia books I used to read to my children when they were young. Not everyone will enjoy the type of slapstick, zany humor employed by this author. But in spite of the light-hearted (and may I perhaps add, tongue-in-cheek, 'lightheaded') dry-humored persona Chris Well has given to the main character, Harry Truman, Harry is a bit sharper than he first appears.Harry Truman is a former crime reporter for a local newspaper. He's making attempts to write the great American novel, perhaps with the intent to try to show the newspaper just what type of talented writer they had replaced. Curiously, he was not overly surprised when a couple of mobster like goons showed up at his door with the news that &#34;the boss wants to see you.&#34; While the readers roll their eyes with thoughts that this is going to be another ho-hum stereotypical read, the &#34;boss&#34; explains to Truman that he wants his biography--a memoir--written before he dies. Harry is less than enthused at the prospect. He's not really given much of a choice, and on the way home he wonders how he is going to accomplish this task and write his own great novel.Harry realizes he is being followed by someone he didn't recognize. The man approaches him and Truman realizes the man thinks he is associated with the &#34;boss.&#34; The man wants Harry to kill his wife--for hire. Harry is not up to committing a crime, but instead of doing the right thing and reporting this to the police, he decides to investigate the situation for himself.What follows is the strangest series of happenstances I've ever read in a mystery. The author presents some unexpected twists and turns that I did not see coming in addition to some good old-fashioned chase scenes. I give this zany adventure mystery a thumbs up for those who enjoy this type of light reading. It is quick paced and has some genuinely funny moments. If I were to rate this book, I would give it a PG-13 rating with a warning about the presence of some drinking, hangovers, smoking, a shooting, and some hints of sexual temptation. There is no crude language.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary review copy of this ebook from the author through The Story Cartel.

$REVIEW.: After a string of failed relationships, it's only natural that a girl go into "heart-protection" mode


Sometimes that might make her look like a cold-hearted witch, but what else can she do? It doesn't necessarily mean that she's not willing to have a good time with a man; just leave the emotions at the door
For Maggie this is exactly the case


She's intelligent, outgoing, and caring, but she's also way too responsible and doesn't let herself enjoy life like she should


After agreeing to join a canoeing trip she meets a man who just might be her undoing.Mace has never met a woman more annoying than Maggie or more perfect for him


He knows that she's been hurt in the past and he was able to size her up fairly quickly from the start
Only trouble is that Maggie thinks she's got him pegged as being just like every other man she's had an unfortunate experience with

He'll just have to show her otherwise and push her in ways that will force her to see him differently and the possibilities.The writing is witty and entertaining
Everything kicks off from the beginning, so diving right into the story is not an issue and the pacing is appropriate to a whirlwind of eroticism, romance, and disaster

Both Maggie and Mace rely on each other for different aspects of security, confidence, and skill during their doomed adventure
This story sort of chronicles how a horrible experience can bring two people together


I was a bit disappointed with the wrap-up of the ending


It came about too quickly and didn't provide answers to a small mystery involving secondary characters

However, this story is a fun and amusing read with an undercurrent of emotional depth that readers will appreciate.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews

A good editor would clean up the story and make it more readable, and probably convince the editor to make needed stylistic changes ("the Drasin slowly began to slow and hesitate"...ouch)  Plot and character development, however, is quite good. With competent editing, this is a four star read.I don't enjoy most First Contact stories, but this is an exception.  I do question whether "thermobaric rounds," particle beam, laser and other of the advanced weaponry (or, for that matter, speed of light travel) discussed here could all be available by the end of the twenty first century, but I can suspend disbelief with the best!

$REVIEW.: To start with, let me say this is really a good book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is fast-paced, well written, and a good book.  However, although the author states these are &#34;stand alone&#34; books, they are not.  For this, I take off two stars right off the top.  It ends with Chemworks, a company of Blake's that is being investigated by WHO and is the basis for this entire plot, being sold to INGX.  This is a shell company engineering new viruses through nanoparticles that excel in transmission as synthetic nerve agents.  As the scientist working with WHO dies at the end, it is told to the reader that Robert Blake, the father whom Leopold believes is alive, actually is alive and is the owner of this INGX company.  Leopold has never believed that his father is actually dead, and has been looking for him for years.  This just leads the reader into the next book, Panic.  Well, this never sets well with me at all.  I like a book that IS a stand-alone book and does not just lead into the next of the series, leaving me with more questions than answers.  This ending was nothing but huge question marks.  Two stars down!  The next star I removed was for all the times I had to go to &#34;translation&#34; for all of the French I didn't understand.  It was occasionally translated, but seldom.  This was very irritating to me.  The fourth star I removed was for all the typos.  Words were left out all through the entire book.  As the book progressed, the proofing of it got worse and worse.  Any author who really cares does not let this happen.  It did and I took another star off.  In general, though, I will say this is a very good book.  If you don't mind the little things like I do.  If you want to read a book with no ending, words omitted throughout the book, and don't mind foreign words and phrases (or speak and read French), then this is a book you should read.

$REVIEW.: When you're in an emergency situation, you don't have time to trawl through long columns of text. This book is great--it shows you a different scenario on each page and how to deal with it. Some of them might sound like you wouldn't use them very often (how to deal with a grizzly encounter, for example)--but you never know when you might be say, visiting Yellowstone National Park and surprise! need that information you stored away in your head. A fun book--I bought it for my 13YO who loves scouting.

$review_text.: I agree with the reviewer that said she wasn't emotionally drawn in.  This book started off with promise.  But Rae was so wishy washy she began to get on my nerves. On the other hand, I really liked Conn.  I was also turned off by the grandmother's involvement.  It's one thing to play the matchmaker.  But for grandma to be so involved in her grandson's sex life was way too much togetherness for me.

It's a really nice compilation of advice and ideas on how to survive a long distance relationship and make it works. I&#8217;ve been with my boyfriend since 2009, living 300 km away from each other and I say &#8216;It is possible&#8217; when there is love nothing can stop it.

$review_text.: Well, Josh has done it again. Written another amazing romantic mystery with realistic imperfect characters and such vivid imagery that I felt so connected with the story and the main characters. Only this time Swift made me cry even more than Adrien. Swift's struggle to stay sober was breaking my heart. I cried when he wanted to use and I cried when Max was there to save him. (Those that know me well, know that I hardly ever cry!!!) He only wanted to help a friend and believed he was doing the right things; and those choices nearly destroyed him. I have to say that I loved the brief "Choose Your Own Adventure" scenarios at the beginning of each chapter. For me, it brought to mind the paths that Swift chose to take throughout the course of his life thus far. What would you choose to do in this situation? Can you really control your own destiny? Or will the finale always end up being the same?Swift and Max's relationship was intense. Here you have the recovering cocaine addict literature professor-slash-famous former poet and the small town's chief of police. Can they be any more different?? Yet they were perfect for each other. I loved how Swift called Max "Chief" and how Max called Swift "Teach". It made me smile everytime. And when Max told Swift, "I'm not going to let go of you. I'm going to hold you all night. So go ahead and feel whatever you feel. If you're still craving cocaine, go ahead. You're safe. You can crave it all you want, but I won't let go, and if you still feel like you can't trust yourself in the morning, and it's what you want, I'll drive you to rehab myself. Okay?", I had to take a break from reading because my chest was hurting and I had tears running down my face.Like I said, it was AMAZING and INTENSE.ETA: I just realized that I did't say anything about the mystery. I guess I'm like Swift, and didn't really care about who the killer was. It was a good mystery and I didn't have anything figured out until the end.

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed this read. I didn't know what to expect as I've not read one of Jan Ruth's publications before.I started this book on an evening where I could sit by myself with no distractions, I do that each time I start a new book. As I said, I didn't know what to expect, but this lived up to more, much more to my expectations than I thought. I was drawn to the cover, excellent cover, then to what the story was going to be about. Thing is, that's just the tip of the iceberg, the story get's larger, more intriguing and draws you in, before you know it, several hours have gone past.The author gave me this book as a gift in exchange for a fair review, I can give this author MORE, much more than a fair review, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will certainly not say NO to any of her books. Thank you Jan. Its given me many hours of pleasure.The characters in the book opened up so well, the story that developed was clinching, and when things turned a little, you wondered which way things would go. Enthralling. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: As soon as I read the synopsis to Good I knew I HAD to read it. First off, all of the books I've read by S. Walden have left me in PIECES. So I knew the minute Good was released, I'd buy it. And I did. And I read it in one sitting. Seriously. I probably didn't sleep that night and throughout school the next morning I couldn't stop thinking about Cadence and Mark. Definitely couldn't stop thinking about Mark. But we'll get to that later.There's been some talk about how inappropriate and wrong this book is. Some had problems with how taboo the relationship was. But come on! The synopsis tells you it's a teacher/student relationship and it even WARNS you that there's explicit sex scenes. And if you've read any of S. Walden's other books, you should know that she does NOT tread lightly in these situations. There's none of that Aria/Ezra student/teacher relationship from Pretty Little Liars going on--none of that mild stuff. **And yes, I do watch PLL--it's good!** So if you're faint of heart, you might not want to pick up this book. But if you're like me, you'll probably need a makeshift fan along with you.Now, lets get to the story. Cadence did something very stupid her junior year--something that is taken WAY out of proportion by everyone--her parents, especially. So she goes to juvie for ten months. Ten whole months of cleaning toilets and other benign tasks, wearing an orange jumpsuit that does nothing for her complexion. Right before her ten months are up, Cadence meets this guy while picking up trash on the side of the road. There's an instant connection, but what are the chances of seeing each other again? One in a million, probably. Except when she goes back to school who does she find teaching her Calculus class? Mr. Converse All-Stars.Every relationship is bound to have its problems--especially a student/teacher relationship. And like any couple, Cadence and Mark go through their fair share of bumps along the way. First off, Cadence is 17 years old when the novel begins. She's totally inexperienced, innocent, and sometimes, down-right immature. Cadence has her wisdom moments, but over-all, she's a regular 17 year-old girl. And as any 17 year-old girl, she gets jealous, petty, whinny. However you want to put it. Did I get annoyed with her at times? Totally. Did I want to stick my hand through the pages and strangle her? Definitely. But did I also love her and root for her the whole way? Hell yes! It's not just the romantic in me that roots for her. It's the fact that even though she's been through crap with her parents, she doesn't let it define her.I have to admit that Mark had a lot to do with Cadence's growth. It may not seem like it, but he makes her question her beliefs and the way she's been brought up. Normally, I'd think a guy like that would be a horrible influence, especially on such a young girl--after all, he's ten years older--but knowing and experiencing Cadence's home life along with her makes me realize that if it weren't for Mark, Cadence would be trapped in this unconventional little life that tries to appear whole and pure, only to be hiding something rotten. *cough cough* Gracie. Back to Mark: he's commandeering, at times demanding, but also sweet, funny, thoughtful, and caring. Mark is hiding some skeletons in his closets that we don't even learn about until the sequel, Better. And he is not your typical hero. And I was so happy about that! I love me a good (see what I did there?) alpha male, but they can get repetitive. And while, yes, Mark can be a little rough and possessive, there's also a whole other dimension to him that we don't even get to see until later in the series. Still, that doesn't make him any less desirable.And their relationship? It's H-O-T-T hot! This is where the makeshift fan comes in! Cadence is inexperienced in all things sexual and Mark most definitely isn't. So you know things are going to get hot and bothered. And I LOVED it! Mark is certainly Cadence's teacher in a lot of ways. While that may have bothered some readers, it didn't bother me. I kinda feel like I'm repeating myself, but I just want to stress how much I loved those scenes. Most of all, though, was the fact that Mark wasn't the only one teaching. Cadence definitely has her teacher moments. And it may seem insignificant, but to Mark they aren't. He states it. Cadence opens him up to feel again. No one in five years had done that. They both grow together, and that's one of the most important aspects of a relationship that authors have to portray.Our favorite BFF, Avery, is definitely one that takes getting used to. Honestly, I didn't like her at first. At all. She was a bitch to Cadence and she kind of looked down on her. But after a while I realized that that was Avery's defense mechanism. She may seem like a heartfelt bitch, but if she cares about you, then you've got a damn good partner in crime. Regardless of how Avery first treated Cadence, I liked how their friendship grew. A lot of times I read these books where the protagonist meets this new girl (or guy) and BAMN! they're instant friends. AND THAT IS SO NOT TRUE!!! Friendship takes time. And any GREAT friendship takes even more time. Especially with girls. We can be some ruthless creatures. So to see not only a relationship grow, but an unexpected friendship? It made me love this book even more. Kudos to you, Ms. Walden!Last but not least is Cadence's relationship with her parents. I've preluded a bit to her home life, but it deserves a paragraph of its own. Honestly, I had some mixed feelings about her parents in the beginning. At first I hated them for how they treated Cadence. Yes, she did something stupid and careless, but did she really deserve for them to turn to their backs on her? What kind of parents do that? Image really was everything to them. But then I was conflicted in a particular scene between Cadence and her dad: **slight spoiler** when she confronts him about him not wanting to spend any time with her. He actually looked ashamed of himself! There were quite a couple of father/daughter scenes that seemed genuine. And that's why I was conflicted. Because at the end, her father just blows up in the worst way. *sigh* And her mom was no help at all either. The only one in that family besides Cadence I grew to love was Oliver. He may embody the annoying little bother, but in the end, he had Cadence's back. And that's all that matters.Like always, S. Walden's doesn't sugarcoat anything. If you're looking for a nice, breezy romance, this is not it. Her books are filled with angst and they leave you with a major case of the feels! They may break your heart and leave it lying all over the floor, but they are truly satisfying! And if you don't believe me, then read what other people are saying about Good.

Right from the start he has you hooked and doesn't play games. You know what is going on every step of the way, except when he doesn't want you to!  You are transported to the crime scenes and the locations and you feel a connection with the characters, both good and bad. The only negative thing I would say is that it was quite short. It seemed to be only half the usual Jon Stanton thriller and kind of rushed to the ending but still a fantastic read. I can't wait for the next instalment. I would and will always highly recommend Victor Methos and in particular his Jon Stanton collection. So please give it a read you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Put simply: this is an amazing read by a very talented author


BRUCE JUDISCH captures the reader from the opening pages, giving us a young, untested--too distracted by a "duh" contemporary world--student journalist entrusted to write the richly layered and painful memoir of a polio victim from former East Berlin


Each is frustrated by, and yet drawn to, the other as the remarkable story-within-a-story unfolds

Like our young journalist, I had to admit my knowledge of the Cold War (though I lived through those times) was textbook limited
KATIA brings it alive


The writing is richly textured and compelling

Mr
JUDISCH transitions between a present day Germany setting and the poignant memoir storytelling seamlessly, moving the reader from time-frame to time-frame via dialogue, phone calls, letters and even e-mails--contrasting the two worlds like a text message against a fountain pen letter
It is a story of family, love, loss, faith, surprising secrets 




and hope


If you liked Sarah's Key, I think you'll love KATIA


I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: One of the first things I noticed about this book is how simple the recipes are. The recipes were ranged as well and I like that. Soups, deserts, breakfast the whole nine yards. Everything was in this book. In fact, some recipes are so simple they can actually be done using the things that are already in your refrigerator. I enjoyed reading about the pointers on how one can go about shopping for ingredients for creating different meals.Like for instance the book spoke about the fact that the recipes for creating foods with a low fat diet in mind can be found on the out skirts of the supermarket and that's actually true. Fruits, vegetables, beans, etc. are some of the first things you see when you enter supermarkets before you start going through the isles.Another thing that this book provides  that's awesome information for any reader are storage tips for some fruits and vegetables. It's a good read because many of us are not familiar with these little tips. Good information here and there, otherwise this book would just have been another suggested recipe book.I would definitely recommend

$REVIEW.: Soooooo....this book is crazy, but it's real. Women actually go thru this in real life! To all women reading this story and review please please please love your self more than u love someone else meaning a man. Know when to let go & what's worth holding on 2. Sometimes the Lord puts people in ur world for purpose and when that purpose is met let them go real s***!!! Also please stop ignoring warning signs, love is blind & that s*** can be dangerous. Men too, women are definitely crazy (to an extent)
$SUMMARY.: Wow

$review_text.: I've been a fan of romantic suspense and erotica for a long time. It's rare that an author is as skilled at pulling the two together as fluidly as Cerys du Lys. From the first chapter, this novel hits like a slow burning journey through mystery and the darker desires burning in the blood.I enjoyed the pregnancy plot steeped in mystery that's at this book's center. Billionaire CEO Asher is aggressive, dominant, and described very deliciously. It's easy to see why Jessika falls for this man after he makes her a crazy offer she can't refuse.But wait! He's a married man with a scheming, infertile wife. Just when it seems that this is the main complication, du Lys spins us around and reveals a much darker, more dangerous threat to their budding relationship. True to life, a billionaire's fortune isn't made without attracting some powerful enemies.This full size novel keeps readers guessing and brings out shocked gasps that run the spectrum. If it's not surprise at another suspenseful twist, then it's an uptick in sexual tension. And when the billionaire and his new love interest consummate their scorching desires, you won't want to put it down.Easily a five star read. This long erotic romance delivers on all its promises.

$REVIEW.: The first chapter of Almost Mine is what appears to be the books ending with Cate ready to attempt to get her husband back (he's been living in one of the outbuildings for a few months).  It then goes back and introduces us to Cate and Nick who are in their late teens and have known each other since they were toddlers. They love each other but only Nick is actually IN love with Cate. They have been best friends all their lives and are always there for each other. Since Cate had pretty rocky teen years Nick was there for Cate more than the other way around. They get married but Nick knows that Cate is not in love with him but he loves her so much that he is willing to marry her anyway.Cate is not a likable person in the first half of the book.  She is pretty self-centered and not at all considerate.I found it hard to believe that Nick loved her so much. About half way through the book Cate matures and finally sees that she is in love with Nick! But is it too late?  They agreed to get married because Cate was pregnant but lost the baby just before the wedding.  They decided to marry anyway.  Cate really, really wanted children so Nick felt his sole purpose was to give them to her.  When he found out he was sterile, he started to pull back from Cate thinking she should be with someone who could give her children. By this time Cate realized that she wants Nick more than children but they aren't communicating so he doesn't know this.This was a well written, emotional book with great descriptions.  I was worried that Nick was going to leave before Cate got to tell him how she really feels. I thought the characters were perfect for the book. I liked watching them grow and mature.  Both Nick and Cate changed dramatically as they got older.I won this book in giveaway.
$SUMMARY.: Really good

$review_text.: Fairly balanced book outlining theories about 9-11 and how or why it happened- gives you viewpoints pro and con as to who was behind it or complicit. Anyone with half a brain figures it out-a MUST READ for anyone who thinks- Should be required reading for most of us-- Wake Up America-!!
$SUMMARY.: Draw your own conclusions-

$review_text.: So the writing was good grammatically. And the characters were pretty decent. The world the author built was intriguing if a bit moth eaten. The heroine was a bit of a Mary Sue- praying for the soul of a cow that was just eaten by a dragon had me laughing out loud (not the effect I think the author was going for).The problem with the book was the dozen little things that didn't fit, didn't make sense, weren't explained, or were just too convenient. In other words, the plot was just weak. There was scene after scene that just didn't make sense. The girls are wearing medieval gowns one minute and sundresses the next. And there is royal blood and non-royal blood and we don't really explain the difference beyond one not being royal but it's super important. And there are Dark Callers who do things... darkly, whatever that means. And we need to marry this one girl for the safety of the ENTIRE kingdom, but we decide to take this other one instead, but not to marry just as a mistress. But we pay her father for mistressing rights on her the same as marriage rights for the royal blooded daughter. Real romantic! (Err by the way did you want use the word consort here but felt it was too high a grade level for your readership? cause mistress has a slightly different and less permanent connotation) . And then the barbarian horde comes to attack us! They can sense if you're evil (that's a power they have) but they are willing to kill if someone says you are evil even if they can't sense it. And then we think your hot and really want to get in your pants, but the second we get home we're going to ignore you for a few days. And then we realize you are our soulmate and the axis around which our universe revolves, but the second someone talks smack about you we believe them. Never mind that you're all black and blue and probably suffering a concussion.And then at 66% I found myself yelling expletives into an empty room and called it a day for Caller of Light. So the search continues for smexy fantasy books that aren't geared toward the young adult crowd. It's thin pickings in this category, but I really regret taking a chance on this one.
$SUMMARY.: ugh
