$REVIEW.: This is my first book from author Kallysten and I've been totally blown away. I really loved Bodyguards. Bodyguards tells the story of a 19 year old woman, weeks shy of her twentieth birthday. Her name is Vivien. And her whole life is about to change.Right away the book starts on an eerie note - a nightmare. Something about getting this type of an insight to a characters mind always makes me empathize with them a bit more. Dreams are pretty intimate, and when they are nightmares you really get to get a peak at what can really drive a person. The whole first chapter is just filled with this foreboding aura, and it had me flipping pages as quick as I could.But its not all doom and gloom. There's a love interest here by the name of Brad. And Vivien has a crush on him. And she gets the courage to ask him out. And Brad denies her. I really had to laugh at Vivien's reaction when he turned her down. I would have (sadly) reacted the same way. The fact that I could see a bit of myself in Vivien really endeared me to her a bit more.As the blurb says, Vivien witnesses a knife fight, and then learns the truth about Brad - and his twin brother Aedan. They are sworn by oath to be her bodyguards, and she is a princess. Then they take her to Foh'Ran, an alternate world. I really am not a "portal" person. I don't go for the swirling mist, the rippled circle, whatever it is that characters use to jump from one world to another. But Kallysten may change my stance on that. There's not all kinds of focus on the actual portal, which is something I am grateful for. And the other world of Foh'Ran, although it may not be as modern, is certainly an interesting world. It is full of beauty, and for lack of a better word, magic. Although its residents would scoff, and insist you call it what it is - The Quickening. There are vampires and channelers, Quickening shields and castles. And this is where Vivien really learns more about herself, and how she is descended from Foh'Ran royalty.A bit about Brad, cause I love a leading man. He's everything a leading woman dreams of, aside from available. Brad has a thing about being "proper" and as it annoyed Vivien, it annoyed me. But luckily for us all, Brad is not all brawn - he definitely has brains. And ladies, keep an eye out for him. At one point he makes a speech to Vivien that made me stop breathing and pant at the same time. Killed me and repaired me all at once. And I am more than sure it had the same effect on Vivien.One character who I thought was infinitely interesting was Aedan. Aedan, whose life took an entirely different turn than his brother, has some obvious issues he should work out. But I really want to know his back story in more depth. I found him to be so intriguing and... barely harnessed. I won't blow any secrets about him, but suffice it to say I thought he was fascinating. And as I like to harass authors, I might have to see if I can pry any information to see if Aedan will be featured more prominently in the future. There is also the matter of a woman named Ciara, whom definitely needs more face time with the readers in the future!I really enjoyed this story. I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released. The characters and the world were captivating. And there is a beautiful first kiss, one befitting a princes - or any firl who has given her heart away. I am a sucker for a good kiss, and Vivien's definitely lived up to my hopes.I just finished the book this afternoon, so I have not yet researched (read: stalked Kallysten's website) to see what's in store, but I know I definitely will be in line when the next book in the Quicksilver Codex is released.

After a terrible ordeal in his earlier years, he retreated into a private shell and gave nothing away. He played with various guys on the side but never showed commitment or interest in sharing his lover or boyfriend with his family...but then along comes Beau who has been a family friend and adored Ethan for some time.This story is about persistence, loyalty and love...god bless Ethan's parents and family for giving him the courage and support to be the wonderful man that he is...and thanks to Beau who finally completed Ethan.This is a superb M/ M romance that follows the Alluring Indulgence series -it's hot and extremely delicious -  highly recommend

$review_text.: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Mark Houston is a marine in love with his best friend, Jon&#8217;s, fianc&eacute;e, Libby. He is chosen to break the horrible news of Jon&#8217;s death to Libby. While dealing with this horrible responsibility, Mark realizes the Libby sees him as no more than a friend. Libby desperately needs a friend, and Mark is the very best. She comes to the shocking realization that Jon was never going to marry her. Jon loved the military more than he loved Libby. Mark and Libby go their separate ways after Jon&#8217;s funeral, and Mark joins Alex Stewart&#8217;s organization, The Team. The Team gets disturbing news that a drug cartel has smuggled opium into the country in fallen soldiers coffins. Jon&#8217;s coffin contains opium, and the head of the drug cartel will do anything to get it back. Will Libby survive the cartel? Will Mark get there in time to save Libby and her family? Will Mark get the girl in the end?I was dreading reading this book because I was disappointed in the first book in the series. I was very pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed Mark. I loved the fast pace of the book. I also loved getting to know more about all the members of the Team. I loved Mark and how devoted he was to Libby even when she was engaged to his best friend. ***spoiler alert*** I especially loved how they both saved themselves for the one. I get tired of all the manwhores most books write about. I found it endearing and I was cheering for their relationship from the beginning. ***end spoiler alert*** Overall, I loved this second book and am looking forward to the coming stories of the other members of the Team.

$REVIEW.: Luc is an Owl shifter, is French, has been widowed and has just found his mate
 Dylan is a young man of nineteen who is attending college, lives with his parents, was badly injured in a car crash so can't walk without aid and is gay

 Luc recognizes Dylan as his mate

Luckily Dylan likes older men but he is about to find out there are secrets he is not aware of, even within his own family


 He doesn't know about shifters so how will he take the news Luc is an owl and his cousin Kai is a platypus? And what is up with those Dingo's?  A new pack is born and Luc has been made the Beta which he is happy with but will his mate be joining him?Of late there has been a level of dissatisfaction with this series and it does continue with this one


 However, I am trying to work out why it is just ok
 Essentially there is nothing wrong with the story at all - I just didn't feel pulled in, shaken about and let go
 It is more I came, I saw and I didn't want the t-shirt
Do not get me wrong, Charlie Richards is one of my favorite authors and I have everything Amazon has from the author


 I can't put my finger on it but think it is an impression that the depth of character and story are missing with the last couple of books


 I will be looking for more from this author because I do follow Wolves of Stone Ridge and A Paranormal's Love series as well as Kontra's Menagerie.

$review_text.: I really wasn't a fan of this one
We've all read the best friends to lovers trope before but it's been done so much better elsewhere

One of my biggest complaints is the &#34;hero&#34;, Lucas

He was a caveman and I pretty much hated him
After Lindy asks him to help clean up the apartment every once in a while he literally says, &#34;I got a dick


I don't clean.&#34; When reflecting on why he hooked up with his ex, Kelsey, Lucas comes to the conclusion, &#34;Enough alcohol and any bitch will do.&#34; Real charmer we've got here

Not to mention what Lucas did to humiliate Lindy all those years ago and he barely apologizes with the excuse that he was young and worried about what his friends would say.I also wasn't a fan of Lindy

She came across as a doormat who did whatever everyone else said


She didn't even argue when her best friend/roommate's dad and Lucas' dad tell her that Lucas is moving in with them

Hello if I am a 22-year-old woman paying my own rent, I'm not letting someone else tell me who will be living with me

And the &#34;mirror man&#34; storyline was beyond predictable and wrapped up in such a hurry at the end

I'm honestly surprised at myself for even finishing this book and couldn't in good conscience recommend it to friends.

It left me with a few wants and a few questions, but I loved it
******SPOILER******I want to know what became of Cadence's relationship with her parents
I want to read Marks proposal, I want to know what happened during her pregnancy, how Mark reacted to the news, as well as the subsequent 9 months

There were too many years missing between the end and epilogue, but still I loved every word

What became of Fanny, Oliver, Marks mom?S

Walden did a great job showing Cadences struggles and growing up..Mark has the patience of a saint with Cadence..
I would not have been as kind, There were times I wanted to vagina punch her.I love the role God played in Candace's life, but I'm left wondering if Mark ever really found his faith again.Even with all of these unanswered questions or wishes/wants...I still loved thus book and highly recommend it to everyone.

$REVIEW.: The first story by LRJ, had a good hero but a heroine that was just awful, making the story awful.The second story by MAR, I was looking forward to, but the writing was so repetitive I was lost in the details. The dialogue and conversations never failed to become obscure and frankly annoying a couple of sentences in and so this was not a good read for me.The last story  by SB, was the best but I did not see the connection. When Miles does not answer Nora's calls after the second time they meet, it was hardly the actions of a strong man and I could not believe in their HEA.So overall, I did not care for this collection and will be careful purchasing these author's books in the future.

$REVIEW.: Where do I start? I understand that these books are not any longer than a novella but you could add a little depth to the characters. Are the questions I have going to be answered? Such as Sadies relationship between herself and father?  How can Sadie go on being in a relationship with Hunter/ Zander? It is probably me, being as cynical and untrusting, but my experience has taught me that if a person you are involved has a tendency to hide crucial details about his life, he is going to do it again. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw there was a fourth book to be released I am looking forward to it. I hope everything gets resolved.

$review_text.: This book is so good I am almost at a loss to describe it. Other reviewers summarized the plot so I will merely say that it revolves around two Brooklyn fireman, Griff and Dante, who grew up together with Dante's family and one of whom is in love with the other but aftraid to admit it for fear that the other one will be upset when he finds our that he is gay.  Both the plot and the characters are spot on for authenticity and emotional reaction.  By that I mean that the two principle  characters are so endearing that you cannot help but fall in love with them. Most of the secondary characters are equally enticing.  Particularly Dante's family, a lesbian photographer and a Russian pornographer.  Sounds unlikely but trust me they are truly worth getting to know.  This book also contains some of the hottest and most stimulating scenes I have ever read (and I read on average, 3 books in this genre a week). In one of these scenes, Griff describes Dante's eyes when he sees them up close for the first time and realizes that they are not just a deep black but have a bit of green in them.  The description of Dante's eyes melted my heart and caused a bulge in my pants. That is only a minor example of the stimulating scenes that occur with considerable frequency. One other word on the gay sex scenes; too many authors in this genre are reluctent to spell out what the private parts of their characters look like; Damon does not fail in this regard either, lovingly describing each of his principal characters' privates.  Without such a description, the entire mental picture of the sexual activity falls short; with it, the scene is as clear as a video. This is especially true here because Griff and Dante are very different in this regard, and it is a csse of opposites attracting.This book is a terrific first for Damon Suede but hopefully not the last.  It is one you will want to keep and read from time to time over and again.  I cannot recommend it enough.

$review_text.: I really struggled with this book in a lot of ways

The hero and heroine are both such ninnies that I really couldn't root for either of them

Christine is meant to be angelic, but the way she leads on the phantom seems quite contemptible


She does it to save her life, of course, but it still seems heartless and cruel (which reaction, I suppose, proves that Erik, the phantom, is the most sympathetic character in the story)
Raoul, often described as a lad or boy or child, was hard to like also

His mercurial shifts from belief in Christine's innocence to accusing her of every possible betrayal were exhausting to read


And I have a hard time with a hero who, within the same scene, bursts into a "mad laugh" only to follow it by bursting into tears


Not that he's the only one who bursts into laughter or tears at every turn


All the characters did it


I was really hoping someone would just react by nodding occasionally, but alas, every scene involved extremes of some sort.The structure of the book was not something I enjoyed either
The conceit--that the narrator is reconstructing these events from diaries, reports, journals, etc.--made for a very uneven reading experience
Just when I would become caught up in the storyline, there would be another authorial intrusion as the narrator jumped in and mentioned where this particular information came from


Aside from interrupting the flow of the story, it also called into question whatever scene had just taken place
For instance, when Christine and Raoul are on the roof of the opera house having a private conversation, who recorded it for posterity? How, if the narrator is really reconstructing from existing documents, did he know what they said to each other on the roof? The device often made no sense, and every time the narrator interrupted the story, it reminded me that the device often made no sense.What I did like about the book was mostly the second half, when the Persian's narrative takes over and the real action begins
So much of the first part of the story happens off-page, that it was nice to have actual movement as Raoul and the Persian chase Erik


The second half is when the story begins fleshing out--so to speak!--the character of the phantom


We find out who and what he is, and understand how his "horrible, unparalleled and repulsive ugliness put him without the pale of humanity." It's easy to sympathize with the ghost, but it's hard to match the Erik of the story with the romanticized phantom of the stage production (or the egregious Gerard Butler movie version)


That Erik wants to be loved for himself makes him human, but most of his actions are those of a monster


It's a heart-breaking contradiction, especially when contrasted with the vapid Christine and Raoul.The poor quality of the translation could be partly to blame for my struggles with this book
I don't think phrases like "the viscount put his head under his hands and wept" or "the old lady's tempestuous chignon" are well-translated, nor do they make for a smooth reading experience
Nevertheless, I'm glad I read this and found out what the original version of this much-reproduced story is.

$review_text.: 4.5 starsOnce in awhile a book will come along and completely blow me away. I don't even know where to begin. I've read my share of sci-fi books before, but this is the stuff that makes my reading escape an entertaining and solid experience. Ficklin and Jolley are bright new voices in science fiction genre with their explosive novel, Extracted!First off, I have to applaud the writing here. Ficklin and Jolley gotz skills. You would never know this was co-written by two different authors. Chapter after chapter the flow and pace of the story is smooth, controlled and engaging. The voices were pitch perfect and the tone of the book was filled with wild action and stunning intrigue. There is so much depth in this story and so different then any other time travel book out there. The concept is really very cool. I love the idea of time travel, but this one is mind-bending on a whole new level of awesome. I love the idea of the time stream not only being a window into history, but being some kind of tangible force making it almost physically alive. I also love the idea of combining two characters, Ember and Lex who are rivalry time travelers and connecting them to an important historical family, but with no memory of who they were or what they meant to each other. That conflict made the story even more exciting then it already was, keeping me invested and enthralled from the first page till it's gripping conclusion.There is a lot happening here plot wise, so I'm not going to try to explain it since I think readers will want to discover all the mind boggling twist and turns this book has to offer. It's not hard to follow, mind you, but near the end of the book it starts to go from complicated to crazy-complicated and I had to really concentrate on every word to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. But once everything is said and done, it left me feeling satisfied and in awe. The ending is also really decent without any cliffhangers to drive us insane, but there is still enough questions that makes me want the second book that much sooner.I really love all of these characters. All of them are tremendously kick-ass in their own ways that make them easy to connect with and enjoy.Lex is a natural leader. He's a confident in control character who is loyal and brave. I love that he doesn't even hesitate when it come to finding a way to get Stein back no matter the consequences. Stein is my kind of girl. She's a feisty little thing that's strong and smart. She doesn't need a man to protect her, she's fierce enough that she can hold her own but still excepts help when she needs it. Ember is a lot more powerful and strong then she believes, but she doubts herself and her abilities. Somewhere in her (erased) memories she knows she's failed someone and she can't shake the feeling that it'll happen again. It was really great to see her confidence grow throughout the story. Ethan is a lot like Lex, but he has a playful coolness and a punk arrogance about him that makes you want to hug instantly. Nobel is also another character that I really enjoyed. He's an awesome friend and a genius when it comes to the time tech gadgets that were pretty wicked stuff.The romance in this book is very light but the moments we did get were warm and sweet. It may not have been the main focus of the book but it still wraps around the intentions and actions that lead these characters to go to the extreme, which was pretty romantic when you think about it.All in all, I had a lot of fun with this book and mighty impressed. The concept is captivating, engaging and fascinating. The story-line is pulse pounding amazing, the writing is effortless and effective and these characters will climb into your heart and never let go. I can't wait to see where Ficklin & Jolley will take this next. This is one time travel experience that will have you begging for more.Brilliantly done!

$review_text.: Why would any one read this fitness book? Yes it's writen by a crazy dude locked up in prison, the pictures are poorly quality, most of the exercises are basic ones, and the training routines don't have much variety.However this isn't just an exercise book, it's more like a true fitness book
There's sections on sexual health, internal cleansing, mind over matter, and having the right attitude in life


The author gives you the same tools and tips that have allowed him to stay strong and fit regardless of his situation
If he is able to stay healthy, break athletic records, and get stronger all while being lockup in solitary confinement, there's no reason we can't do the same.

$review_text.: Toronto undercover cop, Clare Vengel, is posing as a rich, pro poker player wannabe to find out who's been strangling players. With three people dead (one her predecessor) Clare needs to find answers fast before her cover's blown and she becomes the latest victim. But it isn't easy. Poker players are suspicious and experts at lying. Complicating the situation is the new, attractive player, Nate, and the possibility that some players are cheating.Death Plays Poker is the second in Robin Spano's series and it's fast-paced ride. The book is also filled with humor mixed with layers of angst as Clare deals with handlers who keep threatening to pull her off the case. She's also facing a growing attraction to Nate, confusion about her boyfriend back home, and news that her father is dying. These problems add depth to a character who's determined to find the killer despite her discomfort with the spoiled rich "princess" persona. Spano does a great job with multiple points of view, quick short chapters, and mounting suspense. This book has everything I love in mysteries: an interesting protagonist, humor, quick pacing, and a clever plot. I also learned something about the world of professional poker. A great read!

Not that the story was so creatively original or that the quality of writing was incredibly phenomenal (though it was very well written and quite humorous), but the tale the author tells us leads you to believe the characters actually exist and creates an empathic connection between us and them, making us feel their hurts and their joys and their laughter and love and heartbreak

$REVIEW.: Dogs were most likely the first animals to be domesticated and they are unsurpassed in their loyalty and ability to smell. There is also something about a ferocious dog that elicits an innate fear in humans. I have walked by fenced in businesses with guard dogs and they have barked at me. Even though a very sturdy and high fence separated us and I knew they were there, I started and involuntarily hastened my steps. This ability to intimidate humans is why they are effective in prisoner interrogations and why we have seen them used in the infamous abuse of prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison.This book is a history of how dogs have been used in warfare by the United States military, with a concentration on their role in combat and as security guards. Their history as guards is exemplary, military warehouses with a chronic problem of loss of goods through theft saw it end immediately after guard dogs were posted. The combat history of dogs is also good, but is more varied, largely due to human incompetence rather than that of the dogs. Unfortunately, the U. S. military considers a dog to be a piece of equipment, so there is an organizational mentality that considers them to be interchangeable parts. Each is of course different in temperament and training, so attempting to use them outside their parameters led to failure. Nevertheless, the lives of thousands of American soldiers were saved by the actions of dogs and many have been killed or wounded in action.Despite the exemplary history of dogs in war, the U. S. military does not allow dogs to be awarded military honors and those who are unable to continue in their military role are routinely destroyed. However, there are some that have led the movement to honor the contribution of dogs, either by monuments, cemeteries or notes in the official records. They are to be commended, because as long as they are used within their parameters, dogs have no peer.Currently, the war is now in Iraq and we have seen pictures of Iraqi prisoners facing guard dogs. The ongoing war on terrorism and against drugs could not be fought without bomb and drug sniffing dogs, so they continue to contribute to the battles being waged by U. S. forces of all types. From this book, you will learn the contribution dogs have made to U. S. security, and it is a story that is well worth reading.

I only expected recipes, but the book also talks about a huge range of symptoms you might suffer from, but would never associate with yeast: ADHD, Brain Fog, eczema and muscle pain, to name a few

The 14-day Cleanse is strict, but many of the recipes sound delicious and could be made ahead for several days&#8217; meals, or frozen

I saw quite a few recipes in each category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and even desserts) that I&#8217;d consider making

The list of foods eliminated during the Cleanse is long, but any regimen that lets me have avocado, beef, butter and almonds is a winner!

$review_text.: If the reader is looking for a play-by-play account of the Scopes Trial, then you've selected the wrong book. I recommend "Summer for the Gods" by Edward L. Larson. Mr. Mencken's dispatches were his arguments about the folly of the proceedings, William Jennings Bryan, the religious "yokels," and the pretzel logic used to refute evolution. These columns are well-reasoned works of metaphorical art. This small jewel compiles all his editorials concerning the trial as well as over a dozen B&W photos and the full court transcript exchange between Bryan and Clarence Darrow. (Be prepared. Bryan comes across as a confused dunderhead.) It even has Mencken's nasty, no-holds-barred obituary about Bryan. Even over 80 years later and I'm still shocked at the viciousness of the author's attack on a person who wasn't alive to defend himself. But to understand why Mencken took such an approach, please read the outstanding biography "Mencken:The American Iconoclast" by Marion Elizabeth Rodgers. People who are insecure and hate anything that questions or ridicules their beliefs should stay far away from this wonderful book. You'll just blow a blood vessel or two. All other readers should quickly get their hands on a copy. Mr. Mencken's pieces are still very relevant today.

I am a studier and like to have room for my own cross-references and notes.  There are no extra pages for personal notes, but these can easily be added.  The binding is sewn, which is rare find for an inexpensive Bible, and if you spend years marking your Bible, this is important because the pages are not going to fall out.  Use prismacolor col-erase pencils instead of ink as they will not bleed through.  If you need lots of marginal references or notes from "scholars," then this Bible is not for you.  For me, it is the treasure I've been looking for as my eyes are aging, but my mind is not.

$review_text.: Fierce is part of the 1Night Stand series published by Decadent Publishing. If you aren't familiar with the premise of 1Night Stand, you are missing out! It is a series of short stories by a number of talented authors with a common theme: a high end dating service called 1Night Stand. The force behind 1Night Stand is Madame Eve, who has the uncanny knack of taking the profiles of her clients and finding them the perfect match for what they need. Of course, if you can't tell from the name, the specialty of this particular dating service is a night of uncomplicated, no questions asked passion. Don't worry, Madame Eve is a pro at digging up any dirt on her clients, and only the best get accepted. (I KNOW it's just a book, but that kind of stuff crosses my mind!) Now that you have the background, I can tell you about Fierce!Katie is newly divorced and hanging out with her friend in Vegas to celebrate. Why is she celebrating? It's the end of a marriage that had dwindled into more of a roommate relationship. Ohhhh, then the real fun begins, her friend is happy to announce, in a crowded bar,  that her husband of ten years had never provided her with the big O. Oh, and that she bought Katie a 1Night Stand. (nice friend) Katie is horrified. Especially when she realizes that her 1Night Stand is at the next table and heard the entire exchange.Sebastian is man who has been hurt too many times by unfaithful women. He uses 1Night Stand to keep women from hurting him again. Katie's faithfulness to a husband who didn't meet her needs for so long is intriguing to him.The story is short and steamy, with alternating points of view. Sabrina York NEVER skims on the details in the sex scenes, and this story was no exception. You can really feel the hurt both Katie and Sebastian have felt in the past, and how it has effected them up to this point. Especially Sebastian. You can feel his loneliness and yet he is so moved by Katie. It is really an emotional story for being so short and being tagged as erotica.I hope this author ends up writing more of the 1Night Stand stories, because this one was awesome! I give it five stars.

The "bitter old man" worldview and social commentary are amusing. The 70s/80s nostalgia fits into the story, especially as all the old gang gets back together for the final tussle. The art is interesting, as if some of the background character faces are cut-and-pastes from films and live actors. Another great read for the non-superhero comic fans.

$review_text.: Not nearly as dark as Where Darkness Dwells. The Nightmare Within made me think of where our dreams come from, from what part of us, and the impact that they have on our lives. Born of trauma, or of lust, or the imagination or perhaps a replay of a beautiful or painful memory---dreams can almost have a life of their own.I found the premise of a "dream museum" very interesting. If I have one complaint, I really wish that we had gotten an exhibit by exhibit tour. You know, where you put on the headphones and you get this great narrator telling us all the good stories behind the exhibits? I would have liked to have followed more of these dreams as they roamed our world too. There is alot there, I am sure, and I wanted more. To be sure, we got to know Freakshow very well in all his nastiness.What I loved about this book was Kevin. That kid had heart. Not a false note there. He felt real and I was very moved by his story. And that really makes a novel for me. A good main character really drives the bus and Kevin is as good a main young character as Mark Petrie in Salem's Lot, and for me, that is saying alot. His story is heartbreaking yet he is courageous through it all.Kirsch also drops some really good surprises in the last 20 or so pages of the book. I mean good in that when the surprise is unveiled and you nod your head and smile because all the clues were there. Sophie's story in particular was really well done. In fact I was very satisfied with the resolution of all of the story lines and that is actually rare for me. Whether the resolution was dark and destructive, or tender and heartwarming, Kirsch knows his characters and he isn't afraid to let them be themselves.

It was a realistic thing between the two of them.. They clicked and connected.. Evy was skeptical cause Dean was the pretty boy player.. And it wasn't a secret.. Dean was upfront but realized something was different from the other women.. His situation that basically rocked his and everyone he cares about world around was a true story of watch who you screw around with- literally! Megan and her father Clay were absolutely horrible.. And the way Dean handled the situation at the end was brilliant... He's lucky he dodged a bullet! Great story, I loved the relationship between Brooke and Ben, Brooke, Ben, and Evy! The way they look out for her and how they love and looked out for each other! Dean and his boys- Jon and Shaun.. Excellent Friendship! Excellent bond! It's a great read...

$REVIEW.: STORY BRIEF:Luke comes from a wealthy family
 He's a real estate broker


 Luke's grandfather Nick threatens to sell the family's vineyard if Luke doesn't get married before age 36
 In defiance Luke picks Devon because he knows Nick won't like her

 Devon is shallow, grasping, and not known for her intelligence


 A few weeks before the wedding, Devon's former boyfriend appears wanting to marry her
 She breaks her engagement with Luke and leaves town
 Devon asks her half-sister Cat to give Luke the news and her note.Cat secretly has been in love-at-first-sight with Luke


 When she gives him the news about Devon, she offers herself as a substitute bride


 Luke is surprised, and he is sexually attracted to Cat, so he agrees
 Luke had an agreement with Devon to pay her a lot of money after the one-year requirement was met


 He makes the same agreement with Cat

 Cat doesn't care about the money, but she doesn't tell that to Luke

 He doesn't know that she is following her feelings.REVIEWER'S OPINION:Wow
 This was really nice


 I liked reading about all the characters
 Good stories need some conflict and bad behavior, and that was supplied by Devon and also by Luke
 Luke did something horrible which was hard to forgive


 But stories need conflict


 I base this one on Luke's stupidity
 Usually I don't like to read about hero/heroine stupidity, but I guess I could see someone with commitment panic and fears doing this
 So it worked even though I didn't like it.I enjoyed spending time with the characters
 I loved seeing Cat interact with Nick
 She had no fear of him
 There were some good lines

 There was a secondary story with a gay couple that surprised me which I liked


 I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say more on that
 My only regrets were at the end
 I wish it would have gone on longer, with more explanation and reconciliation, maybe some more time with Luke and Cat being happy
 I wanted more assurance and to believe that Luke would never do anything like that again

 I also wanted some conversation and more interaction with Nick.DATA:Story length: 370 pages


 Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words
 Sexual language: mild

$REVIEW.: The book overall is good, but the sections about eating fats confused me.First he talks about the 1980's war against fat, and he says they were wrong, and that fats are good because without fats you cannot get your fat soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K.  I agree.  But, then he says saturated fats are bad, and saturated fats are in milk and meat which is also the best protein sources.  So I just want to know why he is advocating low fat when he says low fat diets are bad. He does recommend olive oil, nuts and fish because of the fats in those.  I believe that whole dairy is better for you than skim, because it's more natural and less processed.  Altering natural foods is what got us into trouble in the first place.I do understand about choosing leaner meats because we fatten the cows by feeding them way too many grains and it increases their fat deposits, which is unnatural.Also he recommends eating lunch meat, and lunch meat has an awful lot of chemicals, unfortunately.I would have liked a recommendation of what to look for in a whey protein powder, because I had never purchased any before.

$REVIEW.: This book in a lot of ways actually reminded me of one of my favorite movies, Forrest Gump. The plot carries you forward so that you become part of the story, but when you reach the end, you realize what a complex, intricate plotline it was. Plus that author does an incredible job of working in historical events and settings so that they flow seamlessly into his story. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that, as in Forrest Gump, there are a couple of cameos from some very well-known characters. Overall, loved this and I'm looking forward to checking out the other books in the series!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome story!

Since we all (so far) face this reality, I find it helpful to consider it from various points of view. Clarissa Pinkola Estes is a gifted cantadora. I find myself returning to her stories time and again and this is one of my favorites.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this book because I presently attend a church where the dispensational chart that had hung on the wall was taken down and sent off with the former pastor. This has become a &#34;fashionable&#34; thing to do lately, and it was done with such mockery that I felt it necessary to both re-educate myself in the basics of this doctrine, and obtain charts and historical documentation of my own. This book is really well-done, and will give you an in-depth look at this doctrinal view. If you want to learn about a Biblical view that is as current as today's headlines, this is the book for you. Read it and and judge for yourself.

$REVIEW.: I am a Yoga enthusiast.  I want to know more about Chakras in a more digestible form such as this short book.  Also, I have trouble with meditation.The book asks you to read sections or descriptions before listening to the corresponding chapters in the 75+ minute CD.  When I do that it is Nirvana!I struggle with Yoga sometimes because of my back, so it is difficult to stay in one spot sitting cross-legged.  I just get "comfortable" and do my exercises.I appreciate the wisdom and experience of the author describing the chakra energy centers, so, this is a somewhat cerebral experience, instead of only a feel-good exercise.

$REVIEW.: My Take on this Journey:This is a very short Novella about Emma Harrison and Aidan Fitzgerald.  Emma has had a string of bad luck in her life, and she feels that her biological clock is ticking.  She is shy, witty, and a fiery red head with a temper to match her hair.  Aidan is a good looking, blue-eyed, blond bachelor, known as the office man whore.  He loves them and leaves them.  Emma and Aidan meet at an office party, and he gets his eyes set on the beautiful knock out, and decides that she is the flavor of the night.  The only problem is that Emma is very shy, and though she is attracted to Aidan, she is a woman that is too smart to get involved in a one night stand.  Once her girlfriends tell her about his reputation, all bets are off.  Aidan isn't use to anyone saying no to him, so he is taken aback by her negative response to his advances.This is a very fast-paced novella.  It starts out in the present, then goes back to two years prior, and tells the story of how these two characters first met.  Emma has had a lot of tragedy in her life, and isn't interested in finding a relationship.  In this short little novella, the author makes Emma into a well-rounded character.  The reader gets the essence of her.Aidan is a very self-absorbed character, yet very intriguing.  He is constantly being badgered about his bachelor status, and told that he needs to settle down, by his sisters.  I found him at times to be very blunt, and it was humorous how he thought that his cute little smile could get him anything he wanted.Sorry to say, that this little Novella has the dreaded little cliff hanger.  My followers know what I think of those!  Looking forward to the sequel, and hope it gives me the kind of ending that makes me go along for the ride.I give this little Novella a clock-ticking, thrill seeking, 3 1/2 stars.

$review_text.: This is a good southern story conveyed with intelligence and flair

 Cuddy Mangum is the police chief
 His friend, Justin Savile heads the homicide division


 He serves as the narrator


 He knows Cuddy loves the governor's wife and will not reveal the fact.There is an unsolved murder, the victim having the same  appearance as one in another jurisdiction
 Bubba Percy, state house press secretary, goes to Cuddy to report the death of a noted new blues singer, Mavis Mahan

 The governor is mixed up with the singer and the sheriff and others seem to be asserting control over the investigation awfully quickly

 Cuddy claims it is a suspicious death within his city's, Hillston's, limits


 Justin discerns that the person involved in the homicide simply resembles the singer

 Soon the identification emerges of Lucy Griggs.Hillston is supposed to be a small city in the Piedmont of North Carolina

 Cuddy tells a lot of state officials to resign before he charges them with conspiracy to tamper with a crime scene and destroy evidence

 The governor's wife has always felt she belongs to the state because it made her family wealthy


 The wife of the governor sends a message to Cuddy via Justin not to hurt himself on her behalf.Cuddy needs to establish who is the perpetrator of the serial crimes


 Whoever he is, he is close to the Hillston police department


 This is way better than the usual crime story
 There are many colorful characters and much realistic detail

 The plot is convoluted but reasonable in the bizarre world of tormented miscreants.

$review_text.: When I was in the store, I bought The Climax merely because it was endorsed by Zane. I had no idea that Allison Hobbs could hold her own in the writing department. I've never even heard of her, but after I read that book I went online looking up more stuff written by her. Oh my God! She definitely has an imagination when it came to The Climax. In every chapter, something more bizarre was happening. It got to the point where I thought nothing more bizarre was acchievable. With each turning page, she outdid herself. I don't know of many good writers who could do what she did with that book. Honestly, she didn't even need Zane's endorsement, but that is what got my attention though. The Climax is one explosive climax after another; the book will suck you in from the very first pages. Allison Hobbs is going to be something to reckon with if she keeps writing stuff like The Climax. One of the best unknown artists I've ever stumbled upon. Can't wait to read her next book. One of Zane's best kept secrets....

$review_text.: Wow!  Where do I start?  I loved, loved, loved this book.  Zeth is an ass that has no clue how normal people relate to each other.  He calls himself the dominant in the relationship but Sloane sure twists him up.  She really turns his life inside out.  This book contains nail-biting, pulse-pounding action, extremely hot and a bit kinky erotic loving, an extremely dominant alpha male, an intelligent and sassy "angry girl", and lots of thrills and intrigue.  I find it funny how their relationship totally lacks romance.  I laughed a lot, and grind my teeth a lot at Zeth and Sloane.  I recommend this story to everyone capable of tolerating a little kink with lots of action, suspense, and comedy.  I definitely plan on reading this series again for it deserves to make my top five favorites.  Enjoy the series and beware of the cliffhanger my fellow bookworms!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this book to assist me with carb counting.  The algorithm for estimating the amount of sugar alcohol calories from nutrition labels is flat-out wrong.  The author doesn't seem to understand basic accounting math.  The correct way to account for sugar alcohol carbs is to get the total carbs, subtract all the listed carbs, and attribute the remaining carbs to sugar alcohols.  Instead the author counts the itemized carbs and subtracts the total carbs from that.  If he calculated the excess carbs correctly using his methods, he would always arrive at a negative value; which is non-nonsensical. Instead he flips the subtraction around to avoid getting a negative result. This is irrefutable evidence there is a problem with some of the underlying assumptions (9 cal/g for fats and 4 cal/g for proteins) or a problem with the contrived examples in the book. The sum of the itemized calories (per serving) should never be larger than the total calories (per serving), which is measured using a bomb calorimeter.  The author then states to divide the number of sugar alcohol calories by 2, combining the divide by 2 step for getting the "digestible" sugar alcohol calories from the total sugar alcohol calories. I contend this will cause many people to divide the sugar alcohol calories by 2 twice, (introducing a -50% error for sugar alcohol carbs) when they are totaling up their "digestible carb" count. My point is the algorithms/formulas in this book for calculating sugar alcohol calories are incorrect. Gary Scheiner, please don't mislead people and fix this in future revisions of your book.

$review_text.: ***I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.I find triad relationships fascinating. The problem being that I haven't found one yet that I actually believe works.At about the 75% point in this book I wanted to stop reading. The only reason I didn't was because that is a prerequisite for getting the free copy. You have to actually read it before you review it. So I pressed on.I'm glad I did because the last say 7-8% made me feel a great deal better about the relationship and its viability.My fundamental problem is that, even at the end, when the book was supposed to be at the height of its positive emotion, I still found myself thinking Daniel was slightly on the outside. I know the author worked really hard to try to convince me otherwise, and this could just be "my problem" but nevertheless, there it is.I felt like Naya got the "good stuff" from both sides, and Remy couldn't have been wrapped up in more affection if he'd tried, but Daniel seemed to give and give and give and got a minimum in return.Another reviewer said her favorite parts of the book were the interactions b/w Remy and Daniel. I might have agreed if there were more of them. The only time they happened, for the most part, when Naya wasn't around was when the scene was antagonistic. The last little bit before the epilogue was nice, but it just that...a little bit.Before Daniel went to Hong Kong I was super excited about this book and was already dreaming of writing a 5 star review. Just after the Skype session in Hong Kong, however, was when it all fell apart for me. And Daniel's feelings were never directly addressed with Remy, he just worked them out in his head. I have zero first hand experience in the D/s world, but from my extensive reading on the subject - aren't subs supposed to communicate with their Doms when something has clearly distressed them? Working it out on your own is not submission, it's keeping control.Whatever. This is becoming more a train of consciousness than a review. I will say that I basically enjoyed the book and the author has excellent writing skills. I just didn't believe the relationship.

$REVIEW.: I loved the brokenness of Maria and Owen and how they appreciated and accepted each other the way they were


They didn't expect them to change, but in fact, connected more because they saw that hesitation, the freezing up, and uncertainty around others, it opened up those channels of trust.Both had such hard pasts that still effected their lives and how they interacted with each other.Loved Tina and the friendship there


How she protected and understood her

That she wasn't perfect herself, she had a mouth, that they were close and open with each other.The parents in this one infuriated me, as well as the bullies


I hate it, but I loved watching Maria and Owen rise above their past, and learn to heal.This is such a realistic story, and I appreciate how just because they were together, it didn't mean they were automatically healed, it just meant they had more support and incentive to work on it, getting a little better.The emotions in Lost are well done


There was so much terror, dread, pain and also love, acceptance and hope.I was caught up in Lost, and didn't want to put it down, and I am very eager to read Found!Bottom Line: Realistic, gritty and dark with steamy romance.

I read, fully expecting there to be resolution at the end, and when I came to the last page, I was yelling "NOOOOOOOO!" which the author probably heard in Australia.Anyway, I am now salivating for book two.I liked Allysha a lot
She's very well fleshed out and likeable


I rooted for her all the way through, and I understood completely how she got herself into the mess with Sean

I been there, sista! But I fell for the Iron Admiral myself, I must confess


He's very delicious

How she can resist him, I don't know
She has far more willpower than I.Another thing I really liked about this book is how the author doesn't over explain anything
Either you get it, or you don't, but it doesn't really matter
If you don't understand things like space travel and info droids, that's okay


She doesn't go into long info blocks describing what these things are and how they work
You, the reader, just gradually pick it up as you read


I LOVE that.I want the second book NOW! I need more Iron Admiral!

$REVIEW.: I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about it going in because it is so different than anything else I have been reading.  But, the story grabbed my attention and was wonderfully written.  I think the only thing that had me was the fact that they were so drawn to each other and how fast it was.  But, the main point of this series is that souls are drawn to one another and there is no stopping that."A significant fact about soul mates was that all past lives were remembered by the soul, which is what made them so strong once they were joined."I loved how fantasy and reality were combined so seamlessly in this book.  You may spend some time with Aprodite and Ares in one part and then are spending time with Rebecca and Robert.  At the same time, you can see how the fantasy meets reality when you have a Daemon come into Stephen (the controlling and possessive ex boyfriend) or when Ares sends his two delinquents (my word!) to try to stop Robert and Rebecca from being joined together.

$review_text.: 4.5 +++ Stars!!!5 +++ Flames for Hotness!!!&#60;I received an ARC from Ella Fox in exchange for an honest review&#62;Draegyn St John is one hot man. With a name like Draegyn what else would you expect? These Justice Brothers are a group of men that make your mouth water.Draegyn is a playboy and when he meets Victoria Bennett the sparks fly immediately. Draegyn does not have relationships and NEVER wants to be married. Victoria has just come off a scandalous relationship and wants to hide out. Well she does not get to hide out for long. There are many surprises in this story and I loved it!This was a fun and emotional story. The heat that simmered in the book had you waiting on pins and needles for the couple to get with the program. You do not have to wait long. Suzanne is wonderful that way; you don&#8217;t have to wait for the story or the pages to heat up. I felt sad for Tori on many occasions but on the flip side I thought she jumped the gun sometimes making me feel bad for Drae. You have a little angst in this book but not too bad. As with the first book Broken Justice the female in the story is a strong willed one. Tori Bennett takes no junk off of Draegyn St John. I like strong female characters because it makes the story more interesting. The chemistry between these two is off the charts. Draegyn is one hot alpha male.I really enjoyed this story. I laughed out loud, I swooned and my heart broke on a few occasions. Let me just say I loved the Binary Numbers story that Tori tells Drae in order to get him to dance. It was priceless. You will know what I am talking about when you read the book.Now you ask why the 4.5 stars instead of 5, I personally would have liked a little more at the end. I realize this is an on-going series and you do get a bit more of the all the characters as the series continues but not as much as I would have liked. Other than that, I loved the book and the writing was superb. The story flowed beautifully.This is my second Suzanne Halliday book (Broken Justice of course was my first) and will not be my last.

It took me quite a while to even get into it and care about the main characters

And in the end I just felt that it was a little predictable
The writing wasn't horrible just the plot was a little cliche
I've read other books by this author and enjoyed them

But I don't I'll read the second book in this series.

$review_text.: I remember when I first learned that good works would not get me into heaven -- that the only way to heaven was accepting Jesus as my Lord and Savior. Immediately a question popped into my head. If accepting Jesus is the only way into heaven, and I have that taken care of, why not just coast for the rest of my life? After all, if good works won't get me into heaven, then how important could they really be?  This book has the answer -- very!Backing everything up with scripture and quotes from the likes of Martin Luther, John Wesley, John Calvin, C.S. Lewis, Charles Swindoll, Charles Stanley and Billy Graham, Wilkinson explains that our behavior doesn't determine where we will spend eternity, but it definitely determines how we will spend eternity. He assembles a solid case to show that our eternal reward is determined by how well we manage our lives.Would you approach life differently if you knew that everything you did ultimately mattered?  Would you live a richer life as a result?  Would you be a blessing to more people?  If you are looking to live a life worthy of reward, pick up this book and get excited about the possibilities.

$REVIEW.: I would have given this book more stars if it were not for the ending. I am hoping this book is the first of a series because it had such an abrupt ending. No real closure for the two main characters.Lily Wilde embarks on a journey of sexual experimentation and discovery. She meets Seb who helps her on this journey with the help of his friends Ana and Grayson. She begins to have real feelings for Seb and they try to form a real relationship, but things get out of control. Not to give too much away but Lily suffers a major betrayal. This betrayal has a negative impact on her relationship with Seb.I believe that Lily and Seb's story is unresolved. There are also others unresolved story lines that need to be addressed. So I hope there is a sequel.

$review_text.: I enjoyed Down the Drain- Pyle knew when to stop instead of drawing the action and the story out too long, as many authors do.  Good writing style, interesting concept.  Was it scary?  I wouldn't call it scary, probably because the monster is a little too alien.  I took a shower right afterwards no problem.  But then again, the only thing that ever really scared me in the real world after reading a book were storm drains after reading King's IT.  For several months afterwards, I always veered away, wondering if a clown with sharp teeth would be looking back up.  But I digress...  Just because I didn't consider it scary doesn't change the fact that it was a fun, different, interesting read.-Bradley Convissar, author of "Dogs of War"

Well I got it so here's my end of the deal...There are some really great stories in this collection. The collection flies out of the gate with It Will All Be Carried Away. I thought this was a great story and really set the bar pretty high for the rest of the stories. Although the bar was high, Heath continued to hit that high water mark with other great stories.From ghost stories, to men slowly going crazy, to old school PI (ish) stories, There is a wide range of stories that all show this man has writing chops.

$REVIEW.: Andy Stanley is at it again.  I have not read a book of his that I did not like.  He is the type of guy you wish you could be around all the time and just soak up every word he speaks.  In his latest book, Enemies of the Heart, he discusses four emotional forces that compel us to act in ways that are not very desirable.  He goes into depth about each of these four emotional forces.  They are guilt, anger, greed, and jealousy.  He breaks it down like this:Guilt- I owe youAnger- You owe meGreed- I owe meJealousy- God owes meNot only does Andy discuss these four topics, but he also provides practical, and biblical ways to regain control of our emotions. He shows us ways that we can control our emotions instead of letting them control us.I think everyone struggles with emotional health and this is a great read to help us grow.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah.

$REVIEW.: Who ever heard of using stealing tricks, at one time used to steal, but now used to take what was stolen (steal) and put it back where it belonged?  That's how it all starts out when Livy saw a street lad steal something from a man's pocket right before her eyes.  Since she has changed her ways, she could certainly put the young lad's wrong to right so that is exactly what she did.  The boy didn't know it happened at the time and neither did the man, Jake.  The story grows in intensity as robberies increase. Jake, being the lawman trying to catch the robbers and Livy, fearing it is the homeless kids, trying to rescue them from the street and set them down a right path of living.  Jake and Livy do more colliding than the robbers do with goods as each pursues his/her goal.This is a great story. I look forward to reading more books by Pam Hillman

$REVIEW.: Ted Dekker is a prolific author, and if any single book speaks to his writing prowess, it is Green


This novel serves as the beginning and end to the Circle series, the first three books of which were published in 2004


It is the preferred starting place for new readers and truly does end with the beginning of the previous three books

If this incredible literary feat were not enough, Green also ties into the stories of many of his other works, either loosely or directly


In total, 15 of his novels are connected by the story of Green, Black, Red, and White
This four novel series is also extraordinary in that it is allegorical
Within the books, the entire Biblical narrative is portrayed, clearly and not offensively

Green is the apocalypse


At times, this novel will pull at your heart strings, it will make you scold the characters outright, it will make you laugh, and it will even make you cry


If you are new to the Circle or Ted Dekker, be prepared to take a trip.

With My Kind of Crazy, it didn't really matter what my schedule allowed for, there was no stopping once I started this truly beautiful, "can't put down" read.O'Sullian's heroine, Kendall Roarke is moving forward after a painful divorce by throwing herself into the remodel of her Bed and Breakfast in the small Cape Cod town she lived in her whole life
She may not be prepared for the complications of the handsome new vet who's moved to town, the not-so-small puppy she's fostering for a friend, or the uptight new neighbor set on making things difficult for her, but must figure out a way to handle crazy if she's going to successfully make her Inn a premiere wedding destination.Toss in a dash of intrigue and you have the perfect beach - or anytime - read.O'Sullivan delivers the same charm and wit that she did with Son of a Mermaid, with this modern-day, beach romance geared toward adults

By following Kendall and Jon as they work to set their past hurts aside and dip their toes into a new romance, O'Sullivan touches on all those emotions that most modern, busy people face

It rings true, touches the heart-strings, and gives hope that everyone has another someone who can deal with their kind of crazy.

$REVIEW.: Intent to Kill is an exciting look at smuggling in Cambodia and the extent that people will go to make money&#8211;no matter who gets in their way. Add to the mix an Interpol agent and a journalist who have a nearly explosive chemistry between them and you have an adventure just waiting to happen.Ms. Kennie knows how to write action&#8211;and there&#8217;s plenty of it in this book. And, I loved the characters of Claire and Simon, even while I wanted to shake both of them and tell them to trust each other. But, if they had done that from the beginning, the book would have been over before it started. Simon has to overcome some baggage from his past, and Claire believes she has to get her story&#8211;no matter what. Both of these nearly turn out to be fatal flaws in their characters.Throw in a cast of secondary characters who are also likable and you have an enjoyable, fast-paced read. This is the first of Ms. Kennie&#8217;s books I have read, but I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be my last. As a matter of fact, it might be interesting to see Claire and Simon in more adventures together&#8211;where they are working together instead of at odds with each other because of the secrets they carry.

As an individual who wants to live my best life, mitigate strife and aim for a peaceful, productive, beautiful life, I&#8217;ve turned to Buddhist philosophies, meditation, yoga and all manner of practices to develop a more meaningful existence. I am sometimes overwhelmed by the at-times fuzzy explanations provided in some guides on spirituality. This book broke out concepts into simple explanations I could easily grasp. The background information provided by the author educated me on the philosophy and benefit using meditation and past life karma-healing and several ways to incorporate Law of Attraction into my life. I put this book down after reading it in one sitting, feeling encouraged, motivated and excited to start my new hopeful life, knowing full well I will go back and nibble on its wealth for many years to come.This gem of a book will have you convinced of the need for raising your consciousness and resolving your karma in order discover and live out your life&#8217;s purpose. I appreciated the author&#8217;s focus on retelling his own story for illustrative purposes and it&#8217;s a real testament to the concepts he teaches here.

It is a very engaging and imaginative story of young Bernard discovering a hidden world and forging a link with his passed on Granda.  As with all of Ashmore's stories you are immediately pulled in to a lovely fantasy world that you wish were real.  Probably not long or substantive enough to satisfy the adult reader, unlike the Time Hunters.  This story will satisfy your Ashmore craving until Time Hunters 2 comes out.

$review_text.: Let's start by saying that I absolutely loved A Better Man (Book 1) but this one was even better
 As far as books being written in the M/M genre I think there are authors that are taking it easy and those that are putting it all out there, and this series it the latter


 Now, that being said, The Men of Halfway House series is more of a suspense/romance than say erotica but the heat is definitely there and it is done right!This second installment follows the guest that Matt and Julian were preparing to acquire as their first house guest in A Better Man
 Cameron Pierce just spent ten years in prison for manslaughter
 A list of other charges were thrown in to boot and all were completely bogus but Cameron was young, he'd just killed a man and to this day he believes himself to be a murderer, why else would he have been stuck in prison for his entire young adult life?  Now 28 years old he's out of prison, headed with Sam to The Halfway House and desperately wants to stay on the outside of those prison walls

 He has to do drug tests randomly and procure a job, which is when Matt hooks him up with Lucy and Bill at a local diner
 Cam couldn't be more happy than working for this elderly pair, taking on responsibility for the first time in a decade and finally earning a little money for himself
 That is until he meets Hunter.Hunter has just turned the big 40, he is a Lawyer who works himself silly and hasn't had a relationship in who knows how long
 He's works for the State and is tirelessly trying to end the drug trade that seems to be getting so much worse


 He stops in at the local diner everyday for one of Lucy's famous fresh from the oven cookies

$review_text.: Through love, a witch begins to question all she has known. She has spent her whole life guarding the sea against the ancient god she believes to be evil, a lonely task passed on through her family. But when she falls for a selkie maiden, she begins to wonder if she could have it all wrong.This story was wonderfully evocative. I loved the vision of the witch, lonely on her island in the middle of the sea. The idea that we are brought up thinking things that might not necesscarily be right is such a great theme, so many people are brought up by their parents to have such bigoted and discriminative views, but sometimes realise the wrongness of it. It is a bit of a lesson about judgement, but wrapped in such a beautiful fairytale that it does not feel preachy.This tale really touched me, especially the bittersweet ending. This story is a must, not only for lesbian teens, but for everyone to read! An amazing piece of mythic fiction!

 I have been in sales for years and I HATE cold-calling

 Who doesn't?  This book helped me focus on what is really important - setting appointments and getting in front of the customer and provide personal contact
 I lost that focus somewhere and my cold-calls were flat.I sell HR and OD consulting and getting senior executives and HR Directors to give you the time of day is very difficult
 Since reading the book and implementing his suggestions, I am much more comfortable cold-calling and setting 2.5 times as many appointments.The book is easy to read and full of simple ideas and solutions, but if you don't implement the ideas, even the greatest of ideas won't work

 Give this book a read

it is the best money I have spent in a long time.Also, his ideas about getting people to call you back are so simple and effective, I almost laughed when I started receiving so many call-backs

$review_text.: Author: Allen MalnakPublisher: Two Harbors PressISBN: 978-1-937293-36-9So much has been written in the realm of fiction concerning holocaust survivors that I didn't expect anything unique when I picked up a copy of Allen Malnak's debut haunting thriller, Hitler's Silver Box. Was I in for quite a surprise!The fictionalized story follows Dr. Bruce Starkman and his uncle Max Bloomberg, a survivor of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. While Max was in the camp, and owing to his silversmith skills, he was commanded to craft a small silver box that was to be given to Hitler as a present from his hideous henchmen. Apparently, the box was to be used to hide some extremely important Nazi documents. Most horrendous was that the silver Max used was extracted from the teeth of the thousands of Jews that were slaughtered by these barbarians.As the yarn unravels, we learn that Bruce, after both his parents had died when he was a young lad, had a very close relationship with his uncle. Bruce is extremely distraught when he receives a phone call from his uncle's attorney and is informed that Max had died and his body transported to a non-Jewish funeral home, where he was crematedAccording to Bruce, all of these details were very much out of character, as his uncle was an orthodox Jew and cremation is strictly forbidden under Jewish law. He is also dumbfounded when he discovers that the death certificate didn't contain any clear cause of death. Apparently, there were needle punctures and bruises on his uncle's body and furthermore, someone claiming to be the medical examiner, completely by-passed performing an autopsy. Another troubling element was that his uncle left money and written instructions concerning the care of his dog that he knew was already dead and buried. Something surely didn't add up. To complicate matters, Bruce believes he is being followed.While all of this is materializing, Bruce finds himself in the middle of a relationship breakup with a smart beautiful woman who unfortunately becomes enmeshed in his troubles and, after disappearing for a few days, is found dead. Is there a connection between his uncle and girlfriend's deaths?Determined to find out what is going on, Bruce comes across his uncle's personal journal concerning his prison experiences in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, some fifty years ago-something he had never discussed with him during his lifetime. Also discovered is a white manilla envelope with a crude, yellowed map with names he didn't recognize. And what really shakes up Bruce is his uncle's note mentioning that if he should find the envelope, he would already be dead. Poring over the personal journal, Bruce uncovers more about the mysterious box and what it contains, particularly, as stated by his uncle, "the thought that he was actually reproducing the dreaded swastikas on a present for the fiend whose grandiose goal was the total destruction of my people."Half way through the book Bruce meets up with an attractive aggressive Israeli woman, Miriam, who works for security in the Israeli Embassy in Paris. Upon learning what Bruce is up to concerning his uncle's silver box and the secret document therein contained, Miriam insists on helping him track it down. The couple find their way to the Czech Republic and at the same time they are being hunted down by a bunch of nasty and savage neo-Nazis killers bent on finding the box and the document before Bruce and Miriam have the opportunity to destroy it. Let the games begin!What really sticks out in this novel is that Malnak serves up just the right balance of nonstop chills and thrills. His scenes are crystal clear, permitting the reader to picture every detail, as he deftly weaves together a plot with unexpected twists and turns that never gets boring, thus providing great entertainment. It is a novel that it isn't as if you can't put the book down, but rather you don't dare put it down as readers are hurtled toward a chilling climax replete with plenty of action. In the end, Malnak has succeeded in creating a great intoxicating and breathtaking read that will keep you up at night. Most of his characters are well-realized with the exception of Miriam, who should have been introduced at an earlier stage in the narrative and more fully developed-after all, she does play a vital role in the plot.

$REVIEW.: Crystal Ships is an epic tale of drama that is filled with a sense of uncertain destiny. I was only barely familiar with the song, &#34;The Crystal Ships&#34; by Jim Morrison and The Doors, but after I finished reading Richard Sharp's novel I was intrigued enough to listen to the song even though, by my count, 'crystal ships' is mentioned only four times in the book. But playing the song paid off;  Morrison's deeply penetrating voice is filled with a sense of longing that is a combination of desperation and hope. I remember the song from my youth but&#8212;as I am wont with many popular songs&#8212;I do not listen too well or carefully to the lyrics. But as I listened I realized the brilliance in which Sharp captures Morrison's mood to create a poetic, if not spiritual, foundation for Crystal Ships.The story begins at points in the late 50s and early 60s as the author builds the biographical backgrounds of his central characters who are two young men from Boston and two young women from New Jersey and through whose lives the historical and cultural upheavals of this a critical period in American history are seen to unfold with a visceral personal almost first-hand intimacy for the reader. The backgrounds of the central characters&#8212;two men and two women of Irish and Italian (one Italian-Jewish) extraction, respectively&#8212;form a sense of the American melting pot in the confluence that was to transform American society in a melting pot that increasingly was to became not only one of ethnicity but of world interests. John F. Kennedy is himself a historical, iconic figure who represents both the hope of change, and of tragedy and disappointment. Young Americans were inspired to begin careers of public service, and many others were mesmerized by the appeal of Camelot...there was so much hope. And then it was over, coming to a crashing end that, in the novel, parallels the demise one of the novel's central characters who explicitly connects and even forebodingly predicts her demise with a sense of connection with Kennedy.And then comes along Vietnam War&#8212;which Kennedy had begun taking steps to wind down, and an Administration led by Lyndon B. Johnson that increasingly alienated many of those who were captivated by Kennedy's idealism. The crystal ships of idealism and hope appeared to be rapidly fading into reflections of alienation from the government and from public service, and by the traumas inflicted by realities of napalm, apartheid and social injustice. And I think these are the troubled waters in which the crystal ships are navigated throughout the course of the epic. The recklessness of the Vietnam War was paralleled by reckless overdoses of sex and drugs. The author skillfully plays on the anticipation of which particular characters will be victimized by the violence and recklessness of the age. The reckless conduct of the war was matched by the wreckage of the war on America's social structure and (if I may comment, on its economy) and yet who is to say that in some irony of ironies the dislocations that were occurring were in some sense pregnant with a positive potential. Perhaps the inevitable shakedown of America's foolish sense of invincibility at the same time exposed some of the old norms such as social injustice and conventional sexual mores but, not implausibly, could also in the end advance social progress. Ignoring the boundaries of the rational tend to rapidly teach lessons to both individuals and the greater society. When change is necessary, the underlying the pain, suffering, and terror are ignored at even greater peril.The reader relives the traumatizing assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy through the lives of characters that are developed with skillful artistry by Sharp. From this point on the novel becomes one not one of social history, but a whodunnit of a murder that is unresolved until the end of the book and that turns the lives of our cast of characters upside down. But the senseless death is an opportunity for the characters to refocus on their values amid the turbulence not only of a turbulent time but the unpredictability of life itself. The last third of the book seems to me to be a struggle towards that end, about the meaning of life when we are left in the dust of calamitous disappointment and sorrow. I found the gradual passage to maturity and personal victory to be inspiring. I do not think that this novel is a statement against idealism, but I do think that the author makes an effort to understand the relevancy of idealism in the face of hard realities. In different ways, his characters display strength, some heroism, and ultimate victory by staying true to themselves despite the disruptive waters that disrupt the voyages of their crystal ships.As a whole, the novel moves along very well. The first third takes a little patience as the author builds his characters in a manner that gives the reader a vested interest in their outcome and destiny. We know the course of American history over the roughly 20 years that encompasses the novel's storyline, but in the novel as in real life people differ in the decisions they make in connection to dramatic changes in the world and in society. There is certainly an abiding philosophical question concerning what if any influence individuals can make on national and worldwide destinies, but the destinies of each individual, it would seem, can very much hang in the balance. In the end, this novel is a book about hope and personal destiny. There is much tangible information and insight concerning the Vietnam War era that in themselves make for a good read. But the pathways to love and success become crystal clear and at times inspirational, and for this reason I highly recommend Crystal Ships by Richard Sharp.

$review_text.: Book:  Desire and DeceptionAuthor:  Sharon BuchbinderGenre:  Erotic Romance, Erotic Romantic Suspense, Erotic Romantic ThrillerLength:  NovelThere is so much happening in DESIRE AND DECEPTION by SHARON BUCHBINDER that I feel I could write a review that is five pages long.  The momentum just keeps building and building throughout the book.  The story line keeps getting more and more complex as you go.  If you like your sex scenes smokin' hot, your suspense edge of your seat, and your thrillers fast paced, this is a book you will thoroughly enjoy.Sarah Wright-Rosen is a professional woman working at the local college.  What I liked so much about Sarah is the growth this character went through in the book.  She started out a little wimpy but grew into a strong, fierce woman that when faced in a dangerous situation, stood her ground and even pulled her gun when needed.I had a problem with Dan, Sarah's husband.  I'm still not sure I like him very much.  He is a busy, good looking doctor that seemed to me, selfish and demanding when it came to his opinions and needs.  Through a series of events in the book that made me want to kick his butt, he was forced to back down from some of his opinions and support his wife and the remarkable circumstances she found herself in or possibly lose her.Then we have Izzy, the princess of a Mexican crime boss.  What a great character!  She works as a professor at the college Sarah works at, and they are best friends.  Polar opposites really do attract.  Sarah, being such a nice person, Izzy is her exact opposite.  She is spoiled and deadly.  As you get further into this story, you start to learn of the deplorable acts perpetrated against Izzy as a child and the reader gets some insight into why she is the person she is and why she likes her sex rough and under her control.  I really enjoyed the interaction between these characters because I felt, through Ms. Buchbinder's writing, Izzy was in some way reaching out to Sarah to get a little normalcy.  I truly believe that although Izzy would make fun of Sarah, she also felt drawn to her because she knew Sarah was the one person that she could count on for anything.I must say that one of my favorite characters in this book was Dan's mother, Gert.  We met this eccentric older woman a couple of times.  She is a bright humorous spot in this book that takes some very dark turns.I went into this book blind.  I had not read any reviews because I like the book to unfold for me as I read it.  I am totally blown away with the direction this book took.  Without giving any of the plot away, I must say that never in my wildest dreams would I have thought an erotic book would have such an interesting intricate plot and be so full of twists and turns.  This was a really great read!

$review_text.: Like all solid science fiction writing, Hoornaert manages to tie in an unmissable amount of social commentary in his writing, which I particularly enjoy. Despite the far-flung and seemingly &#34;out of this world&#34; setting and plot, the Shons, with their herd mentality and their inability to think for themselves is quite obviously a nod to global culture, and Tompa Lee stands out as the hero who inspires some to break away from this narrow-minded way of thinking. Science fiction shouldn't just be about outlandish adventures in space and ray guns; it should also tell us something about our own society and reveal truths that we may regularly hide from. Great science fiction authors make hard truths more palatable, like giving us our medicine in a spoonful of applesauce. I noticed that Hoornaert attempted to make some statements about society in the first Tompa Lee novel, but the underlying messages and blatant literary communiques were more obvious in this second story, without being heavy-handed.That being said, even if that all went right over your head and you read this completely at face value, it's still a heck of an interesting plot and is worthy of praise on that point alone. There were some missteps and a few difficult sections that could use the stiff red pen of a copy editor, but generally, Hoornaert hits the nail on the proverbial head. I particularly liked the indecisive, human nature of Tompa Lee, who was unsure of what her role in this unfolding saga was really meant to me. The internal monologue was beautifully written and you really got a sense of who she was. To be able to so engagingly place the reader in that perspective is no easy task, and Hoornaert seems to do it effortlessly. The romantic surges of the plot were entertaining, if a bit distracting, but there was plenty of other action and uncertain plot developments to keep you tearing through pages to the very end. I'm very much looking forward to reading book #3 as soon as I get my hands on it. Really Good Stuff!

$review_text.: I absolutely thought this story was creative and interesting. I couldn't get enough of Connor and Donna. They were thrilling and the chase was exciting. I thought Donna was awesome with her bluntness and her feistiness. I'm glad I read this story because it totally blew me away. In some ways this was humorous and dramatic. I really couldn't get enough.

$review_text.: Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- Michael does a good job of creating sub characters who really BENEFIT from domination (as opposed to simply being turned on by it). Poor Jim is established very soon into the novel as being in a really bad place in life. Once he meets Marcus, that slowly but surely changes.- There's tons of sex in this book, but I liked it because the sex is used to show the characters' evolving attachment to each other as well as Jim's blossoming as a sub and the gradual calming of his frenetic temperament.- The sex starts almost immediately, as is typical of this author's books, but Marcus waits to actually penetrate Jim until about a third of the way through the book, which I liked. That scene doesn't occur until the two of them have built up some trust and have begun to develop deep feelings for each other.- The two characters have a natural chemistry that translates into scenes where it's obvious that they're comfortable with each other and enjoy each other's company. There's a scene where Marcus and Jim go grocery shopping that had me giggling for about 5 straight minutes.CONS:- The first time Marcus takes Jim home and gives him a spanking, Jim is adamant about not wanting to do that. But because he doesn't have a safe word, Marcus just ignores Jim's protests. Marcus's first thought about safewords comes after they've already done 2 or 3 scenes, and it's several scenes later before they actually get around to selecting a safeword and using it. Overall, Marcus has a problem with not listening to Jim, especially since Jim is a total newbie to the BDSM scene.- There were several plot threads that weren't wrapped up to my satisfaction at the end of the book. The story here is basically just little scenes here and there of the two men's life together, but a few times, one of the guys would bring something up (the idea of Jim being collared, for example), and that "something" would never come up again; thus, some things I was looking forward to seeing I never got to see.- I think it's sweet that Marcus calls Jim "baby," but he goes a bit overboard on it sometimes, saying it a little too often for my taste.Overall comments: I liked this book, as I like most BDSM works by this author. Marcus is a super pushy Dom; I think SOME of that is a result of arrogance, but I also think sometimes he's just entirely clueless about how his actions will be perceived by other people. For the most part, I didn't mind his pushiness, but some readers might very well hate him.

It was good to see another side of him. Grandma was really great in the book. I give this book five stars because I liked the series. Each couple should have their own ending.

$review_text.: From the blurb here at ammy I thought this might be a mystery. I wasn't sure what type though. Turns out it is a mystery but a bit of a thriller as well!The characters were very well done and really jumped off the pages with authenticity. The writing is not overly descriptive nor does it hamper the flow of the story. The mystery develops at a good pace and you will find yourself anticipating the eventual resolution before it gives you a satisfying thump of "wrong!". I don't want to spoil.Engaging characters, writing that keeps the flow clipping along, and a satisfying length made this a one sit reading for me. There is nothing objectionable that I remember which means I can share this with my teen with no worries. I enjoyed it and plan on purchasing some others of the authors work.

$REVIEW.: This book is not what I was expecting at all. I knew it would be hot and I knew that it would be intense but what I wasn&#8217;t expecting was the emotional attachment to these characters and thier circumstances. It&#8217;s far from perfect, but they are doing the best they can and given what they have had to deal with. The subject matter is hard to relate to and hard to undertand, but Teresa Mummert takes that very hard subject material and makes it into a beautifully told story.Annabel and Colin are getting second chance at life. They are getting the chance to start over but Colin is having a hard time understanding what it is that is going on beyond their escape. He doesn&#8217;t know how to move on from the emotional binds that keep part of him in the past. He will always protect Annabel and he will do anything in his power to keep her safe. He knew from the moment that they met that she was something special. He is determined to keep her safe at all costs. Colin is a woman&#8217;s man&#8230; but he has to be in control. Not only is that the nature of the beast, but the only way he knows to be. Strong, determined, sexy and Dominant&#8230;Annabel is just trying to get on with her life, to learn to live again with their new circumstances and in a new environment from what she was used to. But she knows that no matter what happens in her life, Colin will be there for her. He has always been there for her, he will always be there for her. He is sometimes protective to a fault but she knows that she will always have that security because he will always be the one she can lean on for support.Together they appear to have it together, even though it doesn&#8217;t make sense to one another, apart, they struggle and everything falls apart. Can they get beyond the pain and torment of the past and find a place of peace and love?This book was gripping and when I started reading it, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to get beyond the subject matter, but the way the story was told, I wanted the characters to make it through the past so they were able to move on to a beautiful future. These characters came from a bad place and a bad situation, but Annabel doesn&#8217;t have the same memories of that place as Colin does and it is heart breaking to know how much he has gone through but it is also a true testament of what he would go through to protect Annabel.This book was gripping and touching and emotionally raw. It grabbed me and sucked me in and I couldn&#8217;t put it down. The writing, the story all of it, very moving. I highly recommend this book. It was a lot more than a simple love story. Colin stole my heart with his bossy demanding way, Annabel made me smile with her constant push back testing his nerves. I really enjoyed this read.*I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review

But I couldn't get past some of the dialogue and the way it was written. There really wasn't any depth--it seemed that all of the emotions, conversations, actions....they were all surface. I kept waiting for them to dig deeper. But there simply wasn't much depth to the characters or their predicaments.

If you decide to go on the journey read carefully. I had to go back and re-read a couple sections just to follow the who's who. I am still undecided if I will purchase book 2 and find out how the author wrapped this whole saga up.

 I have read many books dealing with threesomes and this one gives you more than hot steamy sex


 She adds emotion to it
 I greatly appreciate that in the story


 Every girl fantasizes about this topic but to see it through Cait's eyes was on point for me

 I felt her panic, indecision, desire and acceptance


 Questioning whether she could do something so intimate with a third person
 I loved both Nate and Liam they were sexually dominate but tender with Cait
 Nate told her they would stop at any moment if that is what she wanted from them


 This should be required reading for all men.

$REVIEW.: Oh how I loved this little novella!  It&#8217;s no secret I&#8217;m a huge fan of anything Nikki M. Thompson writes, and this story is no exception.  Thompson has a knack for writing down-to-earth, believable characters that I, personally, want to be friends with.  With this one, she drew me right into a period of time that was one of the best times of my life, and I re-lived it right along with Charlie and the gang.  You&#8217;ll laugh, you&#8217;ll love and you&#8217;ll be highly entertained.  This is Me is the perfect treat for existing fans of Rebound and Resilient, but can also be enjoyed as a standalone.

$REVIEW.: This entire book played out like a film noire in my head, for some reason. It starts in medias res, then slowly develops it's characters and plot before going headstrong into the book's pinnacle. It's probably because of the beginning slowness of the story line, as well as the lack of descriptive visual traits of the characters that made me a little apprehensive of giving this five stars, but the thriller did just as it promised, it thrilled. I was surprised with how the book started to shock and hurl me throughout the next chapters, as the suspense built up. This story is definitely unique in it's plot, and I love the different twists and turns it makes.

$review_text.: If you are interested in a highly practical urban/suburban survival manual this is it.  Too many "survival" or "preparation" manuals focus on things like "bugging out" or surviving in the wilderness/living off of the land...  Here's the cold, hard truth...  Virtually no one / none of us can "live off of the land" for an extended period of time - finding/creating adequate shelter, finding/obtaining adequate nutrition, etc.The truth is, if the SHTF (defecation hits the fan), the reality is that 96% will be where we live - likely an urban or suburban setting.  We need to know the best way to prepare and survive and thrive where we live.  Were we to "bug-out" and start to drive for the hills, here's the truth of what will happen...  we will eventually get stuck in gridlock, run out of fuel, be attacked by hungry/hostile refugees, and be in a world of hurt...The reality is staying put, getting appropriate training, and having adequate supplies in your own home is the way to go...  Hopefully, you don't live in a volatile inner-city area that is dangerous in the best of times, let alone in times of turbulence.  If you can - M O V E!This book teaches you how to do things right.  It is practical.  It is sage advice.  Mr. Aguirre knows of what he speaks.English is Mr. Aguirre's second language.  Don't let that bother you, it didn't bother me (some typos/grammar issues - who cares?).  Buy this book for the wisdom it contains and what you can learn from it.It may save your life or the life of those you care about it.I recommend it fully.

The description about how the fallen came to be, I just didn't really care, I wanted to get to the raw grit of the story. Well, I was wrong - It went to 4 stars pretty darn fast.I am actually glad that it started that way because it made more sense the further you got into the book, so KEEP READING!!Wow Stevie did a great job and I was really pissed once it ended. I didn't realize it was a series. I wanted to find out what was going to happen and where Brooke and Gavin were going to end up. (OMIGOD! OMIGOD! - I need the 2nd book now!!)I absolutely loved the characters. Brooke and Constance were a HIT. I loved them! I was cracking up at their conversations. It was hysterical!Gavin was a total Alpha Male and Hot as sin! I was ready for him to tear off his clothes and start yelling like Tarzan. He was in control...but slowly losing it. His passion and love for Brooke was making him crazy.Oh,and Dan - Totaly creeper!!! yuck!My emotions went up and down reading this book. It was also mysterious and made you wonder who was the &#34;Stalker&#34; or who was previously involved with Gavin... I just couldn't believe it... I had my suspicions..but I was MAD!

$REVIEW.: The landing of our Marines at Inchon, Korea was a brilliant military maneurver, reuniting two Divisions, currently seperated by the North Koreans, south of Soeul ! Thus began the sorrowful war of attrition of a Marine Division never before suffered in such numbers as the return from the Chosin Resevoir! This campaign lacked the foresight of its commanders, the weapons and technology to win any conflict! The US forces were woefully lacking in strength, training and understimating the enemy! What followed was a nightmare of withdrawal (&#34;attack in a different direction&#34;) of 74 miles to Hungnam ,made the Little Big Horn look like a minor skirmish!The Marines have never made that same mistake since nor will it submit to a Military Commander with so little foresight and disregard for the men who suffered for that shortsightedness! This story is a must if you really want to understand the why's of the Korean Conflict! Tate

$review_text.: Ten years ago, Adrian and Val were roommates in college

 For one week, they were even a bit more
 But, even though their romance didn't survive, their friendship has endured.I loved this story!!!  I almost didn't read it


 The title kinda threw me
 I think of librarians as little old ladies with auditory issues; not a sexy Dominant with a Master's in Library Science


Not to mention one with a brilliant mind and a killer body.Truly, this has got to be one of the best seductions ever written

 Adrian has waited ten years for the man he loves to get a clue
 Since that obviously isn't happening, Adrian takes matters into his own hands

 Poor Val doesn't know what hit him

 I almost wanted to feel sorry for Val, but he has spent so many years looking for love in all the wrong places


 A sneak attack was definitely in order


 There was a hint of bondage, but honestly, there is way too much love and respect for that to fly.This story is well written

 Adrian might be the title character, but this is really the story of Valentino's seduction
 And the beautiful thing was that most of that seduction was with their clothes on
 The lovin' is hot and I can't remember the last time I smiled so much, while reading a book.I only pray that Lee Brazil stays in a nice, sweet relationship
 Cuz, if he ever goes prowling...no one would be safe

 The man's mind is deliciously wicked


Highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: This is a free novella (at least it was for me) in the Amoveo Legend series. I've read several works by Humphreys and I do enjoy her storytelling. She makes it fun as she imbues her characters with normal emotions and characteristics to where you can nod your head as you are thinking, &#34;oh, yea, I do that too.&#34; And if you read my review of the other story I read in this series, I will say here that this one had much much better editing to it. But it is way too short. Granted, it takes a good storyteller to be able to pack that much punch into so few pages, but I would have loved to have much more background and activities between these two as she made it fun. This one needed to be novel length. More please.

$REVIEW.: This story was deftly written.  Author, Rene Folsom, pulls the reader in from the first sentence and like that anticipated kiss, leaves you breathless and wanting more.  Her writing is effortless and leads you joyously into the melee that is Heart You.  The clincher comes from a candy laced kiss and hurls you straight into the arms of pure pleasure.  You will walk away looking to walk toward a "helping hand."  This short was definitely worth the read and definitely a bargain.Rene Folsom delivers a tremendous story, filled with delicious tension and a fulfilling release.  This is her first published work and I am looking forward to her future endeavors, whatever the genre.This story is Erotica and contains F/F and F/M/F sexual situations.  Adult Content.

$REVIEW.: Ms. Lake definitely continues the tremendous style of writing displayed in her earlier books: Gun Shy, Under the Gun, Different Dress and Ricochet In Time.Stepping Out: Short Stories takes the reader on a terrific journey through a gambit of emotions with each of the stories: sympathy, dismay, shock, anger, fright, empathy, anger, loss, laughter, and love.  Although Jumping Over My Head and Vagabond are my personal favorites, each story will move you in its own unique way. While each story may not be long in length, there are 14 stories total, each is quite impactful. You will feel like you are right there with each of the characters, sharing their feelings - whether crying with them or laughing with them - helping them fight their way through their trials and troubles.Already a fan of Ms. Lake's work, Stepping Out: Short Stories just reinforces the reasons why. It is a great book and will be one picked up and read time and time again!

I work as a counsellor in a cancer support centre and I thought it may help me to help the carers and families of cancer patients with communication. It has.

$REVIEW.: KNOW NO FEAR marks the 19th book of the Horus Heresy series. For those of you who are unaware, Warhammer 40,000 is a table top game set in the 41st millennia: in the grim darkness of the future there is only war. Anyway Warhammer 40,000 is epic in the truest sense of the word, a science fiction universe with a slathering of dark fantasy thrown in for good measure. For a table top game it has a surprisingly rich and detailed history due to contributions from some great fiction authors. The greatest of those authors is without a doubt, Dan Abnett and the greatest event in the history of the game's whole shared-world fiction is the Horus Heresy.All the above was written for the benefit of those unfortunate enough never to have heard of WH40K. That said, KNOW NO FEAR is NOT a good starting place for the uninitiated. If you have an interest in genetically enhanced superhuman warriors battling against all manner of vicious foes then I suggest you start with HORUS RISING, the first book in the Horus Heresy and a wonderful way to test the waters and see if this is a series for you.KNOW NO FEAR takes place shortly after the initial hostilities of the Heresy have kicked off. The XIII space marine legion, the Ultramarines, are caught unaware by a supposed ally-turned- traitor during muster for a campaign against the orks in another sector. The betrayal is so complete that within hours a majority of the loyalist fleet has been destroyed and the planet of Calth is wreathed in flames with casualties accumulating at an alarming rate. KNOW NO FEAR is all about one of the greatest battles of the Horus Heresy, a fight to the death between the stalwart Ultramarines and the fanatical Word Bearers.To date the Horus Heresy books have fallen into three categories. There are the plot and character development pieces, sparse with action and focused primarily on displaying the character of the players of this galaxy spanning high speed chess match. Then of course there are the novels that bask in hyper violence as only space marines can deliver. These books are so affectionately described as bolter-porn. Last there are the truly great pieces of fiction that transcend the "shared-world" stigma, novels with deep characters, engaging plots, and furious action sequences. Unfortunately KNOW NO FEAR does not fall into this final category, rather it would probably best be described as bolter-porn.Don't get me wrong though, this does not have to be a bad thing, especially if you've been keeping up with the series. The last few Horus Heresy novels have been lackluster character pieces. I love the new focus on storytelling inherent in the series but it seems as though great action has taken a backseat to overbearing attempts at "literary" writing. KNOW NO FEAR is a much needed change of pace, delivering on the action with one of the highest body counts since the earliest days of the series as the two largest space marine legions duke it out. Abnett writes battle scenes with real talent, showing all the levels of a military engagement from high command strategy to small unit tactical. There is a little something for every adrenaline junkie, from cold void boarding action to siege warfare and even some space marine on daemon melee.The reason why this is a good book instead of a great one is simple. It lacks character depth. The book starts out great, Abnett's prose is beautiful and striking from the get go and his unique approach to writing this specific novel was awesome. The pacing is brutal and chapters fly by. The POV is split up amongst a rather large cast of characters whose perspectives start just before the tragedy and tie up just after. This method is highly successful in portraying the awful series of events that take place and while I was reading I got a disaster movie vibe. Readers get a unique view of these superhuman warrior elite as spectators, victims of an insidious plot...at least until they get their bearings and fight back.The problem with this, as successful as it is, is the lack of characterization. Unless you've been following the series very closely you are unlikely to be able to tell who most of these characters are or why they matter. There is no clear main protagonist because the cast is spread so far to get a wide glimpse of the carnage. Readers will be hard pressed to maintain tabs on each of the Ultramarines and as excited as I was to see Ventanus, Captain of the Troublesome Fourth he never shined as brightly as I'd hoped for.One final complaint. Because of the analytical nature of the Ultramarines they use the terms "practical" and "theoretical" in conversation quite heavily. At first this seems like a neat quirk that can be attributed to their combat effective minds. Eventually though the dialogue does get a little grating. This is nowhere near as bad as Abnett's use of the phrase "wet-leopard-growl" in PROSPERO BURNS, but it can be irritating.KNOW NO FEAR is a fun read, a must have for WH40K fans. There are some great cameos and even a little foreshadowing to the future of the series. Anyone interested can order the book now at the Black Library website where it has been released a whole month early.Recommended Age: 14+Language: Some, including fictional curse wordsViolence: To the extreme. These are superhuman warriors created solely for the purpose of winning wars against the most despicable foes imaginable. And now they're having a go at each other.Sex: NoneNick Sharps, Elitist Book Reviews

$review_text.: The story is sweet and simple and the characters well-drawn for this genre.  It's a nice bit of fluff to get you through a lonely evening, a rainy weekend or a lie in when recuperating.  However, the many grammatical errors come as jarring speed bumps to the smooth flow of the story.  In this day of unconcern for quality in print and the flighty manners of the publishing industry this particular version of the book is horrendous.  It is more like a self-published work and never comes near professional quality.  Perhaps it was released in haste to meet a deadline or a bottom line but that has been an insult to fans and readers.

Honor and Nathan have honestly got to be my top 5 couples
Top 5 books really
Honestly, it's that good
What starts out as a morning run for Honor turns into the run of her life


She is kidnapped by a serial killer

The things that she goes through is horrible and her quick thinking is what helped save her

Nathan is running through the motions of life after the army, friends were killed while he lived, his guilt, I just feel very bad for him


He is at a weekly poker game when he gets the one text that changes his life forever


 Will he be able to save her? You will have to read and see...Wow


The chemistry between Honor and Nathan is just scorching, just hot

 You cannot help but fall for these two and just want everything to turn out all right


The things that they both go through are horrible, unimaginable and what I loved most it that this is real life


Of course not love what happens to people but it is a real life plot and I thought the author did amazingly well

The emotions you feel are at a high
I was beyond freaked out when it was about the killer


I'm talking at the edge of my seat freaking out


I'm not a fall in love at first sight type of girl but under these circumstances can see how it was possible

I love how the author didn't straight up go for that

It was more along the lines of I could fall in love


Well done!!I loved that it was in both of their POV's

It just made it all the more enticing for me

I also loved their chemistry


It was a beautiful thing, especially coming from what they had to go through


It just made it more real.There wasn't anything I disliked from this story

It all flowed really well and just couldn't have asked for anything more


I was just on this story from the get go
I did not want to put this down and was sad that it was done
I would love to read more.If you are looking for a book that has you gripping the pages (or kindle/wink!) this one is for you

You honestly will not regret it.Story 5Sex 5Overall 5+++++Reviewed by Beggin from Mommys a Book Whore

$review_text.: Em lives in a tiny, close Gulf Coast community known as Mermaid's Hands, a ramshackled collection of houses roped together and set on wooden foundations that float when the tide comes in and rest on the mud flats when the tide is out. The inhabitants maintain a precarious existence by and on the sea. Em loves her family of quarreling parents,a beloved older brother who is in jail, and a younger sister in fragile health. She also has good friends - especially Small Bill. Compelled by a desire to know something of the wider world and a longing for adventure, Em has Small Bill take her out in a dinghy and flings a bottle out to sea containing a message to an unknown reader.  Mysteriously and perhaps mystically, her message is carried, ultimately by a crow, to a political prisoner of a repressive Indonesian island's military regime. Kayamanira, called Kala by her young pen pal, is imprisoned on a platform suspended over a volcano. Em innocently sets in motion experiences that evolve into regime-shaking events - not to mention upsetting the status quo at her home and school.With exotic locations at both ends of an unlikely but loving friendship, the author propels the story forward through exchanged letters, journals entries, and the memos of the secret service of a nasty regime that is so blinded by clinging to power that they make a molehill, a local festival, into a volcanic insurrection. Em is a delightful protagonist with the spot-on perceptions of a youngster with a well-meaning and loving heart. Because of her youth and inexperience, events gradually unravel in unforeseen ways into a frightening denouement. This is a first-rate novel with important depths concerning love, loyalty, and the meaning of freedom.

$review_text.: Nedra and Sinclair (Sin) Reasoner have more or less settled down into normal life in the four years since their marriage and previous debut in Crystal Rhodes' Sin.  They have even adopted three children, Colin, Trevor and Gillian, each with their own needs that both Nedra and Sin have been happy to fulfill as a family.  Their home has become a happy, healthful and respectful one filled with lots of love.  The only problem is something or someone is lurking in the shadows ready to pull the family apart.While someone seems intent on stalking the Reasoners, one of Nedra's two best friends returns from a cruise to announce she is now a married woman.  Sharon's revelation turns the happy household upside down for a short while as they all adjust to the new member of the family.  Once the stalker's intentions are revealed, the Reasoners begin a fight for their lives against a very powerful and prominent opponent.  During the fight, they learn Sharon's new husband has within him the ability to help the situation, but professional courtesy dictates otherwise.  As the situation gains momentum, it could heavily impact two households.In SINFUL INTENTIONS, Crystal Rhodes does an excellent job of capturing the reader's attention in this spicy suspense that tells an endearing story about fighting for what you believe in and love.  This was not one of those books where I walked away wondering why certain characters were in the book.  I understood each character's contribution to the storyline, even if I didn't like it.  The writing was clear, concise and left no room for confusion with the storylines as they played out.  For all of you who love a good romance story with lots of suspense, try this one.  It will leave you breathless.Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers

$REVIEW.: I'm a little surprised that this little book has had such good reviews here so far.I made the mistake of first listening to it (or trying to) in the audiobook format, the author's fixation with dates throughout the text makes it very disjointed in this format - I have a daily commute for about an hour each way so get through more audio than print these days but this was just unpleasant to listen to.I've since thumbed through it in book form - a big improvement. Trust me, this is one book that doesn't work as audio...But that's not my main reason for only giving it two stars. Parkinson, in one section, relates the 'origin' of the saying 'Enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey'. Rather doing any research, she just rehashes the old myth about cannonballs and brass deck plates - a simple wikipedia search could have put her right on this and there was an excellent explanation of it given by Stephen Fry in one of his radio essays (Fry's English Delight).Of course, anyone can make a mistake, but when the mistake is a sloppy is this one it casts doubt on the quality of research in rest of the book, leaving a bad taste in the mouth.

$REVIEW.: Celebrating great ingredients and the best flavor-producing techniques are the reasons behind the cookbook, and those ideas come through abundantly. As Cook's Illustrated and Cook's Country founder and editor Christopher Kimball notes in the preface, "recipes with a limited number of ingredients are often the best recipes" and "They also show off one's skills in the kitchen since one has to pay attention to each and every item."As a guide for new cooks, this is an impeccable volume. There are standards in the beginning of the book that reveal basic secrets that just make sense, such as remembering to flavor and taste what you're preparing. More experienced cooks will find new ideas.The recipes themselves are featured in a wide variety of sections that most comprehensive cookbooks would include, including a vegetarian main dish section for everyone, and a Slow and Easy section that will get plenty of use this winter here. The recipes are clearly and cleanly written, and are easy to track while using them. The photographs are clear and make the finished food look appealing and easy to replicate.6 Ingredient Solution is a cookbook to keep with any cook's most trusted ones, and to pull off the shelf for frequent use.
$SUMMARY.: Wonderful volume to use often

$review_text.: The title of this amazon listing is wrong - it's not comfort classics reinvented but 'fresh recipes for the modern cook'.With so many recipes being online these days, I really don't buy a lot of cookbooks because they don't come with ratings like individual recipes do.However, after cooking 3 things out of here, this has become my favorite go-to resource
 The recipes combine fresh ingredients as 'finishes' that add a more sophisticated and fresh touch

 The flavor combinations are unusual

 Tonight, I cooked the picadillo tostadas which combines beef, raisins, apples, cumin, cinnamon, ground cloves, onion, garlic & tomatoes (plus a few other things) in the crockpot
 When slow cooked and tender, you fry up a corn tortilla (or whole wheat flour in my case), layer on the beef mixture.
add some slaw (cabbage mixture seasoned with apple cider vinegar and EVOO), slivered almonds and cilantro


 The flavor combination of sweet, tangy and the different textures (cabbage/almond crunch) created a phenomenal recipe.I've also made the marinara sauce using whole tomatoes - I've made this a couple of times

 Great recipe and all fresh ingredients thrown in.Lastly, I made the beef with argula and grapefruit salad with a honey lime vinagarette

 The flavor combinations work so well together - my finicky palate has really started trusting these recipes

 It's a very well done cookbook with images, directions and recipes.Wholeheartedly recommend.

$REVIEW.: I'm a nerd that loves reading about future technological trends and how it relates to marketing. I've found that a lot of news sites contain glorified press releases and hype, and am usually left confused after finishing them.This book was awesome. I got an overview of the big trends - mobile, data etc - and how they connected with each other. I learned about what is important and how everything interconnects. Reading this helped everything else I've read about make sense.Marketers probably wont learn anything they can immediately apply to their business. Still worth reading to see where all of these tech developments are leading, though.

$review_text.: This is a coming of age story of a young Jewish peasant girl who emigrates from the Russian Outlands (The Pale) with her family to the United States. The family settles into the slums in and around Boston. All become American citizens. Three more children are added to the flock and are much admired because they are the family's first-born Americans.Father has a difficult time keeping a job or business and frequent visits by the landlady only serve as a reminder that there is yet more work to be done to make it to "The Promised Land."Though life is tough in the slums, immigrant neighbors  share much of the same hardships and all seem willing to help each other when things really get tough.Miss Antin was born with a thirst for knowledge that feeds her inner desires and eventually helps lift the family from the slums. Much of the story centers around Miss Astin's love for free American education and free access to public buildings--including her beloved public library--which she dreamingly calls her palace.She greedily takes advantage of these opportunities and is able to pursue her dreams with the encouragement and help of her hard working family and dedicated teachers.I gave the book four stars because the reader is left with many unanswered questions regarding Miss Antin' s college experiences,  her chosen career, and details about the family's move to the fairy cottage.The reviewer suggests  that the reader return to the introduction and read again after completing book. Look for hints that may provide information left unsaid.

$review_text.: I had very high expectations and this book didn't deliver. I love Sarah and I truly wanted to like it. With the exception of a couple of recipes nothing made me go like "hum, I've got to try that". I've been making spaghetti squash for years so I was expecting something I didn't already know. In all honesty, Sarah's website has been a lot more useful in terms of tips and recipes than this book. I love Italian, french and Mediterranean cuisines and I pretty much have adapted many of the recipes out there to my lifestyle and nutritional choices - so this book didn't do anything for me. I know the intention of the book, but the constant "my own version" and "my own spin" took away a little bit of the magic of having purchased an Italian cook book that is Paleo. I found her stories of the trip a lot more entertaining and endearing than anything else. If you've been around the block for a while with your Paleo cooking , don't bother. You will be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: I have mixed feelings on this book, because while I really did enjoy it, it took me a while to actually get through. (The eARC being terribly formatted was mainly to fault, although I can't hold that against the book.) I was expecting this to be a light, fun summery read, but I ended up loving it so much more than that.The main reason I loved this so much! Rome. I mean, if I never get to travel anywhere else in my life, I absolutely HAVE to go to Rome. I must. I mean, crazy nerdy Latin scholar over here (can I call myself a scholar? Whatever, I'm doing it anyway). Which is what made me want to read this in the first place. And I mean, this will give you a serious case of the wanderlust. I did a bit of author stalking (he he) and the places described in the book were from personal experience. And Kristin Rae was spot on. The descriptions, places, experiences were described to perfectly and vividly, I felt like I was there. (And then started crying because I wasn't actually there. Not really, but I wanted to).Which leads into her writing, which, if you couldn't tell, was very well done. I've talked enough about the setting (well, you can never have enough Italy), so let's talk characters. I was all prepared to be mad at/dislike Pippa. I mean, get sent to Italy and you want to complain? But I think she handled being sent to Italy by herself for something she hated very well. And choosing to ditch her parents' plans and make her own cemented my approval for her. (I mean, I could only WISH my parents would send me to itself, but I can also only WISH that I would be ballsy enough to do all of that by myself.)The other characters--Morgan, Chiara, Darren, even &#34;bad-boy&#34; Bruno--were well-written and added a lot of depth and fun to the story. And Darren's contagious excitement over the ruins and history of the city was just super adorable. I mean&#8230; *insert heart-eyed emoji here*. His hair was practically its own character.So you might be wondering--what was it that made me take forever to actually get through it? Well&#8230; The Love Triangle. Now, when a book gets too awkward or romantically angst-y (is that a thing?), I will often put it down and have to focus on something else for a minute or do something else before picking it back up. It's not because I'm uncomfortable, but more of an  I really don't feel like dealing with this right now. Sooo basically&#8230;the entire part with Bruno. This wasn't one of the worst love triangles I've ever read. Just that it was really frustrating because come on, we all knew who Pippa should REALLY be with ;)This was a fun, cute read. It made me smile and laugh quite a bit. It was a great summery read (but be warned--it will leave you totally jealous).

$review_text.: This is an indirect follow to &#34;She Can Run&#34; by Melinda Leigh and follows a similar theme. Woman threatened. Nasty problems follow her. However, unlike the first, the hero in this book Rachel Parker returns home to her small home town to take care of her younger sister. Sarah, the sibling, is a bit of a victim and gets pounded in the book's opening scene by her loser drunk husband. Rachel nearly takes him out and in the process gets to meet the town police chief. Nearly from the start they have chemistry, but neither acknowledges it right away. But give it time. This at its essence is a love story/thriller. Leigh stitches the genres like a pro. This is better than her first. But her first foray is still worth a read. This one took me a little more than a day. It does have some bodice-ripping parts (friend in college showed me those in romance novels). Steamy. Still, two thumbs up on the action. Great characters.

$review_text.: I'm not really a horror fan. That's  probably the main reason why I haven't picked up Apeshit yet. I am a Carlton Mellick fan, though, and his storytelling skills have developed wonderfully over the years. He writes good, character driven stories, with strange plots that are compelling, and keep you guessing.Clusterf**k follows a group of college frat guys and a few chicks out into the mountains, where they plan on going 'extreme caving'. The characters seem generic enough to begin with, but when they become fleshed out throughout the story, their deepest fears, their wildest fantasies, their disturbing pasts bleed into the story.This book is certainly not for the squeamish. The detail of Mellick's descriptions are ugly and at times haunting. Of course, the caving expedition goes horribly wrong, and the urban legends that haunt the mountainside only begin to scratch the surface of what's really going on.Clusterf**k is wild, painful, ridiculous, frightening, at times touching, and above all, a wicked fun read. I'll definitely be checking out the prequel, Apes**t, at some point soon.

I have always had the romantic notion that I would one day pack up my stuff and travel around Europe in a VW bus living in total freedom (and sunshine of course :) ). This book opened my eyes to what is really involved in this kind of lifestyle and it has helped me see that it is not a lifestyle change I want but a long trip! It's full of practical advice, useful tips and quotes and pointers to further resources. There are so many things I wasn't even thinking about, it set my mind straight anyway!

$review_text.: As I write, the number above is the rank this book currently occupies as denoted by sales. There must have been a meeting on the &quot;grassy knoll&quot; of publishers to keep this brilliant work from us. The book has  only recently been published here in the US, this month, but Europe has  been enjoying this work of Mr. Wallace's since 1998 and in 5  languages!The work is brilliant, for this to be a debut novel is only  just this side of remarkable. The last premier of an Author that came close  to this type of exciting discovery was "In The Fall" by Mr. Jeffrey Lent.  The works do not share the same genre unless excellence has now been named  as such.The book moves like a wraith from the era of the pre-Reformation  Catholic Church during the 30 years war to Eastern Europe as it stumbles  from the nightmare of WW II into the evil existence that is Mr. Wallace's  creation. The reading of this book is truly an experience, a dark and evil  feeling that Edgar Allan Poe would leave a reader with. Reading this book  is to almost be infected with one of the forms of dread that lies in wait  for you in this work.The seemingly few graphic descriptions of suffering  almost pass you by, as unease leaves you cold and trying not to think about  the implications you have read. There is nothing common in the manner the  Author delivers his terror to you. Much of the book you are in a group  listening to the protagonist recount his story many years after he believes  he understands what it is that happened.The Pied Piper of Hamelin is as  evil in the hands of Mr. Wallace as that player of pipes has ever been. His  memory alone tortures those in a holding camp in Tarutz Poland, indeed it  drives one expected to be the most rational insane.When the young Doctor  enters Tarutz for the first time it is as follows "the despair hit me as  soon as we entered, seeping in silently through the windows, through the  leather soles of my boots, the wretched earth laden with poisonous seed. If  hell has a garden, an underworld equivalent of Eden, we were now  there."Fantastic writing, great story, and the talent pours from the  book as from one of the masters of the 19th Century.You will love this  book!

I liked the interaction and relationship between the characters; I especially love the main character Michael (Mac) McRyan. The storyline is taught and exciting.  DEADLY STILLWATER isn't the first in the McRyan Series; I didn't realize that until I was into the book, it was not a handicap because Mr. Stelljes understands, apparently, people are wont to do as much and provides just enough backstory so the reader isn't at a loss.  I am now reading Roger Stelljes' other book in the McRyan Series.

$review_text.: This book contains an interracial romance between a Black woman and Asian man

I was excited about a book that explores this racial mix
After reading this book I was really insulted
The female character is a stereotype even though she is a doctor

She has attitude for days and explodes for no reason

The more insulting part is that the character is only seen as beautiful because of her white heritage

This is expected coming from a white author
It is impossible for a non black author to write about a Black women's experiences and feeling (fiction and non) because they can and will never understand.Don't waste your time and money on this book or the other one she wrote (Ebony Eyes).

$REVIEW.: After owning an SLR camera in the 1970s, I have used compact cameras. Now that I have retired, I have taken up amateur photography again. Rowland is a patient teacher who breaks down the technicalities of SLR photography into bite-sized chunks. I especially like the "D" part of the book where the author explains all about photo editing on the computer. Unlike in the seventies, we have a wealth of tools available to make sure our bad photos turn out okay and our mediocre photos turn out great. For its low price, you'd be silly not to buy this guide!

$REVIEW.: As a monotheistic animist raised in both my traditional Native American traditions and as a Roman Catholic who finds little to no conflict in those two paths, I applaud Gregory Sams' work on this subject, reminding people of the place of the Sun in the foundations of world religious thought, and that the Sun is a Being in its own right, as the Ojibwa say, "an other-than-human person." Look at all the ancient and modern depictions of the Sun with eyes and a smiling face.  Others also are looking at reviving the ancient worldview of the animist in new ways, notably Graham Harvey in his bookAnimism: Respecting the Living World.Sams is not an academic scholar, but a man searching, recognizing and wrestling with an ancient and forgotten truth...that the Sun is alive, that it has sentience, and is the generator/center of life in our solar system. In trying to find common ground with the mainstream folks who were not brought up in an animist tradition, but are generally JudeoChristian and/or scientific materialists/secularists, he constructs the book as a developing dialogue with self. He considers the implications and looks at religion and history to figure out how the sun lost its age-old status as lifegiver and solar spirit/deity. Sams adds into the mix his thoughts about how science also might work with this idea of the Sun as a Being. Sadly however, in this he is doomed to failure, as the thoroughly immaterial spirit/soul is not liable to study by science, which is thoroughly empirical/materialist. It's apples and hammers :-)Certainly recognizing that recognition of the Sun's role and being as a sentient being is also reflected in the JudeoChristian/ancient Near Eastern idea of the Shining Host of spirits/intelligences/angels/stars arrayed around the Throne of the Most High, YHWH, and joining that with the animist idea that everything is alive, and that life would not be without the light and warmth of the Sun, that is not worship. Just because there is a recognition of spirits ("gods") greater than man does not mean we "worship" them. Do you worship your mother for cooking the meal that sustains you, even though she did not create the food the meal was made from? No, you thank, appreciate, respect, and love her. Catholicism differentiates between "Worship" of God and "veneration" of the saints for example.Animism is not a religion, but a system of thought, that all things are alive and are part of a web of relationship. There really should be no grounds for dissonance between animism and Christianity. The real problem is that in our society, materialism and Christianity have somehow become strange bedfellows.Now, certainly dogmatic materialism will have dissonance with this idea, given that materialists even have trouble granting the concept of souls to animals or trees, and even human beings in some extremist views. How can scientists see the Sun as a spirit when many scientists do not really believe in the existence of ghosts/spirits... or God Himself, except as an abstraction or a electrochemical "ghost in the machine"? Animism might be more acceptable to scientists if they remember that we are adapted irrevocably as social beings, and that we are hardwired genetically to create social relationships. We see this as children talking to stuffed animals and even the Sun; only gradually are we weaned away from this innate approach to Creation, as we are told to "put away childish things." Indigenous people continue to interact socially with everything in nature, as the Lakota say, "all my relatives."Sams ends his book with eight "afterwords" -principles- which evolved out of his ruminations.1. Intelligent evolution2. The importance of the small --seemingly "insignificant" bacteria3. Water too is living4. Centrality/transformative nature of fire5. Importance of food and health6. The perception and enjoyment of beauty is not limited to humans7. The question of human exceptionalism/centrality on earth8. Humanity's curiosity and innate search for meaningI particularly like Sams' use of quotes in his journey through thinking out his argument. For example he notes Einstein saying: "Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind."

Seeing that it's quite a long work, I thought I might struggle to remain interested in what appeared early on to be a turgid documentary of a desk jockey's exotic after-hours life in the Middle East.But it kept drawing me back, and proved a satisfying read. Mr. Fleming writes well - he creates atmosphere and tension, and makes one care about the everyday people lost in the fog of someone else's war.

$review_text.: Move over James Patterson - Holli Castillo has arrived

 Well, it makes sense doesn't it?  Patterson was an advertising exec; Holli Castillo is a criminal appellate public defender and former prosecutor in New Orleans

 Which one do you suppose has been up close and personal with the seamy side of life?  Castillo's first thriller - Gumbo Justice - takes us on a wild ride into the drug scene in the Big Easy's projects where we're confronted with intertwined mysteries

 Who is killing the defendants that assistant prosecutor Ryan Murphy failed to convict?  And how is Murphy's mysterious family history related to the killings?  The plot takes more twists and turns than the old Zephyr roller coaster at Pontchartrain Beach
 The final curve will blow you away, so whatever you do, do not peek at the last page


 Murphy is the best hard-boiled heroine since V
I
Warshawski, but she's smarter, tougher, and - in a piece of brilliant character development - paradoxically more vulnerable


 Gumbo Justice is fast-paced and tightly woven, combining a psycho-thriller, a police procedural in a city where procedure takes a back seat to impulse, and a terrific love story - a stunning achievement.

Kaitlyn DuChamps is the bad girl, floating through life on her looks and family money. Grant Ashworth is the hard working good guy who begins to see there is more to this woman than a smart mouth and hot body. The plot was interesting, the dialogue snappy, and the sex, hot. The characters were fleshed out into believable people and their relationship evolved. While the book is listed as an erotic romance, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to readers who enjoy a sexy contemporary romance. The third book just went on my TBR.

$REVIEW.: Tchaikovsky's life and death are full of mystery, with strong evidence for several schools of thought. Some researchers and biographers opine that his death was an accident, others that it was suicide, others that it was an ordered suicide. Some say that his lifelong neuroses were largely driven by his homosexuality in a society that forbade it, others show evidence that indicates that Russian society was more permissive than earlier imagined. In any case, unless the rumored hidden official documents come to light (and it doesn't seem as though the Russian authorities will let them come to light if they do exist!), there is more than enough ambiguity to fuel fictionalized biographies like this.The author clearly admires Tchaikovsky as a composer and did plenty of background research; almost everything here is based on either documented fact or documented contemporary rumor. However, the narrative never quite makes Tchaikovsky a fully-fleshed character. Perhaps because the greatest emphasis here is on Tchaikovsky's many relationships with male lovers, the other elements of his life (such as the loss of his mother or his yearning for children) get short shrift and so leave gaps in our ability to understand his character and his choices.The various lovers themselves get so little individual character development that they all blend into one another, which makes the various sequences of lovers rather repetitive. Antonina Miliukova, the unbalanced woman whom Tchaikovsky married in what he later referred to as a fit of insanity, receives virtually no sympathy or deeper investigation herself--she is much more of a neurotic victimizer than a victim herself of unwise passions and impulses.Rather like an unfinished composition, this book left me more aware of what it could have been than delighted with what it was.Note: Adult sexuality, including some brief semi-explicit depictions of sex, but nothing that a typical high school student would be unfamiliar with.
$No. helps.: [3, 5] $SUMMARY.: Lovingly written, rather repetitious, not quite deep enough into the characters

$REVIEW.: This is my second review of a Jack Pollard Gardening book which deals with the rare Red Worm, which, according to the Author is the only one worth considering for composting activity. This book covers all the basics of worm composting such as worm husbandry, worm residences, worm handling, worm purchase and of course what to do with your finished compost product when it becomes available. I was in fits when I discovered that you can purchase worms by weight from the Amazon website!An excellent beginners guide with several useful links to not only the Author's own Worms-on-the-Web website (my words!) but also to the innovative Worm 360 designer Worm Cottage that is probably as good a place as any for the worm composting novice to commence his or maybe her Worm Composting education.Of particular interest to gardeners is Jack's Garden Store page on Amazon with books, and all manner of garden requisites.As a Wormsman of some standing with Brandlings, which seem to like grass cuttings to frolic in, but with little knowledge of the red worm variety, I like this book for its comprehensive encouragement and factual instructions.Obviously this author is passionate about all things in the garden (particularly those that wriggle) and does a good job of covering the necessary steps for the aspiring Wormpreneur.Again I have to say that the layout with regard to formatting needs improving, as does some of the spelling and sentence construction. The table of contents is a nightmare to wade through. A little bit more time spent in making the reader experience more enjoyable would improve this book no end. Oh yes I almost forgot ...there is a section on making a worm/compost separator with a handy diagram for the skilled D.I.Yer

$REVIEW.: The Guardians of the Hidden Scepter by Frank Cole is a modern Indiana Jones type book.  The main characters are 14 years old and in a cool private school.  Amber loves her archaeology class and her teacher, Mrs. Holcomb - herein lies the problem.  Mrs. Holcomb (prefers to be called Dorothy) goes missing and it is up to Amber and her friends to find the clues to bring her home safely.A fun read that didn't disappoint.  Most concepts in this book will be well handled and understood by the younger crowd.  My kidlets will be in 4th and 5th grades this year and I believe they'd handle this book well and enjoy it too!  (I'm sure if it was made into a movie too, no one in my house would complain!)

$REVIEW.: A series about an immortal samurai who must kill a thousand criminals to earn the right to die?  Sounds like the perfect set-up for an endless bad-guy-of-the-week/tournament fighter franchise.  Except, in Hiroaki Samura's hands, this seemingly inane concept yields a story so rich it has few peers.Manji is the titular "immortal," tasked with redeeming a life of indiscriminate murder by taking out villains until he's paid off his karmic debt.  There's just one problem:  figuring out who the villains are is easier said than done.  He gets caught up with Rin, a young woman on a quest to avenge the murder of her parents by the maverick Ittou Ryuu dojo, a sword school whose members follow only one creed:  Anything to win.Far from providing nameless fodder for generic fight scenes, however, the members of the Ittou Ryuu are as fully-developed as the nominal heroes, each with his own distinct motivations and personality.  As Rin's hunt goes on, the question of who--if anyone--is doing the right thing becomes murkier and murkier.Under this story run a number of thematic currents, messages about the humanity of our enemies and the price of revenge.  The series completely avoids being ham-handed about these themes; they arise naturally from the characters' interactions.Samura, meanwhile, is a superb artist: his visual style has a unique, penciled look, especially in the lovingly-illustrated views of old Edo (Tokyo); his writing is second to none, with vivid dialogue that flows spontaneously from the various personalities at play (and brought into English by Dana Lewis and Toren Smith in one of the finest translations in all of English manga).  Page layouts are varied but organized (except for the whirlwind fight scenes, which can become hard to follow).If "Blade" has an Achilles' Heel, it is this first volume, which is simply not the strongest book in the series.  As fully-formed from the start as Samura's vision clearly was, the opening chapters simply don't shine the way later installments do.  Other volumes of the series waste no time on flashbacks or summaries, however, so reading from the beginning is a must.  Also, the production values on the American version of the book are not as high as later volumes; the reproduction of the art is disappointingly grainy.Despite these shortcomings, "Blood of a Thousand" is a necessary first entry in a series absolutely worth reading.  At its best, "Blade of the Immortal" is matchless in its beauty and power.~

$REVIEW.: I read the first book in the series basically in one sitting and I loved it. It was a fast-paced funny interesting story. This book, not so much. There was very little humor in this second book, the story was implausible, too long-winded and drawn out and relied too heavily on deus ex machina. It was a much darker story and I wasn't expecting it. There were instances in the book that were downright crude, unnecessarily so. After reading &#34;On the Street Where You Die&#34; I was prepared to buy and read the rest in the series. After reading this book, I won't bother.

By the end of the books she makes great improvement with the help of Reed and her brother's discipline. Definitely recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: OMG....This book is on the top of my &#34;Recommend to everyone&#34; list.I was not fully prepared for the amount of crying I did, while reading this book
I cried non-stop for the last 90 pages.From the beginning of the book you know something's wrong with Wes and you make your assumptions

When it's finally revealed it's like a sucker punch to the face (even though you already knew it was coming, it still takes you by surprise)

I adored the banter between Wes and Kiersten, it had me laughing quite a bit (even while I was crying)

Their connection is palpable and believable, even though it is kind of an &#34;insta-love.&#34; We've all experienced first loves, they're breathtaking
There is so much to take away from this book

I love all the &#34;wisdoms&#34; that Wes bestows upon Kiersten
They are deep, meaningful and add so much to the book


The author has a way of writing that makes you feel everything the characters are feeling

Making you feel like you are in the story

The storyline flows easily and I loved the two different viewpoints

Getting to see it through both Wes and Kiersten's eyes makes it that much more of a rollercoaster

Oh, and I forgot to mention Gabe....LOVED him
He was funny, endearing and loveable, even when he was trying not to be


I'd love for him to get his own book

Towards the ending of the book there is a little twist and I won't really say what, for fear of ruining it for those who have not read this...but it was nice and comforting
The book didn't end how I anticipated but it was a great ending
I will be recommending this book to all my friends!


$SUMMARY.: Amazong, emotional read.

$review_text.: You guys, I fell into tingly-happy-amazed book love with The "What If" Guy by Brooke Moss almost immediately. In fact, let me go ahead and tell you now that my main complaint is that this is Brooke's first book so there is no back list to go fanatically hunt down and read. I didn't have particularly high expectations since I had no idea what to expect, but let me tell you - the book blew me away! When Autumn and her son move back to her hometown to take care of her father, she runs into Henry, her "what if" guy - the one she never got over. As they get to know one another again, she also mends fences with the friends she left behind after graduating high school.It is, and I cannot stress this enough, very much a character driven novel. The conflicts are few and the plot is mainly served up via the daily lives of the characters. If you like your romance with high drama and tense situations - this probably isn't the book for you. Obviously I by no means found it boring - I absolutely loved getting to know the characters. Autumn was a clumsy basket-case, her son Elliot artistic and sensitive...and Henry: double sa-woon. He was actually a little too perfect if I'm being completely honest, but I quickly discovered I didn't care. I fell in love with everyone - from Autumn's town drunk father to the town's large supply of gossipy old women. I couldn't get enough of reading about the small town life.Since I grew up in about the smallest town you can imagine, I love reading books set in rural areas. So many authors don't get it right though - it's rare that they can get all the vibes down correctly. However, Brooke Moss excelled in that area. If I understand correctly - she actually grew up in the same town the book was set in.As I claimed earlier, Henry and Autumn's path to romance was a little smoother sailing than we usually see in contemporary romance novels. They spent the majority of their time together in the novel extremely happy - and I really enjoyed reading it! I felt really cynical because I kept waiting for horrible things to happen. Not that they didn't have bumps - they did, and one or two were pretty major, just short-lived. I loved them though, they had really great chemistry, another thing Brooke excelled at writing.But let me tell you, one of the main strengths of the novel was that it was absolutely hilarious. Seriously, I lost count of how many times I laughed aloud (something I normally try to avoid when I'm alone so I don't feel clinically insane). Autumn really knows how to squeeze every last bit of awkward out of every mess she gets herself into, but her voice was awesome - so much fun to read! Here is an example:"It is extremely difficult to eat a holiday meal with your ex-boyfriend sitting next to you. I took a modest helping of everything, then pretended to nibble on a slice of turkey every time Henry's eyes roamed in my direction. When his attention wandered elsewhere, I rammed spoonfuls of the gloriously fattening homemade stuffing into my mouth."See? Pure fun. I recommend this very highly to contemporary romance readers...as long as you can appreciate the fact that the book is about the characters and revolves very much around them versus a specific plot structure. I believe it'll be released in August, but is available now via NetGalley. Really great book, and you can bet I'll be reading whatever Brooke Moss comes up with next!

$REVIEW.: This author is a pretty good storyteller, but really needs a remedial course in writing. I did finish the book, in spite of its flaws, because the writer did succeed in getting me interested in the plot. In spite of myself, I did care about the characters.  That is enough to tell you that Jaden Skye (which sounds like a pen name, but I don't know) has definite potential if he or she can figure out the basics about keeping things consistent and doing a better job putting words on the computer screen.  The book is filled with inconsistencies, bad formatting, repetition of paragraphs, and grammatical errors.  This is not something that can be fixed simply by hiring a good proofreader. It requires deconstructing and putting back together again.What is discouraging is that this isn't a first novel. This is the third book in this series, albeit the first I've read. So we're dealing with either a writer who has gotten worse over time or one who doesn't care enough to recognize and improve on past mistakes.  As the Sharks say on TV, &#34;For that reason, I'm out.&#34;  I won't be reading any more Jaden Skye.

$REVIEW.: I picked this novel up this morning for my daughter, who selected it as one of the books she will read for her school's Battle of the Books. It was sitting on the table when I ate lunch, so I turned to the first page. Two hours later I finished the book, and I'd shed some tears on the way. Other reviewers have covered the plot points, so I'll just add why I'm giving an excellent book four stars instead of five. The problem is that the mother is constantly described as irresponsible, and the author even introduces a deus ex machina sort of character who arrives late in the story with no real purpose except to make sure Zoe knows she is better off without her mother (and to fix a motorcycle). No one could argue that the mother wasn't a negative influence, but she was something else, too -- mentally ill. Much is made of the fact that her mother didn't take her medicine and wasn't responsible, but blaming a bi-polar person for not being responsible is another kind of crazy. I kept waiting for Zoe, who is so compassionate with animals, to understand that mental illness is an illness rather than a lazy choice, but it never happened. To a lesser extent I was also bothered by similarities between this book and "The White Giraffe," another excellent book about an orphaned girl who has a gift of being able to communicate with animals and meets a white giraffe whom she saves from poachers with a boy in her class. There are some additional similarities, but you get the picture.

$REVIEW.: Werewolves, ghosts, and missing souls--great stuff! I couldn't stop reading this book and gobbled it up within a day. I loved the heroine's feisty attitude, the rugged hero's internal struggles, and the paranormal tie-ins. The missing child mystery tugged me along, my hope and fear keeping me turning pages. The romance was intense, entertaining, and hot. I really enjoyed being swept away on a journey of self-discovery and had several laughs along the way.From the start, Soul Search grips you and won't let go. Two endangered souls forced to join together in the search for a missing child--a journey filled conflict and complications. Sizzling romance, heart-pounding suspense, and a touch of mystery make for an exciting, riveting read. Amber Scott has me hooked! I can't wait for the next one.

$REVIEW.: Back and forth through history this story relates the lives of several characters, a few days or weeks at a time--keep an eye on the dates--it can be confusing.  Just as the Civil War was confusing for the participants, those of us looking backward must also experience some bewilderment with it's tales, I suppose.  Senseless massacre, war, is well-depicted in this book I was given in exchange for a review.  In fact, there is quite a bit of detail about battles that will entertain those who enjoy reading such.  It is so realistic in several places as to leave one with a sense of horror;  surreal aftereffects; and a willingness to distance oneself from the facts of history, or at least from the real characters of history that this work of fiction is based on.The author has woven facts, sort of setting the record straight, with fictional characters and a stretching or compressing of time.  Duty, Honor, Country portrays strong traits we all possess in varying degrees and for different types of reasons and I feel that we each could find a character in this book to relate to, and definitely one to hate.I did not like finding a few phrases too new for the time period, for instance "war was turning into a slugfest" and "you good?".  And I'm pretty sure there are a couple of mixups of dates and characters but it was so confusing I didn't try to unravel it.  I could see this book as a 5 but it was too much 'work' to read it; the story doesn't just easily flow, one has to do some going back and forth to keep things straight.  And it ends abruptly!

$REVIEW.: A fast, funny read! When Cynthia is turned as a vampire, she discovers a whole new world! She can't eat garlic, gets burned by holy water and forgets to eat, but a SoCal veteran vamp (and Cynthia's brother's main squeeze)gives her the direction she needs to make her new life (as a vampire and as a SoCal resident living in a gated community) work. Throw in a crazed vampire hunter and his cohorts, the worst nosy neighbor ever and a new job that may require some daytime work and you're off on an adventure! The gated community of Slippery Elm will never be the same after Cynthia and her extended family take up residence. Sarah Glenn has written a story that will resonate with any one who's tried to balance life, love and the pursuit of a good meal!

$review_text.: The Saga continues this time with Karma coming face to face with new demons, those out to get her and those she loves, and the demon within.  Survival sometimes takes us places we thought we would never go, breaks us down to our barest essentials, and all too often, leaves us wondering who we really are.  Fitzgerald has done it again, takes us deeper into the silo, into her characters and into the madness of being down deep....and passes us threw the years without a hiccup.  A smooth, engrossing read.

$review_text.: ***May contain spoilers***While Richelle Mead's "Vampire Academy" series is one of my most favourite book series of all time, I must admit that I was quite hesitant to read this book. Primarily for two reasons, Sydney and Adrian (AKA the main characters of this book). I personally found Sydney to be way too uptight for my liking in "VA" and as for Adrian? Well, I was Team Dimitri from the get-go and every time Rose was with Adrian? I wanted to rip my hair out. Piece by piece. Therefore, imagine my surprise when I read this book and enjoyed it more than the first two "VA" books- and had an even bigger emotional reaction to it than those same two books!I think that while I was reading the "VA" books I did everything in my power to hate Adrian and in doing so, I never understood him as a character. However, after having read this book I have such a new found appreciation for him and I have really come to respect him. Adrian is flat out hilarious. And swoon-worthy! He almost makes me forget about Dimitri. And Sydney? I have come to understand that there is a method to her madness being extremely calculated and somewhat standoffish- she's had a tough life and it only stands to reason that said life would have a great impact upon her.Now I must admit, typically when I read a book I try not to foreshadow, I like being taken by surprise and I like having that, "Oh my gosh, did author X seriously just do that?" moment, but in this book I think that what was going to happen next was pretty obvious and as such it was a bit of a bummer because I missed out on that heart-stopping (or heart-breaking) moment. BUT... The last four words of the book (which I will not divulge *laughs evilly*) more than makes up for the overall predictability of the book (seriously, when I read those last four words I squealed. Loudly. And I may or may not have caused my dad to swerve into the wrong lane as he was driving. And then swerve again when he tried to determine whether or not I was crying from the book- which I was- happy tears though).All in all, this is by far one of the best books I have read in 2011! Richelle completely exceeded my expectations and the next book in the series, "The Golden Lily", has shot up on my "Most Anticipated Books of 2012" list.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed other books from this author, but found this one a bit disappointing. The concept was really interesting, and wish it was explored more fully, as it has enormous potential. What would happen if 99.99% of people on the planet disappeared overnight? No struggle or violence, just gone? But the idea was diluted by unexplained appearance of mythical creatures, changed rules of physics, and the unplausible explanation of the survivors all having psychic abilities. I was also a little irritated by the romantic relationship in the book, there was too much starting and glaring and too little normal communication and straight forward talking.

Next to De Niro and Nicholson.In this well-researched book, author Damian Stevenson gives us an intriguing peek behind the scenes of this legendary motion picture. We discover what the relationship was like between Pacino and acclaimed director, Brian De Palma. How the script for Scarface originated. Casting. Contracts. Lighting. Locations. And much more. This is a fantastic read for film buffs like me who love to know what went on behind the cinematic curtain.

$REVIEW.: I judge a book by how eager I am to get back to it and how willing I am to read and reread segments to be sure I am catching the nuances.  Often, I am willing to skim to get to the exciting and interesting parts of a story, and I don't go back to reread - not so this book.  The tale is mesmerizing, and though not relatable to real life, still credible, believable, and tightly plotted and written.  You understand the characters' motivations, it is not overly contrived, and care was clearly taken to set up appropriately the major events in the story - and to make the reader care what happens.  This book hit all the right buttons for me - believable and interesting characters, an adventurous plot line that melded seamlessly with a love story (with plenty of steam that was very passionate without being overly graphic), and memorable well thought-out secondary characters.  Bravo!

I adored this book for many reasons.The characters in this book are easy to relate to and understand.  The characters' descriptions and actions make them lovable and unlikable... whichever you are supposed to feel for them.  Their interactions are detailed but limited to just enough information, you aren't bored or finding yourself rolling your eyes, wishing the scene(s) would just end.  There is great balance in this story.I fell for the underdog... as we all should.  I rooted him on.  Prayed I would get my ending.  Beth Michele does a wonderful job writing out the story to keep you hooked, wanting the end, but yet not wanting the book to actually end.  I can't sing enough praises for this book!

Pena is shot dead unexpectedly. The police arrest Michael Ruiz who says he DID commit the murder but Henry thinks overwise.VERY quick (185 pages in my edition) and fast-moving but not as good as the first three Rios' mysteries. We're introduced VERY quickly to quite a few charcters in the first chapter alone and its hard to keep track. Also almost everyone (expect Henry) is unlikable.

$REVIEW.: In Victoria Gardner&#8216;s book, &#8220;Volumetrics Diet: How I Lost 70 Ibs in 140 Days Using the Amazing Volumetrics Diet,&#8221; she tells her story of going from a slim, active teenager to an overweight adult due to typical overindulgence and bad lifestyle choices. As anyone who has gone to college knows, this is an all too familiar pattern and I feel that many people can relate to Victoria Gardner&#8217;s weight problem and will benefit from hearing about her success with Volumetrics. Gardner writes with a mix of humor and charm that makes her story appealing. I also like the fact that not only did Gardner change her eating habits; she also included exercise in her diet plan - two things that all doctors recommend. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking into diet plans and want one that doesn't involve depriving yourself of certain foods.

$review_text.: In 1936, a mutated virus passed from monkey to human, and a deadly epidemic was born.  Set in a near but undated future, the world is in what would be its last turmoil.  While the United States is poised to begin an Armageddon-like battle in the Middle East, Europeans are emigrating en masse to Africa, believing they are returning to the birthplace of mankind.  Both groups are fueled by a fundamentalist religious fervor, one believing they are bringing about the prophesied end of the world, and the other believing they are bringing about the rebirth of civilization.  When Thomas steals Greg's identity, he brings him into a double life as a conspirator.  Greg's parents have already traveled to Africa to begin their new life, and his wife wants to relocate there as well.  But Greg knows too much.Ruby Barnes has taken an entirely new direction with this new novel.  A political thriller, the AIDS pandemic, conspiracy theories, and a bit of lust and romance all combine to make this impossible to put down.  The only problem?  It was only Part One.  Now, I anxiously await Part Two.4 starsDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the author. I was not required to write a positive review.

$REVIEW.: Larry Rosenberg has given us a book which combines his humor with profound seriousness.  He uses an older Buddhist teaching on specific contemplations which are joined with mindfulness of the breath.  However, don't expect a book which operates on the "meditation is cool and relaxing" premise.  This is definitely written for a committed meditator, or one who is ready to take the next step in his practice, and go beyond "meditation to feel good".  Yet, the by-product of following the practice and become more awake is certainly deeper serenity.  This is a great book to help you with the ups and downs that occur as your meditation and life practice deepen.  He takes each of the 16 contemplations, such "aware of the body, breathing in, aware of the body breathing out" and gently lays the foundation for incorporating each of them into your practice.  If you enjoy the Vipasanna approach, I would really give Larry Rosenberg a read.  His approach is friendly, down to earth, relevant to your meditation and no holds barred.

$REVIEW.: I would like to recommend reading the book - Mia's tooth fairy- written by Yosifia Porat.  The book is about a girl who wanted the tooth fairy will come visit. It's a little bit funny because she wrote letter to the fairy... It is beautiful because it is a little bit like a fairy tale. At the end Mia receives a gift. I'm not sure there really fairies. Even that I received a gift when my tooth fell out. I like also the beautiful illustrators. You should read it..

$review_text.: I received a complimentary e-copy of The Fine Line in exchange for an honest review.Liv is a high school senior who is out hanging with her friends when she meets Logan, who is unlike anyone she's ever met before. Logan is 2 years old and quite the looker and has a hobby that is quite exhilirating.  He street races!Liv has learned that love is synonomous with saying goodbye.  She watched her parent's marriage break up.  Then she got close to 2 of her mom's boyfriends, one of which was killed in a car accident and one that cheated on her mom.  She's sworn off love for herself because she just doesn't want to deal with the pain of losing someone again.Liv and Logan have an interesting relationship.  As much as he makes it known that he'd like to date her, she holds him at arm's length and tells him repeatedly that they'll never be more than friends and that it's that or nothing.  Will Logan be able to break through Liv's resistance and make her see that they could be great together as more than friends?I enjoyed the book.  Liv was a little wishy-washy about her feelings for Logan at times. I sympathize with her having only seen the pain from her mother's relationships that had ended, but her mom was also in a new relationship that was working out well for her, so that should have been enough to prove to her things can be good and happy and not to always be thinking about how you'll feel when/if things are over. I kept thinking that if she didn't man up and admit her feelings for Logan, she was going to lose him as a friend, not to mention any chance of EVER becoming more.I loved Logan, but I also wanted to slap him around at times.  He's only 2 years older, but the difference in maturity between 18 and 20 can be a large obstacle and the fact that he was so hung up on a girl still in high school was a little hard to believe at times.  He was a good friend to her and didn't push too hard most of the time but I knew he'd have his breaking point sooner or later.There was also a twist near the end of the book which could have gone either the way it did or completely in the opposite direction and I think the book would have worked either way.  I'm glad the author chose the path she did though!This was the debut author by Alicia Kobishop, but I'll definitely keep my eyes out for any future books by her.

$review_text.: Readers picking up Kissing the Limitless expecting lists of rituals and goal-specific spells written in the style of Feri tradition witchcraft will soon be disappointed, but its pages overflow with something far more valuable: Thorn's own strivings to deepen and expand her magical work, and the integrity and self-knowledge that such work has brought to her life, shine softly in every word. Each exercise she presents (in sections titled "Doing the Work") is embedded in thoughtful prose to provide context and insight into the practice. Discussions of ethics and theology impress upon the reader the importance of taking magic seriously, of acknowledging the power of self-awareness and self-possession to transform and create, and of cultivating a integrative attitude of love, gratitude and grace both towards that which is within and that which is beyond the individual. Exercises in "Reflection" invite the reader to engage in intense introspection, sifting through the unconscious to bring to light unacknowledged desires and fears and developing contemplative self-discipline, in order to prepare for "doing the work" of magical practice. At times, the line between "reflection" and "work" becomes blurry; simple rituals merge self-reflective musings with acts of will to manifest desires or articulate "inner demons."Much of this work will sound familiar to those who have read about or practiced magic before. Some practices are occasional, designed to meet particular needs or round-out and strengthen certain areas of weakness ("Manifesting Home" and "Enspiriting Matter," for instance, are both incredibly useful exercises for connecting more deeply to domestic life and career choices). Others help establish a foundation of simple but powerful daily work incorporating breath techniques, energy-sensing and soul alignment. There is nothing shockingly original in the techniques themselves. I was startled to find, for example, that I had already intuitively developed a version of "soul alignment" for my own daily meditations, based on the Druid Prayer of Peace rather than the three "bodies" of Feri witchcraft. Reading Thorn's discussion of soul alignment, however, helped me to clarify and adjust my own practice, so that it could become both more challenging and more fruitful than before. And this is what her writing brings to practice: a new understanding, a broad perspective which places even the most familiar exercises in the context of a healthy, thriving spiritual life. Thorn examines, with depth and enthusiasm, practices that are usually summed up in one or two short paragraphs in the average Magic 101 book, and her exploration only helps to emphasize how complex and powerful these seemingly simple practices really are. Reading Kissing the Limitless, it is easy to imagine a musician delicately tuning her instrument until she hears the pure tones of perfect pitch, just as the spiritual seeker returns again and again to the same foundation in order to deepen and align with the "perfect tones" of the Limitless.(For full review, check out Sky Earth Sea: A Journal of Practical Spirituality, Fall 2009: [...])

I personal tried to set up the Amazon Payments, but since their outdated database couldn't verify me, and till now I still couldn't get a chance to use the service and try the AMT project , which mentioned int his book.

$REVIEW.: Grab some tissues, because you'll need them. Sweet Lonnie and wayward Gideon O'Riley, an unlikely couple forced into a shotgun wedding in the first book of Joanne Bischof's Cadence of Grace series, Be Still My Soul, endured hardships and heartache. Just when they've grown to love one another, his past threatens to tear them apart. Cassie Allan claims Gideon is married to her, requiring Lonnie and him to travel back to Rocky Knob, where they must face a heart-wrenching truth that tests their love as well as their faith.Having witnessed the journey this couple took in the first book, I ached as I watched them meet a challenge far greater than anything that had come their way before. I hurt not only for Lonnie and Gideon but also for those who care for them, including several kindly characters who long to spare them pain. As a fan of romances with happy endings, Bischof's moving tale of a couple pulled apart by circumstances beyond their control moved me to tears many times. While the story starts off slowly, the pace picks up when the couple is confronted with Cassie's claim, resulting in an emotional read that will keep readers turning pages as they hope for a miracle. The end of this book wasn't what I expected and left me wanting more. I'll be reading the third book in the series, that's for sure.I have three suggestions for those eager to enjoy this story. 1) Read the first book in the series, Be Still My Soul, so you get to know Lonnie and Gideon and understand why their love is so precious. 2) Before you begin reading Though My Heart is Torn, be sure you have tissues handy. 3) Be prepared to buy book three, My Hope is Found (release date: October 2013) so you can find out what happens next, because you'll want to know. I guarantee it.

Stories rely only on plot for any "horror" or "shock" value, which is too bad because the author is obviously imaginative & relatively talented. (But what's with all the zombies & flesh-eaters, man?) For my money, though, Poe's the better horror writer, in all aspects, especially psychological terror, and all his work is free.

$review_text.: This little E-Book is a must read for aspiring writers, agents, and Amazon reviewers


It tells you why Amazon reviewers review, what makes them tick, etc
It also gives much info on how to reach out to them, both what to do and even more importantly what NOT to do


I think Theo failed to mention one little courtesy writers should use when a Amazon reviewer accepts your book for review- and gives it a positive review: a Helpful vote.By definition, writers, a Positive review is "helpful" to you

So unless it is badly written or something, please remember to vote "Helpful"  The same does not necessarily apply to reviewers not so positive- a well written *** or ** review can still boost sales, so don't be too quick to hit that "unhelpful" button.But overall, this is simply a must read for those people, Theo here has collected for you what would takes years and much reading of boards, etc to figure out.Sure, Theo will not have to wait up on the night the Pulitzer prizes are announced, but the style is simple and readable.

$review_text.: The story is one that those of us from these hills hear often of the outsider who comes in to the mountains.  This author, however, does a wonderful job capturing the time, situation, and the people of the mountains.  The clash of cultures where the intelligent, fiercely loyal mountaineer must learn to live with the outsider is well portrayed.I immediately loved June who falls head over heels for John Hale, the outsider.  She is incredibly smart and, with John's assistance, becomes cultured.  John sees in June all of the things she could be outside of the hills.  I don't want to spoil it, but June has several revelations about John, her family, and the mountains which were well written and entirely believable.Be sure to take a bit of time to read the mountain dialogue; you'll pick up an amazing mix of languages we are losing daily.  When reading, after every few words I would pick up one that reminded me of my grandparents who grew up near the Tennessee side of Cumberland Gap.The clan system in which family doesn't turn its back on each other comes across clearly in the writing and, although it seems antiquated, the outsider and the reader begin to understand the pride of the mountain folks.The middle of the book did start drag just a touch; however, the pace picked back up pretty quickly and the end moved incredibly fast.  I appreciate the author's dedication to the people of the mountains who he portrays accurately and not as ignorant, unenlightened people.If you liked this book, I recommend "The Tall Woman" by Wilma Dykeman.

$review_text.: Each year, I look forward to the publication of this cornucopia of facts, factoids, and statistics. This year's annual publication meets my normal expectations.Just looking at the table of contents gives a sense of the scope of the 2011 volume. Special features and the year in review open the volume (e.g., Top Ten News Topics, Health Care Reform, Notable Quotes, and Historical anniversaries). The year in pictures is another feature, with a series of color photos commemorating events and people from 2010.Then, the substantive material, with categories such as: Economy, business, and energy; Crime; Military affairs; Health and vital statistics; science and technology; consumer information; US facts and history; World maps and flags; US government; US Cities, states, and population; World history and culture; Sports. The volume concludes with a detailed index.What of statistics? I'll simply report what pops up on a few pages that I select at random. On page 203, there is a listing of philosophers and religious figures from history (e.g., John Cotton, Karl Jaspers, Johann Fichte). Page 351 features information on small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids and comets; Page 453 summarizes important historical events in American History from 1936 (Jesse Owens winning four gold medals) to 1946 (a steel strike); Page 529 focuses on election results in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections county-by-county in Georgia. Page 591 contains basic descriptive information on two American states--North Carolina and North Dakota. Page 749 has a more global coverage--with basic data about Armenia and Australia.There are also rich data from the world of sports. Page 875, for instance, presents a discussion of Special Olympics and then records in outdoor track and field competition. The reader is reminded that Usain Bolt holds records in the 100 and 200 meter races; Hicham El Guerrouj has records in the 1500 meters, mile run, and 2000 meter run. Page 895? Super Bowl results (as a Chicago Bears' fan, it's nice to look at the results of Super Bowl XX!). Page 921? Major league leaders in runs batted in per year from 1907 through 1990.So, once more, a cool resource and great fun!

Some spoilers to follow...STORY: This book actually consists of 9 different folk tales


The commonality between them is that they are all Indian (specifically Hindu) folk tales

Most of the tales are set in the past, but readers can relate to characters and events that take place


All the tales are written in a simple fashion for younger readers (as a nice introduction to Hindu mythology and folk tales).As an adult reader, the tales were all a bit too simplistic in nature for me, but I really enjoyed The Beetle and the Silken Thread
It's a tale of how a royal advisor/vizier used his ingenuity and creativity to escape from a potentially fatal situation

Most of the tales follow the same general principle: introduce the tale/character, an evil fate befalls them and the hero is able to escape having learned some moral

To expand on this, the author makes sure to include two questions after each chapter of each tale and 4-5 questions after the conclusion of each story


This would help parents discuss the issues that characters have to deal with and teach some good lessons throughout.MY TAKE: I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting started with Hindu mythology and folk tales
These are all wonderful stories for young children and most of them have some sort of message throughout the book
Indeed, the questions sprinkled throughout the book would make for good discussions with younger readers.I hope to continue reading with some books that delve deeper in Hindu Mythology, meant for older readers.

$review_text.: This book has everything you could ever ask for with a Highlander romance
 Castles, kilts, bagpipes, deceit, fighting and last but not least, love

 The characters are strongly built, even if I did want to kick the hero in his shins a few times, and the author does an amazing job transporting you back in time

 Will definitely be reading the next in this series and keeping my eyes out for more great reads from Deborah!

$review_text.: Apollo's Outcasts (2012) is a standalone SF novel.  The USA and other nations establish an International Space Consortium to mine helium-3 from the lunar regolith.  The mining operations are based at Apollo, a large habitat built within Ptolemaeus Crater.In this novel, Jamey Barlowe is the son of Stan and Connie.  He is a loonie, conceived on Earth, but taken to the Moon before anyone knew his mother was pregnant.  Now he suffers from Lunar Birth Deficiency Syndrome.Jan Barlowe is Jamey's oldest sister.  She is attending college at a local school so she can to tend to Jamey.Melissa Barlowe is Jamey's next oldest sister.  She is called Meemee for good reasons.In this story, Jamey is awakened before dawn by his father.  He is told to get dressed and pack a carryon bag.  Jan is waking Melissa.Melissa refuses to get up.  Jan turns on the light, so Melissa puts the pillow over her eyes. Then Jan issues an order that Melissa cannot refuse.Their father drives the family to Wallops Island.  On the way, they hear an announcement that the President is dead.  The Vice-President is sworn into that office.They enter the ISC spaceport on the island and drive to the terminal.  They get out of the van and meet three other ISC families.  Then their father tells them the new President has him and other ISC employees on her black list.  So they are sending their children into orbit.They start to enter the building, but pause as a limo enters the employee lot.  A teenaged girl gets out of the limo.  Her escorts have a discussion with the parents and other ISC employees.The ISC shuttle only has six seats available.  The new girl would be the seventh passenger, so someone has to stay behind.  Jan volunteers to give up her seat.  The children are suited up and loaded on the shuttle.Jamey has a loonie seat with gel filled balloons to cushion him on each side.  His seat is contained within a case the size of a refrigerator.  Jamey wonders how long his father has been planning this escape.This tale takes Jamey and Melissa into space with four other children.  Jets are sent to intercept them, but the shuttle outruns them.  Once they are in orbit, the Lunar Transfer Vehicle is released for the voyage to the Moon.Then an anti-satellite missile is launched from another jet to shoot them down.  The pilot fires the main engine and maneuvers to avoid the oncoming missile.  It explodes and a piece of shrapnel causes a leak in the LTV.The pilot tells his passengers that they are going to Apollo.  Anywhere else would only find them under arrest and send back to the USA.  Apollo is an ISC facility and will give them sanctuary.This story continues a long tradition in SF of voyages to the Moon, starting withJules VerneandH.G. Wells.  Invasions of a Moon colony are also a SF tradition (seeRobert Heinlein).Jamey learns that he can stand on his own is the lesser gravity.  This volume does not have a sequel as yet, but the author has written manyotherspace adventures.Highly recommended for Steele fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of space voyages, lunar habitats, and a bit of romance.  Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin

$review_text.: THE SHORT REVIEW? Outstanding! When you first behold this book, allow your eyes to feast on the promises yet to be created by your hands, which will be inspired and taught by it contents.THE LONG REVIEW? Having never been accused of being short on words, allow me to spin the yarn that is Carlos Lischetti. In my eyes, he is probably one of the best sugar artist masters; I can only think of one or two others who could possibly share such a level of talent. He has been a rising star within the cake world for several years, and it has been within the last 2 years or so that the news of the long-awaited book release was floating around the sugar world haunts.Though this was released last year, it's reportedly already in reprint; but my question was when was it going to get to the States? Beats me! I even emailed Mr. Lischetti and he kindly responded that he wasn't sure and would get back to me. But never one to have much patience, I found this copy through one of Amazon's independent sellers and I am now a happy camper.Mr. Lischetti was born in Argentina, with his twin brother, Elio (who is a animator no less!) and has been an integral part of this process with Carlos, as well as the book; he created the animation sketches and drawings that proceed each project (Wow....the talent that runs in that family!) They also have a younger sister, Mercedes. If you are fortunate enough to obtain a back issue of the Squires Kitchen Magazine called "Cakes & Sugarcraft" Issue 113 for Summer 2011, on page 6+, there is an absolutely charming sugar project that Carlos made for Father's Day in which he pays tribute to his dad in sugar art! It is such a precious sugar project of figures of his dad, him, his brother, and sister.He was pulled to the cake world since a child so this progression to this artform seems a natural for him. He eventually found himself in England and one of his current posts is teaching at the Squires Kitchens as well as other scheduled classes around the world. The interest in how he creates his characters has been so high that it was only a matter of time before he published a book such as this. And once you see what he can do, you can only feel the pull to learn from him."Animation in Sugar" is a lovely, large compilation of talent and instruction that describes and teaches the adorable and animated characters from his talented mind and hands. The instructions are precise and measured, the photography crystal clear and methodical, and the end results are a joy. Each and every project, as well as steps required, have been photographed close and clear. For instance, in "Ballerina", he show you the 4 steps in making a leg or the 4 steps in making her torso. What he has done is taken the question "how can you do that" and made it simple and beautiful.Putting aside the initial prepping sections, I would venture to say that for the most part, if someone had this version in a language that they could not read, the step-by-step photography would suffice to teach you most of the projects themselves. The colors are bright and happy and I truly believe that it's his ability to create such realistic expressions on his figures, that makes Carlos so wildly popular.There are 14 projects in all but these come after he gives you a rather solid education on all the prep work necessary before you begin. His projects will be the starting point in which you will have the ability to be free and creative to design your own fantasies once you have mastered the basics.The first 48 pages are dedicated to the basics of this artform and how to get started:Essential Edibles and EquipmentRecipes*FillingsIcings and Sugar Pastes**Preparing and Covering Cakes for Decorations***Modeling Tips and Techniques*****For this section, he gives you 2 basic sponge batters, a cookie batter, a cupcake batter, etc for the cakes and cupcakes and cake pops he makes. This is something that you can substitute with your own recipes. This is not an extensive section as the figures are the predominant part of this book.**This particular section is of the utmost importance in that the medium you use has to have certain qualities that can stand up to the manipulation needed to create the figures. You cannot just use fondant with Tylose/CMC; for these projects to come out that way he shows you, I would emphasize that you either use his recipes or buy a high quality paste.***This section gives a good overview of cake assemblies, etc in quick detail.****This section covered how to make the basic shapes that would eventually become figures, as well as proportions, and using casting molds for faces.And now.............the PROJECTS (yahoo!) I promise not to mention all the information so that you can be as mesmerized and enchanted by them when you get to see them yourselves, but it's so difficult not to tell you! Also, along with some of these projects, he also makes cookies and cake pops to accompany them; they are as beautiful and fun as the figures themselves.BALLERINA: My favorite project in the whole book! As I said earlier, the section opens up with a fantastic sketch or painting, done by his brother Elio, that is the vision that Carlos has for this figure. This is by far a stunning figure that looks like porcelain as this young girl is all dressed and ready to leap and twirl as soon as she finishes lacing her slipper. Exquisite!BOUNCING BABY: This is sooooooooooo cute! The expression on this baby's face is priceless as he is sitting on top of his cake in his little nappie/diaper!QUEEN of HEARTS: I kept trying to figure out how he made her and when I saw how, I thought, of course! That's how he did it! She can be the basis for a bride figure or maybe for a young girl for her "quincenera" party. (hope I spelled that right)ROBOT: Any little boys dream toy! Definitely more time-intensive but so worth it.FLORA the WOODLAND FAIRY: The cover project. So exquisitely delicate!THE QUEST for FOOD: These are mice that you won't mind running around your kitchen; think a skinnier Remy. Their little faces make you want to gently hug them!FASHIONISTA: Diva alert for the younger or older fashionista!DUNE BUGGY: Boy toy that will make you "cool" even to a little guy!GRANNY'S KITCHEN: Absolutely adorable tribute to his Grandmother's kitchen! How blessed our childhood memories are if she was like your grandmother too!PENNY FARTHING: This was so different but so awesome that I will only say you have to see it to love it. A simple project but has great detail.MOULIN ROUGE: I couldn't stop laughing with this one and I still can't every time I see her. She is someone you have to see to believe; absolutely hilarious!JUST MARRIED: So sweet! What a lovely just-married couple!! This got me to thinking of how fantastic these figures would be because this is definitely a couple that can be stored as a beautiful momento of their wedding!WINTER WONDERLAND: This project was featured in another issue of Squires Kitchen Magazine and is just precious; it reminds us of the joy we had as kids playing in the snow. And if you grew up in anyplace warm, just substitute a beach scene and bathing suits for the characters.SANTA CLAUS IS ON HIS WAY: All I'll say is Santa and presents; how much better can it get?Lastly, "Templates" and other necessary diagrams completes the book, as well as sources.Yes, I know I am a chatterbox on this book, but I have been waiting so long for this to arrive and it was totally worth the wait. Enjoy this artform; it will be a challenge in some area's as your skills are refined and honed, but it'll be such a joy to learn. Peace.

$review_text.: Sigh&#8230;. I just finished Merry Christmas, Henry and am still wiping tears from my cheeks. And not in a bad way.Henry is a lonely man. Treated badly as a child, his only retreat was into his paintings. &#8220;Henry the Trifling&#8221; he thinks of himself as being &#8211; insignificant, shy, and totally unassuming. A night museum guard, he spends his days painting beautiful paintings of the people he sees on his daily walks to the museum, setting them in beautiful, exotic settings. And his breaks for dinner in the museum? He spends with a painting of a beautiful, and yet melancholy woman on a windswept sea cliff. So goes Henry&#8217;s life for more than twenty years.What happens next in Henry&#8217;s life is a beautiful Christmas tale that broke open my heart and filled it with joy.I never, ever would have thought that this was Ms. Wynne&#8217;s first short story to be published. Her writing is crisp, well formed sentences drawing you into the story and leading you on a breathless journey through melancholy out out the other side to the light of pure Christmas magic.Grab this short story and curl up in your favorite chair, a cup of cocoa in your hand, Christmas music playing softly, a quilt across your lap. You won&#8217;t be sorry. This will be one of your best Christmas presents to yourself ever.

With the million dollar bounty on KP&#8217;s head, you&#8217;ll see how loyalty walks out the door when greed walks in.The storyline flows well and reads as if you are watching a criminal television series

You&#8217;ll start to form your own thoughts on who KP may actually be, but the twist and turns will have you second guessing yourself.I would definitely recommend KP2 to everyone, especially those are love a good suspense thriller


I look forward to reading part 3 so I can confirm if my suspicions about the real KP are correct

I even caught myself attempting to talk to one of my friends about Oyster because he's a big lovable lug. Obviously she had no idea what I was talking about because she hasn't read the book.Character development is very strong and almost sudden. I almost immediately held Lizzy in the highest respect, I believe she is the type of journalist we need in today's world. She will do anything to get a great story while taking care to protect her virtue in historic New York. She works diligently to get the facts instead of making up words to fill a page like too many "journalists" today are prone to do.Sir Gideon is very down to Earth; a real self-made man. He does, of course, possess an air of sophistication that adds to his charm. I found his character to be very strong, realistic, and humble when needed.I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romance novel. And anyone who loves to write. And anyone who simply loves to read.

The recent location and DNA verification of Richard III was quick and easy.  Without more modern forensic technology applied we are all left guessing.

$REVIEW.: This had a bit of a different feel than other books set in the Elemental World, but it only serves to show that Hunter is not a one-style pony. While still having the curvature of her unique and exquisite voice, the story is framed in a much different container. She shows she can take a couple you thought would have no more intimate space to explore after having been together for the better part of a century, and show that all couples can grow and explore each other's depths.

$REVIEW.: An interesting, good story, and given that it was written in the 20s, a fairly prophetic prediction of the Pacific part of World War II. Some things, the author gets right and some he gets wrong.Right? Japanese sneak attack, not on Pearl Harbor, but on another critical part of the American War effort, perhaps just as bad as Pearl. He envisions the initial Japanese victories, the delay while the US builds up its forces, and the slow island hopping to recapture the Pacific. He even shows some of the deception the allies used against Germany, only against Japan in the book. The small unit actions were similar to what I've read of the Guadacanal fights. The long range efforts with submarines and mining were interesting and not dissimilar to reality. The critical nature of Japan's supply and raw materials problem were showcased.Wrong? No Pearl Harbor (despite the blurb on the book). The Japanese in the book treated their prisoners with respect according to the Geneva convention unlike the real Japanese. The Japanese in the book weren't so fanatical that they'd flight man, woman and child to the last person. The final peace was negotiated, though the Japanese were clearly on the losing side. Airpower in the book, though important, didn't have the decisive nature that it had in WWII -- there was still an epic battleline fight as at Jutland. The japanese in THIS book were the Japanese from the Russo Japanese War -- clients of the British. Lastly, our real war was part of another World war, not an isolated war between the US and Japan.Even so, if the Japanese DID read this book, they should have read to the ending because all the issues that led to their failure were right there to read -- lack of raw material, inability to replace their man and material losses, dependency on sea lines of supply, dependency on overseas possessions, etc.In the Russo Japanese war, the Japanese learned (or thought they did) that they could take on a huge world power and win if they could roll up some victories in the early stages. They never invaded Russia it's true, but Russia had other problems that prevented them from an all-out war on Japan. Those same issues weren't going to keep the US from winning this one. If Russia had attacked Japan the way Russia attacked Germany in World War II they may have drawn different conclusions.

Needless to say, Ms. Larsen did not disappoint!  She created another world with many planes of existence, and with customs and protocols that, if violated, could literally mean the loss of one's life.  The sisters' introduction to their paternal grandmother was also wonderfully written and intriguing.  This is yet another book that is an absolute page turner which cannot be put down!  Thanks Ms. Larsen for writing such wonderful novels.

$REVIEW.: Just what I needed! I always look for something great reads as I spend a lot of time commuting and I like to read in the train

This book does the trick
It flows very nicely, the plot is intriguing and keeps you entertained


You really want to know..is Ayla going to give in, is she not


Definitely made my commute time pass in a flash
I actually couldn't wait to go to work so I can pick up the book and see how it ends.All in all, it is a great time pass

Not too heavy, not too light, the heroine makes it easy to identify with and the story is well written
The author makes visuals easy to imagine and you feel you are part of the plot as it unveils

I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good book to read during a commute or who needs an easy read for a plane ride.

Hannah's conservative upbringing blossoming into fear/anger/strength inspired me to mentally encourage her to push through.  Though I am generally anti-abortion, this book did not anger me as I know it likely did some.  I am in fact anti-abortion however, I would never shun anyone for doing so but rather hope and pray for their health and a better future.The love affair with Aidan was an all too real glimpse of how weak the human race is and all sins or mistakes are forgiven and/or judged by each of our own higher beings.

$review_text.: If you&#8217;ve already decided on the Paleo diet, this book will definitely get you started. It explains the idea behind the diet, including which foods are okay, and includes tons of recipes. It also addresses the different approaches to Paleo (such as whether sweeteners are allowed), and explains why you may choose one approach over another. Overall, it seems to give good advice about how to select more natural, organic food and the benefits of exercise, however the connection between this advice and why Paleo is the best solution seems tenuous. Included are claims from unspecified nutritionists and scientists, as well as references to studies, but there are no details or proof. If you look at the resources, the majority are other Paleo books.

$REVIEW.: A very compelling true crime story from the Illinois of the 1880's!I really enjoyed this book! A young schoolteacher, left alone in the schoolhouse at the end of the day, is subjected to "nameless indignities" by persons unknown
What follows is a gripping tale of neighbor against neighbor, shoddy investigations, attempted lynchings, pompous lawyers and the ruination of a young woman's life.The research that it took for Susan Elmore to put together this story is mind-boggling! Using family stories, newspaper accounts and court records, she has constructed a clear, interesting and realistic portrait of what happened in the small settlements in rural Illinois

As a person who loves to do genealogy research, I'm thrilled to see how in-depth the research can be

As a person with roots near the locations in Illinois, I love the historic picture she presents of the area

As a lover of mysteries, this sets one's imagination racing.There is a lot of detail and some people may find that it moves too slowly for them but for me, all the detail just helped me immerse myself in the people, the setting and the time period


I loved it from start to finish.I received this book through Goodreads First Reads program and I really appreciated the opportunity to read and review this book.

The other maps (from guidebooks) did not reach far enough into the outer parts of the city - where we were staying. As others have said, this is a little large to tuck into a pocket, but it actually fit in my smaller travel purse and it really held up and didn't crumple because of the lamination. I'll see out other maps by this company when I travel.

$REVIEW.: Jim PathFinder Ewing's little book Clearing: A Guide to Liberating Energies Trapped in Buildings and Lands is a reasonably decent overview on methods for clearing spaces of unwanted energy or spirits.  His views are from the Native American tradition, and more specifically, from the Cherokee perspective.  Many of the techniques and explanations are shared across diverse belief systems with regard to energy clearing, and many will be more indicative of his training and cultural perspective.  The book is a mere 110 pages, 23 of which are glossary, notes and supplementary information.  And it is a small book in size.  It doesn't take long to read.I especially appreciated Jim's overview for grounding, centering, shielding, ley lines, and various types of spirits and guides.  Where I think he goes off target a bit, is when he forgets the language that these experiences, definitions and approaches are variable, and that his is just one approach, to language that asserts &#34;this is the way it works.&#34;  That's where I stop listening.  Having evolved in my spiritual journey in some unorthodox ways, I know that each person's journey and approach is as unique as they are and we are served best when we avoid cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approaches.  It is fantastic to have reference points, but we must adapt our own style.  For example, to say that we all have an animal guide, or that we all are born with at least one guide throughout our lifetime, is a belief, not a fact.  Some people are never aware of their guides (or may question if they have them) yet do incredible healing work.  There are several similar assertions within these pages.There are many good quotes in this book but I will leave you with this from his opening remarks:&#34;Have you ever walked into a room and felt a chill, or that something wasn't quite right?  Or have you entered a space and suddenly become sad or agitated for no apparent reason?  On the other hand, are there places which you have visited that consistently bring about an inexplicable sense of contentment?All the spaces we inhabit; the places where we live, work, or visit for various reasons, may harbor spirits or types of energy that affect our well-being.  If spirits are trapped, their energies may cause us mental or emotional distress, while in other cases their presence can uplift us emotionally or contribute to a wholesome state of mind.  Additionally, energy patterns in structures or on land can be either negative or positive, depending on their origin and vibrational rate.  Fortunately, spaces can be cleared....&#34;

$review_text.: Johanna Rios was just a little girl when she saved her sister from being drowned by their own mother.  Johanna and her sister Carmen were the only family they had.  No man ever stayed with the Rios woman.  Their mother believed they were cursed by La Llorona, the crying woman.  La Llorona was an old Mexican legend of a woman who drowns her children.  Still haunted by this legend, Johanna finds herself stuck in the middle of a murder case and she could be the next victim.I enjoyed this book.  I loved hearing the Mexican legend of La Llorona.  It was an interesting, but scary legend.  The characters were true to life, co workers afraid to show feelings, father daughter relationships and friendship.  Once I picked the book up it was hard to put down, the story keeps you interested and wanting to get to the truth.  I like this book, especially for a fall read.  A bit of a scary legend is always a fun fall read.  I would highly recommend.Rating: 4.5Heat Rating: Mild/HotReviewed By: RaeCourtesy Of My Book Addiction And More

She has no choice but to stay with Jared until she figures out what to do with her life or if she needs to go back home. But Jared offers her a job after some horrible crap happens while she is out looking for a job. She starts working for him and gets to see every side to Jared( literally ;-) ) Ha. These two have a deep connection and friendship I never would of seen coming. He has a past and she is trying to move on from hers. Can these two over come things like what his profession is? can they find love in a hopeless place? you will have to read to find out! but I can promise you, you will LOVE this book! it isn't just sex like I thought it would be, it isn't raunchy, he isn't a douche, she isn't weak and whiny.

$REVIEW.: I was simply blown away by the world that these authors have created for The Red Star series.  The mix of Fantasy sorcery with Science Fiction technology is very well done.  The art is gorgeous.  The characters well rounded and well written.  This whole plot has a wonderful sense of the epic that BEGS it to be made into a movie or at least a well funded HBO mini-series.  This book is so good that it makes you forget that you are championing a fantasy version of the Soviets.That being said, this book does not promote Communism.  It promotes the idea that the Communist dream was once beautiful, but was quickly corrupted.  That the average Communist was a sincere person that merely wanted to make the world a better place, but was naive and made a pawn.  This novel is about those people on the ground level of war that suffer for the corruption and manipulation of those leaders sitting far away in comfort.  By the time this novel opens, The United Republics of the Red Star are in decline due to a horrible defeat in the small desert nation of Alistaan &lt;A fantasy Afghanistan>.  The bulk of the novels action happens in the memory of Maya Antares, who is visiting the grave of her husband who died in the horrors of the last battle of the Alistaan war.  Maya finds she must balance her mourning for her fallen husband and her anger at her  corrupt leaders, with the her love for her people and their dreams of Utopia.I can't oversell this book.  It's my new obsession.

$REVIEW.: I usually don't like short stories, because they never have enough development to be enjoyable or sensical. This is a good example of that. I had way too many questions after finishing, and though the story is funny, it wasn't great. Besides the few grammatical errors and the bad Kindle formatting (some paragraphs are indented incorrectly, leading me to believe the author didn't save the story as a web page first), it's just an okay story. It's free and all, so worth a quick read. I don't really want to read any more stories by the author, though, judging by this story alone.

$review_text.: J.R.R. Tolkien is a very quick read.  I finished it in just a couple days of reading in the evenings.  It is interesting as it follows the life of Tolkien and how he came about to write the books that define the fantasy genre.  I loved The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy so this was interesting to learn more about their author.  I also have enjoyed reading lots of C.S. Lewis books, and I've always heard that they were friends, so it was neat to learn the history of their friendship and how it progressed through their lives, and how they influenced the style of each other's writings.  It's also very interesting to learn about the inspirations for the LOTR.  If you're a fan of any of the above topics, give this one a go!Disclaimer: This book was provided to me in exchange for my honest review by Thomas Nelson Publishers.

$review_text.: This book is a very well written and is an entirely enjoyable foray into a new twist on fantasy. I would love to be able to give it a decimal score of 4.5.  It reminds me of Eve Forward's Villains by Necessity or Mary Gentle's Grunts - which is a serious compliment if you have never read those.  I will certainly be watching for the sequel which the ending portends. Note, BTW, that it is not by any definition a cliffhanger (or my score would be MUCH lower).To judge my scoring - a 5 in fantasy would be something like American Gods, Grunts, The Hobbit, and much of Terry Pratchett's work ( on a 5 point scale Wee Free Men gets a 6 :) ).
$SUMMARY.: really needs a 4.5 or even 4.75

$REVIEW.: Who Is My Shelter? by Neta Jackson is the story of Gabby Fairbanks
A middle-aged woman going through a difficult separation from her husband Phillip, after being thrown out of her own home

Gabby is making a new life for herself, raising her two teenage boys, and working at a job that gives her life meaning..


running the House of Hope for homeless single moms and their kids


Gabby is a christian who let the promise of romance and a better future distract her from God

But the trials in her life prove to be the very thing that leads her back to Him

And He shows her that He is the only Rock she can lean on.I absolutely loved this book


It was so much like real-life, I didn't have to imagine that this could happen
I felt as if it was happening and I was just an on-looker

The characters are wonderful and very easy to follow
I admit that at the very beginning of the book, I thought I had figured out the ending
I was disappointed


And while I was somewhat right..


the story really took me by surprise

It never got too complicated, but it never failed to keep me interested

I was sad to be done with it

I wanted to read more...I enjoyed this book so much that I have already bought several books in this series and the one that precedes it
The author began with a series called "The Yada Yada Prayer Group", and in it begins the story of some of the wonderful characters that carry over to the "House Of Hope" series
Neta Jackson's husband, Dave Jackson, also wrote a parallel series to this one that looks amazing

Check it out.I have certainly found another favorite author..
she has me hooked! I'm ready to read every book in the series, and the ones by her husband
Neta Jackson is a great writer and her books are very well written


Easy to read and keeps you coming back for more


I recommend this series highly
It's great fun!*Thomas Nelson has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book

I was not required to write a positive review

The opinions I have expressed are my own.-Thanks Thomas Nelson! :)

$review_text.: OK let me start out by saying that I have not read any other books by this author. I read the synopsis for this book and was immediately interested. I guess I looked over the whole book 3 thing but oh well. The book can be read as a standalone. I am sure I would have enjoyed the book a whole lot more having known some of the other characters from the other books. It was great either way.Another great thing about this book was the way Gigi and her sisters interacted with each other. You could tell they loved each other and would do anything for the other. Despite the way their father raised them they came back together. All except Tatiana which we will learn more about in the next book. I can&#8217;t wait! You can tell they were a family of strong women which is different then most family series I have read. They usually focus of a family of alpha men with a sister or something but this series is about sisters and I loved that.I will be reading the next one and catching up by reading the first two hehe.

$review_text.: I am still reading the book and I have to say that so far I have enjoyed it. Even for a relatively new javascript programmer, this book is excellent in catching concepts that are ignored in most other web development books, primarily because it considers JS as a full fledge language which is the correct approach to explain javascript. That being said, a mastery of any object oriented programming language such as Java definitely helps to grasp the concepts explained in this book.Its a good buy, and I highly recommend it. Appreciate the author's sense of humor every once in a while - its like a team member actually explaining stuff to you during code reviews :)

This is one of the better book about a ship making a long trip home. I like how the character continue to grow as the story moves forward. Ryk Brown seem to have the story planned out to the end, unlike some other that start out well but get lost a few book into a series. I look forward to the next installment.

$review_text.: This is a story about a couple entering into a D/s relationship and Paige, the submissive, has defined some contact terms of her own. She's smart, sassy, sexy and she's determined. Yes, she will give him her unflinching devotion and submission, but not without some negotiation. I like her style and her moxie.The Contract is a captivating short story with a Lot going on in 37 pages. I'm a big fan of well done short stories because there is no time for long drawn out angst. I have little patience for pages and pages of unrequited angst. The Contract is short on angst and long on character development with sizzling sex scenes. This is a story with characters readers can relate to.I think women considering a D/s relationship will thoroughly enjoy this book. Even if a D/s relationship isn't something a woman has thought about before, The Contract may give her second thoughts. E. R. Pierce has done a superb job making her characters real and the story believable.For the guys, Nicolas knows what he wants, but he's not so stubborn he won't comprise. A healthy D/s relationship isn't a one way street. Nicolas knows that and he wants a woman like Paige who can not only be his submissive, but also his lover, friend and mate.I am eagerly looking forward to the upcoming books in this series. Something tells me Nicolas may have his hands full with the sassy Ms. Paige.Lock and Key (My-Sir #2)

The book is fast paced and really engages you from the beginning. It is a multi-layered nightmare and a really nicely built world. West World style robots compound the doom and dread of world decimated by creatures who harvest human brain matter to feed to their Lovecraftian overlord. The nod to Dr. Michael West is a nice touch also.

The two stories in the book were both interesting and kept my attention. I prefer Monster in the Mirror to the other one, because the characters are really realistic. The subtle details come together nicely for the surprise ending. I'd recommend the book to anyone looking for a quick read.

I was very interested to learn many facts about her background and home life that I hadn't known before. I believe history will be very kind to this intelligent and dedicated woman.Strangely, when men are so dedicated to serving their country they are immediately lauded. When women are dedicated they are in a classification that is anything but flattering. I wish I had known Margaret Thatcher personally and been able to hear more of her views on this world we live in and heard her advice on achieving world peace.

$REVIEW.: I started reading this book over lunch and when I looked up it was three in the afternoon

 I don't mean that it was particularly suspenseful, but it has characters weird enough to be interesting but sturdy enough that I felt like I knew them
 The characters that will be in the next book seem so (outwardly) perfect that I'll probably be getting that one too.Meredith, the heroine, struggles with detaching--and distinguishing--herself from her large family

 Usually in books families are either perfect or emotionally abusive

But a family that's just nosy and demanding of your time? That I can relate to.But where Dacus really shines is in her world-building
Bonneterre seems like a real place

 C.S

Lewis wrote about how he read as much for the fun of "living in another world" as anything else, and Menu For Romance achieves this


 I love that Bonneterre is a mid-sized city


 I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little sick of incestuously small towns in fiction.This was a sweet, surprisingly compelling romance.

$review_text.: I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour in exchange for a fair and honest review. I rated it 4.5 Stars.In an alternate old West roamed by zombies and survivors, Angela Scott's Survivor Roundup, the story of Elisabeth, aka "Red", a woman stuck between both worlds, and Trace aka "Cowboy", the man in love with her, begins where Wanted: Dead or Undead left off. Introducing a handful of new secondary characters, new adventures and a climactic faceoff with Red's nemesis, John Gatherum, this rousing addition to The Zombie West series is sure to please any paranormal or western romance lover. It kept me turning the pages late into the night.Beginning where we last left the resilient group of zombie fighters; Red and Trace little family gets a new addition when Wen and Carolyn have a baby. Realizing the fort where they've been living is getting low on supplies, Red and Trace know things will have to change in order for all of them to survive. Leaving Wen, Carolyn, and the children behind, Red and Trace decide to leave the fort and forage for supplies agreeing to come back within a month with whatever they've been able to scavenge.As Red and Trace travel in search of food, it becomes obvious Red's body has truly changed as a result of her continued exposure to zombie bites. While still human, Red is now able to walk among zombies without them even picking up her scent - she appears invisible to them. While Trace considers this a miracle - it makes Red uncomfortable. She's worried about the state of her humanity. When Red and Trace are split up by a group of roaming cowboys - it'll take more than all of the skills each has acquired to survive. They'll end up having to rely on the help of acquaintances they make along the way.I really enjoyed how Ms. Scott continued to develop Red and Trace's relationship as both a couple and as individual adults; we get to see them at both their best and at their worst. We also get to meet some really interesting and incredible secondary characters in this installment, from Kitchi and Aponi, two native American Indians, who help Trace survive his experiences to Nash, Red's temporary kidnapper and Davis Story, her older brother, two men who are instrumental in helping Red face off against her enemy, John Gatherum. Ms. Scott did a good job developing and exposing us to John and the evil he has become - he was the perfect villain and it was easy to root for Red and her group to win.Will Red and Trace be able to make it back home together in time to save their friends? And what new secret will Red have to share with Trace? You'll have to read Survivor Roundup to find out. I enjoyed it and can't wait to read the next installment in this series, Dead Plains, set to release in 2013.

$REVIEW.: This is a depressing, yet, darkly humorous, story of what happened to the author beginning in 2008 when she worked at WaMu. It was probably a good place for Ms. Wolf to work, as she seemed to practice a lot of the same hand-over-my-eyes, I-will-deal-with-it-later types of methodologies as her doomed company. It was funny, and well-written and error-free, but as far as content goes, I couldn't help think at least some of this stuff must be exaggerated. At least I would hope so. She has an adopted daughter with mental problems, who she reluctantly takes into her home because her equally dysfunctional husband, whom she married three days after meeting in person (I guess their online relationship must have been such that three days is all she needed), wants it. She has homes and horses and credit card debts up the WaMu (pun intended, if it is a pun.) She loses everything, then gets breast cancer.It is a really frank and funny read, but I couldn't identify with any of the choices Ms. Wolf made. I guess that isn't the point. I do think she is a great writer, and her humor is extremely sophisticated, so I'm four-starring it for that.But really. I just couldn't identify with most of it, except the cancer, of course. That can happen to anyone. I should know. And a job loss can happen to anyone. But to be so ill-prepared and then expect an affluent sibling to bail you out? Really? And to keep on making poor financial choices, like keeping horses when you can't afford to? The author makes a case for that, that she needed to keep them for her sanity. But I don't understand that way of thinking, which is why I didn't appreciate the book as much as I'd hoped to.

Funny, protective, bold and mischievous, definitely my type of boy.I&#8217;m so glad we got to see this side of Ringer. It was a part of him that was missing from the other books. But what I love the most (yes, I&#8217;ll use the word love a lot because that is what I feel for this book) is the process we see him go through. From the lonely ranger of the group, the untamable stud that was unwilling to fall for all the gooey eyed love his mates had fallen into, to a man in love. Quite beautiful to witness.I also adore that this book was different from the others in several aspects which gave the series a fresh touch. It just adds to C.J.&#8217;s creativity. Once again, we are not in Onslow; this time we get transported to Ballen, apparently a town in the middle of nowhere. But this time around, we also get away from the group and focus exclusively on Ringer and Miranda. We do get to see the gang for a bit, don&#8217;t worry, they are there, just not that present in this one.Nevertheless, my favourite part was that, unlike the other books, this one was told from two different points of view. It&#8217;s the first time we get an Onslow Boy&#8217;s point of view! The stories have always been told from the girl&#8217;s point of view, but now we got both, and it was amazing! I really loved it, it added so much to the story.Miranda, is a whole other story. I felt like a really made a connection with her, because even if all the Girls in this series go through a maturing process, Miranda was the one whose growth was more tangible. You can see her experiencing all those life changing decisions. I loved her wit and boldness too! That girl is not afraid to get what she wants! At first I didn&#8217;t get her much, she reminded me a bit about Amy, with being all spoiled and all. But once you get to know her and her demons, you get her.But mostly, I loved their relationship and to see how it developed. As I said before, Ringer was always the funny of the group, and he didn&#8217;t disappoint. The cool thing is that Miranda was up for the challenge. Her love-hate relationship was hilarious and you could feel the sexual tension between them. I dare say C.J.&#8217;s writing is getting better, because I felt she truly managed to capture their feelings, processes and essence.In sum! This is an enticing story that will have you turning pages (or clicking in my case) until you are done! It is a fun and fast paced read that makes an excellent addition to the series. If you are an Onslow Boys fan, you cannot miss out on Ringer!!*Note: I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review, but my opinion was not biased in any way by this fact.
$SUMMARY.: My favourite Onslow Boy so far

$review_text.: After the not-so wonderful experience with the previous book I read, I started this book with high hopes, hasn't disappointed. It's one of those books you cannot read at a fast pace, you need to slow down to savor every detail, delight in every scene narrated and slowly make the pictures in your mind of every character portrayed. The supernatural in it is perfect, it took me far away from page one with it's superb descriptions, detailed enough to give me an image without being boring. The characters are so well-outlined, it's easy to have them grow on you.I loved Alex and Aurora, she's so selfless and he's so loving. Sara is a sweet girl too, but she's just a frail human... is she? And Ryan? What's the secret behind Ryan's coming and going? And why is he so obsessed with Destiny? Is Destiny so important, is Destiny the best gift anyone can receive? Can we learn to cherish Destiny through this series? I think Ms. Noelle Blakley can teach us to do so.

$review_text.: This is one book that keeps you guessing until the very end and even the ending was a surprise! The book is about lies and how one lie will spread like wild fire and grow into a web of lies. The story starts off with Katrina driving to a small village to start a new after her fiancee and mother passed away leaving her financially stable.As the story progresses Katrina picks up a hitch hiker who seems to be inapporpriate and displays signs of crazyness. Katrina was fearful of her safety and she lies about where she was going to get him out of the car. Upon arriving she discovers that at her new job, the hitchhiker is a new co-worker, a philosophy teacher.Without giving any more spoilers, the story is very fast paced and kept me engaged the entire time. The plot is deep to its story and helps the reader feel as if he/she was in the story. Everyone has a dark past, and this book shows this perfectly. This is a great book with interesting characters and an amazing story.

$review_text.: In 1996 in Wyoming, Laramie Majors follows directions provided to him by his roping mentor Dwight Purley to meet another student Hap Bowman so they can team up as cowboys

 Instead of a quiet discussion, Laramie arrives only to have Hap running from a cabin; inside is which a woman throwing things at him
 She switches her target to the innocent Laramie
 He later learns that when Hap was twelve he fell in love with the daughter of a one time customer of his father


 Since that time he has dedicated his life over the last decade seeking out his Juanita with the "silhouette of a petite horse's head under the right ear".Ten years later, Hap and Laramie remain partners still searching for the right Juanita

 They cause an international border incident in Mexico and face other troubles in which they accidentally perform heroic deeds with good intentions but not always good results


 Laramie falls in love with widow Anamarie Buchet while Hap falls for Rosa Rodriguez Tryor

 Whereas Laramie knows who he wants, Hap still obsesses that Rosa is not Juanita so is not for him.Stephen Bly provides a wonderful amusing modern day western sidekick romance starring two likable cowboys on a romantic quest, but whose code of ethics (especially Laramie's) leads to one problem after another

 The story line is character driven from the insane opening gamut until the final twisted climax
 Readers will never look at the Rio Grande the same way as the buddies learn rustling on either side of the border is unhealthy
 In summary, a rose is a rose is a rose except she's not Juanita.Harriet Klausner

The emotional and psychological processes are accurate, so the reader gets not only a terrific, well-plotted thriller, but also a view into the world of urban police culture. As a psychotherapist myself, I really enjoyed that aspect, and the thriller dimension made it a page-turner.

$review_text.: Fox is so enamoured of Hildegard that he rewrites her to suit his belief system. He makes her into an environmentalist, a believer in the 'cosmic Christ,' and I find none of that in other studies. Instead, this book is unfair to the real Hildegard who was radical and a bit crazy--enough out of her time to be extraordinary. She is fascinating, an artist, musician and healer, but we don't know enough about her to say what Fox says. He conveniently leaves out her anti-semitism, for example, and tries to transport her into our time. That's unfair to her and to us.

$review_text.: I must have looked at the cover of this book 100 times


Then awhile ago I read Taz's book and while I was surfing through books to read last night I stumbled on this and there was Taz's name mentioned
Hmm

So that's when it it me

This is the first book in that series

Needless to say both of the books could be read as one shots.I liked how Ben came in and just kind of unintentionally made himself at home


And I think some folks may have some issues with the believability of that but I felt more like it was bringing me back to some younger years in my own life where that's the kind of stuff that happened

I also fell in love with the house as its own character though to the end of the story I wondered how they ever resolved the Ben and the tiny little shower thing.I had a harder time with the various levels of crime in the book


I've said it now on a few of the books that with my bikers I only need one criminal organization


After that it starts to get a little complicated

Though in this case I could kind of see the point of it.Also there's some bizarre things going on with the quotation marks that made some of the quotes hard to read

I found instead of beginning quotes on the actual quotation there's actually set of end quotes on the non-quotation sentence before

I found it slowed it down my reading trying to figure out where dialog started and stopped
And there were a few misuses of words but nothing that would make me highlight it or claim the book is unreadable.

I enjoyed the story but I feel like its lack of characters depth and build up.Their connection is great. She's too naive as someone so smart and that's a slight eye roller moment for me. But I feel like I know more about their friendship and their project than her as a heroine or him as the hero.It's a nice light read but that's about it. Enjoyable though. I really enjoy that.

Some people use "cloud" as a synonym for "on the net someplace" but it has a much more specific meaning than that.This book describes all of the considerations that go into implementing the cloud, with an emphasis on risk and security.  It's quite technical, and has all the technical basics laid out well with a whole bunch of actually useful checklists and enough depth to help you make real decisions based on real knowledge.Did I mention that it is clearly written, has a good index, and doesn't bother with standard boilerplate stuff that you, if you're in the target audience for the book, already know?Worth your money, and, more importantly, your time.
$SUMMARY.: Everything you need to understand cloud computing and evaluate cloud vendors

$REVIEW.: I loved this book! Hannah and Mac are both strong and sexy characters. When Mac meets Hannah he thinks she is there to mess with his special ops wolf team, but its the oppisite. She is there to help them.They both are having strong feelings for each other and are fighting it. Hannah is his superior and she thinks Mac hates her. He is impressed with how she can keep up with the pace he set and how strong she is. He leaves her sleeping an scouts the area when Hannah wakes she thinks he left her on purpose. As she realizes that he didn't she gets attacked by 6 men. Mac realizes she is in danger and all he can think of his protecting his MATE. Then he doesn't understand why he thought mate but has no time to worry about that he needs to save Hannah. He kills 2 as he comes in and takes out he rest but she was wrong their are 7 men and she comes face to face with a gun. Mac rips his head off and cradles her when its over. He gets her to the cave with the rest of the unit as soon as he can to get her medical attention, but then he is very aggressive to his guys when it comes to Hannah. He wants no one touching her or near her. He's Moonstruck!Hannah is confused at how Mac acts caring one minute and an Alpha ass the next. He falls hard for her and the heat between them is amazing but things happen and she could rip Mac's head off. Of course its not his fault wolfs have sensitive noses and can tell everything that happened between Hannah and Mac. Hannah gets embarrassed and says things to Mac in the heat of the moment that sets him off. Will they work it out.I loved this book! Its a must read for any werewolf fan!

$review_text.: "...May the battles that we fight be for the advancement of humanity."This remarkable story is one that comes from the author's inner core, crafted by her personal experiences that make this a raw, candid read that contains such poignancy and intensity as to really touch your heart. Michelle Cohen Corasanti is brave to bear her soul to the world, but it takes not only strength of character but determination to present to the world a `real' picture of how things are and to push forward with ones own beliefs as a free human being. The Palestinian dominance within Israel is the central focus of this detailed, thought-provoking narrative as the author wanted to help bring about peace to the Middle East. I feel so privileged to be able to hold this extraordinary work of fiction within the palm of my hand, and to have the opportunity of exploring new things by these words that moved me to tears...hence I can honestly say that this book is quite special.One follows the story of Ichmad Hamid as he struggles through life in the knowledge that he can do nothing, and is utterly and completely helpless to save his friends and family. Living on occupied land his entire village operates in constant fear of loosing all that they hold most dear; including their homes, jobs and belongings but most importantly each other. Ichmad's twelfth birthday unknowingly to him is the catalyst for great change, as his world is suddenly & unexpectedly turned upside down...His father is imprisoned and his family's home and belongings are confiscated, amidst his other siblings soon succumbing to hatred in the face of great conflict. Ichmad then begins an inspiring journey using his intellect to try and save his poor dying family, and in doing so he reclaims a love for others that was lost through childhood violence, hence hope is kindle...This stunning story embodies the true meaning of love and selflessness, and that great fight that the main character goes through for trying to save all that matters to him in life. It shows readers the actual meaning of life by presenting to one, quite openly the horrors that take place within the far corners of this world and that as you read will take place whilst one contemplates upon this message. Sometimes one must fight for what they believe in, for what you deem to be right and just and for those that you love (consisting of your entire world). There is so much injustice, so much hatred in the world and the divide within social hierarchy is still widening constantly, as new leaders rule with different ideals and those who oppose them feel such wrath.This story really moved me, affected me deeply and which would strike a chord in all our hearts for regardless of whether we come from other continents, speak in different tongues and live by different cultures we all are united together due to the power of LOVE. This in effect is what makes us human and is our adversary's greatest weakness, for though we always strive for peace there is a war raging in another corner of the world.*I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the author for having her book on GoodReads as a `first-read' giveaway.*
$SUMMARY.: This noteworthy book is one that touches your heart with its exposed frankness, emotion and which is greatly affecting.

$REVIEW.: Patchwork Family is a good title for a story with a hodge-podge of personalities connected by blood and marriage. We can't choose our family, but we wind up entwined in their lives whether we like it or not, and that's the case here with Regina and Annabelle and their families. Enjoyed this easy-to-read tale about how the twists and sometimes harsh turns of family drama only serve to make us realize we were meant to belong to these people we call family.

$REVIEW.: &#8220;If God made all our faces, did he laugh when he made me?Does he make the legs that cannot walk and eyes that cannot see?Does he curl the hair upon my head 'til it rebels in wild defiance?Does he close the ears of a deaf man to make him more reliant?Is the way I look a coincidence or just a twist of fate?If he made me this way, is it okay, to blame him for the things I hate?For the flaws that seem to worsen every time I see a mirror, for the ugliness I see in me, for the loathing and the fear.Does he sculpt us for his pleasure, for a reason I can't see?If God makes all our faces, did he laugh when he made me?There were so many great lines and quotes in this story I was a highlighting fool wanting to remember them all!! I can honestly say this is one of my favorite books this year!!!The first Amy Harmon book that I read was A Different Blue and I loved it so much that she pretty much became an auto buy or me. So when I saw this one out I was all over it!I fell instantly in love with these characters. Fern Taylor in all of her ugly awkwardness, Bailey Sheen in all of his unique quirkiness and amazing outlook on the world, given his circumstances, and of course Ambrose Young with his beautiful face and body and even more beautiful heart!!This is a story of growing up, discovering who you are and loving yourself and others no matter what the outside looks like. Being able to find the beauty and love in people that you may not see on the surface but believe me is there in spades!!Fern has loved Ambrose since they were children and that love has never wavered. Even though Ambrose never really looked at Fern that way he knew she was around and genuinely liked her. Bailey and Fern are cousins and two peas in a pod. Bailey is confined to a wheelchair so Fern is his right hand gal for the most part. But they really are best friends first and foremost.This story spans a long period of time. We start with the kids at the end of high school, although there are a lot of flashbacks to help the story along. As school ends Ambrose and his buddies move on and join the Army instead of going off to college and this is where we see Ambrose grow up fast!!Oh, and I have to mention this all takes place during and the years after the attacks on 9/11. That plays a huge roll in this story as well.I could go on and on and on, but I won&#8217;t! I will say YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!! I MEAN IT!This booked moved me like really great stories do, I know this because I was in a book funk for almost a week while these characters continued to live in my head. They won&#8217;t leave you easily, I swear!

$REVIEW.: I wish it was possible to give this book 2 1/2 stars. As a fellow Floridian, I wanted to like this book. I was intrigued by the glowing reviews it received, and after seeing the author at a local book reading, it held much promise.Unfortunately, promise and reality are extremely far apart. The author attempts to braid together three disparate themes - illicit sexual behavior, horses and the Depression - and fails terribly. The book is very disjointed. In some parts riding and Thea's sexual behaviors are discussed ad nauseum, and neither are as interesting as the author wants you to believe. The Depression feels like it's thrown in as an afterthought. In reality the book could have been set in almost any era.Thea is not a likable character. Her indignation after what she repeatedly sought with her cousin was almost laughable. Yet she fails to learn from that experiences, and continues to indulge her own whims, with no thought to the hurt she inflicts. Her parents' motivation to isolate Thea and her brother are never explored adequately. There are hints about her mother, but nothing of substance.The author has much to learn about writing a captivating novel. If you feel you must read this book, do so with low expectations.

$REVIEW.: Everything by Jeri WilliamsI was not familiar with this Author or her work, there was some general conversation going back and forth on FB so I decided to check her book out.  I was really surprised to see only one review on Amazon.  The review sounded interesting so I decided I&#8217;d purchase her book.  I promised Jeri Williams I would read it.  Well I read it.When first getting into this read, it was unlike anything I&#8217;ve read.  Not my norm by all means.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what this was.  It seemed like it was a story about some poor girl Dacey Harper who had a really dysfunctional life.  A father who kept a roof over her head, food in her belly and clothes on her back minus any love what so ever. Seems Dacey&#8217;s Mom died giving birth to her so you get the distinct impression her Dad resented the hell out of her. Then you have her crazy Aunt Opal who sometimes goes into the twilight zone.  Keep in mind they live in a small town in Florida and everyone knows everyone&#8217;s business.  So poor Aunt Opal is known as the town crazy.  Dacey&#8217;s boyfriend is some hot dude and I wasn&#8217;t really all into him as far as his character, something just didn&#8217;t sit right with me about him.  Then you have Dacey&#8217;s stepmother Ann who she didn&#8217;t consider her stepmother but her mother, and her little sister Aria. Aria and Dacey were insync with each other it was almost creepy. Well at least their Mom thought so.We can&#8217;t forget her smart mouthed BFF chica Tina.  Tina and Dacey had been friends since kindergarten and the sandbox crowd.  And of course good old Uncle Mick MTD anyone who read this book will know what that means.  Oh and we can&#8217;t leave out the sneaky dorm mate of Dacey, Kelly.  Yeah she was one person right off the bat I didn&#8217;t trust as far as I could throw her.  Little miss do good all sweet and innocent.  Yeah right.After a horrific accident where Dacey and Aria lose their parents you really see who the real friends are and you see how family is so very very important.  Her hunk boyfriend showed his true colors the stupid lump like Tina liked to call him.  I can think of a few choice words but if I printed them my review wouldn&#8217;t get published.  At first it seems that no matter what these girls couldn&#8217;t catch a break.  The grieving they went through was painful to read.  I can&#8217;t say anymore without giving too much away.  But I have to say one thing spoiler or not, Jusin Parker the Highway Officer that was at the accident scene pops up in Dacey&#8217;s life when she least expects it, and he&#8217;s such a gentlemen and you know he is really digging Dacey.  But he&#8217;s taking it slow and I&#8217;m loving it.  I&#8217;m really really digging Justin, and Aria and Ri Ri we need to see where this goes.  I can&#8217;t wait for Eugene and Opal to have their wedding.  Hmmm will this break down the cement walls around Dacey&#8217;s heart.  Will she let loose and open up to Justin?  (god I hope so).  I&#8217;m looking forward to the next installment  &#8220;Anything&#8221;  got to see where all this leads.

$review_text.: Goulart does not explain her rationale or methodology in putting together this volume


We don't know why she chose this rather than that, why she sometimes adapts material, why or when excerpting has taken place


For instance, John Dear's striking "Apostles' Creed, Updated" runs to more than sixty lines as originally written; only twenty-five lines are provided by Goulart (pp

200 & 201) and we are left to wonder at and about the unexplained abridgement.Taking the above into account, this is still a useful and reasonably heterogeneous resource for run-of-the-mill interfaith services and interaction

The hit-or-miss options given after each selection may or may not provide serviceable ideas about how the selection can be used in a variety of contexts; for "Offerings to the Buddha" (pp

202 & 203) one of the optional suggestions is: "Substitute the name of your higher power for 'Buddha'." An index by faith tradition would have been handy and appreciated.

 However, I am glad I stepped out of my reader comfort zone

 The characters were so accessible I was knee deep in the suspense before I realized it


 Stayed up until past midnight to finish BECAUSE I HAD TO KNOW
 No spoilers, I promise.Characters were real and tangible.Action was deliberately paced to draw the reader in and keep them engaged.Mystery is buried deep enough to make it worth the read.This is a confident, well written mystery.I look forward to what's next from this emerging author.

$review_text.: Several interesting characters including Zeb, Song Bird, Jake, Steele and others.  A good start at character development.  The character of Doreen becomes even  more distracting in the next book in this redeemable series.  Her dialog is reminiscent of Granny Clampet on Beverly Hillbillies or Flo on Alice.  I expect to hear her say "kiss my grits" any minute.  I have been familiar with Safford, Globe, Miami,Tucson, and Phoenix for over 65 years and have only heard a waitress speak like this on excursions to  small town Texas.  When I lived in NY, Chicago, Idaho, Oregon and Michigan, the small town folks sounded about the same as small town AZ minus the generous sprinkling of Spanish words, correctly or incorrectly pronounced, woven into the conversation.With better editing, which is always my biggest problem as well, and killing off Flo,  I would have rated this book a solid 3.  There is enough potential here to make me hope book 3  will be a solid 4.

$REVIEW.: An absolutely fascinating read


I highly recommend this book for those interested in economics, community development, economic development and human behavior.Kling, Arnold and Schulz, Nick From Poverty To Prosperity - Intangible Assets, Hidden Liabilities and the Lasting Triumph Over Scarcity, Encounter Books, New York, NY Copyright  2009 by Arnold Kling and Nick Schulz.This book is about "Economics 2.0' - an emerging field of economics whose impetus for evolving has been the blatant miscues, misunderstandings, assumptions, math, models and people that have contributed to the ongoing global financial crisis

I will let the following excerpts speak for themselves:"This book presents the main ideas of what we call Economics 2.0
Economists have developed these ideas in order to explain the enormous differences in quality of life over history across countries." P

2"Economics 2.0 says that these differences reflect intangible assets and invisible liabilities


The intangible assets are knowledge bases." P


2"Invisible liabilities, on the other hand, are institutional and cultural impediments to innovation and productivity
These range from the structure and conduct of government to the attitudes and customs of ordinary citizens." P
2."Economics 2.0 says that overcoming market failure requires innovation
Innovation is best delivered by markets." P


3Economics 2.0 is about abundance, which arises from technological progress." P.4."We use "recipes" to refer to innovation, ideas, know-how, science, and technology
We use "the operating system" to refer to customs, rules, norms, laws, regulations, and methods of intermediation." P


10-11."The past decade also saw gains in jobs that involve imagination and creativity - designers, architects, photographers, actors and directors


The hairstylists and cosmetologists category rose by 146,000 jobs


Many occupations that use analytic reasoning have continued to grow, too, but computer operators and others are beginning to see their numbers fall
The occupations in eclipse are generally those that involve muscle power, manual dexterity and formulaic intelligence."pp.46-47"The software layer creates the possibility that growth will accelerate

As more and more of the value in goods and services come from ideas, our standard of living will tend to increase at a faster pace." P
75"By far the largest contributor to growth of our price adjusted GDP, or value added, has been ideas - insights that leveraged physical reality." P.76PAUL ROMER is a senior fellow at the Stanford Center For International Development (SCID) and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR)

His contributions to field of economics include being the primary developer of new growth theory, which deemphasizes the traditional idea of the scarcity of objects and directs attention to the power of new ideas."Newton said that he could see further because he stood on the shoulders of giants." P.80."The set of possible ideas, the set of things there are out there to discover, is just so incomprehensibly large that we've only begun to explore the tiniest subset of possible  ideas or discoveries." P.81"As long as we keep freeing up labor from bending metal and stamping out pills and put more and more of it into discovery, we can keep pushing up that rate of growth, by directing more and more resources in that direction." P
98"You want people to be aware of what others are doing so that you don't end up with a whole lot of replication of effort

Part of what A communications technologies are doing is coordinating  these discovery efforts worldwide: as soon as somebody discovers something, it gets broadcast very quickly to others throughout the world, and people can change the directions they explore based on what they know others are doing." P.99Question to Paul Romer:  "Are there one or two key things that our politic class, broadly speaking, doesn't sufficiently appreciate or understand about economic growth?" Pp.1041
Well, one thing that's important to persuade everyone of is that everyone wants growth but nobody wants change, and you've got to have both or you've got to have neither - it's what I was talking about before, that it's all about rearrangement and finding better ways to rearrange things

The only way you can create new value with new rearrangements is essentially by doing things differently; and any time you do things differently, there will be change, so people have to buy into the idea that change accompanies growth

It's not going to be just more of the same for everyone." P.1042
We have to agree that, one, there will be change, and two, there are some winners and losers and there are no guarantees: everybody who is engaged in economic activity takes a certain amount of risk
There are always winners and losers when there are risks


We all commit to that, and on average we're all going to be better off, but we don't let the  losers have veto power over progress

This is clearly a very acute question right now in Europe, where the existing elite, the existing well-off, do have a very strong position of veto power, a choke- hold on change and innovation." P.105JOEL MOKYR is the Robert H

Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University
He holds a joint appointment in economics as well as a Sackler Professorial Fellowship at the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at the University of Tel  Aviv."The degree to which we hold fast to the wisdom of earlier generations is an incredibly important element in how innovative a society is, because if you think about it, every act of invention is an act of rebellion." P


130Kling & Schulz -- "Tribalism tends to cause resistance to innovation
People in isolated villages view new productive techniques as threats
In part, this is because innovations are associated with outsiders
Moreover, innovations threaten to disrupt local traditions that have sustained community cohesion for many generations." P

139DOUGLASS NORTH is the Spencer T
Olin Professor in Arts and Science at Washington University in St
Louis


He was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1993
His major interest is the evolution of economic and political institutions and the effects of institutions on the development of economies over time
He is the author of Structure and Change in Economic History (1981), Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (1990 ), and many other books

P.148"We're trying to broaden how we think about problems, and


The frame is not economics; it's all of the social sciences
You cannot separate economics from political science and sociology at all
All of the interesting issues are on the borders between them." P.149Question to Douglas North -- "What other obstacles prevent economists and policymakers from seeing what really matters?" Until they understand that our understanding of the world is very fragmentary, is not complete, is - I believe - partially incorrect, no matter how intelligent we are, we're not going to make sense of the world." p

151"Behavioral economics, which has gotten a couple of Nobel prizes in the last couple of years, is the beginning of a recognition that traditional economics is too narrow, and cognitive science is now becoming a flourishing area of interest to social scientists." P.152"We still don't understand how beliefs get formed, how they change, why they change, when they do, and how that underlies the choices people make." P.153."It factors in in that I keep on saying it's a non-ergodic world, which means the world is changing
And therefore, we're always behind
And if we're way behind, of course, our theories are completely wrong

And indeed, all of economic theory is predicated on models that are derived from the past

Now the models, if the world isn't changing very rapidly, may be perfectly fine


But if the world is changing very rapidly, the models are out of date." P.154.Question to Douglass North: "What do you make of the emphasis on math in economics?" It was vastly overdone

Math should be a tool, and what's happened is that it's become an end in itself

We build elegant models, using very elegant mathematics, but they are so abstracted, so divorced from the problems we're trying to confront that they don't deal with them at all

We borrowed again from the physical sciences, and in the physical sciences, elegant mathematics is essential


That's not so clear for most of the social sciences." Pp.160-161"We should be very tentative about how we understand the world
That doesn't mean you don't do things
You've got to do things, but you've got to recognize you may be wrong

We don't know enough

And so it's terribly important to recognize that you can be wrong
And, to be, therefore, very susceptible to modifying the theories you hold in the light of new evidence
Now as I said, that doesn't mean you don't do anything; you've got to do things

It does mean that you're willing to be adaptively efficient [in the face on change and to rethink the problems as you evolve." P.163"What particularly bothers me is that the world is evolving more rapidly now than it ever did before
The degree to which we can catch up with it and deal with it, I think, is more and more strained now that we've devised ways to blow each other off the face of the earth


The time horizon we have to solve problems is much more abbreviated than it used to be; whereas before we could make mistakes and kill a few hundred thousand people, now we can blow everybody up

And we don't seem to have gotten very far in solving social disorder

I hope I'm wrong." P.164Kling & Schulz: "The entrepreneur's task is to overcome resistance to adoption of new ideas and the discarding of unsuccessful or obsolete practices


This in turn requires that people accept change."  P.183."Economic development is best served by searchers." P.195"Economics 2.0 says that the abundance that arises from innovation and economic growth depends on the work of entrepreneurs and searchers

We see economic activity as an ongoing battle between upstarts and incumbents

Incumbents try to consolidate and defend the existing modes of operation

Upstarts try to apply new knowledge and techniques


When the upstarts succeed, incumbents are reluctantly forced to follow."  p
197."In Economics 2.0, we emphasize the importance of what is unseen and unknown
In the case of financial intermediation, it  is the problem of unseen risks that merits attention." P

229."As with any bureaucracy, the internal dynamics tend to favor those who question innovation and put roadblocks in the way of those with new ideas." P.245"Economics 2.0 looks at the economy primarily in terms of its adaptive efficiency - how effective it is at incorporating new recipes and discarding outmoded ones." P.239"Incumbent organizations - resist adopting the best practices that challenge the status quo


The gradual diffusion of innovation is a process that has long fascinated economists." P.249."The material portion of our GDP is declining, and the intellectual portion is increasing." P.274."The most successful economies have been those in which people have been most willing to accept and promote change

Poverty tends to be concentrated in countries where people and cultures tend to resist change

This means that those countries will either remain backward economically or confront difficult social tension." P.278The excerpts above are simply a few tidbits
A wonderful contribution


Devour it.

$REVIEW.: The book is easy to read and short. Kate and Rudy both share the true story of the eruption of Mt. Merapi, in Java (Indonesia). They are eyewitnesses to the devastation and destruction of an active volcano occurring in November of 2010. Villagers were being evacuated from an area 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from the crater itself. The authors lived in what was known as a safe zone, meaning the volcano normally did not touch that area.&#34;Many people just ignored both the warning sounds from Merapi and the sirens.&#34; It seemed foolhardy for people to not heed the warnings given way ahead of time. They lived with a false sense of security until it erupted. I saw poor judgment and bad excuses prevail, to the extent that people risked their very lives for belongings.&#34;Statics about the November eruption vary from one source to another, but the death toll of that eruption was around 350, comprised mainly of people who had not evacuated for one reason or another.&#34; Kate and Rudy survived and are fortunate to be alive to tell their story, many others did not. They returned to an intact house with some damage, again many others did not. It was an interesting story mostly because it was a true account.

$REVIEW.: Maybe I should just give up on British romance. It always leaves me asking myself, "Why did you bother?" It started off right, charming and cute, maybe even a little hot - but then it went nowhere.Ms. Lovell writes Bea as if we were getting a glimpse into her diary, and while that's okay, Bea doesn't exactly have a strong voice. I would have liked to see something happen. Anything really. Even when I thought this book was going to be so predictable that I could call what would happen next, I was still wrong. Instead of the predictable happening, nothing happened. It was just, "how is a long distance relationship supposed to work" and "I love you, let's have sex." It was this same simple, yet frustrating thought again, and again, and again. To the point where I wished our sexy, too perfect, Daniel would have smacked some sense into his woman a lot sooner.In the end we get a brief glimpse at Tillie's story and THAT seems to be where the story is at but I fear even picking it up if it is anything like the first installment.All in all, I sadly found myself more annoyed with this book than enjoying it; baby, I love you, sweatheart, mush, mush, mush. This book had a lot of promise but just feel short for me. Le sigh.[...]

$review_text.: Lucinda Richards has accepted the job of teaching in Estelline, Texas though not even 18 years old.  She leaves all that is familiar and comfortable and begins a new life in West Texas.  The story is conveyed in letters to loved ones back home and diary entries.  It details the life of a young woman in 1911, facing the changes that come both in her life, and to the lives of the people she comes to care for and love. It is the details that ring true, the differences in stations in society, the hardships faced by families, and the expectations on a young , single woman.  I think this would be a great book for a mother-daughter bookclub to read.

But TG's dialogue has become repetitive and predictable


The characters are dumbed down and many plot points seem too contrived

Also, the plot felt like what i imagine a nancy drew novel to be like.Glad.to see TG step out on his own

$REVIEW.: 2.5*When we met Frankie and Benny (and the Bianchis) in At Peace, they were at a very interesting turning point
After 7 years as the scapegoat for Vinnie Jrs' death, Frankie is ready to move on...just as the Bianchis have been shocked into realizing they want to reclaim her
Have they realized they were wrong, or are they now just willing to 'forgive' her? Can she ever trust them again? A promising set up for an emotional read as they deal with the past and move forward......Except that's not the story we get

The past is never really dealt with at all

Benny feels some guilt over his treatment of Frankie, but mostly he just takes over her life and then is proud of her 'maturity' in not making his family feel bad
And so we don't even get a glimpse of reconciliation with Theresa (Benny's mother, who has despised Frankie for 7 years)
Vinnie Sr just gets offered coffee, and Manny (Benny's brother) isn't even allowed to apologise by Frankie, who really does have martyr issues that need therapy
Emotional impact just withers and dies.Back in At Peace, there's a moment when Frankie recalls she used to wonder sometimes if she loved/wanted Vinnie Jr's family more than she actually wanted him


For me, this is a HUGE issue in The Promise - Frankie needs so desperately to be part of a family

Yes, she wants Benny
But she wants the Bianchis just as much - and goes into meltdown at the thought she might lose them again.Finally with the negativity, I found it disturbing that Frankie begins as someone who is independent and taking control of her own life and ends as someone who, after being ordered to sit and not move by her man, is apparently LITERALLY unable to move until he pulls her from the chair.I like Frankie (though the drama queen KA heroine is getting very old)


I like Benny


I don't hate the book


But this is the most frustrating KA book I've read in that it could have packed huge emotional weight and it just didn't


Disappointing.

This book 'Bees: learn About Your world Series' is easy to relate for kids too with the playful nature of the two bees Brenda and Bella.When I began reading from the view point of the bees, I wondered how it would pan out, but the author Trinity Jorden has maintained the consistency of bees and their interest - flowers and pollen. we read about animals like dolphins and even bees communicating in the figure eight but how does that communication look like? It does seem to be fun to be bees even if it gets crowded.The facts of bees in the later part of the book are fun too, with a choice to start reading based on your interest.

$review_text.: This book is mostly a collection of columns written by St. Clair McKelway and published in The New Yorker magazine. They are a marvelous collection of sideways looks at America, and most of the stories are marvelous looks at offbeat and unusual occurrences.=== The Good Stuff ===* Several of the tales are literally laugh-out-loud funny. Self-proclaimed diplomats and low-value counterfeiters are both amusing and sad tales, but eminently readable. McKelway has a talent for capturing these characters and relating their story. Even though these tales are fifty or more years old, they still stand the test of time and are relevant and enjoyable today.* Most of the tales are based in New York City, but there are stories from the South Pacific and Europe. Even if you have never lived in NYC, or any big city, the characters and plots are interesting enough to satisfy most any reader.* McKelway is nothing if not thorough. For every story, we typically meet the character, explore his childhood, and see him in later years including the consequences of his actions. The author errs on the side of more rather than less information and detail.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* Perhaps the most charitable description of McKelway's writing style is to say that it is the product of a different time. I found many of the stories to be overly detailed, sometimes rambling, and often full of details and diversions not needed to develop the plot. All of the tales seem too long, but a couple cross the line into becoming unreadable. In at least two of the stories, I found myself losing interest and skimming parts of the narrative.* McKelway is much better at relating 3rd person tales than autobiographical stories. In at least one of the stories, he appears to be delusional and the story becomes a rambling, hard-to-read, and borderline nonsensical story that I ended up mostly skipping after the first 20 pages.=== Summary ===The good parts of the book are very good, but the bad parts are equally bad. I ended up powering through the book, but if I knew what the book contained, I would have only read about half the stories. If you like offbeat tales of life's curious characters, there are several in this book. My only advice would be that once you feel a story starting to get boring, repetitive or full of obtuse details, don't be afraid to skim the rest of it. It doesn't get better.

$REVIEW.: I am pleased to say this second effort of Scribner's is better than his first

I rather enjoyed the mystery here, not "guessing/deducing" the culprit before the denouement at Judge Severus' final gathering in Baiae.The story concerns the murder in Rome's seaside resort of two people

A curiosi (read "Secret Service") named Publius Bassianus and General Gnaeus Avidianus Nepos (cognomen Cyclops) have wound up dead


One from a clonk on the head, the other with a dagger through his remaining eye
Public hysteria means there is a fear that a serial killer by the sobriquet of 'Odysseus' is murdering people using methods described in Homer's 'The Odyssey.' He may be on dubious jurisdiction, but Severus has been ordered to investigate and an anxious Town Council is keen to wrap up the case before tourism takes a mighty hit
It's not quite so easy as a trip to the Blue Oyster Bar to work matters out and by the end of the book two more are dead....the culprit is a busy person - involved in a court martial in Judea, a counterfeiting ring in Antioch and the series of murderous events in Baiae over the course of the month and four days that the novel spans.Scriber keeps his assortment of characters from the first novel
Vulso gets more of a look in as the hard-hitting ex-Centurion
Straton is less evident


There's a few newbies: Proculus, Flaccus and Eclectus


All of them are needed to puzzle out the lies and misdeeds of Galba, Galliancus, Carbo, Herminius, Ambibulus, Meherdates et al
who are all prepared to inveigle their way out of the relentless Stoic pursuance of the suave Severus.I'll pick up on a few "errors." Examples include:Historical - Scribner has his hero muse: "Then Persia, as we call that country, or Iran as they Persians, call it." The term Iran was coined in Persia under the rule of Ardashir the Unifier who ruled from 206A.D

Given the events of the book are in 161A.D

there is no way Severus would have known this.Typos - "the Flaccus, prodding." "it's" (for "its")Modern parlance - "smog", "blurbs", "didactically, "police", "lucre", "hotel", "vagabond", "shacks", "nymphomaniac", "booty", "international character", "safe-deposit repositories", "I want the sauce on the side", "the Milky Way", "homicide" There's a bit too much of this being used by the characters
Their language needs more realism.There's also the humorous description "a crashing orgasm"

Never heard it described like that before, but Scribner professes to know second century Rome, so I'll have to accept it, I guess.The novel allows Scriber to delve into his favourite pastime of educating the reader, though he's cut back on it somewhat from the first novel, thankfully


The passages on Homer are necessary for the plot, the lengthy didactic on frumentarii is unnecessary given the curiosi have a tiny part in the book

I've come to expect Severus soliloquies/monologues on philosophies and the small details regarding Eastern cults is also integral to the plot (or at least to one blind alley.)In conclusion, the pace of this is better than the previous effort; Severus is still a stuffy, boring lead sleuth, but his associates more than make up for his shortcomings
The mystery is confusing enough to hold our attention throughout; the action, right from the first beach to the digging in the villas at the end, is bright and believable.Not bad at all
I will definitely look for the next one.

$review_text.: Giselle Carmichael delivers a novel that can be compared to one of the best African American interracial novelists of our time - Ms. Sandra Kitt.Politics of Love is a steamy romance novel that covers the building relationship between mayoral incumbent, Chase Matthews and third grade school teacher, Eden Warner.Upon first sight, Chase Matthews is immediately blown away by the very sight of Eden at her school during a scheduled press conference to promote his platform on education. Eden, as well, is struck by the sheerhandsomeness of Chase Matthews but is a little miffed at his choice of using her public school as a conduit for possible mayoral votes, not knowing that her principal is one of his best friends. By happenstance, Chase overhears Eden speaking to one of her fellow teachers about her displeasure in using the school as such a platform and decides to call her bluff and work in her school to get a better understanding of the veryeducational platform he is trying to promote.An instant attraction ensues but the interracial undertones are prevalent, not because Eden who is African American or the fact that Chase is white, but for the sake of Chase's political constituents and their prejudices of interracial couples. To ensure Eden of his sincerity he quotes to her his Politics of Love, hence the title.Ms. Carmichael delivers a lovely novel filled with steamy love scenes, romance and promise. The topic of interracial relationships was clearly researched allowing the author to deliver an interesting romance. A bit of mystery was interwoven into the story which gave the outcome aninteresting twist. The family dynamic is touched upon with success where the families deal with the interracial concerns and the affect it could have, not on their relationship, but on Chase's political career. I look forward to more from Ms. Carmichael.Michelle HenleyAPOOO BookClub

$review_text.: I must admit that I judged this book by its cover before I ever read it. With such a yummy hottie on the cover all wrapped in chains, I simply couldn't resist. I was pleasantly surprised with this story because it touches on not only my love for a good romance novel, but also my love for classic literature. The story is part of the Grimm's Circle Series and introduces us to a Grimm named Jacob. Grimm's are somewhat like guardian angels. They are technically ghosts; people who have died but are not really dead. They exist to show people the lives that could be, or could have been if they make different choices. Similar to a certain story involving three ghosts showing an old mizer how his choices have impacted those around him and why he needs to change his ways.Jacob, is given the task of training a new Grimm named Celeste. After suffering a tragic death, she refuses to let go of the life she had and continues to torment the trainers to the point that they simply refuse to work with her. Thinking Jacob will just be another trainer to toss her aside, she continually puts herself in harms way and dwells on her old life when she can. When she takes it a step too far, Jacob decides that it is time to push Celeste to the edge and see if she can finally let go of her past and move on to her future. In doing so, he learns that his feelings for Celeste are becoming too strong to ignore. Can Jacob save her from her own sorrow? When is is finally able to show her what she is capable of, he realizes too late that he may be able to save Celeste from her heartache, but not himself.This book really took me by surprise. Throughout the story the author throws in hints about Jacob's past life and it kept me curious from beginning to end. I love the subtle nods to the classic story his character is based on and how the author uses that mizerly personality as a reason for Jacob's becoming a Grimm. My heart simply aches for him when he is finally able to show his true emotions. There is something about a strong man willing to let the walls come down to bare his heart that just makes me weak in the knees.This was a unique take on demon slayers and I simply love that the author steps outside the box to bring in old stories with new ones. A great read with a short but sexy love story that will leave you wondering what happens next.

$review_text.: I found the book to be lacking. The topic is very pertinent and interesting, but I expected there to be more analyses in the book. Instead, it read more like a recap of current events and blogs that I already follow. Penny describes very real sexism. The issue with the book is that these are all topics already actively discussed (for free) on internet forums and blogs. I am not complaining that I spent $2, but I am saying that to charge for a book feminism, I expected to see some original ideas. Instead, she just recycles ideas found on various feminist blogs (the ideas are usually valid and well thought out, but I've read them all before).Her writing is engaging, but she does fall into some blog-writing tropes (ie describing a geeks &#34;neckbeard&#34;) that often emphasize phsyical atteibutes over ideas. This is ok in the blog-sphere where everyone gets the joke, but not in a published essay. The essay also lacks in any kind of serious citations. She makes a lot of claims about the sexism women experience, but hardly sites any studies or polls. She also makes claims about socialization without any scientific support. I am in almost complete agreement with her arguments, but I can't stand by anyone that doesn't back up arguments with research.All in all, after reading it, i had a &#34;so what?&#34; Moment. If you are even passingly familiar with internet sexism, this book will offer you little. It is basically a summary of the sexism women experience, with little analyses as to why (the analyses she does offer is not supported with any data other then well known stereotypes). There is nothing in the book that offers any way to combat this sexism, except with vigilantism (with no discussion of the reprecussions of that). This essay was more a rant of what women put up with then a

Sex is a sure plus in a romance novel but the story about Laurelyn And Jack really dragged on and the sex was used as filler. Too much.  Also there was absolutely no closure pertaining to Audrey.  She continued to cause problems at the vineyards and persuaded Laurelyn she was Jack Henry's wife, then just dropped off the face of the book.  The author could have so much more with this.

What a thoroughly satisfying, yet twisted conclusion to this wonderful story!I'm not going to give you a summary, because a) I find them so difficult to write (read the synopsis!) and b) I can't do it without giving juicy stuff away! So here is what I have to say....What we, the fans, get from the Token 6 is, in true Marata style, so much more than we bargained for! We find out who the bad guys is!!! (A fist pump worthy moment!)


We get action, drama, romance, suspense, surprise, giggles and a whole heap of satisfaction and delight

You have no idea how ingenious the plot is, I never saw the identity of the villain coming! Ms


Eros' depth of deceit knows no bounds! I love it!I'm especially looking forward to the next two upcoming installments which focus on the intriguing Thorn and the hilarious and snarky Kiki!The Token series, so far, has been one hell of a roller coaster ride of emotions for me, and super addictive
Do yourself a favour and start from the beginning and enjoy the ride

$review_text.: I could not put this book down, frankly I had to beg myself to "slow" down just to savor the story. Nico and Elle are such endearing characters, filled with flaws and emotional needs. They come from two different worlds yet that diversity makes them drawn to each other like magnets. Outstanding dialogue, stellar sex scenes and well rounded characters, even the back ground ones,had importance in this story. It makes you laugh and cry, it also makes you wish for a man like Nico(just look at the cover-----sigh!Review based on ARC Kindle Edition.

$REVIEW.: I rarely read paranormal, thus kept pushing Blue-Eyed Badass aside while reading other works the past couple of months.  But Bonnie Bernard is so talented and her short stories so memorable, her name kept popping to mind until I eventually gave in and picked up Badass.  Thank you, voices in my head!As usual, this author brings such exciting life to every character introduced and keeps readers turning pages with her unique writing style. Don't try to figure out what's coming around the bend because you won't. Bernard makes writing look easy (and maybe it is for her), and her keen ability to weave together a story certainly makes reading fun.None of us are exactly who we seem to be, but there are few writers today who can endear readers to unusual characters residing in worlds unlike those we know.  If you want to read the same old, same old, go elsewhere.  If you want to read awesome writing and stories you'll be recommending to friends and thinking/talking about for days after reading, buy Bernard.And please - be careful when talking to strangers.

$review_text.: DARKWOOD is beautifully written, compelling, atmospheric, richly imagined...but still unsatisfying.  Despite Breen's wonderful, polished writing, I felt like I was reading a sketch or an outline - the bare bones of a story that hadn't been fully developed.I was drawn in from the very beginning by the eerie setting, the barren outpost of a strange land where night falls instantly and the darkness is so complete it strands every citizen inside his or her home until the sun rises again.And I loved the book's heroine, Annie.  She's curious and clever and loyal, a survivor.  Like so many lead characters in fantasy stories, Annie comes from a miserable broken family.  Her parents are dead, her sister is dead, and she lives with her alcoholic uncle and bitter aunt.Annie is quiet and obedient, mostly trying to stay under the radar, until she finds out that her uncle is planning to sell her into slavery as a miner.  Children are sent to pick precious stones from nooks and crannies where adult bodies will not fit, and they are worked so hard and treated so poorly that few live longer than a year or two.Rather than accept this horrible fate, Annie runs away.  First she plans to save herself - then she decides it's her duty to save all the other children, too.  And so begins a series of wild adventures - Annie stumbles rapidly from dizzying highs to devastating lows, chances upon allies who are instantly devoted to her and falls into traps laid by enemies who are always a step ahead.  The author lays down obvious clues that Annie ignores for far too long (she encounters the kinderstalk - huge, predatory wolves - five or six times without being attacked...but doesn't stop to question why she's been spared), while Annie warns the king of obvious dangers and he doesn't pay attention.The thing is, DARKWOOD is pretty short...and a LOT happens.  So instead of carefully developing each plot point, Breen cuts corners.  And it shows.  So even though the writing is fantastic, even though I loved the cast of characters, even though I could drown in the atmosphere, I couldn't get over the weak story.  I enjoyed reading, but I was disappointed.That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to read the sequel.

It was easy to read and gave a quick review of how the Kindle publishing of books works.  I was happy to learn about this process.  It encouraged me to see that individuals with something to say now have an easy and inexpensive way to allow them to share their expertise in any area of interest.  This is great to know.  It breaks down a lot of "walls" that may keep especially deserving folks from contributing their unique knowledge from their own point of view.

$review_text.: Matthew Shepard is looked upon as part of a context. The technique is really very interesting. For one would think that Matthew's story would be narrated in the usual manner, starting from the beginning and ending at the end. But this book is nothing like this. The book is about Matthew Shepard as much as it isn't. It is the story of an emergent identity (that of the author) precisely because of Matthew's tragic end. In this sense, Matthew's murder is an end but also a beginning. And this book warmly and objectively commemorates the former, and beautifully celebrates the latter. It avoids making Matthew an object of mere curiosity, and nor an icon. It keeps him true and warm and personal. A truely sensitive tribute.

Tech is pretty much absent with the exception of a sonic screwdriver that gets used once. Once our hero is sent back to earth to complete his Jedi training or something, the story enters the ludicrous zone. There is no space epic here, there is however a lengthy adventure thriller story that stretches logical thought to the breaking point.On the plus side, the overarching story plot is fresh and interesting, and the writing is well above average.

I mean, what girl wouldn't be terrified to marry into royalty when you're just a &#34;normal&#34; girl? I can't begin to describe how the story grabbed me and held on tight all the way until the happily ever afters. This isn't Snow White, but there's no doubting that this book could be a real life fairy tale but this time with a real life ending. If you love royalty, romance and love, don't hesitate to pick up this book.

$REVIEW.: Ok I am a fan of interracial stories both Christian and non Christian fiction but I must admit I had to force myself to finish this book, I think is was too long and could have ended a lot sooner. I can understand the heroine being conflicted about the pursuing the relationship but to end it just because one relative, not even her mother had problems with it- well Courtney you have no backbone girl! Her parents were happy, her close cousins were happy and her good work colleague was happy for her but still she ended it due to one aunt...As for the guy she went out with for 4 months I doubt any man or women would appreciate playing second fiddle to someone else. Roger took her rejection of him very graciously, considering how long they dated, not sure how realistic that is whether the man is Christian or not- he probably went home and punched the wall.As for Sebastian he is either a saint or something he waited for this girl for 5 years he knew what he wanted from the beginning and hung in there- good for him I suppose that requiresgreat faih and for one so young (they were only 22, 23 years old) that is something. The twist regarding his background I suppose helps us to understand his parents objections especially his father but it was not necessary to have this as part of the plot. All in all an ok read but borrow from the library rather than buy.

Gotta love Nick. Couldn't ask for a more perfect book husband!

$REVIEW.: For what it's worth, the main characters have the type of personality that you either love it or hate it
 In their case, it worked for them so therefore I liked the chemistry between the two

Clearly, they loved each other to put up with each other

 What I didn't like is the immaturity of the characters


 My husband and I can be silly at times and we like to joke around and have fun with each other but some of the stunts these characters play on each other is just very immature especially at the workplace

 That's a big no no
 It's one thing to pull pranks at home or in the company of friends but when you take it to the workplace, you jeopardize reputations and careers
 That's was just too much for me
 They are supposed to be in their mid 30s and hold professional careers but they were irresponsible in many ways


 I like Colleen a little bit
 She was a bitch for the most part and way too moody for my taste but I think Brad made me like her because he loved her so much


 I felt that Brad's personality was more realistic than Colleen's although it shouldn't take 30 years for you to tell someone how you feel


 I kind of felt they did not take marriage or bringing a child into a marriage seriously
 As romance novel, it could've been better as far as the personalites of the characters but I like the chemistry between them
 They seem to know each other better than they know themselves and I like to see that in romance stories.

$REVIEW.: Seventeen year old Ari along with the infected humans have left Earth and are now on Loge. They thought things would be better after all they were almost killed on Earth. However things aren't much better here on Loge. They are becoming slaves trained to attack the enemy which happens to be Earth. Zeus is ready to save his people at any cost. Ari and Jackson must stop him and save two different races. It's hard to do that when you never know who to trust.Ari really comes into her own in this book. She is doing her own thinking and trying to do the right thing. She is in a lot of danger and seems to becoming less human all the time. I really like how she doesn't give up and keeps trying. For all the Jackson lovers out there get ready to lose your heart even more. He is truly one amazing alien and you get to see a whole other side of him that will truly make you understand all he has went through and continues to go through. You also get to see more of Zeus and truly get to see how evil he is.If you enjoyed Gravity you will love Hover. It starts right off where the last book ended and you continue the journey Ari is on. You get to see the new world of Loge and see the beauty of it. You also get to see the evil side of it as well as agendas are revealed and you see what Zeus is really after. You also see things on Earth are changing as Ari and Jackson communicate with Earth to try and help get things sorted out right. Plenty of action in this book as the book is fast paced and something is always going on. I loved seeing more of the characters and getting to watch them grow and seeing what you know they will become. The only downside to this book is the ending. I didn't want it to end and now have the wait till the next one. I have to know what happens next. If your wanting something new to read and different try this series you will love it.

$REVIEW.: Set 60 years before the events in Elegy, The Corpse King finds young apprentice Arbiter D'Arden,along with his mentor Havox, investigating the events at the court of a mad king.This is an excellent introduction to the world of Eisengoth and provides some background into the Arbiters. Here we see D'Arden as a brash youth, far different than the cool, unflappable man he is in Elegy.I loved the atmosphere in Elegy but this short story ratchets it up to 11. The settings have as much weight and importance as the characters themselves, you can almost smell the rot and age of the Corpse King's castle seeping through your Kindle. Kellen is becoming a master of gloom, I love the way he describes his universe. And in Eisengoth nothing is particularly happy and cheerful to say the least lol. This is a dark, almost hopeless world.If you enjoy dark, pulp fantasy do yourself a favor and pick up both this and Elegy, turn down the lights and ignite some sputtering, smokey candles to induce the proper atmosphere and enjoy. This is fantasy that one can picture being read out of a hardbound, mouldering tome by firelight, surrounded by companions with the wind and unknown noises coming from the forest around you.

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was very well written and edited.  The legends of the Apache's were very interesting.I normally read something with mystery included along with the romance, but am very glad that I took a chance on reading this book.It is a story of a divorced mother and her son following a treasure map given to the child by a elder Apache or Ndee.  They return to her home town where she meets up with her high school crush and hires him as a guide for the treasure hunt.  The only other thing I will say about the story is that I wish I could have met a man like Bram when my children were young.Would definitely suggest this book for a nice romance novel.  I enjoyed it because the two main characters knew each other before and it was not a "fall in love at first sight" novel.Will definitely look for other books by this author.

$review_text.: To be honest there is one thing about Elle Casey's books that I almost hate.  But hate is a curse word in my world so I'm not quite there.  . . That one thing is finishing them.  I go through a period of feeling lonely, as though my newest friends just abandoned me.  And By Degrees takes the trophy!I have to proclaim a new favorite in my E. Casey collection. (Spike still being my all time favorite character though)  This one blew me away for a few reasons.  The first because I LOVED all of the characters and their flaws (no surprise because Elle is a master at character development). Secondly because any book filled with rock stars or anything artsy already has a head start.  And the other few reasons because it's relatable.  I wish that the reason it's relatable is because I fell in love with a hot rock star but nope.  Chemical dependency and abuse are heartbreaking.  It thrills me when the light at the end shines bright and real.  I know all too often it doesn't, which this book shows too.  And though the end  might not be everyone's cup of tea, I loved it!  No spoilers here... I just agree with the choices and words spoken at the end.  And if anyone thinks this couldn't happen...hmmm, it has.  Maybe it doesn't play out so nicely, but I've seen it.Scarlet goes through a transformation, honestly I think it's a believable transformation too.  (Grief process is all there:  denial/isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance).  I do understand that there are some heavy issues in this book, which I LOVE because this means Elle has branched out once again!  Obviously there were a lot of things to dislike about Tarin, but I know many addicts and out of control people that I don't like at times but I know I love the real person under all the garbage.  It's unbelievable how different people become when they're lost but Elle shows a perfect example of "forgiveness" and loyalty.  In fact, loyalty is always a main theme in Elle's books.I also love how I am able to disagree with some parts of Elle's books but still know I can respect her and the characters.  There are some choice words and ideas that aren't necessarily ok in my world, but to change them would be changing Elle's work and that wouldn't be right.  I also feel like some will disagree with my review and that's ok.  But since I can sadly relate to some parts of this book, I'm ok with anyone disagreeing.

$review_text.: I checked out "The End of Materialism" from the library and I read it.  I am reading it again.  It changed my attitude about a recurring post-skull-implant-surgery phenomenon -sleep paralysis.  Sleep paralysis happened so often, it used to be terrifying.  However after reading Charles Tart's fine book, I realized that I could use these episodes as a jumping point to have an OBE(out of body experience), or at least a really cool lucid dream.  I regularly listen to Shamanic drumming to alter my consciousness and energize and hang out with my power animal.  I wanted to share my dream journal entry from 4/12/2011, it's pretty neat:4/12/2011My extremities started to tingle and vibrate.  I found I could not move them.  A loud scary buzzing sound.  Felt like my body was rising. Sleep Paralysis.  Again.  But this time I didn't fight, this time I said to myself,"Awesome, hypnogogic consciousness!  My brain is doing it's 'theta-wave mode' thing.  I want an OBE and I want to be lucid!  I am going to try to float to the ceiling.  I am a powerful positive & loving energy vortex generator. This is really great my brain/body is doing this.  I am going to go for 'unusual alpha-wave-OBE mode like I read about in "The End of Materialism" by Charles Tart! I am ready and I am into it!  Bring it on! BRING IT ON!!!!"And I expected to hit the ceiling as I attempted to fly & as they say 'astrally project.'  And then this buzzing white noise got louder.  And then my entire body vibrated and it was scary and I heard this evil man or entity's deep horrible voice.  And then I crossed over.  I do not know what I crossed over but then my consciousness went somewhere else.  I think that I overshot my goal... I don't remember having a body at this point, I seemed to be pure awareness.  I remember hearing the most prettiest Native American music I have ever heard -flutes and chanting and drumming.  Kind of hard to explain as it was mainly a non-physical realm, but it was pitch black like outer space, a fine clear starry night.  There was a gathering & a bonfire, but I don't remember any smoke.  I felt the presence of spirit coyote and spirit raven.  And I was all ears listening to the most beautiful ethereal Native American music just playing.  It lasted for a moment in this realer than real place that was forever.  It was such a nice night with the stars and the fire. and then I returned through the buzz/white noise to reality my bed and body in my room.  I wanted to go back, and I followed the white noise/buzzing freaky loud low sound and I got there again, but only very briefly, then I don't remember anything after this.  Likely deep sleep.I wrote this the following morning.  Right after waking up.  Sleep paralysis is no longer scary.  It is an opportunity and I didn't realize what I could do until I read about Mr. Tart's experiments with Ms. Z and Bill Monroe.I am a former skeptic/materialist who became interested in the paranormal and quantum universes due to recurring spiritual experiences.  I found Science, poisoned by the plague of 'Scientism' dogma, an empty fraud.  Materialism and rational science were unable to explain, comfort, or help me process my experiences in any sort of coherent way.  Except to label me as 'crazy.'  Which I am not, by the way.  So this book was an invaluable tool to break free from judging myself from a Western Rationalist perspective of toxic negativity, labeling, and  invalidation.  Western rationalism & scientism are destroying our planet, our souls, and messing up our psyches!  Everybody should read this book!

$review_text.: Living in the region covered by "Pacific Northwest Trips" gives me the perspective to be aware of what's NOT in the book as well as what is


My take on it is that it is geared toward the young, "we're too hip to do do what all the tourists do" traveler

Nothing wrong with that, but if you want to see all a region has to offer, you probably want an additional guide or two on top of this one
Especially if you're looking for lodging along the way!

$REVIEW.: A mind blowing series of journal entries from the eyes of an innocent little girl surviving a zombie apocalypse...If it weren't fiction it'd be sick. The rawness of the the world Kellie now lives in has certainly decayed the innocence within her, and even within me.I feel as though complaining about any aspect of my life would completely undermines the hell of this world. She has no experience, very little education,almost no people skills, and yet you see her develop between the lines of each entry. I bet half of the future readers wouldn't stand a chance of survivalcompared to Kellie, and yet I don't know if I should feel pride in her. She has suffered more in a few years than we do in 20.A dark and twisted treat awaits you after book 3, as Jenner manages to capture the mind and motives of a detestable figure from Kellie's past, Dr. Crane.The insight provided by the exploration of this character further proves that Kellie has endured much more tragedy and suffering than she is even willing to admit.There is redemption however, found in Sarah's story however brief, as you discover her roots and find out she came to be the guardian of Kellie's sister Lydia.You quickly realize anyone who is alive has endured emotional torture brought on by the sudden catastrophe that takes over the land, and brings about the beginningof the end.Awaiting the next entries in this series patiently, but also secretly raving at the mouth. One can only wonder what horrors await the characters that wehave come care for, and if the world and its people can ever recover from this nightmare.

$REVIEW.: I was REALLY excited when I saw Eliza Brown was publishing Cash's story! I literally squealed like a little  (fan)girl

This is book 3 in her series, so I really recommend starting with Saving Stella & Sloans Surrender

Then you can really appreciate how messed up Cash is
Losing Sloan sends Cash on a bender to top all benders

Thankfully Clair is around and is not willing to watch him self destruct
She hasn't spent the last few years loving him and reading self help books for nothing.Clair is strong, feisty and willing to fight for what she wants


Cash is strong, although a bit hardheaded and oblivious


This story made me laugh, swoon and cry
There are parts that are heartbreaking and others  are blushingly HOT! This is by far my favorite story by Eliza Brown
I can't wait to see how she grows and develops as an author.

$REVIEW.: One of my favorite subjects at school is Math so Easy As Pi was great to read. I really learned a lot of new stuff about numbers and not just in relation to math but also in fiction, culture and religion (the book dedicates a chapter for each of these and all nicely organized) that I heard in passing but don't really know the meaning of. For example, I now know the meaning behind the movie title 8 Mile (it's a road in Detroit that provides a socio-economic divide between rich and the poor of the city). But my favorite part of this book will have to be the "Numbers in Mythology and Religion" section. In particular, I really enjoyed trying out numerology thing. The author explains how numerology is used to make ideas and theorize numbers and he tells how you to assign each letter in the alphabet with the numbers 1-9. Then, you match the letters in your name to the numbers and keep adding them up until you come up with a single digit number. That number's meaning supposedly tells you your personality. I tried this out with my name and I got the number 2 which means "duality, division, cooperation." Hmm... this is true, I guess, because there are times I'm torn between two things and I act in different ways around different sets of people. Anyway, I also really like when the book talks about the different zodiacs--again, zodiacs were something I've heard about but never really understood and now I know more about it!I thought the book was organized well with a table of contents for the different sections and with the page number for each separate topic that falls under the section. Everything was really easy to find and I didn't have to flip pages. There were these cute little illustrations too and I really like that a few were there to provide a nice visual and explain a topic clearer. To sum it up, I really liked this book. It has a lot of interesting information, all explained well (though a couple were a little confusing) and I learned a lot. And though I know this, it all the more made me realize that there are more to numbers than the math we learn in school. This is a book I'm going to come back to once in a while just to flip through and re-read a few of my favorite sections. 4.5 out of 5 starsReviewed by Leslie [We received this book from FSB Media for review.]

Her situation was tragic, but how many times did the author find it necessary to let us know her misery....even while she had a wonderful new husband who would do anything for her. I felt she was unappreciative of what she was given by this man. How is it that she could be with her fiance while he continually beat her, still have an intimate relationship with him, but she can't let someone who truly loves her touch her?Not real believable.

$REVIEW.: Hopeful, lyrical, heartbreaking, healing.  Lisa has once again proven her mastery of faith-integrated fiction in this tale of blooming faith and friendship.I do have one warning.  Early in the book there was a scene I almost didn't finish containing the heartbreak and terror of Rwanda in a very real way.  This scene could definitely be too graphic for some readers.  However, a death always comes before a resurrection.  May's lifechanging experience in Rwanda leads to the death of all she knows and holds dear before she can fully embrace the life-giving of Christ.Healing and forgiveness are often learned in the strangest of places.  For May this means embracing friendship with an imprisoned murderer who has himself embraced Christ as savior.Justice and mercy.  Showing love often leaves us deeply wounded, but even these wounds can be ultimately healing.  Lisa deals with issues of the death penalty in a very balanced way leaving the reader to contemplate questions with no easy answers days after putting the book down.**Thank you to Thomas Nelson for a copy through the Book Sneeze program.  The opinions expressed in this review are my own.**Resurrection in May is a beautiful, lifechanging book that has quickly pulled itself to the top of my Christian fiction reads of 2010 so far.

$REVIEW.: In the middle of the book, Donella outlines the 12 most strategic intervention points within a system
Her number one, most strategic intervention point is in transcending paradigms


That's what this book fosters -- transcending paradigms.Become a meta thinker, look at the systemic whole before becoming entranced and consumed by the minuscule details


If zen could be put into scientific models, I see it taking a form very similar to this book

Systems thinking is a zen level of thinking, beyond our egoic tendencies and habits -- finding where information or resources flow from, end up, what feedback loops are perpetuating or limiting the system

We are ourselves very complex systems, embedded within millions of systems
This book is a wonderful introduction to systems thinking, and will benefit all who pick it up.As a whole-systems designer, this reading has had huge implications on my professional and personal works


Step back, take a deep breath, observe before interpreting, see the system flow

That's HUGE, no matter where you live, work, play, this writing will add new dimensions to your mental models

One may find themselves instead of observing isolated events or objects, seeing the many influences, interconnections and feedback loops that create and give life to observed reality.

$review_text.: This book is supposed to be about how declining birth rates in much of the world will result in population collapse in those countries

The countries surveyed include much of Europe and Japan, but most critically many Muslim countries
However, the issue of declining birth rates is really a framework for Mr
Goldman to present his real argument, which is how horrible Islam and secular societies are and how great the United States and Israel are.Unfortunately, this results in some a book with some strange arguments

Mr
Goldman picks and chooses to make his point

Thus, for example, in one section Mr

Goldman argues that Islam is collectivist while Christianity and Judaism are oriented to the individual
He uses the example of Jewish group prayer, in which each member of the group prays at their own pace, independent of the other people present
This is in contrast with the highly regimented daily Muslim prayer where everybody prays together


Mr


Goldman tellingly omits any mention of Christianity and (for many denominations) its weekly regimented group worship service.Any idea that the book is primarily about the decline of civilizations as opposed to a rant against Islam is dispelled in the chapter entitled "The Crisis of Criticism"


Under the premise of saying that Islam doesn't allow critical scholarship on the Quran, this chapter presents the argument that Muhammad never existed and that early Muslim history is wrong

I find this chapter quite ironic because these claims are "proved" using exactly the same types of argument which are used by other scholars who say that Jesus, Moses, Abraham, etc

never existed and that the history presented in the Bible is fabricated


It is also ironic because his alternate view (that the earliest spread of Islam was migration into Byzantine areas rather than by conquest) is contrary to the normal conservative view that Islam was spread by "convert or die" conquest.I also had problems with some overt factual errors


Mr


Goldman states that Falun Gong is a traditional Chinese religious movement (it dates to the 1950s or 1992 depending on how you define it) and in discussing suicide attacks states that most during the 1983-2000 period were by Muslims (actually, it was the Tamil Tigers)


However, this book is primarily about the author's argument, so facts are sacrificed where necessary.

$review_text.: Action  Adventure  Mystery  and a great story to go with it.  This is one of the better sci-fi examples of how to treat complex concepts in an understandable manner that I have ever read.  Even my wife who is not a big on sci-fi enjoyed the story and the ending (I did not even have to explain the concepts to her).I highly recommend this story and compliment the author for a thought provoking but easily understandable book.  I seldom read books twice but this is one I definitely will just to be sure I did not miss any of the fascinating details!!!

$REVIEW.: If you like the odd, the adventurous, the sci-fi world of magical beings, then this book is for you.~~~~~~Sura takes a job at Frost Plantation.She will meet Mr

Frost, who&#8217;s love of Christmas is obsessive, after all he invented Christmas, didn&#8217;t he?Sura will find the love of her life and the home she has longed for.She will also meet Jack, who is the opposite of Mr
Frost


Jack hates Christmas.~~~~~~A Christmas story so unusual, it makes the Grinch seem like child&#8217;s play.The world building and character descriptions will have your mind working overtime trying to envision them
Tony Bertauski&#8217;s imagination knows no bounds as he takes me on a magical, sci-fi adventure after the downfall of the North Pole.There is a love story, but to me that was just the icing on the cake


Jack is the cake.Elves in South Carolina? Impossible? If you saw a round blue guy, what would you think?I love a &#8220;guy&#8221; that I love to hate and Jack fits that bill to a T.I wanted to laugh and cry with Jack, when I could get over the fact that he was a total a******

I felt bad for him and then I wanted to slap him up side the head


Jack didn&#8217;t have visions of sugar plums, but there were reindeer and a jolly fat man dancing in his head

The sun was so hot, but his memories were of white, fluffy snow and ice cold temperatures
He was not a pleasant &#8220;person&#8221; to be around
All that being said, I have to say that I liked Jack

The things he went through as he came &#8220;alive&#8221; made me root for him, encouraging him to hang in there, things will get better, won&#8217;t they?I was confused for a while, trying to figure out what in the hell happened after all the badness at the North Pole, but as it came together I was even more surprised


This book is darker than Claus, but every bit as entertaining to read.I love a surprise at the end, and Tony left me screaming for more!When Tony says, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather sail a boat than climb a mountain&#8221;, I smiled, nodded my head and said to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m with you Tony.&#8221;I received this book from the author in return for an honest and unbiased review.

$REVIEW.: I read an advance copy of Conclave and was impressed by these four pieces of speculative fiction from New Zealand authors.  Over 90,000 words altogether, they are a mixture of novellas and stories.The first, A Mer-tale by Jan Goldie, is an enchanting story mostly told from the point of view of Thala, a young mermaid living with her uncle and aunt following the disappearance of her parents after an invasion by an alien species, the Sprats, drove the merfolk out of their natural home.  In part, the story is also told from the point of view of Shiv, one of the Sprats, who takes an interest in the merfolk and begins to question the values of his own people.  It's an interesting story about accepting others who are different, and the two main characters, Thala and Shiv, are portrayed well.The second, The Fence by Piper Mejia, is set in a dystopian world ruled by a nameless and faceless Corporation, who extract &#34;volunteers&#34; from a small town.  The story focuses on Doze, a schoolboy with attitude, his two sisters and a few others, who decide to escape from their unpleasant existence.  The setting and dialogue in this story is memorable.The third, Conclave Seven by Lee Murray, is a kind of galactic competition involving solving potentially lethal problems and, akin to the Hunger Games, possibly knocking off some of the competition along the way.  The story follows four unfortunate young humans, all strangers, who, because of their genetic links to an ancient warrior, were selected to compete against several alien species to retain their world's place in the galactic government league table.  It's an entertaining and action-packed story with themes on teamwork and ethics, great writing and dialogue.The fourth, Peach and Araxie by Celine Murray, is set on a generational interstellar ship on which no one recalls their home world and is still twenty years from their destination, if they are still on track at all.  Peach, a young student, is surprised when she gets contacted from offship by Araxie, who befriends her, and she shares her concerns about the voyage with him because her mother is unwilling to discuss them with her.  This is a unique story which I really liked, and I didn't pick the ending at all.

Hopkins wrote this book in multiple points of view and I feel that was the strength in the telling of this story


Getting to read the different perspectives made all the difference to me when reading this book

I enjoyed the mystery which unfolded, along with the bit of romance and glimpse into the Amish lifestyle.After finishing the story I can see there are avenues for Serenity and Daniel to be in other books

I would enjoy reading more about them
One suggestion I have is to have multiple edits with an editor and proofreader

There are frequent errors which almost stopped me from finishing my reading of this book
I'm glad I kept reading until the end, but I would hate for the errors to turn off other readers.

$review_text.: Mehl-Madrona packs several levels of wisdom into this book of theory and stories. If you read it as a traditionally trained medical practitioner it will establish grounds for broadening your view of medicine, to how it can be whole-person healing. If you read it as a nontraditional practitioner it will bring you a well-researched world view, through the author's native American eyes, of how real transformation occurs, and when it does and does not occur. I recommend this to, beyond all practitioners, all people who themselves want to heal.The anecdote about his grandfather hoping to connect to a spirit modern enough to fix a tractor when he prayed to get it going again was itself worth the price of the book (tongue in cheek on the author's part -- some part of what he reports on is his direct observation, though much also is what he has participated in). But the incident is not merely humorous. We all know that more goes on here than meets the eye; Mehl-Madrona sets out to make sense of the underlying ways that what goes on with real healing has its own forms and reality. He has a breadth of understanding and clarity of expression that only a western medical doctor, as he is, and also healer, as he also is, could communicate. He gradually builds the reader's gestalt of comprehension toward a depth few people can hold, let alone describe, as he does here. A book to read and reread, for his words and for what comes across between them.

$REVIEW.: A middle age woman preparing to die from cancer reminisces on her adventure as a 22 year old, when she had an affair with a married man during a summer trip to Mexico


The story is told in segments alternating from the present to the past as Frances (Frankie) ruminates about the affair her husband Phillip is having with a coworker as she harkens back to her Mexican adventure when her affair with Mason enraptured her but was one in a series for Mason who told her not to think about it


But the affair leads to the death of Patsy, who overdoses on pills when it impedes her own affair with Mason and prompts Frankie to implicate herself years later in Patsy's death


How it impacts her own death from cancer is the startling conclusion to this intriguing novel.

$review_text.: I rated this book a five-star.  Sure, the editing is wanting and even at $2.99, others would, and have in reviews, taken the view that the editing should be done before a book is foisted upon the readership.  I am rating the writing  and the author who I believe has a great future as a writer (though I note that he already has several books published - on several topic areas).  In any event, the writing in this book is tight, moves along at a good clip  and caveat the author's possible bias against the incumbent US president, is factual and he handles both operational descriptions in the theatre of operations and the domestic political scene in the variuos nations he describes equally well.  I have become an instant fan of this fellow and ordered the next two in the trilogy within minutes of finishing this book.I am not easily impressed by future war scenarios nor am I a neophyte to the field of future war.  I am a retired military intelligence officer after forty years which included the combat arms (infantry)and hold a masters degree in War Studies specializing in strategic sceanarios.  But this is not about me.  It is about this book and I was impressed.  Get it.

$review_text.: The Shadow Reader had everything I love in a fae book
Seriously, I have a special place in my heart for fae characters
Ahem, Ash and Puck


*Wink, wink* It had action, hot Fae guys, adventure, romance, hot Fae guys, court intrigue, witty dialogue, and epicly cool fight scenes


Oh, and did I mention the HOT FAE GUYS?!Excuse me while I fangirl.McKenzie Lewis is a special human

She can see the Fae and read their shadows

This ability makes her a very important ally in the war raging between the Court and Rebels because she can tell where the Fae are teleporting to


Just think of her as one hell of a blood hound and you get the picture
For years she has helped the Court track down and kill Rebels, until one day she is kidnapped by a rebel leader named Aren, who henceforth in this review shall be known as: "Le Hottie." While in captivity, she discovers the war she once considered black and white, just gained a whole lot more colors in between


As a result, she starts second guessing her alliance with the Court and her awkward relationship with the King's sword-master, Kyol, "Le Steamy".First off, this is a really awesome debut novel for Sandy Williams

The Shadow Reader grabbed me from page one and held me in a choke hold that would make "Stone Cold" Steve Austin proud


And considering the last two books I've read had me in a "two-star" reviewing slump, I was extremely grateful for a fun read
That's not to say this book is without its flaws

Oh, no


Lol

But, there is just something about it that makes me a lot more forgiving

The Shadow Reader is like a toddler just finishing up a cherry Popsicle on a hot summer day

She's a little messy with sticky fingers, but she's just so darn cute you want to hug her anyway


And that's exactly how I felt about this book


Even though McKenzie did irritate me at times and the romance was toeing the "insta-love" line, I couldn't help but really enjoy reading this book.The Plot:Two words: Action packed


I don't even think this book had "down time." It was just back to back revelations, fight scenes, sexual tension


You know, all those things to keep you on the edge of your seat

This was a solid plot with pretty good world building


I easily got a feel for the Fae's world, but the only thing I would have liked to see was a freakin' map! McKenzie's ability to track the Fae's shadows is reliant upon her knowing where the locations actually are


I would have liked to have been able to see where these places were myself on a map
There is a lot of traveling done in the book between "fissuring" (think: teleporting) in and out of the human world or between the providences of the Fae world


So, yeah, it would have been nice to be able to flip to the map and see exactly where they were.McKenzie's goal in the first half is to escape Le Hottie (Aren) and his Rebels and return to Le Steamy (Kyol) and the Court
She firmly believes they are evil and remains loyal to the Court

But, she never expects to fall for her captor and grow sympathetic to the Rebels cause
When she finally does return to her sword-master, she finds that her loyalties no longer lie with the Court.The Characters:Le Hottie (Aren), McKenzie, and Le Steamy (Kyol) were smart, sassy and classy respectively
I usually don't like love triangles, but this is one of those rare occasions where an author tells me to, "Shut it, Stephanie and read the darn book
You will like it!" And lil' old skeptical me goes: Hmm...We'll see about that Ms


Williams.Well, here I am eating my words because I loved this love triangle
If I were McKenzie, who would I chose? Le Hottie or Le Steamy? Jeez, I don't know! They were both awesome guys! Aren's the cocky son of a biscuit eater that has you wanting to smack that ridiculous grin off his face and kiss him at the same time

While on the other hand, Kyol is the mysterious silent type that will keep you up all night trying to puzzle out the secrets hidden in his eyes

(AHHHH! Hot Fae guys! I.CAN'T.EVEN!)Of course, we have our heroine McKenzie
I won't deny that there were times when she really irritated me because I thought she just couldn't see the bigger picture of the war and how the Court treated her all those years

The Court specifically didn't want her learning the language of the Fae and she not once thought that was strange


And one of the first things Aren does once she is kidnapped is have her taught the language


This should have been a gigantic red flag to McKenzie, but she remains loyal to the Court until it nearly very dearly costs her

But, she's supposed to be a stubborn heroine


I get that
I just wish she was a little more observant


However, she is a strong-willed heroine because she never does give up trying to escape her captives

I have to give her props for that

Even when she knows her attempts are in vain, she continues again and again


I have to admit, though, I did wish she didn't need quite so many rescuing from our hot Fae guys
In fact, why does she even have a sword on the cover? I kept waiting for her to kick someone's ass in the book, but it never happened
No matter
That wasn't enough to stop me from enjoying the book at all.The Romance:Ah, here is where the gushing review dies a painful death


Oh, insta-love, how I hate thee!! You manage to ruin it for me every time! When will you leave the awesome stories and their characters alone?! *Evil fist shake*First of all, I want to say I loved Aren and McKenzie together
They had great chemistry, but for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why they liked each other
Apart from the little zings of electricity shooting from each other, I don't understand why they were in love

It's your typical, "Oh he's hot, but he's the bad guy and I'm not supposed to notice that

Oh my damn, I can't look away!" As for Aren, I didn't even realized he really liked her until he kissed her and by then I'm like, "Wait, you actually like her? You were for real?" Then, by the end he's telling her he loves her
-_- Case and point, I found there attraction rushed and underdeveloped.McKenzie and Kyol's relationship was a bit more believable because they had been working together for ten years compared to her brief few weeks acquaintance with Aren
The King had forbid Kyol and McKenzie from being together and despite their intense feelings for one another, Kyol tries his best to keep their relationship strictly business
McKenzie waits for him for ten years

Ten years


But when she returns from captivity he realizes this has been a mistake

By that time, he has kept so much from her (and Aren has laid a claim on her heart) that it damages their relationship
I really applaud McKenzie for standing up for herself and telling Kyol that she shouldn't have waited for him and that she was moving on


But, something tells me that his hold on her heart has not yet loosened its grip...Overall, I really enjoyed reading The Shadow Reader and can see this appealing to fans of Richelle Mead


This book falls somewhere in the 3.5-4 star category for me, but what they hell, I'm rounding up to 4 for the special unputdownable quality.More of my reviews and other random things at my blog [...]

$review_text.: Sixth book in the series for the author but first one for me.  The best thing I can say about the &#34;Popping the Shine&#34; that's I got it for free. Usually, if I like a free book, I will buy the rest of the series.  &#34;Popping the Shine&#34; left me 'wanting no more'.Story is told by Jay Leicester in the first person. An aviation consultant who, as a favour, investigates  brutal murder of a friend's grandson. International cartel, local police and CIA also involved. Sounds promising isn't it?First person narration left me with a little or no insight in to characters. Jay's relentless descriptions of everything and everyone stopped me from emotionally connecting and caring. There is so much of - weather (good for flying or not), wines, cigars, food, restaurants, people's appearance and aviation - one can take in a mystery book! Reading about Jay's investigation was like reading a slightly less formal police report. Seems to me, he was more interested in uncovering who Shine's hospital visitor/guard is.Story about a small insignificant players in a big game, but the big game and the big players (cartel, CIA and all the excitement that comes with them) are just hint it on!Style of mystery writing that is just not to my taste.

 Without some access to credit they have absolutely no chance to ever get out of the revolving situation that will absorb then and their children

 It's a vicious cycle of poverty that will be perpetuated unless they are given a chance to break it

 And they all want to break it

 Not for themselves, but for their future generations, which will incrementally improve their situation.

$REVIEW.: Due to the historical nature of this novel I wasn't quite sure what to expect but the author found away to weave history and fiction together perfectly


I was drawn in to the love Aleron had for Mynea and the affection she showed him until her disappearance
With Mynea gone in walks Pandora and this is where the real story begins


Not only does Aleron find out he's not the only male but his mere making was forbidden.Aleron is full of action and romance without being overdone


It was amazing to see how everyone story came together and all pointed back to Vlad


I'd highly recommend this book to others and can't wait for the next in the series.

$review_text.: The Hidden series as a whole is great but I've been dying for Tony and Chris's story ever since meeting the characters in Hidden Crimes. Hidden Passions did not disappoint. I was drawn in from the first page and was in love before they were.Hidden Passions sizzles and sparks as these two men realize nothing they do could keep them from loving each other.There are five Hidden stories. They can all be read out of order, mostly without spoilers, except the last two. Hidden Dragons runs parallel to Hidden Passions and has a much broader plot, chalk full of mystery and intrigue. This is all in the back ground of Hidden Passions. So if you don't like spoilers or the mystery to be ruined, make sure to read m/f Hidden Dragons first.Absolutely loved it!

$REVIEW.: I was pretty blown away by this story


It was full of twists and turns that I never saw coming


Plus, it had a steamy, romantic side infused into the pages which made me cheer the main couple on


Karen and Joel seemed like the average couple who fell in love because they lived in the same area around a Lake in Michigan
In the dead of winter, these two&#8217;s passion becomes entangled with something insidious lurking in Joel&#8217;s house


Karen tries to uncover the mystery, and ends up neck deep in a mystery that spans lifetimes where a cold blooded killer with brilliant green eyes become set on her demise

Scary, right?The first part of the book took me a bit to get into, I admit

It was a nice romantic set up and seemed pretty normal
The horror aspect of it builds up gradually with scenes that flash some foreboding stuff


Once it took off like a freight train with no brakes, I could not put it down


It was fast paced, awesome, very detailed and the story telling was immaculate

When the backstory comes into play, full of lore and legend, it gripped onto me and never let go


Gave me the creeps!I really loved the main character Karen, even if she was a bit off-putting, but her boyfriend Joel annoyed me to death because he did some pretty bad stuff, even if you factor in the evil bound to him


I felt sorry for Karen, the stuff that she goes through for him made me want to slap the crap out of Joel for many, many reasons


If that&#8217;d been me, I&#8217;d never go back to him

The many twists and back story it had kept me glued to the pages, wanting more and more.I highly recommend reading this if you&#8217;re into graphic horror, scary stories, romantic suspense and/or murder mystery.


$SUMMARY.: Absolutely Stunning storytelling


Really Creepy and full of terror.

$REVIEW.: I got this book from the author, free of cost, in exchange of an honest review from my side.Firstly I would like to thank Marjorie DeLuca, author of The Forever Ones, for giving me this opportunity of reading and reviewing this book.In this book we meet the forever ones who have been genetically altered to remain youthful and immortal and are kept within the guarded Iduna Corp compound. They have an easy life and get to do whatever they want and be as they like but the truth is not so simple and luxurious. There are grave secrets that are about to surface and throw the life of the forever ones in to chaos. Paige, a forever one steps in this matter and with the help of her friend/boyfriend Junius and Chale, towards who she feels an undeniable attraction, will try to solve the mystery. But what if you don't know what's lurking outside? Will you still step outside? Whom to trust? Whom to suspect? Are you lifelong beliefs just a well framed lie?I really loved this story and liked the whole concept of the forever ones. Where there is a love triangle you'll find me digging in it and I got that excitement here, maybe because I'm confused about guy issues too in my own life and I bet that most of you are as well. Well, the plot is well planned out and I liked Paige a lot, she is confident and kick-ass and has guy issues (Lol)! I liked Chale more, what about you, girls? The writing style of the author was new to me but I got accustomed quite well. It's fast-paced and has some serious actions. The mystery element is breath-taking and the grave secrets are really eerie and made me anxious to know them. If you want to have a blast then go for this book guys, you'll like it, I bet!

$review_text.: Laura Dunaway's first book "Distorted" is about a girl, Aly Chase, stuck between two guys, who love her and she has to decide, which one she wants to have a relationship with.  She has the sexy, hot CEO of Pierce Homes that she has worked for three years now, Paul Pierce.  He has had a steady girlfriend for those three years and she has been forced to watch him around his girlfriend.  She knows that Paul has never shown any interest to her until something changes between the two.  She has no idea what to think of it.  All she knows is that Paul has a girlfriend and that girlfriend already suspects that Aly may be a problem.  Aly has helped Paul with several of the projects for his company and she definitely is passionate about her job.  She also has her best friend since college, Ethan, who works at Pierce Homes as well that has feelings for Aly since the minute he saw her at the bar those years ago.Aly knew that Ethan had feelings for her, but never thought of him in that way until something happens between her and her boss and she has a new view of her best friend.  Ethan has always been there for her through everything.  She just never realized until now she may have always had feelings for him.Laura Dunaway gives you a love triangle where you fall for both of the guys.  Unfortunately, I lost my interest in Paul due to one incident he put Aly through.  I could not forgive him and neither could Aly.  She was definitely confused between Paul and Ethan and I definitely could not blame her.I loved both of the guys...but Ethan stole my heart the minute he was introduced.  He had been with her since day one.  He even kept trying to state his feelings for her forever.  Aly was just too hung up on her boss.Paul definitely had my heart the beginning when he was introduced until his girlfriend gave Aly grief every time she was around.  Poor Aly...I would have decked Paul's girlfriend, Casey.I loved this book, although there were parts I did not like, but it was due to what Paul did to Aly and how Aly kept having her emotions get to her.  She could not make up her mind between Paul and Ethan.  The whole time...I was rooting for her hook her up with her best friend, Ethan.  Seriously...why would she even consider Paul for what he did to her.  I would have kicked him to the curb a long time ago.Laura did an amazing job on her first book and I look forward to what she has in store next.  I need to know what happens to a certain character.  Laura definitely made me cry several times and want to throw my iPad across the room, but she did have me crying happy tears as well towards the end.If you are a fan of contemporary romance and love triangles, you will definitely want to read Laura's debut novel, Distorted.I give this book 4.5 moons and highly recommend it.  Just be warned...your emotions will be going through a lot in this book and you may love Paul, or Ethan...or maybe even both.  You may even want to slap around Aly sometimes.  (just saying)I received a complimentary copy of the book for the blog tour in exchange for an honest review.  This review is my own opinion and I was not compensated for it.

$REVIEW.: In some ways, this lovely book is depressing
 There are so many wonderful places in the world featured here, that when I think about how few I'm actually going to see, it's kind of a bummer
 But that is far outweighed by the gorgeous photos...of places I've been (and being reminded how lucky I've been to see them) and places I TRULY hope to see.There are scads of places around the world featured here, and each location gets 4 pages (and about 6 photos)


 Of necessity, this means the information is VERY skin-deep

 This book is not a travel guide (and it's coffee table book size, so you'll never take it on trips anyway)...it is a photo book that serves to show the wonderful places our world has to offer and to perhaps help inspire you to visit places you might not have thought of.The United States IS featured, but no more heavily than the rest of the planet


 That's perfectly fine with me
 The photos are lovely
 The information provided is helpful (not comprehensive, of course...but helpful).A minor gripe is that the book is organized into chapters and the chapter titles don't really tell you WHERE in the world is being covered
 The book is organized by "mood" rather than geographically...so it's a little tough to know where to start
 But this also compels you to browse...to flip through
 And that's actually nice, too, because behind every corner (or on every page) there are little surprises


 The photos are almost never of the cliched places you always see in photos (for example, the section on Rome doesn't feature the typical shot of the Coliseum or St
Peter's...it shows the lovely Tiber River at nighttime).So, as long as you understand the info isn't in depth...this is a very nice book for the person who enjoys travelling but must sometimes do it vicariously
 I will certainly be flipping through it many times.

$REVIEW.: You cant help but fall in love with these main characters! Jo is headstrong and confident, and has the wits to challenge any man. Flynn Ito is a half-blood man, used to being on the fringe of society...at least, the society of out-of-the-way ranchers. Being half Japanese has made him hard and distant from letting women get too close. He has had to prove his worth and defend his name and honor too many times to be fooled with. He is not a man to cross or get on his bad side. But in the brothels, Flynn is truly wanted. Jo has the misfortune of being in his way one evening. When their paths cross, it is instant fire! This is not your typical steamy romance. Jo goes after Flynn and tells him like it is. She becomes a captive, and when Flynn rescues her, it is such a realistic scenario, again not typical. Not your typical weepy-eyed, helpless female. She proves she is strong on so many levels.Those two were just meant for each other!

$REVIEW.: Jeffrey Butz writes that understanding James, the brother of Jesus, is the *most* important key to understanding Jesus. *And* the mainstream Protestant view of Jesus has gone in the wrong direction because of the primary assumption that Martin Luther correctly read his experiences back into Paul's epistles. Did the Catholicism of Luther's day teach the equivalent of the Judaism of Paul's day? Butz argues that early Protestant reformers did indeed misunderstand the Judaism of the time of Jesus. So Butz argues that to truly understand the Judaism of the time of Jesus is to understand the way it was understood by James, the brother of Jesus.

$review_text.: Find You in the Dark is not your average teen love story. The protagonist Maggie had always been a good girl,that is until she runs into Clay, the new kid in school. Clay is incredibly hot, mysterious, and downright unfriendly. Maggie is instantly attracted to him, and of course a hot romance begins to build slowly. This is where this YA novel takes a different turn. Clay has a dark past, and seems to have serious control issues. It turns out he is bipolar, and stops taking his meds. By the time Maggie realizes she is hopelessly in love with him, she realizes that his issues are really serious. He has a violent temper, and cuts himself.  I like how realistic this novel portrays bipolar disorder. Maggie goes from being the perfect daughter, to one who will lie in a minute to her parents and friends for Clay. Clay's unhealthy hold on Maggie does not help matters either. I felt bad for both characters, especially Clay who tries so hard to control his behavior but just cannot come to grips tht he has to stay on his meds, not stoping when he starts to feel better.I I finished the novel on one sitting. I don't want to totally give the plot away, but just know this novel will upset you long after you finish it. There is no happy ending, but there will be a book two. I can't help but root for these characters to somehow end up together.

$review_text.: The book includes 67 essays, some of which are published for the first time in this collection. The variety of topics covered is diverse and delightful.There's something astounding about a volume that can contain a playful exposition about chasing your hat (and why it's fun and comical) and a serious discussion of why we need to understand philosophy.I've heard Chesterton called a prophet, and reading a few of these essays made me understand why. He wrote a century ago, but his writing is relevant, real, and radical to us in the here-and-now.This was one of my favorite recent reads. It's also a book that you would do well to put by your armchair and pick up every so often. You're sure to be amused and challenged in equal proportion and in ways that will surprise you.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I have to admit that Pat Hat has quickly become a favorite for my kids, the bouncy, rhythmic storytelling and the vibrant illustrations just grab their attention and keeps it from start to finish. So, when the kids wanted to get another book they chose &#34;Catality: Saving Your Reality&#34; and had a fun time reading it. Catality is an adorably memorable superhero that saves not cities or planets, but whole realities and manages to find himself caught in the web of evil mutt Striple when the villain tries to put Catality's superheroing to an end. The well-written and bouncy story is full of adventure and action as the superhero evades Striple and his gang of thugs and their dastardly plan. Overall, this is a cute and engaging children's story that will entertain kids and parents alike.

It was just as interesting to learn that a larger percentage of them didn't actually eat meat, and you could tell the difference between them just by the size of their heads! My kids thought that the T-Rex was the scariest looking one out of the lot. While, the one with the long neck was really unusual. Hard to imagine them being related to birds. All in all, nice pictures & a very educational read.

$review_text.: "The Death of WCW" is one of the funniest and most informative books I've ever read

My jaw was on the floor reading about the insanity run amok and laughing aplenty

After I finished I thought about who was primarily to blame for the destruction of the organization

I've read other reviews adding their two cents worth but here is my opinion


The guilty parties are, in order:1.Ted Turner2.Hulk Hogan3.Eric BischoffAs I was reading the book I kept asking myself: "Where was Ted Turner through all of this?" He was Time Warner's czar and was wrestling's biggest booster

It was essentially his baby


I don't know how much Teddy knows about wrestling but after carrying the NWA for all those years you'd think he would know what a good wrestling show should've looked like
When it became apparent the show was really going south he should have stepped in and tightened the reigns a bit on Mr


Bischoff and not let him and everone else run riot

It was his responsibility step in and restore order.Eric Bischoff comes in third because he was really the new kid on the block


He is an example of the saying "too much too soon." While he brought fresh ideas and energy, he misidentified the foundation (i.e
wrestlers) of the company
They were Flair, Sting, Arn Anderson, Luger, etc

The workers who had been there all along and who, most importantly, brought with them a built in fan base to kickstart the new WCW brand


Instead, they were completely taken for granted


The stars Bischoff brought in:Hogan, Savage, Hall & Nash, Hart and other former WWFers, were important to the "invasion" angle but they were not the ones hardcore fans really identified with


Indeed, it was the fans who started booing "Hulkamania" Hulk Hogan that set the stage for Hogan's turn to heel

When the WCW/NWO rivalry was established it should have been clear to Bischoff where fans' loyalty were and try to build around it

Instead he tried to manipulate their emotions trying force them to cheer or jeer who HE wanted.He had a shallow understanding of the wrestling world and should have consulted someone whom he trusted to clue him in.Which brings us to Hulk Hogan.It could be argued that Hogan had as much power as Bischoff

He had total control over his own character thanks to the clause in his contract and you can bet he was whispering in Bischoff's ear influencing his decisions
He knew the focus of the entire company was centered around him but because his ego was constantly stroked, he lost sight of the fact that matches work better when the combatants cooperate and make each other look good
Hogan already had been through all this in the WWF so he was no stranger to how it all worked

It was his judgment and input that helped shape events in WCW

He was in an excellent position to help keep WCW on top even if he wasn't in charge of the talent
Hogan WAS the talent and decided which talent to work with
That is why he places second over Bischoff.Please don't talk to me about Jamie Kellner being the one most responsible

He may have done the deed but the decision was made incredibly easy for him


Anyone with no knowledge of the industry would have looked at the situation at face value and made the same decision


Had the true guilty parties kept WCW intact it would have been much harder for Kellner to pull the plug


No one wants to explain why they canceled an historic moneymaker that would have had the legs to sustain Time Warner for years to come
Even the authors of the this book acknowledge this fact
But theirs was a knee jerk conclusion stated out of the indignanty that someone actually had the balls to do it

It shouldn't have been surprising that Vince McMahon delivered the final blow to the careers of WCWers in the manner he did

He is all ego even to the detriment of his company

His actions prove he will always put himself before his business

Just as everyone in WCW did.

$review_text.: Firstly Id like to acknowledge the beautiful cover.


Its definitely drool worthy..I may or may not have stared at the cover for 10 minutes..Alright the summary for Hidden Wings drew me in.

It slightly reminded me of Gayle Formans If i stay a book i greatly enjoyed.

So a car crash leaves Emma Wise all alone.


Her parents are dead, she had no siblings.
and no other family to speak off.

Okay so the car crash leaving her alone is basically where the similarities end.

between Hidden Wings and IF I stay.
Emma is claimed by her mothers half sister.

a half sister Emma was unaware existed.


An aunt to lives in Alaska.
causing Emma to leave Sunny California for Cold and Dark Alaska.
Now on a personal note.
Ive lived in California for a few months a few years ago and i hated it hate hate hated it.
Id take Alaska in a heartbeat! Im a cold weather kind of girl.

I appreciate the need for Owl Snuggies and a book on all those cold and inspiring days and nights.

Emma however doesnt seem to be a cold weather girl.
Dont you just love how off topic i get..Emma&#8217;s Aunt Alaine is widowed and pretty well off.


Well off enough to send a couple of chaperons to pick Emma up from California and travel with her to Alaska.


One such chaperon is quite handsome Kade, Emma is immediately drawn to Kade.
She can even sense his presence before hes in the room.
He relaxes her when she needs it.
electrifies her when they touch.
and puts her to sleep when she needs it..Traveling to Alaska just got a whole lot more enjoyable with Kade at her side.
Although she is noticing some strange occurences.


And kade cant/wont answer her questions even after a freaky incident in the bathroom of the Alaska airport&#8230; He keeps referring her to her aunt.


And assures her she will be safe with her aunt.


but safe from what?! AHH..The struggles between good and evil&#8230; Fallen Angels.
Nephilim.
and Darklings.


Now i will say i was a little slightly mislead but i think it couldve been totally my fault.

As the question was posted on the cover.

What happens when darkness and light collide.

when i first started reading i thought okay cool shes obviously the light and will fall for the darkness.


Yeah.


thats not what happen..Hidden Wings is action packed.


seriously Emmas first few days after the accident are a whirlwind.


I was captivated by Renaes storytelling..I couldnt function in society properly while reading this book.


Life kept calling me away and all i could think of is DAMMIT I WANNA FINISH MY BOOK! and when i was done.

i felt satisfied.
especially because i had a late night twitter convo with Renae and learned shes working on book 2! So im one happy camper.

and i LOVED that the book definitely backed up this beautiful cover..I won this book in a contest HEY HEY!

$review_text.: Coincidence or fate, well, whatever the explanation might be...what is a problem with a humorous twist turns into something so much more for a pair of werewolf shifter brothers.It seems that there are poachers in the national forest because one minute Cliff MacDougal is trotting through the woods on four legs and the next thing you know he's locked up in the nearby zoo. To add to the humiliation his brother Rainy is standing on the other side of the bars, on two legs trying not to laugh. The only good thing about the entire incident is that both brothers have discovered their mates at the zoo, worker Lisa Carlyle and her brother Travis, the zoo veterinarian.Rainy's got one big problem with wooing Travis that his brother doesn't have when he figures out that Travis is so far back in the closet the door's never been opened. Since werewolves only get one mate their entire life there's no way Rainy will give up on Travis. So even though he's dying to sink his teeth and mark his mate Rainy has to be patient and grind his canines until Travis is willing to take a chance and be the gay man he's meant to be.There's plenty of warmth, passion, and excitement in this sexy page turner titled Werewolf at the Zoo. A strong cast of characters with two intertwining romances though Travis and Rainy's love story is the focus here. Tender lovemaking and hot, steamy sex are equally intense as Travis and Rainy explore their feelings for each other. Werewolf at the Zoo is an engaging escape tale with a promising and primal start to an intriguing new series.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

Even if the story is only in Jared's point of view, Matt is sort of transparent, even if he's in a state of self-denial. His actions, his little signs of affection, spoke louder than words. Usually when I read about a character who is so hesitant, I find him annoying, but it is Matt that tries to overcome his own confusion reaching out to his best friend.The motor of the relationship between Matt and Jared is not lust, it's love and friendship and reading how it evolves, the way it gets more physical and tender, was riveting. It's a slow building, so different from the sudden and immediate I-love-yous some protagonists exchange after having met for two hours! The arc of the book spans a whole year of their life, during which both Matt and Jared have to overcome their fears and to face problems with co-workers, family and the community they live in.There's just one thing I didn't like: Matt's reaction to what happens to Cherie, it made him appear a little insensitive.It's a great story, one I wanted to re-read right away after I finished it.

$REVIEW.: When I saw this book on the LibraryThing giveaway, I thought, hmm..


this looks interesting
And well, I need non-fiction
But this short book, consisting mostly of real-life accounts of victims of sexual abuse, makes a very big impact.While I'm not the intended audience of the book, as it's a book aimed at the sexually abused, it reminded me of not gossiping

More than one account mentioned how they didn't want people to know, and how they felt that people were talking behind their back

I think, if I ever find out that someone I know undergoes something so terrible, I should remember not to gossip, but rather, support them.The book is divided into three sections: stories from victims of child sexual abuse, questions and answers about child sexual abuse amd choosing a professional counselor
To me, the most interesting sections were the first two, and I glossed over the last section.This book is taken from a longer work, but is standalone


I think that we should be aware of such things, even though I myself would rather not know about such realities
But since it exists, we cannot be ostriches

I suggest that if you do not want to read a long work about sexual abuse, you should at least read this book.Disclaimer: I got this book free from the LibraryThing giveaway in exchange for my free and honest review.(First published at [...]l)

$REVIEW.: This book seems to be aimed at the "beginning to early intermediate" chess player. After you have learned the moves, some basic checkmate patterns (a good book for learning those is Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess) and the main tactical motifs (for instance from Ward Farnsworth's excellent Predator at the Chessboard books), Yasser Seirawan's Winning Chess Strategies would make an excellent choice as your third or fourth chess book. (Alternatively, you could just work through the previous 2 books by Seirawan in this series, Play Winning Chess and Winning Chess Tactics.)The writing style is very didactic, which evidently annoyed an earlier reviewer who said that the book "seems to be written for children". I don't agree with that assessment. For the book's intended audience, a simple and lucid writing style is called for. The one aspect of the prose that I myself found slightly distracting, is the excessive references to "eating" your opponent's pieces, e.g.: "there is nothing I like more than devouring my opponent's pieces and pawns", "once you have consolidated your position, seek out new goodies to devour", "these hungry pigs [a pair of rooks on the 7th rank] will eat everything they can get their snouts on". You almost start to wonder if the author has a "phago fetish"! A good editor would probably suggest a re-writing of some of these paragraphs. But this is in any case a very slight detraction from an otherwise excellent book.

$review_text.: Julie Chrystyn really hit the nail on the head with The Secret to Life Transformation. Not only does she tell you what you can do write to create your own life transformation, but she also makes you take a hard look at what you can be doing wrong to sabotage yourself.My only complaint is the all the success stories included as separate chapters interspersed the book. The success stories were great, but I found myself getting confused as to who is writing and getting frustrated losing the trail of Julie's thoughts. Since I'm not a fast reader and having to stop reading many times as life interrupts, I tripped up many times.All that aside, when I re-read this book, I'm going to read all that Julie has to say first then read the success stories afterward. I loved what she had to say. I truly want to grasp all of Julie's concepts as a whole and let it sink into my psyche so I can implement what I need to do for my own life transformation.The Secret to Life Transformation is chock full of good life transforming advice starting from the inside out. No magic solutions or woo-woo advice. Just solid, heart-to-heart real and practical advice to help you take your first realistically driven steps to a transformed life.

$review_text.: I absolutely LOVE this book.  I wish I had it in print!  This story is well-written, captured my imagination and is full of adventure, danger, magic and friendship.  I highly recommend this to middle grade readers who love adventure and mystery that keeps the reader guessing til the very end.  With intriguing twists and turns this story of friendship, determination and personal growth will capture the imagination of even the most skeptical reader.The characters are well-developed. The strained relationship between Sarah and her mother is realistic, and explains the reasons for her constant fantasizing well.  Her desire to escape leads to her ultimate adventure and her learning some valuable lessons along the way.  The emotional roller coaster that Sarah and her new-found friends experience kept my interest from start to finish. I can't wait to see what the author comes up with next.  Hopefully there will be another adventure in Greystone Valley for Sarah real soon.*I received a free ebook copy from the author for this review.  all reviews are my personal opinion -see my blog for more info momloves2read(dot)com

$REVIEW.: I was amazed to start reading about an area I know well--the Sacramento River Delta--adding a funky houseboat was even better (not enough about the sounds of the Delta at night and the smell of the river--so what--she did a great job of re-creating the whole area.)  It was fun and romantic--the tension is spun out at just the right pace and the characters are wonderful.  The whole thing about the frogs was a nice counterpoint to Patrick's ADHD and gradual development into a true prince, with a lot of encouragement from Whiskey (the man, not the drink.)  So what if it was a tad melodramatic!  Who cares about age differences?!  It works!  Patrick and Whiskey are perfect for each other and Fly Bait was the perfect "fairy" godmother (sorry) for the situation.Others have written in-depth reviews, so I won't go there, but how the sheer writing talent and storytelling ability of Amy Lane has escaped me for so long is just another grain of sand in the Sahara of the Unexplainable.  This was such a fun read; I'm with the reviewer who reads it over again (I do that also with Caught Running by Abigail Roux) and will probably do the same with this one.  In my book she's up there with Josh Lanyon, A. Roux, Madeleine Urban, Harper Fox, Jordan Castillo Price, Marie Sexton, maybe even Ben Monopoli and a few others I can't think of right now.  Bravo, Amy, Bravo!

How do you face them and then dominate them? He just wants to stay on his island away from the pain. Who wants to dredge those feelings up? Not him! Of course, there are all types of directives that are just plain mean coming across the text messages. And of course, they come at the most inopportune times. Because of these directives, attitudes erupt, feelings are hurt, and emotions run rampant! Lucian and Tara are trying their best just to hold on and keep things together while the stress is going up, up, up! How this chapter unfolds is astounding! Unfortunately, after an error in judgement, our team is faced with a penalty. My oh my! The next book will deal with that situation as Dom Wars continues!! I can't wait!

$REVIEW.: This 10-15 minute read is a lovely story of loss and hope. Three people who have lost loved ones in the past two years meet at the cemetery through the actions of Mary Elizabeth. Mary Elizabeth is a bit of a mystery - she's the self-appointed caretaker, making sure there are flowers at graves, flags on veteran's day, etc. Will they be able to let go of their sorrow and move on? A bit predictable, but still satisfying.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Kindle version of Sugar Daddy - A Dark Thriller, by Jeff Menapace, through Amazon after seeing the author post to Kindle Boards.Overall: 5 stars.Plot/Storyline: 5 stars.  I was pulled in from the description, which made me purchase it, to the actual execution of the story. There was a lot of suspense here and I had a strong desire to read on and find out what was going to happen next.  I felt like I was in the hands of an expert writer who knew his genre. There was all the built-in dread that I could hope for.A portion of the story is told from the point of view of an author who was a part of these events and who is looking back at it at a distance of twenty years, telling it to an audience as if it's fiction. The events he remembers are current, with mentions of Red Bull and Vodka and the Jodie Foster movie Panic Room as a movie that is not too far in the past for them. Since the author is looking back on this twenty years from now, it's good to know that writers will still be of interest and in demand. This is a promise, right?Characters: 5 Well-drawn recognizable characters here. The guy who dreams of better things, and who looks at his friends with a barely concealed sense of superiority, the opportunist with questionable morals and get-rich-quick schemes who is destined to fail, the long-time customers of a bar, drinking their drinks and measuring their lives by empty beer bottles and puffs of cigarettes. I felt like I not only knew these types, but also these particular people.Writing Style: 5 stars. The descriptions and dialogue were so well done that I felt like I was there, a part of the author's world, unable to look away.  I was enthusiastic from blurb, and it was great that the actual writing allowed the interesting story to be brought to life and handled expertly.I had a really interactive experience due to the writing. I wondered what was going to happen. I tried to figure it out. I looked at certain lines and wondered if they were foreshadowing or contained clues. Sometimes I could tell something was a clue and that I tried to decipher the clue. All the time Mr. Menapace doled out just enough to keep me eagerly reading.Mr. Menapace also wrote this with a great awareness and a sly sense of humor. He switched between first person and third person and I thought, "oh, that's a risky thing to do," later in the story his author character commented, "It's a risky technique - switching perspective back and forth like that - but if you're careful, it can be a nifty took in the toolbox."  This was not the only time that the author character, talking to people in an auditorium, talks to the reader as well.  I'd say more about this aspect, but would prefer readers to discover exactly how it pans out without my spoiling it.The author sets up the concept of there being something scary behind a locked door, and that's a classic. Stephen King wrote many years ago about how a reader's imagination is bigger than anything an author can produce. When the Bad Thing shows up there is usually a letdown, or at least a release of tension, because the reality, the tangible monster, can never match what the reader - or viewer, in the case of movies - had conjured up in his or her imagination.  This story has a door, and the author knows the nature of the story needs the door to be opened and for the characters and the reader to enter in and see what's beyond the door, and in doing so he risks disappointing the reader in the way King wrote about.  Whether or not he succeeds is for the reader to decide, but I think he got away with it by focusing on the nature of dread, which is in anticipation, and the idea that any dread the reader felt waiting for the door to open is but a fraction of what someone would feel if they waited decades for the other shoe to drop after surviving the thing in the room.This is a story meant for people who not only enjoy horror, but who appreciate writing as a craft. Yeah, I liked it a whole lot.Editing: 5 stars. He left the first "t" out of Fred Flintstone. Inexcusable. Pistols at dawn.

$REVIEW.: "Evil" was the word the Anglo-Saxons used where we would use bad, cruel, unskillful, defective (adj.), or harm, crime, misfortune, and disease. Of course, this is not the meaning of evil that Hugh MacLeod had in mind when he formulated his concept of a plan so forget about the word and focus on the valuable insights that his counterintuitive mind offers. As he explains, people need a plan guided and informed by "that crazy, out-there idea that allows them to actually start doing something they love, doing something that matters. Everybody needs an Evil Plan that gets them the hell out of the rat race, away from the lousy bosses, away from boring, dead-end jobs that they hate. Life is short."MacLeod speaks from extensive personal experience as he discusses his struggles years ago the lessons he learned from them. He has paid a hefty "tuition" to obtain the real-world knowledge he gained and now shares, as he did in an earlier book, Ignore Everybody. In that book and in this one, he provides an abundance of his brilliant illustrations. Some are hilarious. Some have the impact of an ice pick stuck in the ear. All are precious gifts. They remind me that, long ago, Oscar Wilde offered this admonition: "Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken." MacLeod presumably agrees but, I suspect, would cite another admonition from the Gnostic Gospels, part of the New Testament apocrypha: "If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."In other words, MacLeod is affirming the importance of having personal authenticity while making and then sustaining a full commitment to doing whatever we love most. It took him years to develop what Ernest Hemingway once characterized as a "shock-proof, built-in crap detector." It takes courage to acknowledge one's own crap and then eliminate it. Life is short and our most precious resource is time. So, MacLeod insists, feed the hunger that, paradoxically, "will cost you your life" in order to save it from the forces that feel threatened by anyone who has "crazy, out-there ideas" and evil plans to make them a reality.Consider this brief passage in The Book in which Alan Watts observes, "We need a new experience -- a new feeling of what it is to be 'I.' The lowdown (which is, of course, the secret and profound view) on life is that our normal sensation of self is a hoax, or, at best, a temporary role that we are playing, or have been conned into playing -- with our own tacit consent, just as every hypnotized person is basically willing to be hypnotized. The most strongly enforced of all known taboos is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego." Evil plans eliminate all masks. That is one reason why they terrify those who wear them.MacLeod believes that "evil plans are not products; they are gifts" and that is what this book is, a gift from him to each reader and offered with love. He acknowledges, "I'm not the world's most talented person at what I do. Neither are you. That doesn't make the gifts we have any less valid. Giving the gift is an act of love. And love is the only thing that matters. That's why we have an Evil Plan...Because it matters. Because love matters. What else is there to say?..."Hopefully, Hugh MacLeod will respond to that question in his next book.In other words, MacLeod is affirming the importance of having personal authenticity while making and then sustaining a full commitment to doing whatever we love most.

$REVIEW.: I just spent some great time reading Tim Horvath's collection, UNDERSTORIES
I haven't done one of my entirely unorthodox book review-thingies on my blog in a while, and I wish I had the time to devote myself to convincing you to give this one your full attention.So, here's a moment

Allow me to emphasize that it needs attention


I needed to read it carefully, attentively


First, Horvath knows how to write one kick-arse sentence after another

These are sentences to read aloud, to get the feeling of them rolling off your tongue; they're complicated but well-executed from beginning to end

That's just his sentence structure
Second, and I think everyone is saying this, the stories are so imaginative/inventive/fantastical/dystopian, etc


The city with films projected everywhere got me the most, until I read about how people inexplicably blew up into smithereens during tense conversations, with only a trace of mint in the air suggesting impending violence

Wow

Third, Horvath's prose is smart

I like smart fiction

I'm just impressed by philosophical astuteness in fiction
Fourth, if I were teaching my dream one-year-long fiction seminar, I'd like to end with Matt Bell's first book, and this one
I don't write like this at all

I don't do this stuff, but I know this: it's important

It speaks of the role of fiction, the development of literature


There

$REVIEW.: "MISES The Last Knight of Liberalism" is a masterpiece of scholarship. It takes you on a year by year journey through the life of this giant of a man. It is an intellectual history of the development of ideas, and it is a personal history of the man, his contemporaries, and the times in which they lived. The many photographs of von Mises and the personalities he worked with and debated brings them to life. The beautiful idiomatic American by an author whose first language is apparently not English makes Mises a joy to read; I have never enjoyed reading a book of non-fiction as much as this one.In the preface to his excellent book, "The Growth of Biological Thought," Ernst Mayer states that "MUCH OF MODERN BIOLOGY, particularly the various controversies between different schools of thought, cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of the historical background of the problems." In reading MISES I discovered the truth of his admonition as it applies to economics.There are undoubtedly many like myself with no formal training in economics who have at times struggled to understand von Mises. In reading MISES you will find that some of those issues fall into place. For example, in The Theory of Money and Credit von Mises classifies in tedious detail the things people think of as money. It seemed rather boring. What was his point? In reading MISES I learned that there was a school of thought that considered money just a place holder for value. It was in part a response to such views that he had to sort out money from certificates for money before he could proceed.A point of interest for those who keep books and may wish to pass them on to heirs. It has a waterproof cover and a binding which is superior. That seems to be a trademark of the Mises Institute press.I was heartened to discover at the end of MISES that my review of "The Betrayal of the American Right" by Murray Rothbard might well have been written by von Mises himself in substance if not in style. Amazon posted my review. The Mises Institute refused to post it, but I am pleased that they didn't ask me to separate from my wife.

Next thing I know, I feel tears well up in my eyes because this person was so mean and cold and had such a detrimental effect on the young boy, Will. But the biggest reason I got so emotional is because I actually went to school with the author. She graduated 3 yrs. ahead of me but I remember her and her then boyfriend, now husband. Both just very good and decent people. She used to leave cookies in the mailbox for my father, their postman back in the day. They, nor their family deserved any of this and though it may be painful to have to dredge up these feelings again, I think it's important to make folks aware that there are all kinds of sick individuals in the world and we need to be cognizant when things just don't seem right. Just a fabulous, fabulous read. I highly recommend it, not because I know her but because it's a darn good book. Can't wait for the next one Kath!! : )

$review_text.: This novella (I guess) is a quick easy read


It's not my usual cup of tea, but the subject, the end of life, is something we need to talk about

The writing is nice, I spotted one minor grammar error, in character speech


the author advised me that she would correct it
I highly recommend this topical selection.

$REVIEW.: I have read all Evan Currie's later books, and enjoyed them very much, but I did not like this one.  Like his subsequent books, this story has some great battle scenes and I liked the idea for a futuristic power station.  Not quite sure where all the water to run it came from in the dead heart of the continent, but may be that's nitpicking.  Unfortunately I also didn't find the rest of the plot believable, I thought the female police officer was unrealistically stupid and I hated a lot of the "Aussie" dialogue.  I've spoken to quite a few Australian soldiers and I don't recall any of them ever calling me "son", let alone doing it in every third sentence.  "Mate" may be "son" no.The rest of the background didn't gel either.  I don't know if Interpol agents cruise the world looking for bad guys but I suspect they don't, particularly in countries with their own police forces.  I am, however, sure that they won't be able to legally bring their own weapons and ammo into the country without filling in a lot of paper work first.  Amazingly the country does have its own defence forces too, not nearly so large as America's, but not so small that they can only field a single team of soldiers to deploy in the middle of the country.  And the army bases, even by road, would surely be able to get some personnel on the ground sooner than a helicopter flown from mainland USA.

$review_text.: Calliope Reaper-Jones never imagined the one thing she avoided like a plague would end up fulfilling her life-long dreams of buying designer clothes -without the inevitable diet of ramen noodles to cover the cost- and dating hot guys. Who knew "Death" had so many perks?Our once reluctant protagonist is dressed to the nines and eager to attend her first official outing as President and CEO of Death Inc. playing hostess for a Masquerade Party and Dinner at the Haunted Hearts Castle. First thing on the agenda: Prove she can handle the job. Second: Make her former boyfriend, Daniel, eat his heart out. She has a slutty rhinestone bikini that should do the trick! The tables are quickly turned however, when she discovers Daniel isn't at the party alone; a possessive paramour is on his arm. That proves to be the least of her worries when the annotated copy of "How To Be Death" is stolen and bodies start dropping like beads at Marti Gras. It's a race against time as Callie, Jarvis, Runt (Hooray!) and Freezay, a quirky retired detective, search for a vicious killer and thief before the stroke of midnight signals the end of Halloween and, possibly, the beginning of the end for all humanity.This time around, the main focus is on the Aztec Pantheon which is particularly fitting for the story-line. Several intriguing new characters are introduced, most with secrets and/or hidden agendas. One of the dinner guests shares a brow raising revelation that is subtly hinted at in early chapters. I would love to comment further on that, and several other interesting character developments, but I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone. I'm thrilled that Callie's adorable side-kick, Runt, had a larger role in the story and also enjoyed the addition of former detective and old family friend, Freezay. Hope to see more of both these characters in the next book!Hold on to your hat, and your heart, as pieces to this mysterious puzzle fly in rapid succession making you *scratch your head* more often than Cerberus with a case of fleas! Amber Benson does a fantastic job providing hints throughout and tying everything together at the conclusion of this exhilarating, fast-paced "Whodunit".I was fully immersed in this "CLUE" style mystery from the first page to the last and "How to be Death" is my favorite of the series so far. It would help to read the first three installments but isn't essential as Amber provides enough back-story to get new readers up to speed or refresh your memory after a year's wait following the release of Serpent's Storm. I highly recommend it for Urban Fantasy readers and fans of the Mystery genre.*Cambridge definition* :)

His coverage of Darwin's discoveries and the early battle around evolution is one of the most thorough I have ever read, and I am a scholar of that period. He makes clear that he believes our acceptance of evolution makes our acceptance of the incarnation possible. He grapples with difficult topics that have troubled Christians for ages: original sin, life after death. Very thought provoking book.&#34;

$REVIEW.: I didn't know if I was going to like this book. I don't generally do well with anything that's one extreme or another. However, I did find that I really did enjoy this book. It was nice to see a different kind of character represented as well. Not much swearing and not much sex in this book and it was nice to see a more innocent side of teens and in today's world to boot. Ms. Walker's characters are very endearing. A group of friends whose bonds are as strong as steel, but willing to add another to their ranks was wonderful. It was also nice to see parents who were present, not clueless and not portrayed as the villains. Are Lacey's values strong enough to withstand a challenge? Will her family understand if Lacey's values aren't the same as theirs? The love story between Lacey and Ty was great and built slowly, which I liked. He respected her and was not the typical bad boy. I thought Ms. Walker's characters were unique and I liked them all. This book is yet another in the Contemps Challenge.

$REVIEW.: Of Blood and Brothers is a book that taught me much about the more intimate details of the Civil War struggle in the South.  The characters ring true for the time periods being written about.  The story is thought provoking for me because I had never stopped to consider the fact that there were those from one family who did fight on opposite sides. As if that war was not bad enough with the American citizens of the north and south fighting and killing each other, add to that family connection and love and it becomes a much bigger horror.The author captures the language and culture of the era(s), and the loving nature of southern families that makes them very special to these United States.Can't wait to read the second book!

$review_text.: I received an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.I don't normally like reading novellas since they tend to feel like you are reading an almost entirely different series, but this was great!  It felt like the author wrote it at the same time as the other novels and just happened to cut these scenes out since they didn't really work with the other book(s).I felt horrible for Charles after what happened to him in Inked by an Angel, he did mostly bring it on himself, but he wasn't being a complete jerk, it just wasn't meant to be with Kyle, she definitely belongs with Jed.Kami definitely deserves a man like Charles after all she's been through and the sacrifices she had to make.  They make a great couple.It was great to see Gabriel in action he definitely deserved one last chance to make love happen before his promotion.  Although if this series continues as long as I hope (fingers crossed) maybe we'll see him matchmaking again with Kami and Charles' children, since that will be his right.  :)Great story.  Highly recommended.

It is aimed at convenience of cooking (and taste) and not at health. Also, on the kindle app, you'll find that there are no pictures of the actual prepared meals, which is unfortunate, because that is one of my favorite things about a cookbook. Instead, it contains that same picture of a slow-cooker above every recipe. Meh. But overall, if you are interested in some easy ways to make some of these recipes listed above, add it to your kindle- its FREE. woohoo. :-)

$REVIEW.: Beneath Outback Skies is an Australian Contemporary Romance written by Alissa Callen.The Review:I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem
Impressed with the simplistic writing style, interesting characters and the sweet romance, I was able to lose myself in the stark imagery and enjoy this fun read.Story, Characters and Plotting...Taking place in the dry and scenic outback's of Australia, I could easily imagine and feel the struggle of the community, the people and specifically, Banora Downs, as it was left barren by drought and transformed from a thriving freehold to the desolate and parched dustbowl we now see


I empathized with the desperate farmers as they waited for a rain that seems to have abandoned them.Paige Quinn is determined to keep her homestead, Banora Downs, from the fate of surrounding farms where farmers are forced to sell or abandon their properties which have surrendered to drought
She's also resolute in caring for her disabled father and keeping him from realizing just how severe the drought has affected their farm and declining livestock


Suffering the effects of a past relationship gone wrong, her trust is hard to earn and she's built walls to keep her heart safe
Her struggle and determination can be easily misunderstood as detachment but in reality, she feels under pressure to pull them out of a never ending work load before they lose everything


I really liked her character

She feels Banora Downs and her father are her sole responsibility as she tries to keep the promise she made to her mother
Her strength and spirit was admirable.Not as oblivious as she think, her father, Conner, has other plans
Seeing the strain and all consuming life of the farm weighing his daughter down, he decides it's time to step in and take action

Announcing he's invited a paid guest to stay on their farm, he introduced her to Tait Cavanaugh.Instantly disliking the city-boy, Paige tries everything she can do dissuade Tait from staying


But little does she know, he's part of her father's plan and he's not going anywhere.Tait has personal business to attend while he's at Banora Downs and getting close the Paige is just one of the benefits.I really enjoyed Tait

He was hard working, gentle and caring

Coming from the city, he saw firsthand the problems facing this community and he stepped in and tried to help in any way he could.Paige and Tait weren't to terribly complicated and there was a bit of intrigue in the middle of the romance


I liked the fact there was an instant attraction but they didn't immediately fall into bed with one another


There was a slow build with conflict and tension


But, though this was a sweet story, I would have liked a bit more of a push-pull to enrich the plot and more romance to ignite the spark and chemistry between the characters.The Wrap Up:The story was well told and I loved all the unfamiliar references to things specific to Australia
This was a sweet and enjoyable read and my first time reading this author


I will definitely keep an eye out for future works from Alissa Callen.NOTE:: A gifted copy was provided for an honest review by Random House Australia.

 With every chapter of the book brought on a new broken heart for Bennett.....but the one beautiful thing in her life was Grey!!!!!  But with every trial and tribulation that happend to Bennett from the time she was little to the end of the book she showed how strong of a women she really was

 I had to put the book down about half way through the book and really sit back and think for a couple of days because my heart really broke for her in all of her loss and heart break and the rash decisions that she made


 The one thing though that I can give Bennett is that she always stuck around for what was next to come even though she felt like everygood thing in her life she never deserved but in all actuality she really true heartedly deserved everything good that happend to her

 I can not wait to read about the next chapter in there life of Bennett and Grey!!!!

$review_text.: In their first book Do Hard Things, Alex & Brett Harris challenged young people to break out of the stereotypical teenage mold of low expectations and do something noteworthy.  They challenged their readers "to do hard things for the glory of God and, in the process, turn the world's idea of what teens are capable of upside down." (p.1) In their follow up book, Start Here, they seek to provide some guidance and suggestions for just exactly where to start doing hard things.One of the most difficult parts of doing something challenging is knowing where and how to start.  Through the Harrises' first book, many young people were challenged to do something hard but perhaps didn't know what to do.  In Start Here, the Harrises give very sound, practical advice and tips for getting thing started by offering such questions for consideration as:-"What do I like to do? - Doing hard things is challenging, but...it often involves something we enjoy." (p.12)-"What can I learn from others?"-"What is my goal?"-"How can I get my friends involved?"-"What should I do when I'm done with a hard thing?"Along the way, they give many concrete examples of young people who have faced challenges with their "hard thing" and how they worked through those obstacles.  They also deal with the issue of pride and how to handle attention - both positive and negative - that may come by attempting out of the ordinary things.  At the end of the book is a very helpful list of 100 "real-life examples" that other young people have done and includes things like "memorized a whole book of the Bible," "learned Spanish," "wrote an encouraging letter to my youth pastor," "donated blood to the Red Cross," and "apologized."  This list is a great tool to help the reader start thinking about what kinds of things he or she can do.There were several things that I especially appreciated about this book.  First was the emphasis that hard things should be done for the glory of God.  This theme is prevalent throughout and is a constant reminder that as Christians, everything we do is for the praise and glory of God.  Second, was the excellent emphasis on learning from others, but especially from the wisdom that comes from parents.  It's very easy to write off parents as out of touch or worse, but the Harrises recognize the truth of Scripture in children honoring their parents, even when they might be opposed to the hard thing the young person wants to do.  In their own words, "Honoring your parents is commanded in Scripture.  Odds are that your specific project is not.  When in doubt, side with what God makes clear in his word." (pp.34-35)Start Here is a great book for young people to read for help in how to move beyond the have-fun-while-you're-still-young mindset and start really building the "muscles of responsibility."  Every young person should read this book.(This book was provided for review by the WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group.)

$review_text.: I admit it. When relaxing I look for books that won't tax my brain too much. You know, like summer blockbuter movies; somewhat predictable, but full of action. Deadlock is one of those books. This is the second book about journalist John Hutchinson. Like other books of this gnere, you miss something by not starting at the beginning. If I had to do it again, I would bring the 2007 first book "Deadfall" and read that before this one. It isn't really necessary. This book is big fun all by itself.The story centers around John Hutchinson an idealistic reporter and military industrialist Brendan Page. Page is a villan straight out of Ian Fleming; brash, smart with take-over-the-world ambitions. We have a reporter who will dig until he gets the story and a bad guy that will stop at nothing. The book moves at breakneck speed. The dialogue is crisp and the action non-stop.This is the kind of book I love to read on an airplane. I start before the doors close and before I know it, we are at the destination. Don't get me wrong, this isn't literature. You have to suspend disbelief and get yourself in a "James Bond" mood. If you like adventure, you are going to love this book.

$REVIEW.: This is an important translation in many ways. First of all, Ta Hui is a key figure in the Rinzai lineage of Zen* and has been very influential in the shaping of this form of Buddhism as it comes down to us today. On this merit alone, any translation of his works and words is necessary and welcome, as we try to assess that influence as well as get in touch with the wise words of a very religious and spiritual man in Sung Dynasty China, words that do indeed speak with a jarringly colloquial eloquence across the oceans and centuries. So the historical importance and universal appeal are both there. Furthermore, as far as eloquence goes, this text has more of it than most; sometimes reading Zen texts is like gnawing on an iron bar, but since almost all of this book is made up of letters and addresses to laymen, Ta Hui gets his hands dirty and his feet wet "dragging through mud and water" with grandmotherly solicitude, breaking down Zen rhetoric into manageable portions. Oh, the good ol' paradoxes, seeming non-sequiters, and nondualistic loopdeeloops are still there, but toned down and elaborated in ways Ta Hui wouldn't have bothered with had he been addressing his monastic peers, and he's careful in several points to ward off "anything goes" misunderstandings of Zen practice (evidently a problem then as now). That being the case, this makes for an excellent and accessible introduction into Zen discourse, thought, and practice, and I would highly recommend its use as a primary text in the university classroom. And since it is addressed to laymen, people trying to meditate and be Buddhists while out in the secular world engaged in the daily grind, it's very relevant to most American practitioners of Zen today who are usually in much the same situation. So this book very much has appeal and usefulness both at the scholar's desk and on the meditation cushion.Cleary's translation style is quite appropriate, too, remaining true and accurate to Ta Hui's language while not being afraid to get slangy when he does. The flow of words is unstrained and natural while not fast and loose. The footnotes and parenthetical remarks are handled with good balance, making references obscure to the 20th century American reader clear while not talking over the author himself. The only thing really lacking as far as I was concerned was a brief biographical sketch of the laymen to whom these letters are addressed, perhaps as a little appendix in the back. Who is Ta Hui talking to? Why does he keep writing to Li Hsien-ch'en and Tseng T'ien-yu multiple times while only writing letters to others once or maybe twice? Or is this only an effect of Cleary's selection process? All of this would have been good to know, but the lack thereof doesn't detract that much from the book, which still stands quite well on its many merits. I highly recommend this book to any and all.*(I approach from the Japanese side, but "Lin Chi lineage" and "Ch'an" if you prefer. But then why don't I refer to the monk as Daie? Cleary does the same thing, too, with "Zen Master Ta Hui". The tangled linguistics of Zen/Ch'an/Son in America would be worth a study in itself.)

$review_text.: Where to start with this book?All of my blog sisters and I have now managed to read it and although we read it at different times, we were there for one another and supported each other through all of the twists, turns and road bumps! Poor Krystle was the first to read it so had to endure the story that is Brooks and his "Kat" alone.There is very little we can say about this book without giving too much away

I thought the synopsis was very in depth but if only you all knew that was just the tip of the iceberg that Jenn Foor treated us to before reading the book.Katy was torn between two brothers

The choices were taken out of her hands but she never forgot her true love, Brooks Valentine."No matter how hard I'd fought to not want Brooks, it made me want him more


His touch was like nothing I'd ever felt before


Every bone in my body reacted to him, as if I were metal and he were the magnet."She made some difficult choices in her young adult life - ones that were not necessarily the right decision - but she came through every roadblock she encountered and never lost hope

Brooks shared that hope and once he managed to catch up on the life he'd missed away from Katy he grabbed her and hoped once more it wasn't too late for them."I don't want to be your friend, because I need more than that
Open your eyes woman


I want to be your everything

I always have." ~Brooks"I can't change my past, and I shouldn't ruin my future, our future
If it's still okay, I'm ready to fall completely into this with you
I've been ready my whole life, but I was just too scared of losing you." ~KatyThis doesn't mean their story ended at their reunion after their two years apart

Oh no, no


But I'm not going to say anymore and ruin what is quite possibly the best rollercoaster of a love story we have ever read.Myself and Krystle have both read Jenn Foor's books before and, personally, the Mitchell Family series is in my Top 20 of all time faves, but this outshone them all and is a fantastic testamonial to how an author's work progresses the more they write

If this is what Ms Foor is capable of now, then I cannot wait to see what she releases next
Fans for life.So, a thank you from four humbled Brits for allowing us to travel the Love's Suicide journey with you!My rating - 6 stars


My first one ever!

$REVIEW.: I came across this while browsing through recent releases, really by happenstance more than algorithm. I enjoy and appreciate gay coming of age stories, but all to often they are heavier on eroticism than character development, emotion and message.  Lissa Brown's "Another F-word" is a refreshing departure from the norm in this category.The book description and other reviews have already done well in capturing the essence of the story, so I won't rehash that.  Rather, I would simply encourage others to enjoy this book.  Further, I'd suggest you set aside a single block of time to do so, because I doubt you will want to set it down.  The story moves at a solid pace, never bogging down in extraneous fluff.  Using a framework of many short chapters, the story pulls you through.  I sat down with this at 9pm and upon completion, at 3:30 am, was both emotionally drained and thoroughly satisfied.  I look forward to enjoying other work by this talented writer.
$SUMMARY.: Beautifully told story of struggle and success

$REVIEW.: This is a short little book but it is packed with some great information. I got into juicing about a month ago. I bought one of the Breville Juice Fountain models. My friends had been telling me for some time that you have never tasted anything like freshly juiced fruits and vegetables but I have to say, I didn't believe them until I actually tasted it.One of the ingredients I had been most apprehensive about was juicing greens because I just couldn't see how they would taste any good. This book has a few recipes in it that I can vouch for personally - they are good! And the best part about it is that they are good for you.But that is not even the best part about this book. The best part is the 7 day detox plan which I am going to start on this week. It seems pretty easy to me and the steps are laid out in a manner that anyone can follow.If you are on the fence you need to jump off and get this book. I'll say the same things that my friends told me before I got my juicer, "You've never tasted anything like freshly juiced fruits and vegetables." It's the truth!

$REVIEW.: What I LovedThere was a lot going on in Blue Moon Promise and I liked the way that the story started--suspenseful, intriguing, with a lot of eyebrow-raising I-can't-believe-that-just-happened action.The characters were colorful and memorable. Lucy's determination to be a strong and able helpmeet was endearing, as were the kids. Eileen and Jed were such fun to get to know.What I Didn't Like As MuchAt times the pace slowed and I would get confused or have to rifle back through the pages to realize where I was.Also, the voices sometimes seemed to "jump" and I felt as if I had missed something in the way the characters rationalized their actions or conclusions. I didn't care for the way this prevented me from "connecting" with the characters sometimes...but over all, this book is a tension-filled story of two hearts thrown together and in the middle of two mysteries that threaten their love.

$review_text.: Don't read this book if you're happy with your comfortable Christianity. This book will challenge you to step outside of that little box you've put your faith-walk in, and open your heart and life up to real hands-and-feet Jesus-following Christianity. Reading this book made me squirm. In a good way.Heather Curridge is a surgeon's wife, complete with all the perks. She has everything most of us could ever want, but she still wants more. Her shopping habits have gotten out of control and driven a wedge between her and her husband. She keeps driving past the home of some old class-mates because she can't forgive herself for the way she treated them. And she's constantly questioning what it means to follow Christ. Is it enough to give your money to those who need it? Is it enough to minister inside the safe walls of your comfy church? Or does God ask us for more?Quaker Summer is the story of Heather's awakening to the call of God on her life. God uses a kangaroo, her 15-year-old son, a couple of elderly sisters with their own real-life faith, a Catholic nun who loves the addicted and forgotten, and a drug dealer to speak His love and direction into her life. And she listens. Her name is "Curridge," after all.This beautiful story is written in Lisa Samson's signature first-person style. I will never know how she is able to so deftly give each of her main characters their own distinctive voice. But she does. Those of you familiar with Lisa's books will be thrilled with the fact that Lark Summerville, the character from Women's Intuition, is one of Heather's closest friends. I'm going to have to pick up Lark's story again soon; it's been awhile.One warning: do not read this book on an empty stomach! The descriptions of fried pork chops, crab cakes, potato salad, and cake - oh, the cake - left my mouth watering. her description of tea even made me want to get me some - and I'm not a tea drinker!

$review_text.: I don't think I will ever get enough of this series and the characters! I get so excited when I see that there will be a new Red Stone Security book releasing soon and I'm always very impatient to get my hands on it. And they just keep getting better and better! I honestly don't know how Katie does it, but she does and I am SO very thankful! The men in these books are all the macho bada** type, which I love and they have the best taste in women! I think what I love so much about these stories is that they are just so intense, packed with suspense and drama and hot steamy sex. I can't help but fall into them, which is why I always have to devour these books in one sitting, because I just can't stop reading. This one was no different!Jordan and Vincent met and fell in love with each other 7 years ago but they are torn apart when Jordan just disappears one day. Now, 7 years later, Jordan is back and her reasons for leaving are pretty huge. And though he is angry with her for leaving him, he's not about to let her go again, especially once they discover she's still in danger.These two characters are among my favorites of Katie's characters and they really took me on an emotional roller coaster with their story. To have loved and lost like Vincent did or worse, to have found love but had to give it up the way Jordan had to, it's such an intense story. Jordan was a great match for Vincent, she took the heat from Vincents anger and then again from his sister and she did it all with her head held high. She knew she messed up but it was what had to be done at the time. And Vincent handled himself very well. Through all of his anger he knew he still loved her so he managed to just push it all aside. It's too often that the hero stays angry for longer than necessary and that wasn't the case with Vincent. Which made me love him even more!This book was a hit with me (obviously)! I loved getting the glimpses of past characters and hearing a few tiny updates. Now, I am ready for the next Red Stone Security book and I have my hopes for who will be the hero but we will see. My fingers are crossed...and okay my toes are too.If you have not ready any of these books yet you should go now and add them to your TBR list because they are a must read for romance lovers. I will never get enough of them and I hope she continues to write them forever! ;) Thanks for another great read Katie!*I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review**This review can also be found on Book Lovin' Mamas Review Blog*

$REVIEW.: The author presented a raw discussion in his book "Straight Dope". The facts which I learned were revealingly shocking and depressing. It was outrageous to read the interviews of the drug addicts, the counselors who are attempting to stop the addiction cycle of the addicts, the families of the addicts, the teachers dealing with drug abused children, and the discussion on the battle against tobacco companies, why should marijuana be legalized and how the administration is dealing with this issue.This eight chapter book also revealed author's experience with drugs, as his own life didn't remain untouched with drugs from family members to his neighbors. He himself trying marijuana for the first time, experimenting with different types of drugs and finally breaking the shackles to escape the possible drug addiction.The author LeRon Barton did a detailed research on the topic to present this amazing piece of work to us. I wonder how hard it would have been for the author to find and track people to confess about their experiences, who was all set out to find the answer to the question " why are drugs so entrenched in American culture?"I will give this provoking disclosure a five star rating!

$review_text.: Well, i have read all the reviews by clover and some happen to not like it. I can understand why. The story leaves a lot to be desired and nothing is really fleshed out.Although the story line is like this, i immediately fell in love with "Clover". Ever since i read it, it is now my favorite clamp series. After reading this cover to cover in one sitting, it left something on me. Maybe an impression? Its a bit abstract but i love that about this book, it really lets you delve into your thoughts and emotions. When reading i was compelled to throw myself into a frenzy of so many thoughts. I also felt my heart in my throat so you can tell how tense i was feeling. Seeing as how many manga don't incorporate the type of feelings or mixed emotions you might get from "Clover" (I mean the way you feel not what the characters in the manga are feeling). This is a manga i can relate to.Overall its a gorgeous book with amazing art. No amount of words can really tell you how much i love it. Its abtract, different, unique. A dark fantasy which has a light feel to it. As if its saying "There is darkness but if you look hard enough, there is more to it than meets the eye". (Cheesy yes but its how i feel and i'm sure you've heard the line a thousand times,can you bear with a thousand and one?)

 Or worse you attend the will reading of the deceased and major shock follows  ...she was not your aunt by your mother!This is the start to the fabulous book by one of the best authors of all time


 The chemistry and rough moments of some very delightful dialogue between Joshua and Holly was splendid and so much fun to read.I loved how the author used little tricks here and there to bring these two characters to a fiery duel of romance.What I especially loved was the mystery behind the identity of Holly's father

It added to the allure of the book and in the end brought it all together for me as reader.This is one of Liz's earlier books re-released with a new cover

But the book was certainly not old fashioned in any manner, the author still delivered a stunning romance

I was left with a everlasting impression of love found in unexpected places under rather suspenseful and unnerving circumstances bringing forth a revelation of another kind.The author achieved her goal of awakening desires with a explosive flame !Nicely done Liz!4/5 star review

$review_text.: An interesting and very informative look at the Lincoln family during several months in 1861 when the Civil War began.  Told through the collected writings of a close friend, 16 year old Ms Taft, who accompanied her brothers to the White House in order to play with the two Lincoln boys, Willie and Tad.  Within a short amount of time, many of the historical events taking place are included and incorporated into the story.  The title refers to the young girl, Ms. Taft who kept a diary and wrote down her personal recollections of her experience with the Lincoln family.  A very nice portrait of President Lincoln is a charming part of this story.  A quick look at the family, their personal lives as well as society in general with the background of the civil war equals a nice look at some personal events that went on as told by this young woman.  Fun read.  Very enjoyable.

$review_text.: Wonderful novel, can't believe it was free


The world building in this was above par, and the character relationships and identity development were astounding

Here you had very round characters, even the side characters had enough background given on them that they could easily take off on their own


The story itself was very enjoyable and I find myself willing to shell out the big bucks to continue in this series.

$REVIEW.: This book accurately explains the life cycle of caterpillars in away that appeals to children of any age.  I'll admit it; I learned many details about the caterpillars that I certainly didn't know before.  For example, the eggs are typically laid on the underside of the leaf in order to avoid becoming a tasty morsel for a hungry predator.  My grandchildren and I were all fascinated by the clear and beautiful images showing the different stages of the caterpillar's life cycle.Andrew's questions, embedded within the text, prompted the children to be interactive as we all took turns reading the book. They eagerly looked for the black spots on the male Monarch butterfly, and the photo of the beautiful adult Emperor Moth blew them away.The facts about the metamorphosis of the caterpillar have never been more entertaining.  Andrew, this is the way learning should happen.  My hat is off to you!

 This second book in the series captured my heart and I've become a cheerleader for this young woman and her courage in the face of so many challenges


 So much information, so many pieces of the puzzle, so many directions this can go

 At first glance, Bryan's hold over Hallie seems cold but you begin to really feel the pull of these too people
 There is so much hidden, so much unsaid, yet H

Ward has developed a beautiful story around too souls that seem so lost

 There's even some well written comedy that was so unexpected that I found myself laughing out loud
 Jonathan's appearance brings up questions and once again the ending is a page turner waiting to happen

 I can't wait to see how Hallie deals with her present and faces her future
 Three more books, three more stories to share of this beautiful woman and the one and only Bryan Ferro!

$review_text.: I just LOVED this book!  Sometimes a book just speaks to me and maybe it was because Kim is also a book blogger (but apparently one that is well sought after in the Chick Lit world!) but does it on the side, much like me.  I felt like I could relate to her...not that I have a job that isn't challenging, but that I do something on the side that I love and have hopes and dreams that do not extend to my "real" job.  She is also caught up in the cattiness of a former classmate, who perhaps has her own insecurities to deal with, but definitely does not show that in how she presents herself.I felt like this book was realistic and Kim's situations and feelings were what most women feel at one time or another.  We see her realize that there is more to life than reading and reviewing books.  It takes her quite some time to figure this out, but when she does.....watch out!  She takes it seriously and comes into her own with more confidence about herself and what she is capable of doing in life.Originally reviewed for StoreyBookReviews.com*I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*

$REVIEW.: Coleman owns and edits an art magazine. Her cousin, Dinah, has a print gallery. Although born in the South, they're making their way in the New York art world. There are some clouds on the horizon. Coleman believes that one of her writers is stealing her ideas and selling them to another publication. Dinah wants a bigger gallery in a better location, but her husband Jonathan, who is also her backer, want to keep her close to home.Enter Heyward Bain, a millionaire who wants to start a print museum. Soon very expensive prints that haven't been seen for years start appearing at auction. Then the supposed seller is found dead. Coleman believes he's been killed because of his connection to the prints, but the police don't believe her. Being Coleman, she has to find out what happened. Dinah agrees and their zany detecting begins.This is a fun novel and very fast paced. The author has done a good job with the New York art world setting and even takes readers on a side trip to Britain. The characters are amusing if not particularly realistic. They remind me of characters in a sitcom.The novel has several plot lines. They all converge at the end, but I felt that some of the rationale was stretched to accommodate the revelations. Still the book is fluffy and fun. I recommend it for reading at the beach or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.I reviewed this book for Net Galley.

Aaron brings us an original and captivating story of immortal gods, angels, demons and the devil. While the story contains characters such as the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, as well as Satan and Lilith, Aaron reinvents these characters in a thought-provoking and entertaining manner to create this thrilling story.Aysel is a beautiful character. She is sexy, sensual, intelligent, witty and charming. Aysel teaches us about faith and family.  Following her in the story is not only entertaining it is mesmerizing as she comes into her fate as a god and then as she educates new gods.Aaron&#8217;s use of historical figures, artifacts and times are all expertly weaved through the storyline with great care and effectiveness. The magic, humor, suspense, and intense moments all coalesce in an enchanting story of the creation of gods. I can&#8217;t wait to read the other books in this series. I love that Aaron writes the stories in a way that they can be enjoyed in any order. I highly recommend it!

$review_text.: Presumed Guilty, BaezAfter Casey Anthony's daughter disappeared and was later found dead she was charged with murder. The media played it up [to distract people from the real news]. Most were surprised when the jury said `not guilty'. Lawyer Baez explains his work in this 430 page paperback book of 34 chapters. It has some pictures but no `Index', so it can't be used as a reference. You must read it all. I read the `Afterword' first. Casey's lies to the police led to her arrest and the belief in her guilt by the public. The jury listened to the facts and not the phony experts in the media. This is a very readable book and explains why so many watched this trial. ["Perry Mason" warned his clients against lying to the police.]Chapter 1 tells how the case began when Casey's mother Cindy tried to find Caylee. Casey was arrested and called Jos&eacute; Baez. Baez met Casey, then her family (Chapter 2). Baez learned more about the Anthony family (Chapter 3). The police leaked false information to convict Casey in public opinion. The word of the media people meant absolutely nothing (Chapter 4)! Baez tells about his life and education, and more about the case (Chapter 5). There were demonstrators outside the Anthony home. She was indicted (Chapter 6). Baez hired Dr. Henry Lee (Chapter 7). Other people were attracted to this case (Chapter 8). The media made up stories (p.105)! Caylee's remains were found near the Anthony home (Chapter 9). This area had been searched before (p.120). This changed the investigation (Chapter 10). A meter reader found the remains in the woods (Chapter 11). Was it seen in August? The problem had to be resolved (Chapter12). Others had searched the area before (p.153). A defense witness was threatened (p.154)! Why did somebody try suicide (Chapter 13)? There were family secrets (p.165)! Did this cause Casey's lies (p.169)? Chapter 14 contains new facts. [This may be the most important chapter.] Why was there "no computer activity" on June 16, 2008 (p.182)? No socks and shoes on Caylee suggest she never left the house (p.185).Human error in the justice system is extremely prevalent (Chapter 15). There was no trauma on the body, but the Medical Examiner said it was murder! It is easy to contaminate evidence (p.197). Cadaver dogs were used to test the trunk and backyard (Chapter 16). [Can they testify in court?] They are unreliable. A qualitative analysis said there was chloroform in the trunk, but there was no quantitative analysis (how much). The remains were examined (Chapter 17). There was no evidence of drugs or suffocation (p.221). Judge Strickland was biased (Chapter 18). Photos of Casey were leaked to damage her character (p.229). There were other rumors (p.232). A psychologist demolished the prosecutor's case (Chapter 19). Judge Strickland was biased on the check charges (Chapter 20). He recused himself (p.254). Judge Perry's decisions added to his workload (p.258).Witnesses would testify that Casey was a good mother (Chapter 21). There were no prior signs of abuse (p.264). Media propaganda made their job difficult (p.266). No one had seen the body before it was found (p.267)! The forensic evidence favored the defense. Chapter 23 tells about jury selection (pp.283-284). Baez prepared his opening statements (Chapter 24). "An accident that snowballed out of control" (p.306). Casey's friends said she was a good mother (Chapter 25). Baez explains his tactics and strategy (Chapter 26). The prosecution claimed there was a dead body in the trunk (Chapter 27). The Medical Examiner said there was no trauma for Caylee (Chapter 28). Baez called the FBI laboratory personnel for the evidence that exonerated Casey (Chapter 29). There was no blood or DNA from Caylee in the car. The state's witnesses supported the defense. The crime scene had been disturbed (p.360). None of Casey's shoes had soil samples that matched the recovery site (Chapter 30). Baez began his summation (Chapter 32). There was no evidence (p.398). The jury retired and reached a verdict (Chapter 33). Not guilty of murder. Chapter 34 tells what they did to evade the media.

$REVIEW.: Book two in the King Trilogy is everything that book one promised it could be, and more.We discover more about King, Mia, and the gang, and really get a firm sense of WHO the characters are. We had a pretty good idea of who Mia was in the first book, but, with skill, Ms. Pamfiloff allows Mia to grow. Everything we felt we knew regarding King is challenged and ultimately shattered (as we had hoped) as we delve more into his origins. Both as a grade A devil and as a man. The full cast gets fleshed out even further, some with more shocking secrets than others. Tension and suspense abound as the mysteries are solved. King For A Day takes unexpected turns; some great, some not, some stellar. With this book beautifully tidying up book one's loose ends we are left to wonder; what will Mia REALLY do in book three? Will she make the right choice, or the easy choice?  I, of course, have ideas of what I would love to happen, and can't wait to see for myself! The King Of Me can't be released quickly enough to appease me!!!

$review_text.: This book offers a comprehensive view about atheism and that is exactly what I found in it. The title is referred to the condition in which every human being is born, this is, as an atheist. The case of David Eller is different because he never was a believer despite the social "pressure" for being one. "I was born an Atheist...," he says, "All humans are born Atheists." In this perspective, what Eller does is give us the path we transit from being atheists to be believers and (in some cases) to be Atheists again.This is not the book about the personal experience and how the author lived it but just the opposite. Eller doesn't star his book. The star of the book is reason only. That's why chapter two is dedicated to it. In chapter two, Eller tells us that reason is (equal) to thinking and also that --or as a consequence-- reason is a method. In this vein he writes a fortunate (and a kind of definitive) sentence: "Reason is the process of moving form facts to conclusions by means of argument." This definition closes the possibility to the supernatural under the premise of the facts. If you take the facts out from the sentence you doesn't have the whole process of reasoning but just a part of it (which is a completely different thing).You can read it by yourself and being convinced (or not). But like it or not Eller is not only highly cogent but also he is solid as a rock. He doesn't leave loose ends. So as long as you read you discover that the author has meditated any single detail of his work. This is not a testimony --I insist-- but a defense of the atheism as a natural condition without any artificiality. Here --despite the fact that N.A. is not an easy reading-- everything is crystal clear. There is no rhetoric or verbal twisting for making you believe in a position which has nothing to do with believing. "Atheism," as Eller puts it, "is the conclusion (not the belief) that there are no gods."This book is different from any other one about this topic. I already said that N.A. is not testimonial, neither about science, archaeology or history. So Eller is not Richard Dawkins, not Christopher Hitchens, not Sam Harris. Eller is Eller and you'll be able to realize it as long as you read the book as I did. This book is a plus in the summation of atheism defenders. Is intelligent, well written and last bur not least, with no cheating or traps.My only "but" is Eller's U.S. centered perspective. But this is a problem with the majority of this works. In Latin America we are like orphans of this discussion and Catholic Church is very strong in terms of publications and opinions. We need an Eller here to enrich our visions about the world.Finally, I highly recommend Natural Atheism. You'll note the difference with recent books and debates in the essence of this original and courageous defense of atheism.

$REVIEW.: I did not expect to enjoy this. I've never read anything with a cowboy in it that I found particularly interesting. I'm currently thinking I need to head west in a dually with a trailer full of horses and see if I can't find this Macon Valley and then a couple cowboys.Perry and Jesse are happily engaged and just a few short weeks away from the big day. Perry has shared numerous women with Sean in the past. Perry and Sean have always wanted a woman to share, permanently. They are hoping that Jesse is the girl for them. Now they just have to introduce her into their lifestyle.The Unexpected is male-female-male m&eacute;nage. It is mentioned that Perry and Sean have enjoyed each other intimately, but they do not in this novella. That was a huge disappointment for me. The sizzling trio knowing each other from the very beginning of the novella worked wonderfully. It allowed for them to fall into to the numerous scorching sex scenes quickly.I will definitely read more of this delicious series!book from the author for the purpose of an honest review

The last fifteen months have been rough for Nicole, but reading her and her decision to move on made me like her instantly

There are times when her past creeps up on her and she falters but that's normal human behavior

Zack is a really great book boyfriend, he's a hot rock god with a heart who doesn't do anything in this book to tick me off
I'm also loving the secondary characters, I can't wait to read more of this series for sure.

$REVIEW.: This was a well written story and I liked all of the characters-until the end.Sabrina had her heart broken in high school and has never really moved past it.  There was one witness to the mess that happened to her, Tyler.  He helped her that night and she has never forgotten him or the promise she made him.Fast forward ten years when Sabrina's dreaded class reunion comes around.  As much as she doesn't want to face that one part of her past, she does want to face Tyler after so many years.  Sabrina's awesome roommate Julia talks her  into going, taking a chance that Tyler is there.This is a hard book to review as I don't want to post spoilers.  Things happen with Sabrina's past issues and her future is also affected. There is one situation that happens to her (again), and I for one would have a hard time moving on from it.  That is the only part of the book I had a problem with, relating to her choices in the end.Promise Me is a good, quick read with some surprise twists in it.

$review_text.: I received a copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review.This is a fantastic romance novel that swept me away to the Caribbean! I loved it!Lauren Biltmore is a fantastic character. She has survived an attack, but is still emotionally affected. I liked her very much. Although she is tougher than she realises, she believes herself to be weak. However, if I was attacked and survived what she had to go through, I'm not sure I would be sunning myself in a tropical paradise; I would more than likely be residing in a facility with padded walls! Meeting Noah Reynolds may just be her salvation.Noah Reynolds is also a fantastic character. He is charismatic and sexy man, who has skeletons in his closet. He meets Lauren and sparks fly!This is an extremely fast paced read that hooked me from the first page. I loved the intrigue and mystery surrounding Noah's stalker. Who were they, and what did they want? Both Lauren and Noah are "damaged goods" in that they both have gone through a traumatic experience, although completely different ones. The story is told with alternating view points between them. This gives the reader the opportunity to understand what each character is going through at a given moment. I wanted to shake Lauren a few times, especially when she started to fall to pieces, as I knew she was capable of handling the situation. I think that out of these two characters, Noah may just be the more sensitive one. I'll leave it to you to decide if you agree with me or not. The attraction that sparks between these two characters is intense; the romance scenes are hot without being too explicit or erotic.Amber Lea Easton has written an exciting and thrilling romance that flowed beautifully. The intrigue, mystery and danger kept me on the edge of my seat! I highly recommend this book if you love romance novels. - Lynn Worton

$review_text.: Pirates, magic, assassins and an impossible curse: everything that could only result in an amazing adventure. The Assassin's Curse is a great mix of strong characters, exciting adventure and the author's amazing creativity. Not to mention the gorgeous cover that completely matches the inside of the novel. However it's worth mentioning that in my opinion the world-building and characters' background were somewhat lacking.The Plot: The beginning already starts with a bang, Clarke promises us an exciting novel and she sure fulfils this promise. Ananna embarks on an unexpected adventure through the desert and the sea with an even more unexpected companion: an assassin. The development of the story certainly entertains and surprises us. What I mostly disliked about the story was the world-building, which for me wasn't as developed. I wanted to know more about Naji's enemies (the Mists) and about that parallel world in which they live in.The Characters: Ananna was the perfect pirate. She steals, swears and is not the bit ladylike and yet she is not ashamed of it. I really enjoyed this side of her, although she also has a sweet side unknown to her. Naji was a bit of a mystery and to be truthful I didn't like him that much. Clarke doesn't share much about him and I found him to be too grumpy. Why Ananna falls in love with him remains a question for me, yet it was inevitable.The Assassin's Curse was a fun and quick read that provides readers with an amazing adventure. The author's way of writing gives off an Arabian feeling that takes us to the world Clarke's story takes place in. Even though I really enjoyed the plot, in my opinion there are some important components missing (characters' background, Ananna's family disappears, world-building) but being a series, it is imaginable that certain will be explained in future novels . If you are an adventure lover, you should certainly check this one out.

Have read a Change in fortune and have in my hand the next book  A most peculiar circumstance and can't wait to start it. Jen Turano has such a way with story telling that you laugh out loud, and are reminded of all the great authors that you grew up with. She is up there with Jane Austen and Edith Wharton just with more humor.  If you like Jen Turano I would also suggest Jenny B. Jones ( love the humor that both these authors use).

$review_text.: Operation Zulu Redemption: Overkill - The Beginning by Ronie Kendig is the introduction to her new serialization

If you're not familiar with serialization, it's when books are released in episodes

The next episodes in this series will be released on July 18 - Operation Zulu Redemption: Collateral Damage Part 1, on July 25 - Operation Zulu Redemption: Out of Nowhere Part 2, on August 1 - Operation Zulu Redemption: Hazardous Duty Part 3, and on August 8 - Operation Zulu Redemption: Act of Treason Part 4


By the time you are finished with this serialization, you will have read the equivalent of 2 full length novels
Why not wait until it's released in its entirety? Well, if you want more great serializations from Ronie, you need to support this venture by purchasing the episodes as they are released.I admit that I am not a fan of serializations as I HATE waiting for the next episode


Ronie's serialization makes the wait all the harder because she is such an excellent writer and has a knack for leaving you wanting more
This introduction to the series hits the ground running and never stops


You will not want to put it down, and you'll be begging for the next episode as soon as you finish it.

$review_text.: In Desire by Design by Paula Altenburg, Eve Doucette has been trying to prove herself in her job. She may not have the title as an architect but she is good at what she does, her designs are great and her abilities as project manager is one of the best. But she knows that the mayor will not let things go as easily for she goes head to head with him on every change he wants for new City Hall that is out of budget.Matt Brison is a famous architect with very modern designs. He is used to big projects where he get paid good money, but when his uncle, the mayor of Halifax, ask him to come to spearhead his City Hall project, he knows that he must help him, for his uncle was always there for him and his mother while he was growing up and he owes him.When he shows up at the construction site and meets Eve he knows that his job will not be as easy as he thought. Especially when he learns that the original designs were hers and now he is the one that will be designing City Hall and taking that job away from her but he cannot help feel attracted to her since their first meeting.Now he has to work closely with her if that means compromising a little so be it but when he realizes that someone has broke into Eve's home, it is up to him to find a way to keep her safe.Eve does not want anyone to know that the person who broke into her house is her ex-husband of two weeks and that he is now stalking and harassing her. Especially since she never told anyone but the authorities the truth of why she was divorcing him.Their relationship starts rough, but Matt will do everything to be a part of Eve's life and make things easier for her, even if she makes things a little difficult by not always trusting him with everything going on. He may a be a successful and famous architect, but he knows that what he has found with Eve is something special and something worth fighting for.Matt is a nice, sweet and fun character, I love that he is understanding and does not think that everyone must bow to his whims professionally. He is loyal to his family and is very protective to those he cares about.Eve is strong character with a back of steel and a very witty mind that will make you laugh. Not many could do what she did and break a marriage after only two weeks like she did when she opened her eyes and realized her mistake. She may be the first in her family to break tradition and divorce, but she did what was best for her, even knowing she would not have the support of her family in her decision.I loved Desire by Design by Paula Altenburg, it was fun, sweet, sexy and fast paced with just the right amount of intrigue and passion to make it just perfect.

$review_text.: I quite enjoyed 'The Prophet' (and recently enjoyed 'Stone Eater', another of Brent's short stories) and am interested to read more of his work - especially stories centered around the Wanderer character from Prophet. Unlike some of the reviewers here, I went in with the expectation that it was a short story, not a novel, so I wasn't expecting page after page of character development and intricate sub-plots. There are a million details that could be fleshed out from this story (tell us about the journey from Spokane to Calgary, for example) and I look forward to exploring the Wanderer's post-apocalyptic world.

$REVIEW.: I honestly do not usually like stories about billionaires, the rich, etc. even though there are so many of those types of books out right now. However, I do love Nina Croft&#8217;s paranormal and futuristic books so I decided to give this one a read. I am so glad that I did. She has taken an overused theme in my opinion and turned it into something original. I thoroughly enjoyed Out of Control (Babysitting a Billionaire). No tormented billionaire or conflicted helpless young woman in sight. Instead, she has given us a strong, capable, competent female lead. It&#8217;s just hard not to admire and like Dani. Zach, on the other hand, he had to grow on me. He is however, an authentic character that I would expect to find as a playboy.With the characters there is an interesting plot which has a smooth pace with a bit of suspense and lots of romance. Just what I like. A real winner.

$REVIEW.: The male on the hunt, searching not for food, but for the perfect mate, is an epic and difficult quest man has undertaken since the dawn of time
 The primal desire to meet and mate has been programmed into human kind since we first walked the earth
 The male quest to find Ms


Right is an eternal journey; sometimes a victorious one, but often a frustrating endeavor

 Tyler Powers' new book, How To Talk To Women, gives readers the answers to the age old dilemma of how to approach a woman in a way that will intrigue her and win her heart.What makes Powers' book so compelling are the intimate and sometimes embarrassing details of his personal journey to finding his "Eleven." The clear lesson from Tyler's journey can be summed up in the age old adage "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."  He tells the reader the meticulous and painful details of all his mistakes, from a horrible date with Isabel, where he tried to micromanage every minute of the date, to longer relationship where he did the opposite, and let himself be walked all over, and ignored his own needs


 Through these lessons, he makes himself into man who can approach and speak to a woman with confidence, poise, and magnetism

Learn from his lessons, and avoid the pitfalls men have worked to overcome for centuries, and you will find your "Eleven;" the woman of your dreams.

$review_text.: I read THE SABLE CITY because I've read other stories from this author and really enjoyed them. These were short stories, though, so decided i wanted to try something with more meat so-to-speak. Well, THE SABLE CITY is like a five course meal at a five star restaurant. The story truly belongs in the epic category yet reads very fast--mainly because you want to find out what happens next. The novel is filled with colorful characters, my favorite(perhaps because I am male) being Matilda Lanai, though she goes by Tilda. Tilda is everything a reader would like to see in a heroine--sexy, beautiful, intelligent, and yes she's damn good with all kinds of weaponry, including but not limited to swords, daggers, clubs and bows and arrows. All kinds of interesting creatures can be found in this epic fantasy--stirges, piercers, hobgoblins, bugbears, bullywugs, and dragons, and more. THE SABLE CITY is a fun literary read. Highly recommended for those lovers of epics and new worlds. And this was only book one--wow!
$SUMMARY.: Epic Literary Talent!

The author is a true christian in her beliefs to understand what she went through was a trial and rely on GOD to see her through it. I enjoyed the book as a lesson to not ever take life for granted and to be truly thankful for your health and well being.

$REVIEW.: Yes, I did buy the Heating up the Holidays 3-pack just to read Snowfall by Mary Anne Rivers. I'm sure I'm not the only one to feel that way (no offense to the other lovely authors) but am I exaggerating when I say that she may be one of the most exciting romance authors to recently debut? She swept me away with the achingly romantic The Story Guy and with Snowfall, she solidified my enthusiastic opinion of her writing. No area of my heart remained unscathed. For such a short piece of work, Snowfall &#8211; and the brave but somewhat doomed Jenny made a staggering emotional impact. And Evan &#8211; strong and compassionate and full of integrity &#8211; he won my heart completely.

$review_text.: Oh. My. Goodness. Let me say that again, oh. My. Goodness.I don't know if you saw my review of Good Vibrations but if you did, then you would know how much I enjoy that book. Definitely my favorite summer book! It had the perfect amount of drama, tension and the book overall will leave you wanting more. I fell in love with not only Evan *swoons* but even Mallory as well, she was such a headstrong and independent character that you can't help but just look up to her. And darn it, I fell in love with those two even more in Good Intentions.At the very end of Good Vibrations there was a teaser for Good Intentions and when I read it I was just like, "Whaaaaat. Oh no she did-n't!" plus *head swivel* But when I finally got to read the sequel, all was made clear for me...Here's what you need to do, if you've read Good Vibrations, multiply that to maybe a billion and then you'll get Good Intentions. S.L. Scott really pushed herself in this one because you don't just see a progression in the story but you also see a maturity and growth in the characters. Mallory, having gone back to her homestate, obviously had difficulty leaving the love of her live but she got through it, you know? She never doubted Evan (but of course, there were times when she was unsure of him because let's be honest, he's a chick-magnet, on purpose and not.) The distance between them plus Evan's mom's conniving she-devil ways were the obstacles that they faced that really threatened to tear them apart. I'm very excited to see what Mallory will do next in the third book (I recommend that she give Evan's mommy-dearest a good, hard bitch-slap. I volunteer!)I adored Evan even more here. I was pretty shocked during the first few part of the book because I never expected that have happened to him, I mean, seriously? The guilt that he had to be carrying must've weighed like a ton of bricks. But moving on (no spoilers, hehe), Evan, coming from a wealthy family with a very cutthroat business, stepped up his game. He started taking big responsibilities and actually working for what he wanted, a future with Mallory. It was cool reading in his POV as well because you could really see what he went through, the "temptations", the struggles and all that. He didn't have it easy either but through it all, he was a guy with a goal and nothing ever hinders those kinds of guys.S.L. Scott didn't sugarcoat this book with uber-cute moments and things like that, Good Intentions was filled with hurt, anger, passion and even hotter naughty scenes than its first book, it was very real and it will, without a doubt, grip you. There are characters that you will love and root for and there are also characters that you just want to get run over by an eighter-wheeler. #Truth I enjoyed this book even more than Good Vibrations and I'm positive that I'll love the third one just as much (or more!). It's not just the characters that mature every book, it's the author as well. S.L. Scott has her own signature writing style but you can definitely see a shift to her prose that will appeal to the readers. I can't wait for more Evan!! Ahem, I mean, Evan and Mallory. *awkward laugh*Rating: 4/5Official blog post: [...]

$REVIEW.: This was not a difficult read.  The language was not difficult.  It'a a middle-school book, but I think some high-school readers would like this.  This is not for the "Twilight'(Sparkly-vampire/Fluffy Werewolf) crowd.  THis is for kids who like some mild horror, but not too much.  There is no gore here.The protagonist is a Robert, starting at the New Middle School.  He is raised by his single mom, who means well, but works a lot.  Robert only knows one student at the new school, and it is the bully from his old school.  Robert begins to realize that something at LOvecraft MS is 'wrong,' but he can't identify it.  Hemakes friends with a mysterious girl who knows more about the secrets of the school than she is willing to share.  Robert befriends a two-headed rat - who also knows more than he is willing to share.  I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but the book manages to follow some parts of the Lovecraftian Mythos without being too spooky or gory.  It's more of an adventure book with some horror aspects than a straight-up horror story.No sex.  No violence. No inappropriate language.  No gore.  The story is well paced.  Adults and Teachers (human ones) are depicted positively.  A bully turns out to be not so bad.  Characters are menaced, but not injured.  Some humans are possessed by demons.  Some 'black magic' is used.  There is demon possession of some characters.The writing is relatively fast-paced.  Characters are well developed.  I think that students who liked "Goosebumps" and similar stories would like this.

$REVIEW.: Who doesn't love barbequed chicken? I grill at least once a week during the summer, and the majority of the time I cook chicken. So, I'm always looking for new recipes to try out. I was delighted to find this cookbook. So far I've tried the "Lemon Grilled Chicken Breasts," "Grilled Chicken Breasts With Ginger and Soy," and the "Blackened Cinnamon Chicken." They're great! This weekend I plan to try the "Grilled Chicken With Moroccan Spices," it sounds delicious.Some of the recipes require that you marinate overnight, so they take a little advance preparation, but a lot of them are quick and easy. The hardest part is deciding which one you're going to try!If you like barbequed chicken, you need this book. Get out and grill!

$REVIEW.: Light and breezy with familiar characters who all get what they truly want in the end, the book has some funny bits about the current literary scene of MFA writing groups, journals and publishing in general. I enjoyed it, though I suspect the author is employing one of the techniques for success that the characters disparage. Namely, choose a hobby, knitting, stained glass, baking, and write a book with that as your setting. Everyone who does that hobby will buy your book. There are 2 million knitters in the United States, how many want to be writers?

$review_text.: This is the first in the Broslin Creek series by Dana Marton although they were published in a different order.Murphy Dolan has just returned home from his second tour of duty to find a woman in his bed. The problem is that she's holding a gun on him and he has no idea who is she or why she is in his house. Kate Bridges is on the run from an assassin and doesn't believe that the FBI can be trusted. The two come to temporary terms and Murphy find himself wanting to protect Kate.It's a thrill ride of a story. I was immediately captured by the situation, dialog and characters. A great suspenseful romance with a mystery stalker and a few twists that surprised me.And a little humor throw in which I love from an author. Best line: &#34;Holey mocha truffles!&#34;Totally worth the read. I want to read more by Dana Marton.I received a copy of this book from the author.

$REVIEW.: I'm so glad I found this book. I now feel that for the first time I've got a handle on what may be CAUSING my inability to lose weight for the last 2+ years. This makes perfect sense. I also bought a couple of other books on this subject, including his more extensive book. One of the books I bought suggests we should eat 6 times a day, and denigrates books like this one which say just the opposite: 3 meals a day, no snacking. Richards explains it perfectly, to my way of thinking: &#34;Snacking between meals is like a repetitive stress injury to the pancreas. The pancreas does not have time to get ready for the next meal ... [Lots more detail in the excluded part of this excerpt]...This means that insulin stays elevated ...The prolonged insulin response shuts off fat burning so o weight loss is possible.&#34; He goes on to describe the vicious Catch-22 that results.Okay, so that's for the cause. happily. Richards also offers a lot of help to get your metabolism back on track and your hormones properly self-regulating again. I don't have enough experience to be able to say how effective his advice is, but it makes sense to me, and that's an important start as far as I'm concerned.

And more tragic she lives in a time when a woman is considered ruined even though she is not at fault. But I loved her fight, her will to rise above idol gossip mongers and try to find happiness in the aftermath.Her parents and brother want to protect her yet they truly are not like the normal society and allow her to remain with them, I am so glad they did, because oh how I love Daniel, rake or not this man is gorgeous. Or as Rebecca calls him an adonis. I agree, and more than that he sees past what was done to her, sees her beauty, wants to protect her. There is an immediate chemistry and this man who did not want to marry until he was ready, may just be rethinking all that. And not just because of his dying fathers ultimatum.Lady Rebecca stopped to admire one of the roses. Still a relatively young Bloom cupped in her hand.&#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful&#8230;so pure and undamaged.&#8221;&#8220;It is well protected from the elements here. But flowers which are not so well protected are just as beautiful.&#8221;&#8220;But not pure.&#8221; He blanched. She sounded so defeated &#8211; as if by his insult, Newthorpe had stolen the last of her fight. He waited a moment, choosing his words carefully.&#8220;There are different kinds of purity my lady. I believe purity in heart and mind are most important. A flower may have a blemish which was cause by a violent storm, but its fragrance will remain sweet and its beauty intact.&#8221;Ohhhhhhhhh this rake won me over right then and there with that statement. And right then I was rooting for him to take her and make her his forever. I wanted Rebecca to have her happily ever after.So I read this book in one entire sitting in about 5 hours and OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK. I can not say that enough. How absolutely tender and patient Daniel was with Rebecca, how as much as he did not want to admit to being in love, to falling in love, to thinking he would just marry to have an heir to please his father, Rebecca changes all of that.And Rebecca accepting his hand in marriage thinking it is a nice offer and really her only hope of ever being married learns with Daniels tender touch that marriage and love with a man is not anything like what she first experienced.Of course what is a book without some twists and there are some in here and Daniel and Rebecca certainly have their bumps along the way, but in the end, wow what these two share is so amazing. The love scenes are always so tender, enticing, exciting, titillating and oh make you want to hurry through the in between parts to see how they interact in the next scene, will she explore more, will he be restrained or will he finally just show her everything. Oh man I could not put this book down and once you open it up neither will you.

$review_text.: Good action, good plotting, some grammatical errors, but nothing to throw anyone off. This is a rough tale, an apocalyptic world where only the strong survive. Adrian is a strong character who is suffering from soul-crushing grief and heads to the mountains in what appears to be a death wish.  What he sees there will drive him to the brink of insanity, until one action brings him to his senses.  This is a realistic book, filled with heavily violent scenes as Man has basically been thrown back to the Stone Age. Be warned that some scenes will be hard to take.

$REVIEW.: Overzealous fan or crazed stalker?About THE CHRISTMAS STALKING:Country music superstar Destiny appears to have it all. Beauty, money, and fame. But it's not all glitz and glamour. Being a celebrity comes with a price--loneliness, and now threats from an unknown stalker.With Christmas approaching, and as the danger escalates in Nashville, Destiny has no choice but to disappear. She escapes to her grandparents' cabin in the Adirondack Mountains near the tiny Village of Serenity & Peace.It seems to be the perfect choice for a hideout. Longing for the serenity and peace she experienced there as a child, Destiny sheds her celebrity persona and resumes her long-forgotten identity as Holly Stone.This is a good, quick mystery laced with faith. I was first drawn to the book when I learned it was based in the Adirondack Mountains, as my contemporary romance is, too. Once I started reading, I realized her heroine, Holly Stone, has a lot in common with a character I sketched out and sent chapters to newsletter subscribers back in 2010. A celebrity who gets in trouble and returns to her roots.Holly's story has a few characters that could be her stalker, and I had trouble figuring out if there truly was a stalker, and if so, who. I love that it took me awhile. The mystery element is strong in this book. However, I would have loved to have it longer and dive more into Holly and the other characters. As a fan of the Adirondacks, I selfishly wanted more so we could see more of the Serenity hamlet.If you enjoy a good, clean, suspense that you can read in one sitting, check out Lillian Duncan's THE CHRISTMAS STALKING.I received THE CHRISTMAS STALKING as a free .pdf from the author in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: This book is just so convoluted

It could be a smash if the author could go back and make it more exciting
The book took a long time for me to read because I would not read it for days because it bored me


I think the author needs a &#34;do over&#34; on this book.

$SUMMARY.: Do over!!!!!

$REVIEW.: The first two books were good, and this was ok. I thought some of the passages were a little long winded. And it went over and over the same topic, her past. However there was a little intrigue. Also, I was a little thrown off by all the typographical errors.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book I've read by Cynthia, but it won't be my last.  This was a great story, I couldn't put it down until the end and even then I wanted to read more of Drake and Paige's story.  It was too good to be so short - I want more, more, more...If you love alpha, shifter, possessiveness, then this is a must read. I didn't realize this was the third book in the trilogy, so I'm going back to read the first two.
$SUMMARY.: Another Great Alpha Shifter Novel!
