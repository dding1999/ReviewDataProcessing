$REVIEW.: One certainly to read all three books in this series.  I bought the middle book at Walmart and did not realize that it was a series.  I would not start reading it until I had the other two in my possession.  All three are good Christian books.  I enjoyed reading them.

$REVIEW.: Cloud Walking was a great companion to Find You in the Dark. We first meet Rachel and Daniel in FYitD where we see the bumpy road their friendship travels on the way to becoming something more. In Cloud Walking we get a more in depth look at what really was going thru their minds as they both fought their feelings and fears of becoming more than friends with each other in a multi POV. In it we also find out what they really thought of Maggie and Clay's relationship. I liked these two in FYitD and I really liked getting more back story on them.
$SUMMARY.: I loved Rachel and Daniel's story

$REVIEW.: Overall, I enjoyed this book. It's a neat story line, different from the typical vampire romance novels. But the end left so many unanswered questions. It just kind of ended. Yes, I know there is two more books after this one, I just felt it shouldn't have ended so abruptly.

$REVIEW.: A package arrived yesterday and I opened it with my daughter. She asked what it was and I told her "It's a Book." She asked what book and I told her again, "It's a Book, that's the title." So you can imagine how that conversation continued. So like any kid with a present, I immediately tore into the package and read it cover to cover. It's a quick read as it's a children's book but there is some good adult humor mixed in as well.The book has three main characters: a mouse, a monkey and a jackass. Basically the monkey is reading this thing called a "book" and the jackass is trying to figure out what a "book" is. His questions run the gamut from asking if it has to be plugged in and if you can blog with it. It's a great comparison for all of the digital media out there and most adults and kids will find the humor in the book. Once we see the jackass try out the book he becomes enthralled and sits and reads for hours.As a kindergarten teacher, and not a prudish one at all, I will definitely read this book in class but I think I will have to refer to the jackass as a donkey to keep it clean for the kiddos. Even my daughter read that animal name and wondered about the appropriateness. I can just see the kids going home to tell their parents that their teacher read them a story about a jackass!

$REVIEW.: I just finished this book and I have to say I loved it. It took be a bit to remember who was who since I didn't re-read the first book before starting this one. But it didn't take me long to remember what was what and once I got into it I just couldn't put it down. What I like about this book is there's many opportunities for the author to take you down a dark path so I'm pleasantly surprised when I think something is going to happen and the opposite does instead. That kept me engrossed in the book because I couldn't predict what was going to happen. I really enjoy the love that's described between Marcus and Breesen, its not too mushy and it has a 'real' feeling. There were a few times the story moved a little slow for me and I'm stil not sure how the title and the cover play in to this story but other than that this was a great read that I would definately recommend.
$SUMMARY.: Great Read!! Marcus and Morgan!! What's not to like..

$review_text.: Its hard to know where to start but I guess I will take a stab at it.  If you have any intention of being faithful to the magesterium of the Church, this book is not for you.  Sister Joan, in this book, openly criticizes and questions several aspects of her faith which have been infallibly defined.  Whether or not non-Catholics believe in papal infallibility is irrelevant, as a Catholic sister, she is supposed to.  It is unfortunate to see how far away from the faith she has fallen and how much she disregards her profession and her vows.  The Holy Rule of Saint Benedict, which she vowed to live her life by says the following of obedience:"The first step of humility is unhesitating obedience, which comes naturally to those who cherish Christ above all. Because of the holy service they have professed, or because of dread of hell and for the glory of everlasting life, they carry out the superior's order as promptly as if the command came from God himself. 5The Lord says of men like this: No sooner did he hear than he obeyed me (Ps 17[18]:45); again, he tells teachers: Whoever listens to you, listens to me (Luke 10:16). Such people as these immediately put aside their own concerns, abandon their own will, and lay down whatever they have in hand, leaving it unfinished. With the ready step of obedience, they follow the voice of authority in their actions. Almost at the same moment, then, as the master gives the instruction the disciple quickly puts it into practice in the fear of God; and both actions together are swiftly completed as one.It is love that impels them to pursue everlasting life; therefore, they are eager to take the narrow road of which the Lord says: Narrow is the road that leads to life (Matt 7:14). They no longer live by their own judgment, giving in to their whims and appetites; rather they walk according to another's decisions and directions, choosing to live in monasteries and to have an abbot over them. Men of this resolve unquestionably conform to the saying of the Lord: I have come not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me (John 6:38).This very obedience, however, will be acceptable to God and agreeable to men only if compliance with what is commanded is not cringing or sluggish or half-hearted, but free from any grumbling or any reaction of unwillingness. For the obedience shown to superiors is given to God, as he himself said: Whoever listens to you, listens to me (Luke 10:16). Furthermore, the disciples' obedience must be given gladly, for God loves a cheerful giver (II Cor 9: 7). If a disciple obeys grudgingly and grumbles, not only aloud but also in his heart, 18then, even though he carries out the order, his action will not be accepted with favor by God, who sees that he is grumbling in his heart. He will have no reward for service of this kind; on the contrary, he will incur punishment for grumbling, unless he changes for the better and makes amends."Every Benedictine house is supposed to read from the Rule everyday of their lives.  I guess sister Joan just skips over the parts of the Rule she doesn't like.For a much more faithful approach to Benedictine Spirituality I would suggest any of the following:Earthen Vessels: The Practice of Personal Prayer According to the Patristic TraditionThe Path of LifeAn Unexciting Life: Reflections on Benedictine SpiritualityCommentary for Benedictine Oblates: On the Rule of St. BenedictCommentary on the Rule of St. BenedictThe Road to Eternal Life: Reflections on the Prologue of Benedict's RuleToward God: The Ancient Wisdom of Western PrayerSpiritual Life and Prayer: According to Holy Scripture and Monastic TraditionA Guide to Living in the Truth: Saint Benedict's Teaching on HumilityPeace,

$REVIEW.: Like usual, I pick books I picked up A Question of Time without reading anything about the book but simply just basing the book entirely by the look of the cover. I know, it's a bad habit. But you can't say you haven't done it too.Thirty minutes into the book and I was hooked. It was so simply written and the main character was so likeable, that you can't help but like the book too. So, seeing as the book looked like a time travel book. I didn't know when the &#34;time traveling&#34; would start.I read and read and I thought, huh, Celia (the main character) doesn't have any paranormal powers, how is this going to work?. Well, ladies and gentlemen, Joanne Renaud, wrote a book that isn't what you or I expected. The time traveling occurred in an unexpected way. It was so unpredictable, that I was in awe. I love it when I don't read the synopsis! It makes the book even more thrilling!I was also curious about how when and how the romance would play out and when it did. I absolutely loved it. The whole storyline was beautifully written and constructed. Though, it shares similarities to various books and movies. But it still held its own uniqueness and wit.In conclusion, Joanne Renaud wrote a beautiful book that was realistic and at the same time, held elements of the classic Time Traveling. It was short and oh so good! A definite unputdownable book!

That is the true mark of a "scroll" type of document in the martial arts.  You can keep coming back to it, and depending on where you are in your path, you will learn new things.  As new questions arise, so do new answers.  As a primer on ninjutsu, this book gives some great anecdotes about training with Hatsumi-Soke in the fairly early days for us westerners.As a student of Budo-Taijutsu and member of the IBDA I first aproached this book for more info on our grandmaster.  After reading it in two days I walked away and thought "wow, what neat stories."  As my path developed I found that it answered many of my questions and still does.  Buy it, read, repeat.

$REVIEW.: I love all of Dee Henderson's books, but the O'Malley series stands out as my favorite, probably because they were the first books I read that were written by her.  She is a gifted storyteller who obviously loves the Lord.  I love characters that have qualities that are heroic, but also are still human.  "Danger in the Shadows" is the prequel to this series and it is also a really good book.  I am looking forward to reading everything that Ms. Henderson writes and wish her many happy years writing in the future!

It was goodbye Matt, welcome  Jack McCall.  I was hoping Matt would forgive me. He did, but he reappeared in my life again in The Original Alibi. I now remember why I had fallen for him the first time. He still talks directly to me, and I respond.The Original Alibi is yet another wonderful book by David Bishop, in the style of Agatha Christie. Once again, we have a super plot and the introduction of another lovable character, Axel. All this, mixed with a screwball family, makes for a delightful as well as suspenseful reading.I can't get enough of David Bishop's writing.  Read him and get hooked too.

$review_text.: Lady Emily is determined to be belle of the ball in this irresistible romantic romp.La Petite Four is the sweet, playful tale of sixteenyear- old Lady Emily's self-discovery on her way to finding love and having a ball--literally!Emily and her three best friends can't wait for the year's biggest party: the Coming-Out Ball that will plunge them into the seductions, scandals, and decadence of nineteenth-century London Society. But when dashing Lord Robert puts a wrinkle in their plans, Emily and her crew hatch an investigation to expose his dark side--a move which puts them right in the path of the stubborn, yet curiously attractive James Cropper. Readers will have to fluff up their ball gowns and hang on to their corsets as Emily decides between Robert and James, love and independence, and ultimately discovers just how far she'll go to follow her own heart.La Petite Four had romance, mystery, friendship, and an unwanted wedding arrangement. Now the mystery really wasn't on the edge-of-your seat, desperately wanting to know who the killer/thief was.It was a different, which of the gossip is true, what is he doing or want, kind of mystery. The friendship part of the book was really good and they had a cute name for themselves. There were some times were their friendship didn't feel believable but then you believed them. Emily was a sarcastic, sort-of independent girl for her times, which was great. The romance was really good and the unwanted marriage arrangement is what starts the story and is where it really starts. Overall this was a very good historical fiction story but it could have been a bit better, but it is still enjoyable and a fun read. The ending left you wondering if there will be a sequel. If there's not going to be a sequel then the ending really wasn't that good.-Carol[...]

For instance it doesn't mention Parsons joints and some of the joint descriptions are really lacking, like the locked miter (totally useless description).Overall better than average with very good production values, but not comprehensive and IMHO poorly organized.  The index is also less than great and some of the joint descriptions are at best sketchy to useless.

$review_text.: Now I understand this writer is still in her teens, but that doesn't excuse putting out work like this. I wouldn't call it garbage because time and effort was spent behind this but this story was definitely lacking in terms of plot work, not to mention the editing issues. A story about a pimp, and don't get me started on the amount of characters introduced within this story, the obscene language even if it is street lit was completely over-the-top. I struggled literally struggled to make it through this book because it came highly recommended, but I honestly don't know why? The plot contained several holes in it and it was as if the story wasn't properly thought out. Some stories you feel could be written in probably a better way or more engaging style but this is a story I wouldn't read in any style. The female characters were not properly differentiated to make for individual characters except for their looks.This author clearly has a lot to work on to truly make a name for herself in the urban lit game, much improvement is needed!!!!

Now, I'm not going to be giving up my "traditional" romances, eve, but now that I know good m/m can be found, I'll be revisiting this genre again.I blame my change of heart on Brigid Kemmerer's YA paranormal, SECRET, which I recently read and loved. While talking to other readers, finding some recommendations, and digging through GR and Amazon, I came across A.M. Arthur. After reading a few reviews, I felt like this might be a good place to start. It was my lucky day when I found No Such Thing up on NG! I can honestly say that I am very glad I requested this title!I liked Ale and Jaime, they were the perfect mix of sweet and sexy, both as individual characters, and, of course, as a couple. I loved the chemistry and growing connection between them as well.No Such Thing was very sexy and there was plenty of heat between these two young men. The scene at the gay bar both fun and extremely hot, as was the scene at Ezra's house right after that. I'll admit, I was kind of hoping that particular scene would be gone a bit further, but I can see now that Jaime and Ale have plenty of time to experiment, if they both wish to; right now it's about the two of them.There's a few issues in town, including a few fights with the local idiots who hate gays, which helped to add some tension to the book.My only complaint? The ending felt a bit too quick, and left me hanging.I enjoyed No Such Thing, and finished it very quickly. I will definitely be trying more books by this author, and in fact I can't wait to see what book 2 will be like!If, like me, you are tempted to try some m/m romances, I would suggest picking up No Such Thing. I'm not an expert on the genre, but I can tell you this: I loved following this cute couple, through the good and the bad.4 STARS!~ * ~ * ~For my full review, including favorite book quotes, please visit my blog, TBQ's Book Palace.Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest reviewTheBookQueen

$REVIEW.: I got this book because someone I know sadly has to deal with the loss of a child and the only good thing about the whole situation is that this is their first time, which also means they will need all the help they can to cope and keep moving forward
I did read the book myself and the content is very informative and I think it will greatly help them with their loss

I guess the biggest problem for me will be how to give them the book without hurting them more

If you or someone you know is about or lost a child recently, then this would be a good gift.

$review_text.: I truly enjoyed this book.  Alesha Escobar is a wonderful storyteller and weaves an alternate world where magic is commonplace and those than wield it hold the world in the balance.The story takes place during an alternate World War II and starts with people trying to kill our heroine, who goes by many, many names.  The story will take you from battle to battle, with few breathers in between.  Filled with mysteries and betrayal, the main character must make her way through France, complete her mission, and not get killed in the process.  Did I mention that she seems to grown enemies as quickly as she loses allies?To add to that, I loved the way the book ended.  It had a twist ending I would have never seen coming, and yet made total sense in hind sight.The only thing I did not like about this novel was the editing.  Though the book was edited well enough for me to read and review it, it did take longer than usual for me to read and the errors were plentiful, though they rarely detracted from the reading (unless you're an editor, in which case you can't help but notice).  The errors I found were almost always systematic, meaning she made the same mistakes throughout the entire novel.  With a proper editor, this book would have been well worth five stars.Source: Gifted by AuthoreReader: Stanza for iPadFile type: ePub

$REVIEW.: 3.5 starsBlurb:In &#8220;Love in All the Wrong Places&#8221;, Annie tried her hand at online dating, but it brought her nothing but a broken heart. This girl can't seem to catch a break in the dating world! While wondering what went wrong once again, she met an attractive, funny and sincere hip hop dancer in the parking lot at work. But just as Casey expressed interest in taking her out, he had to leave town to tour the country with an up and coming pop star. Annie was willing to wait for him to return, but then she received an apologetic text from Nate, the last guy she met on Craigslist.Join Annie on her adventures in &#8220;All the Right Things&#8221; as she makes some of the biggest decisions of her life. While she thoroughly enjoyed the time she spent with Nate and is still attracted to him, he screwed her and then ditched her at the bar without a word. Will Annie accept Nate&#8217;s explanation and his heartfelt apology and give him a second chance or will she kick him to the curb? Or will Casey&#8217;s charm and determination to show her how a real man should treat a lady win her over? Or will both of these guys be left in the dust when someone from her past reappears?(less)My Thoughts:This was another fast but fun read. Again we are taken on a journey with Annie. After the heartbreak she went through in the first book she wants to guard her heart. She starts hanging out with handsome dancer Casey. Annie has been enjoying getting to know Casey, but now he is leaving. He is going on tour and will be gone for a while. While being positive about the possibility of something more with Casey people from her past start popping up. She is faced with trying to decide between some thing new and fresh, with old and comfortable. Can she trust them after everything that has happened?While all this drama is happening in her love life she has decided to go after her dreams and audition for a talent competition. Can she keep focused in order to make her dreams come true?I enjoyed this story. It was a quick read. Read it in one sitting. I liked hearing more about Annie and what happened after the last book. I wasn't as engaged with this book like I was with book one. I think that Audrey ended this book well. I am definitely interested in what happens in the next installment. Overall this book was fun. I have enjoyed the series so far.

$REVIEW.: My problem with such substantive constitutional arguments such as this book, is that they are just that-- substantive, and hence subjective (in that they are subject to debate, counter, and rejection).Meanwhile, that the Constitution does not reserve the sovereignty of the states, per se; even the 9th and 10th amendments don't reserve the right of secession, but only the powers not delegated to the government (which are subject to federal interpretation).The national sovereignty of the states, rather, is reserved by the nature of national sovereignty itself-- i.e. it remains unbreakably intact under international law, unless specifically dissolved by the sovereign power in question (which in the case of these states, was the citizens themselves of the respective state).Reading the Constitution and other documents, we do not see any such express and willful dissoution of any state's sovereignty; rather it's the opposite, if anything; therefore the issue is purely objective, and not subject to any discussion-- the states were sovereign nations under the Constitution... and so remain.Until the states realize that they are sovereign nations under international law, which predate the Union, then all even the most perfect substantive arguments will simply be ignored, dismissed and ridiculed; you can lead people to the truth, but you can't make them accept it.In conclusion, only a SOVEREIGN interpretation of state's rights will have any objective meaning; arguing the Constitution against the federal government, meanwhile, is simply telling the juggernaut that it has no right to crush you; while you may be right, it makes no difference.

$review_text.: This book is a gut-wrenching debut from a promising author. After a difficult divorce, a young nurse named Emily goes to Panama for an extended stay with her friend Annie. While she's there, she becomes trapped in the middle of a war and experiences unspeakable things and a terrible loss--I hate to elaborate because I don't want to ruin the story.It took me a long time to finish this book because I experienced a personal loss of my own while I was in the middle of it, and I identified so much with the characters and their emotions that I had to put the story down for a bit for an emotional break. If that doesn't speak to how well-crafted the characters and setting are, I don't know what does. The writing all rang very true.This book moved me, and it informed me about a conflict I knew little about. My favorite books are the ones that introduce me to new places and new information, and Ms. Wilson definitely delivered that.I'm officially a huge fan of Jaclyn Wilson and look forward to reading more of her work!

$REVIEW.: I am officially addicted to this series.  I loved Abby!  She was strong, yet vulnerable and it made watching her journey so much fun.  Sam is such a good guy and a *sigh* cop with ink. This is an "out of order" love story where the babies come before love and an HEA, but it is not cliche.  We do not spend the book *spoiler alert* dealing with all of the complications being preggo with twins can cause and instead we are focused on Sam and Abby building upon the connection they felt the night they met and decided to escape their lives through one another.  Is it an easy road? absolutely not, but it feels authentic even when the past shows rears it's ugly head.  If you have not read any of the other Ink series books, have no worries.  This is a stand alone novel and while there are cross over characters, you do not need any prior knowledge of them to thoroughly enjoy this book. This is a hot, sweet, and complete (yay for no cliffhanger).  I really hope there is another book in this series soon!  I seriously am addicted!

$REVIEW.: This book left me somewhat perplexed.  Books regards life after death and peoples experiences into what happens after death really interest me.  I found this book rather boring.  The first part went on and on and on regards his pain and illness much too long.  Then when he get to the otherside basically all we learned is that we should "serve each other" on this side.  Then we go through his recovery and all the pain, pain, pain again until he finally get well.  Then he and his family go around the country handing out notes to people telling them they care and to have a good day - as well as other free service to communities. I'm not saying that community service and service to our fellow man is not a good thing of course it is.  I guess I just did not enjoy the book.  It wasn't written that well and it just didn't excite me.

$REVIEW.: ** This review is done in conjunction with NerdGirl. For more info check out their FB page **This was a very nice poetry collection. Written well, and flowed, I could really get into the cadence of the pieces. They were touching, and open enough that you can easily relate to them. There's a lot of romance in them, some love, some lust, some sadness, but overall very well thought out pieces. They flow together well, and work in a collection, and you can tell the author has talent for writing. I think he word choice was strong, and really showed me she took time in crafting each detail of the poems, as with short writings like that you really are made in the details. She also tells some stories with the poems, and incorporates modern with history, and weaves them together. This is a strong collection, and I would recommend it to any poetry lover, because I think you'll find something to enjoy within these pages.*I was given a copy for honest review

$review_text.: This is without a doubt the greatest arc of the revitalized X O Manowar yet.  In this volume we get the backstory to the invasion of earth which is pending as the Vine seek to capture or destroy the manowar armor.  The fast paced action and surprise turns get you all ready and set up for the main event:  Aric going to the Vine home world to reek his revenge upon an entire race and planet!  We get to see how all powerful the armor is as Aric reverts to his true Visogoth conquering heritage.  He is well on his way to taking on the entire Vine planet and working toward its destruction when he learns that this world houses what is left of his race, the Visogoths! (Talk about a twist!)  Anyway, the volume continues and wraps up with an unexpected ending which makes you realize that Aric has not only reclaimed his heritage, but also his humanity.The tight story coupled with compelling artwork work together to keep the reader totally enthralled and motivated to see how this will all end.  After all, how many times can a lone individual plan and actually be capable of taking out an entire planet by himself?Valiant continues it masterful storytelling and takes more time than the original in the 1990s to build the backstory to their characters so you have a deeper understanding of, and empathy for, them.  This type of thoughtful build of a character is something which Valiant does better than anyone in the comic industry today and it only gets better with each issue in each series.At the price, it is less than purchasing the individual issues, but in this one volume you get to see all the variant covers which sometimes can be $100.00 each!  So for economy, this is a great buy.  For a fast paced and well illustrated story, this is a great buy.  So, with all of that, what are you waiting for?  Go out, get this, and prepare to be thoroughly entertained.  Then, check out some of the other Valiant series which are equally as good.  Go trade paperbacks!  You won't be sorry!

$REVIEW.: Purchased the kindle version for the Ipad to research volcanoes for a science fair project my 6 year old daughter was doing.  We had tried to watch a documentary on volcanoes first, but it was too intense and scared her.  So I decided to look for a book, thinking it wouldn't be so dramatic in still picture, and was happy to find a few for kids.We both really enjoyed this book.  I even learned a lot about volcanoes and now my 6 year old is telling everyone she sees about the different kinds of volcanoes.  It's adorable, I'm impressed with what she learned, and I learned a lot too!  My favorite tidbit my daughter has been telling everyone is this:  &#34;When the magma chamber can't hold up the volcano anymore, it goes SPLAT, like a pancake!&#34;  I don't think the pancake reference was in the book, but I find it hilarious that she compared the caldera formed when that happens to a pancake.

$REVIEW.: I had already read Teardrop when I picked this one to read.  This novella has three chapters.  The first gives you Ander's story giving some background to the Seedbearers, their origins and their task. The second is a chapter from Teardrop that gives you an insight into Eureka's personality and the third is also a chapter from Teardrop - their meeting. It was worth the money to know more about Ander, but the two additional chapters could have also been something new or different from the novel. Still very much worth the read.  Looking forward to the next part of the story.

$REVIEW.: This book is an ingenious YA novel that will pull at the reader's imagination and keep them entranced throughout.  Even when there is a moment of inaction, there's descriptions of things going on, definition of character development and more that fills in the gaps seamlessly.  And even though the main character is a girl, there's enough going on that will have both genders enthralled.This book brings alive the mystical mysteries of the Egyptian culture, past and present.  A revolution, spiders, secret passages, paranormal happenings, knowledge of the ancients and adventure awaits the reader.  I found myself wishing there was some good Egypt shows on cable to keep my curiosity piqued.The main character, Olivia, finds herself faced with new discoveries not just underground but right there in her life.  Things that she thought were black and white turn out to be a bit different and one of her social enemies turns out to be much closer to her than either every knew.  Other people in her life, that she trusted, are also found to be covering up the truth of themselves until the time is right for them to strike.  So many changes she goes through in such a short time.I felt that some of the actions were a bit disconnected from the actual moments involved.  There wasn't a direct flow that was needed and made some of the story a bit harder to actually envision.  There were also some grammatical errors here and there that sidetracked me enough to distract me from the story itself.  Other than that, this story is one that wraps the reader up and doesn't let go until way after the last page.This is definitely a good YA book that will attract any reader of Egyptian lore.  I also feel that this touches bases well for anyone who has an interest in social unrest stories and anyone who is just looking for a good, action filled read.  I will be recommending this to my own children, who range in the ages of 15-20 and would recommend this to voracious readers as young as 12.

$REVIEW.: Continuing on with the story that was started in Persephone (Daughters of Zeus #1), this book gives further glimpses and insights into the mythical characters introduced


While some questions were answered from the last story, so many more questions were raised, and the adventure became deeper and even more exciting.While I love these characters, and Persephone is one of my favorite mythological goddesses, she showed more of her naivete, which was somewhat infuriating

On more than one occasion, I found myself saying &#34;It's so obvious, how can you not get that!&#34; to her character's lack of understanding, or connecting dots I thought were a bit obvious
However, having the story dotted with clear signs and clues made it easy to create things for Persephone to figure out later in the story
It also helped bring the story together, keeping the plot flowing with clues that needed discovering, which is necessary, but kept me somewhat annoyed with her


The other characters are all deeper, and the addition of a few new characters added some intense relationship drama for most of the main characters.I enjoyed this installment to the series quite a bit


The increase in angst, mystery and danger was entertaining, and the writing style and voice are great to read

I'm looking forward to reading the next book!*I was given an eCopy of this book, from the author, to read in exchange for an honest review.

 This book has put others to shame, it definitely sets a standard for The Horus Heresy and is one of the biggest reasons why many books from that series seems mediocre:  the story arc rivals that and comes out winning


 With stories like this, I think a lot more is expected from the Horus line and they just don't deliver

I have also enjoyed the works of Tim Powers (The Anubis Gate, etc.), and some other &#34;Steam Punk&#34; creations. This book however is a loser. It is the obvious first in an intended series of what resembles most; modern murder mysteries. The book is NOT a murder mystery, but the structure is exactly the same. The wtiting is uninspired, the period and the characters poorly, no, VERY poorly researched. The two co-investigators: Burton and the bon vivant and poet Swinburne, investigate one of the major Fortean cases of the period. This historical event(s)/phenomena are/were Springheel Jack & The Mad Gasser. (The phenomenae were very similar and seemed to be related and pointless). This could have been a very fun book, bot once again a good &#34;Steampunk&#34; author fails to emerge. Writing ability aside, certain &#34;rules&#34; have been developed for Sci-Fi and Alternate History novels. Essentially, the author is allowed to add an invention or a single historical point of seperation from our reality line. Everything else must remain the same unless changed by the invention or event. This was 21st century  with bowler hats. If you have to be PC writr high fantasy.

$review_text.: Was given a free copy for an honest review. What do you do when you have a naughty fairy tale character? Is she strong willed, lies, or puts herself in danger? You take her to the Spa N K where Master Wolfe will spank her into submission. This book is ADULT ONLY. Jillian and Jake need to find mates so they travel to the matchmaker. On the way Jake takes a tumble down a hill (sound familiar) and Mr. Wolfe stumbles on two and takes them back to his home to get Jake help. While there Jillian is thrown into a world she had never been introduced to before. Jillian remembers, &#34;The spanking he had given her- her first ever- would always be in her mind as the event that opened her eyes to the outside world, and she hadn't disliked it as much as she should have.&#34; This story made me laugh at loud at times and really it's just a cute little story, with some slap tickle along the way. So let Master Wolfe open your eyes to a new way of looking at all those fairy tale characters.

$REVIEW.: Rarely does a book ever scare me but this one... *shivers* this one did. It&#8217;s so good. I felt like I was personally going through the events that the main character, Dharma, went through. If I was ever in her position, I would have left that house way before she did. Heck, I probably would have never have gone back to the house again! But that's what's so good about this book. The reader gets to go on a wonderful, yet, haunting adventure with the characters.This story starts with us getting introduced to the main character, Dharma Moore. Dharma is a normal seventeen year old girl who lives with her mother and baby brother, Benny. Dharma&#8217;s mother is a scam artist, always pretending to be a Paranormal Investigator who can get rid of any ghost and unfortunately, Dharma is always caught in the middle of her mother&#8217;s lying and has to help her. Dharma longs for a permanent home. Somewhere where she and her little brother Benny can live happily but Dharma knows that&#8217;s never going to happen because her mother never puts them first. But things change when Dharma moves into a new house in the Bayou country so her mother can work a job there. When an ancient curse, placed by a now deceased slave, falls upon Dharma, it&#8217;s up to her and a kind local boy named Wolf to break the curse. Little does Dharma know that breaking this curse is going to be harder than she thought. Along the way, she finds herself falling for the handsome, yet haunting, Wolf. He seems to be honest and trustworthy, but will secrets from his past come to ruin the first good relationship she has ever had? Will Dharma be able to break the curse? Or is she destined for failure?I really enjoyed this book. I have read a ton of books that were supposed to be creepy or scary and have never gotten scared before. But this book changed that. It&#8217;s one of the only books that made a chill run down my spine and for that, I applaud the author. The writing was well written and the editing, of course, was spot on. I really enjoyed getting to know all the different characters in the story, especially Wolf and Dharma. They were relatable characters and I felt like I connected with their characters immensely. Overall, I really enjoyed this story! The setting was perfect for the plot of the story and the scenery and physical descriptions were a key element to creating the creepy and eerie atmosphere of the book. Well done!! I recommend this book to everyone!My favorite quotes from the book:&#8220;Groovy!&#8221; Mom said, eyeing the dilapidated mansion.&#8220;Creepy, you mean.&#8221;&#8220;No, it&#8217;s perfect.&#8221;&#8220;Right. Perfectly creepy.&#8221;Wolf listened for a moment, then shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear it now. Maybe it&#8217;s a gang of rats plotting an uprising.&#8221;&#8220;&#8230;.With you, it wasn&#8217;t about looks or being popular. I&#8217;ve dated tons of chicks but none of them were very nice or fun to hang with. They were all into themselves, their hair and makeup. But you&#8217;re different. I can just be me for a change. I don&#8217;t have to be perfect, or the star of the show. And neither do you.&#8221;

$REVIEW.: I bought this book,even tho I didn't like the last one very much, because I've read them all and I'm OCD and I HAVE to finish this series. I like this series, I don't love it, the main reason being that the characters and story are just too perfect in a annoying way.The constant reminder of how they're all so beautiful, so funny, the constant repetitive sex talk among the girls and the perfection of it all...like I said, annoying. And now, there's so many characters to keep up with that it makes me dizzy. I prefer it when the stories are intertwined but the way this series does it feels sorta messy.I would still recommend it, if you want a light easy read.

He was trying to keep it from his staff, but like any normal situation the rumor mills started. Those were quite interesting to read for sure.I started reading this book and definitely made time to finish it in a timely manner. I couldn't wait to find out what happened to the governess and the rest of the characters in this book.  It was a perfect read for taking my mind off it all. I've read other books by Carrie Turansky in the past, but didn't remember that I've read them. Reading this book reminded me, just how much I enjoyed reading this author's work.

$REVIEW.: Once again, DAVID WEAVER PRESENTS delivered and in a MAJOR way. IDEvenK where to start with this book. It was just THAT DAMN good. There's twists and turns from the very beginning and just when you think you have something figured out, the author drops another twists.This book played out more like a movie than a book. The story flowed effortlessly and transitioned well between the characters. You'll find yourself living vicariously through the characters and wanting a love identical to theirs. This book had me on the edge of my seat, heart beating fast and at times having to put the book down because it was just to much. The ending was definitely a shocker...both parts. Well one part you'll kinda figure out. But the other completely blindsided me.To say this book was good is an understatement. You would want to do yourself a favor and get this book FOR SURE. I'm just happy I was smart enough to buy part 2 at the same time that I bought part 1. Because as soon as I post this review, I'm getting my Kindle to start Part 2. Great job David Weaver and Raymond Franco.

$review_text.: Having just finished this book, I quite enjoyed it, though I believe it is most suited to those who have yet to find the Lord and are intellectually curious. I say "intellectually" because this book is not one to be read lightly or breezed through in quick little jaunts. Mr. Piper gives 50 different reasons why Jesus was crucified ("why" as in the "purpose" and "meaning" of His death). Each reason is short and well explained and supported by many references from the Bible. But sometimes the logic is difficult, especially for those not already steeped into the life and death of our Savior. However, it is great for newer Christians to help them more clearly see the glory of the Lord and would also be suitable for the more intellectually-minded deep-thinkers who have yet to give their lives to God.

I did read this cover to cover and went back to a few sections to hone in on some subtle points


I have been around DSLRs for a while now and I just needed to bone up on the D800 really, really  fast (I had a photo shoot within 7 days of getting the camera)

I ordered the book up whilst my camera was in transit....If you know your camera bodies, shot Nikon before, and need to hone in on the significant but subtle changes

$REVIEW.: An inexpensive "try me" alternative to the Rosetta Stone.The Instant Immersion language series is based on the same learning principle as the Rosetta Stone:  Natural Learning.  It is based on the theory that we learn a language by repetition and continuous exposure to a language or environment.  Theoretically this is true.  However, each person learns in a different combination of ways based on his/her previous experiences and therefore the way in which we learn develops as we age.  How effective any program is, boils down to whether the method of teaching matches that individual's method of learning.This product contains a number of CD s for listening to role-play conversations and role-play games in Spanish on a specific subject, say buying a T-Shirt.  In this script you will be exposed to words for size, colors, numbers and basic phrase such as "I would like___", "Could you please give me___"This product also contains a DVD which is essentially a number of photo-flashcards for word association.  This is only slightly more helpful than the CD s because you can see a video of a man and a woman taking turns speaking the language and you can mimic the way their mouths move in order to refine your pronunciation.In comparison to the Rosetta Stone this product is not as in-depth, comprehensive or as organized.  It is basically a  "light" "try me" mini version of the Rosetta Stone.  At this price, it is a good introductory program for both the learning method as well as Spanish vocabulary.  It does not contain as much grammar or sentence building knowledge as the Rosetta Stone series or the Pimsleur series.  It resembles a phrasebook set to CD.As both a Pro and a Con of this type of product: expect the Spanish version to be similar to the Italian version, the French version, the Japanese version etc.  Works well if you thrive with this learning method but is bad for those that are  bored easily.Recommended if1) You always wanted to try the Rosetta Stone style of learning but are not sure you want to spend that much $ yet.2) You are quite certain that flashcard style learning or audio role-playing works well for you and just want to experience the Spanish language.3) You want to learn Continental Spanish rather than Latin American Spanish.4) You want to have an Audio Phrasebook.

$REVIEW.: I knew when I picked this story I was in for short, but hot time. I wasn't let down. The characters are interesting and the premise of the tale is believable. I find when I read M/M stories, many times the story lines are very stereotypical. Not so with this book. In fact, the human qualities and foibles of Jude and Rob are what made the story memorable. The writing is tight and well paced.What I wanted to see more of was what happened after the story ended. I liked how A.J. Hardcourt crafted the characters, but I wanted to know what happened afterwards. How did Jude's mother react? Don't get me wrong, the story is strong. I just like more details and how things go in the long-term. And granted, I know this is a short tale, so it can't, by nature, be long on details.Still, the sex in this little gem is smoking. I could feel the admiration and lust flowing between Jude and Rob. It was sexy and heated and kind of pretty all at the same time.If you want a story that's quick, but hot, hot, hot, then you need to read In His Bed. I give it 3.5 cherries.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews

I've got to say the panic attacks got to be a bit much for me but other than that it was a very interesting story

Having worked in the prison system for 28 years (6 as a screw) I can honestly say I never witnessed the kind of abuse that Toni endured


That's not to say it didn't happen but I would have never tolerated any such thing

I did witness many things that would make your stomach turn but it was inmate on inmate or inmate on staff

It would be fun to get a sequel to Laura and Toni's story though.

$REVIEW.: I could easily and joyfully write pages of laudatory comments about &#8220;Kendra&#8221; by Edward M Wolfe. I could tell you that the characters are as real as any you&#8217;ve ever actually met or read about. They talk like real people, act like real people and&#8230;as far as I&#8217;m concerned, Kendra and Keith, as well as the other characters, are real people. I could describe a unique plot that is unlike anything else you&#8217;ve ever read; a storyline that includes a large helping of non-mushy romance mixed with portions of metaphysical science-fiction, fantasy and religious contradictions.A brief synopsis, other than the one Mr. Wolfe uses to describe his latest novel, is superfluous, and would run the risk of giving away a piece of the intense emotional ride that awaits the reader. The phrase, &#8220;I could not put this book down,&#8221; is an understatement when talking about Kendra. There are times when a single sentence or phrase is all that&#8217;s required to pass along praise for a book, a story, a great novel and that is&#8230;If you go through only one book a month, or one book a year; if you are cracking open your very first novel, &#8220;Kendra&#8221; is the book you need to read.

$REVIEW.: Kate Cranbrook was born, and ruined, in Kenya. When a coup threatened her safety with her father, she grabbed onto an inheritance in America and fled, at gunpoint.Or did she?You see, Kate lies. A lot. About everything.~*~*~This is a dark, and deeply disturbing story, with a 'heroine' who is extremely difficult to care about. There were points where I truly despised Kate.She does things that simply shocked me, to the core. And, always, there is - to her mind - a logical reason for her choices.As the novel progresses, one starts to disbelieve everything that Kate has said. Her relationship with her father is increasingly disturbing. And it simply becomes impossible to believe that all of the bits and pieces will ever make sense.In an effort to avoid spoilers, all I can say is: Yes, it all comes together. Shockingly.This is a dark, and deeply disturbing story. (It bears repeating.) As such, it takes some intestinal fortitude to get through to the end - I still feel as though I need a shower to wash Kate off.You'll not forget her, no matter how you try. And, perhaps, that is the best recommendation I can offer.~*~*~Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary electronic copy of this book from the publisher [...]. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

$review_text.: Beautifully done Ms. Ormiston! I salute you and can only think of superlatives in describing this piece of excellent writing.I do not wish to repeat what the other reviewers have already said, but the characterization, dialogues and plot development are so superb that I listened to the audible three times and then bought the Kindle edition as soon as it became available.The characters are quite unaltered in comparison to the original and you do not find a single stranger amongst them (Quite a rarity in Austen fan fiction). The dialogue is wonderfully logical and flows naturally in the expression of many conflicting opinions, each befitting the character who holds them (I especially loved the audio reading of said dialogues where the right emotion was injected into each utterance.)This is not an action-packed piece of writing with dramatic twists and turns, rather it does what Ms Austen also set out to accomplish; plausible character portrayal, behavior matching the values and mores of the time, excellent dialogue and flowing writing with an ever present sense of humor. Both main characters retain their pride and prejudice respectively at the outset, and lose them in a most natural, convincing and delightful way.I found the writer's voice to be insightful, mature, carefully observant and of course, very romantic. This Darcy and Elizabeth shall stay with me for a long time.

$REVIEW.: I finished this book 2 days ago, and i still cant seem to get my emotions in check

Jake and Trish have taken up residence in my head and heart and they probably wont be leaving anytime soon.When Gigi asked if I would be willing to read her book i thought sure, why not? I didn't know what to expect, but i certainly wasn't expecting to have my mind blown by a new author with her debut novel
I still don't think that there are enough words to say will do justice to the beauty of the story that Gigi has created
5 stars just doesn't seem to be enough

Books like Unbreakable are the reason that I love to read.For me, when an author can provoke so many emotions in a reader, and make a reader feel as though they are right there by the characters side, that's what makes a good story
And this novel had my emotions all over the place

There were times when the silly banter between the group of friends had me laughing out loud and in the blink of an eye, that laughter turned into ugly crying

Yes, you will need tissues....and lots of them.Trish Wilson's boyfriend Dylan died in Afghanistan while serving his country
His death, coupled with the passing of her father in the same year, left her broken hearted and afraid to love again

Jake Oliver was Dylan's best friend

He's always had a thing Trish but he stayed away out of respect for Dylan
When Dylan was killed, Jake stepped up to the plate and became her source of comfort
It was a tragedy that brought them together, will it be a tragedy that tears them apart?This story is so beautifully written


The characters are so unique in their own ways and well developed


I felt as though i was right there with them with each page I turned
The plot is thought out and it is apparent that a lot of thought and research went into several aspects of this book


To say I am impressed is an understatement

BUt what I loved most in this book is the message that I walked away with: A little bit of love, faith, and prayer can go a long way if you just believe.I cant recommend this book enough and you can be sure that I will be stalking Gigi for more books


A top 5 of 2014 for me without a doubt


Simply put, it's brilliant

Well done Gigi!

A robotic female voice runs all text together from chapter headings to sentence structure. The result is a nonstop run-on of thought. Fragments of text reappear unedited. Inadvertent mistakes occur, as when she states that contradictions in thought "are a wash___ington."

I know I go off of the comments and ratings when I am searching for a new one, so I try to help by adding my two cents.As far as Axel goes, not a fan. I enjoyed the beginning, it hooked me in and I thought it was entertaining the &#34;games&#34; Axel and Izzy were playing with each other. But when they finally did get together it go so boring!!! The dialogue was horrible and unnatural. I found myself skipping a lot of it. I barely could finish the end. Big, bad Axel was a wuss as soon as he and Izzy got together. I understand love makes people softer, but the beginning characters vs the end characters.....not even close to being similar.

$REVIEW.: Joanne Bischof has wrapped up the Cadence of Grace series with "My Hope is Found". This book was so deeply moving and satisfying. Countless times I laughed and cried as I journeyed with the fabulous characters she introduced us to in "Be Still My Soul". She carried us deeper into their hearts in her second book "Though My Heart is Torn", wrapping it up with this final book.Though this book can stand on its own, I would urge the reader to delve into Books one and two first. If I hadn't read both of them first I would be immediately ordering them so I could enjoy more about Lonnie, Gideon, Toby and the other rich characters Joanne has created.Joanne writes with a lyrical style that is so poetic and refreshing. I found myself re-reading her phrasing just so I could take the words and the scenes she created deeper. The author's voice is so uniquely beautiful!In this book we find Gideon returning to Lonnie with the joy and hope of renewing their love now that he is free to claim her as his bride. BUT, things aren't going to go so easy. Through twists and turns that had this reader sitting on the edge of her seat, I found myself drawn to Toby, who also loves Lonnie. Gideon is heart sick but with his hard-headed ways does his best to get Toby out of the picture. The author brings us along on the journey as God works in His mysterious ways in Gideon's heart as well as Toby's and Lonnie's.Get ready to fall in love with both Gideon and Toby. Get ready to find yourself rooting for both men as you watch Lonnie find her way to her one true love. There are countless lessons I learned as I read this book (and the previous 2). There were challenges I faced regarding my own walk of faith. God's peace - God's rest - despite the outward circumstances is waiting. We are challenged to humble our own selves before Him and be content to wait for His plan - which is perfect, to unfold in our own lives. You will rejoice as you see what God has in store for Lonnie, Gideon, and Toby.

$REVIEW.: 3.5 StarsI love prologues that steep the story in a mysterious, tantalizing tone. A teasing snippet that fuels your hunger for more. That's what Kaitlyn Davis did with the prologue of Ignite.I found Kira to be likable, she catapulted the story forward by being fiercely determined, smart, witty, and fun. The other characters were just as enjoyable, but I have to say that I was disappointed in Emma's (Kira's friend) character. She had moments where she was superbly excellent, but her parts were mostly dominated by the cliche of the overly talkative friend. I also found a tiny inconsistency with Chloe's (Kira's sister)  age, she was either four or five, both ages were stated once. There was a bit of unrealisticness as Kira's parents were never 'parenting', I understand the reasoning behind it, but she was constantly getting into trouble (ie. after curfew, not coming home), but never once suffered any consequences.In the first half of Ignite, I was pulled deeply into the emotions surrounding the three main characters. It seemed, though, that near the end the emotions started to taper off, leaving me lacking, but still intrigued. Ignite is a fairly new take on vampires and conduits (aka really cool vampire slayers). The history was well thought-out and the plot had some unexpectedness to it, but at the end, I again felt that it became a little too predictable. The ending gives the reader a complete end, but the knowledge that there is more to come. There were still a few mysteries that were left unsolved that will most likely come to play a bigger part in the future installments. I'm curious to see where the story will lead. I'm crossing my fingers that it's not going to turn out the way the sneak peek suggests.Also, I don't want to be too picky, but even though I LOVE the cover, once reading the story, it doesn't quite fit with Kira and the way I imagined her. I get it, it makes complete sense, but she is described to have strawberry-blonde hair. That is not strawberry-blonde(I would know, I had it until my early twenties. And, yes, it was natural.), I would call it copper. Maybe if the colors were mixed a little bit more, not so chunky? I don't know, but it is still a fabulous, eye-catching cover.

$REVIEW.: I have finally reached an intermediate point in my Japanese studies and along the way have used a lot of different learning resources. Japanese in Mangaland is one of my better buys because the explanations of grammar are very good. Everything is explained in a very thorough and clear way. It is so much better than the textbook we used in my college class.I don't like the manga part, though. The cartoon sections are forced story lines that are just for explaining lesson points or to use certain words. It doesn't work very well.I just use the grammar explanations and ignore the cartoons. The explanations of Japanese grammar are so good that the book is worth it just for that. I have Japanese in Mangaland 1, 2, and 3 and like all of them.

$review_text.: The purpose of this book is NOT to teach about food labels. It is a sermon in favor of organic food. The author made up her mind and then searched diligently to find sources that agree with her point of view. If the entire world population followed her advice I believe someone would have to decide which half of the people would be the ones to stop eating. I agree with much of her philosophy but the book has so many half-truths and pure surmise that I would advise anyone against reading it. The logic seems to be: A has been shown to sometimes cause B, B is probably related to C, therefore if A then certainly C. I would expect more from someone trained in the sciences.

$review_text.: This book by Michael Werner takes the very substantial work and contributions of Jasmuheen about living on light (see pranic Nourishment) from the ashram to the laboratory.  He is a chemist living in Dornach Switzerland and has made himself available for scientific testing of his metabolic functioning after ceasing to eat 1/1/01.  He feels that anyone who believes it is possible to live on light can wean themselves from food and liquids by following Jasmuheen's 21 day transition procedure.

$REVIEW.: One of the reviewers is spot on - Lizzie Church really does know how to use language in a luscious and revealing manner such as 'divested themselves of capes, muffs, boots and all the other accoutrements deemed necessary for a winter's evening in Bath...'.  Accountrements just rounds out the image of folks shucking off their outer garments in readiness for a pleasant evening.  This is, sort of, a typical regency, although there is a bit of mystery which bound me to the book to the point that my husband became mildly irritated. I couldn't tear myself away once we learned more about Lord Barnham's poignent past, and then that of the Great Uncle.  A very nice twist on the typical tale of girl meets boy...Initially I found Cecily to be very shallow as she was so focused on what Mr. Forster looked like, but then as I thought about it, recalling myself at that age, well, how 'normal' she is!  And we later learn that she is made of substance, and that her character is well formed. Likewise I found Mr. Forster very forward in his attentions to Lady Cecily, withe the constant stream of complements, but we later find out that he too is a very good man; one to be admired.Ms. Church does need to pay a bit more attention to history and facts, a bit, though.  I researched and learned that women did not take up the guitar until the late to mid-19th century; the term 'a tad' was in the late 19th century; nor will you find birds finding insects on the ground in the winter; they're hibernating behind bark.  Some language was a bit modern, but I'll forgive this talented author as her story was so intriging.  I do hope that she'll continue to bring her very rich and interesting tales to us!

The Male Stripper is a bold, spicy m&eacute;nage that possesses exceptional writing, offering a voyeuristic opportunity into three peoples' lives as they revel in their sexual fantasia. From the get go, Becca, Cal, and Don are intriguing, enjoyable and likable characters making this story quite conceivable. Their carnal unions are erotic and well orchestrated, taking up many of the pages. Ms. Carew makes sure this short story's erotic ambience dominates. A keeper for sure, The Male Stripper is one that will be opened many more times.EchoReviewer for Coffee Time Romance & More

$REVIEW.: Learn the real facts about what happened before, during and after 9/11.  While reading this book I was amazed at how much information and witness testimony was withheld from the public.  The book details how field agents for the CIA and FBI were hampered and told to back off about the suspected terrorists.  How Osama Bin Laden could have been, should have been captured when in a hospital shortly before 9/11 but was protected and treated like a dignitary by the CIA.  If you believe, like me and millions of others, that the official account of 9/11 is a sham, now with 7 out of ten 9/11 Commission members saying it is a sham or think you can debunk the so-called "Conspiracy Theorists", who are really seeking the real truth, buy and read this book.  If you still believe that elements within the US government had nothing to do with 9/11 after reading this book, then there is really no hope for you because you are too brainwashed.  There are just too many unanswered questions to answer on this obvious cover-up.

$REVIEW.: WOW! The girls known as KIT ROCHA did it again!The dynamic between Rachel, Ace and Cruz is brutal and beautiful. I found myself wanting more and never wanting it to end!We see a different side of Ace that I have been DYING for. This beautiful man is also tragically broken and unknowingly hides behind his hard hitting words, creating the facade that we have come to see and know in previous books. However, deep down he is so vulnerable and so heartbreakingly broken that it killed me to see him in this light. But I definitely feel it was an extremely important layer to add to our sexy man beast, Ace. SwooonnnWe really see Cruz's darkish side and D@MN IS IT HOT! He is demanding and dominating in a very caring and sensual way with both Ace and Rachel. He is a protector, he is dominant, he is loyal, he is a fighter, and he has a huge, huge heart!Rachel really made me happy in this book. I saw her struggles with fully trusting Ace with her heart, but her strength through many ordeals that occurred really made me see more of her that I enjoyed.When you think of a 3 sided relationship, you more than likely think the final blowout will be brutal and steer very clear of the emotional shrapnel that would ultimately be thrown for miles. However, this trio is different. It's almost as if their hearts beat in sync with each other's and cannot continue to beat unless they are all together. This relationship definitely is hard and has its drastic ups and downs (and hot, hard core sexytime!), but don't all relationships?One thing I really love about Kit Rocha is that they don't put out flat stories. There are always multiple layers to each of their stories and this is no exception! We have the trio, the issues with the stills, and many other layers that ultimately make up Beyond Jealousy and all of it ties together in one way or another. I love it and I can't wait for more!!!!

$REVIEW.: A very interesting read.  While I do not agree with Mr. Hayes' view of Objectivism, he makes some valid points, specifically the negative effects of crony capitalism and government bailouts for failing Wall Street businesses.  Mr. Hayes contradicts his own argument though when he puts forward the idea that government intrusion in the private sector is necessary.  Indeed it is that very government mishandling (bailouts) that adds to the financial problems of this country.Mr. Hayes then resorts to name calling, repeatedly referring to followers of Objectivism as sycophants and comparing Objectivism itself with Nazism.  I guess Mr. Hayes missed the part in Atlas Shrugged where it was repeatedly stated that a main tenant of Objectivism is that under no circumstances can physical force be initiated against another person.  Indeed there were times while reading this book that I was wondering if Mr. Hayes had read a different version of Atlas Shrugged than the one I read.Still, I recommend this book to anyone has read any of Ayn Rand's works as semi-reasonable argument to the Objectivist philosophy.
$SUMMARY.: A decent read.

$review_text.: Destroying Angel (Righteous Series #5) by: Michael Wallace continues the saga of a group of polygamist Mormons and the in-fighting between two clans.  The Christianson's, led by Dr. Jacob Christianson and the brutal and almost defunct Kimball's represented by Taylor Jr. continue the feud that started in The Righteous.Jacob's son, Daniel, rescued and adopted from the Kimball's when most of the clan was either killed or sent to prison starts to have alarming visions which Jacob suspects may be triggered from the mental illness that curses his biological family.  Christianson has learned of this proclivity towards schizophrenia by reading the diaries of his Great-great-grandmother.Taylor Kimball is running amuck, hell bent on revenge against the Christianson's. In all of the books in this series the characters are bigger than life and the nemesis border on Ian Fleming villainy.  To give a hint, but not a spoiler, Volcanos and Climate Change are woven into the story.In the bulk of this series most women are treated as nothing but chattel and baby machines but in this iteration we see some of the women come to the fore with problematic results.  I'm growing fond of this series which I only started to gain some insight into the darker side of the LDS religion but I've already Pre-Ordered #6 The Gates of Babylon.

$review_text.: Susan and Alex are your typical New York couple. Young, married with one child, they are trying to make ends meet. Alex is working hard in his photography business, while Susan has put aside a law career to work on an art career. Hiring a nanny to accomplish this goal, finances are tight.When Susan finds the perfect apartment just within their budget, they decide to check it out. When she finds the "bonus room", she knows this is the perfect place for her to make an art studio. The apartment is almost too good to be true.They settle into a routine. The nanny keeps their daughter busy. Alex is working long hours, leaving Susan to her art. Yet she doesn't seem to be able to focus on it. Unusual things begin to happen. Then she begins to notice itchy, red welts, but only on herself. After researching it online, Susan becomes convinced they have bedbugs.She speaks with the elderly landlady, and calls in an exterminator. Even when nothing is found, the problem continues with Susan. She becomes obsessed with bedbugs, and as the situation escalates, she begins to question her own sanity.As the story unfolds, with characters as intriguing as the plot line, there are many twists, turns and unexpected surprises. It is quite a thriller. A very suspenseful novel, I could not put it down. I read it straight through. Though it is admittedly not my usual genre, I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: Everyone else has raved about this book so I want to say something different and useful to those still not convinced. This book is written from the perspective of someone who both knows the T4i and can communicate clearly to the non-professional. The insights in every section make this book exceptionally useful. I don't think you will go wrong buying the digital version especially because with the Kindle or PC version you can find what you are looking for quickly and quickly find every mention of that keyword throughout the book. I have this book both on the PC and the Kindle and like having the camera in hand along with the camera manual in PDF form. One other unique feature is that certain items mentioned in the book are sometimes linked to web sites where you can learn more about the item linked.

 The first book left me feeling so sad because of the way her all broke apart but I felt like there was hope

 The second book was a little nerve recking I thought
 They tried so hard to make it work and it had a couple of very serious OMG moments


 It was a great book because it filled me with so many emotions
 I was happy, turned on, sad and scared

 That means its a great book if I can have a variety of emotions during my reads

 Definitely a book I would recommend.

$review_text.: I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Kellie is dealing with a lot: her sister is distancing herself from the family, her best friend has suddenly stopped speaking to her, her father wants her to be more like her studious sister, she has a new boyfriend, she&#8217;s started working at her mom and stepfather&#8217;s shop, and she&#8217;s joined the school newspaper and made a whole group of friends there. That&#8217;s a lot of changes for one person in such a short time, but Kellie takes it all in stride. Mostly.Families in YA are so often absent, but Kellie has an entire family: mom, stepfather, sister, brother, and stepfather. Every one of them is present in the book. I like Kellie&#8217;s family a lot, with the exception of her father Clayton. He obviously favors Kellie&#8217;s sister Sara because she gets good grades and goes the the right private school, and he&#8217;s unfair to a much more laid-back Kellie. Kellie isn&#8217;t a bad student; she&#8217;s just not an overachiever. The middle of the road is fine (to use one of her favorite words) with her. She doesn&#8217;t knock herself out to get the grades that would impress her father because that&#8217;s now what&#8217;s important to her. She hasn&#8217;t figured her path out yet, but that&#8217;s okay. She&#8217;s only a junior in high school and she has time.Kellie&#8217;s mom is an example of that. When married to Kellie&#8217;s dad, she was a straight-laced paralegal. Since their divorce, she&#8217;s become a tattoo artist and, like Kellie, she&#8217;s a more laid-back person. She values Kellie as much as she does Sara, and even though she initially doesn&#8217;t want Kellie to work in the tattoo shop, she eventually relents and gives her a chance.Kellie has an interesting relationship with Oliver. She almost had sex with him on the day they met, months ago, but stopped herself and hasn&#8217;t seen him since, until she runs into him again with his brother (Sara&#8217;s boyfriend). The new relationship is important to Kellie, but it&#8217;s not her entire focus. She turns down invitations from Oliver to hang out with her newspaper friends and to work at her mom&#8217;s shop and she invites him over while she&#8217;s babysitting her brother but she plays with Finn while Oliver studies.To be honest, I didn&#8217;t really get the &#8220;Oliver is overly clingy and wants to take up ALLLLLLLLL my time!!!&#8221; vibe that Kellie suddenly decides is an issue about 85% of the way into the book. I feel like that came out of nowhere, although there are small hints earlier on &#8212; mostly comments from other people &#8212; that he has an underlying issue. It feels, to me, like Kellie is looking for something to be wrong in their relationship and when she discovers what that issue is, she flips out. She and Oliver don&#8217;t spend all their time together, but he doesn&#8217;t give her grief about the time she spent with her new friends or babysitting her brother either. It&#8217;s only natural that he wants to spend time with her, so Kellie&#8217;s realization that Oliver wanted more from her just seemed a little contrived. Up until that point, I thought they had a pretty good relationship and that she even goes about deciding to have sex with him in a healthy way.As Kellie&#8217;s sister starts spending more time with her newly-found biological mother, Kellie is left behind and feels resentful and abandoned. It&#8217;s interesting to me to see this story told from the point of view of the sister being left out and not the one experiencing meeting her bio mom (and later her father) for the first time.Ink is Thicker Than Water is actually Amy Spalding&#8217;s first book, but The Reece Malcom List was published first. Although I liked The Reece Malcom List, I think Ink is Thicker Than Water is a stronger book, with better, more likable characters.

$REVIEW.: MILD SPOILERS -mature content reader discretion is advised.NOTE: DO NOT READ IF you have not read More Than Her. You&#8217;ve been warned.If you are anything like me then I am sure that you experienced HEART FAILURE at the end of MORE THAN HER. You had that moment when you tap the screen but reality sets in&#8230; 100% DAMN, no more pages.HER.The book opens with Amanda just trying to make it. One minute, of every hour, of each day minus the one who holds her heart. Logan. She has kindly asked for Micky and Lucy to keep their distance, she&#8217;s still raw and needs time to heal, to move on. She knows that would be impossible by staying close to his friends.Hell, she can&#8217;t even hear his name without all the memories flooding her brain. And the pain, all of the pain over how he just up and left. How could he leave without saying goodbye...or explaining why. As if any reason could actually appease her.No, the only thing that can heal what&#8217;s been broken in her is Logan.And he's gone.HIM.With the help of his father Logan joins Doctors Without Borders and is gone for a whole year before returning home. In that time he has some life changing experiences that readers will get to see in a very unique way. Once home fate takes over and places him directly in to her path again. Both are hesitant and neither is the same person from a year ago.Logan is the guy just trying to pull himself out of the deep black hole that swallowed him. He makes it VERY clear that he is willing to do what EVER it takes to be with Amanda. He understands that he may make mistakes but he shapes up and learns from those mistakes REAL QUICK.I think that was key in the story for these two. There was a need to get out their feelings with a no holds barred conversation. She asked him first chance she had. &#8220;Why did you leave?&#8221; And that grew to &#8220;You didn't think I was worth a call....&#8221; Oh yeah, home girl was vicious when she went in on the questions; asking EVERYTHING I wanted her to.In the mean time the strong love Logan and Amanda share for one another starts the process to repair what was once broken.Jay McLean showcases great chemistry with her hero&#8217;s and heroine&#8217;s. It&#8217;s magnetic, it&#8217;s undeniable,it&#8217;s P E R F E C T I O N.In between the main couple we get some great dialogue from the secondary characters Ethan, Lucy, Tristan, Tyson and Alexis.

In my dreams Jay will do a double release and give me Cam and Lucy&#8217;s book along with Dylan and Heidi&#8217;s. Yes, in my ideal world she would do both books. *GRINS* Hey, a girl can dream!Jay McLean has managed to put a balance in her story telling she will make you laugh, cry, cheer, fear, love, hate and use the lord&#8217;s name in vain on multiple occasions while reading her books.And this book...

$review_text.: Like Nevada, the "BattleBorn" state where most of this collection's 10 stories take place,  the characters we meet have undergone emotionally wrenching experiences.  Some have been violated or abused, others have been grappling with the suicide of a parent, friend lost, or love lost, etc.  Scarred by these horrendous experiences, the characters are mostly anxiously looking for a way forward and bravely longing for some sort of healing.The prose tends to be somewhat spare and has a quiet but powerful grittiness that shines a spotlight on how life can sometimes feel like the sum total of what one can endure, to paraphrase the words of the letter-writer in one of my favorite stories from the collection,  "The Last Thing We Need" (p. 30).Many of the characters have faults that would likely make them somewhat unlikeable to some readers.  A few of the characters' experiences are so out of the ordinary, some readers may not be able to relate to them.
$SUMMARY.: Well-crafted but mostly emotionally wrenching and poignant stories

$REVIEW.: Not a good start for the lover of medieval crime genre.  I toiled trough half  the first chapter before falling into a slumber and stopped.  I am sure I didn't miss anything.  Descriptions of the characters and crime scene were ill-drawn and it seemed unlikely I would find a worthy protagonist to identify with long enough to carry me into the story.  The author overwhelms the reader with repulsive sensory description rather than evocative historical detail.  Sorry, I couldn't get into this at all.

$review_text.: Cooking with cast iron is different than cooking with stainless steel or with aluminum. Cast iron requires different care and it heats up and retains heat differently. A lot of recipes that are written for general cookware work fine in cast iron. That said, recipes that are developed and written specifically for cast iron seem to just work better. I like cooking with cast iron cookware and I am always looking for good recipes to try in the cast iron cookware that I have. I found this book on a book stack and decided to give it a try, and so far it has definitely met my expectations and given me more ideas for the kitchen.The introduction starts off with a short but interesting background of cast iron cooking and focuses specifically on Wagner Ware and Griswold cast iron (page 29 makes this very clear - this is a brand-name cookbook). Ultimately the brand is not really all that important unless you have a sentimental connection to a specific manufacturer or have had bad experiences with a brand in the past. The history is interesting material and is truly worth the read.As with most other cast iron cookbooks I have seen, this one includes a section on proper care and maintenance of cast iron. Most of the information is straightforward and common-sense stuff, but there are a few informational items that I did not know before, specifically regarding self-cleaning ovens and open flames.At several points in this cookbook there is mention of someone named Aunt Ellen. At first I thought this was a relative of the book's author and that this was simply a tribute to a favorite aunt, but I finally discovered an explanation of Aunt Ellen and who she was, on page 27. The anecdotes and various sayings by Aunt Ellen come from an industrious and knowledgeable woman who worked for Griswold and shared recipes, tips and advice regarding cast iron cookware.There are four main sections in this cookbook: Luncheon and other Nibbles, Vegetables and other Sides, Main Courses (which is subdivided into Poultry, Meat and Seafood), and finally Desserts. I have not tried a lot of these recipes yet but I have one that I tried in particular that turned out memorably well - Mom's Macaroni and Cheese with Bacon, which is the very first recipe in the book. Made in a cast iron Dutch oven, it turned out entirely different than that made in a stoneware crock or casserole dish, but it was a big hit with the family and is getting made again this evening.Most recipes (not quite all) have gorgeous, full-color pictures with the finished dish. The majority of these show the dish still in the cast iron cookware used to prepare them. I very much like the formatting and layout of this cookbook.If I could change one thing about this cookbook, I would add an indicator with the recipe, either directly under the title or in the narrative introduction, a statement about what kind of pan, pot or griddle is needed to prepare it. This is a small thing and adding it would have made this cookbook even better.This is a fine book for anyone who likes cast iron cookware and wants a good collection of recipes that are geared specifically for cooking with cast iron. There is a little bit of everything in this cookbook, there are some great stories and lots of advice from Aunt Ellen's archives. At the current price (about $10) this book is a bargain.

$review_text.: Let's start with what I liked:The writing was pretty good for a debut novel.What I didn't like:- Jesse is super annoying. She is a 16 year old stuck in a 26 year old body. I'm surprised she wasn't a virgin. I could not connect with her at all. And I hate weak female characters. &#34;Oh you don't love me you say? No problem show up at my apartment after breaking my heart a few hours before, demand sex, even though I won't understand why, and all if forgiven&#34;The whole story is about sex and a psycho wife.- ok now Brett- he is a douche, seriously all he thinks about is sex. It's his answer to everything. When Jesse decided to finally start bringing up his wife 6 months into the &#34;relationship&#34;, he still did not want to have the talk with her but instead offers sex to deflect.Anyway, all in all, writing is good, but not good enough for me to recommend this book.To the author keep writing and don't give up! (Hopefully this is constructive criticism).:)

Lots of other books either directly or indirectly tell you to be mean and obnoxious around girls in order to get success. This book is perfect for guys who want nothing to do with that. This book is written from the writers perspective and goes through examples in his life where he navigates the tricky world of getting women to like you. There are some funny moments and the writing is charismatic. I would recommend this book for nice guys looking to improve themselves.

These survivors don't frighten easily and they are capable of fighting back when necessary.  Each is paid one million dollars to spend a night in the old Butler House--a supposedly haunted house where grisly murders were committed years ago.They are allowed to take whatever they want with them as long as they stay the entire night.  But real evil dwells within the walls, and when the dying begins it happens violently.  There are things more frightening than ghosts living there and they thrive on the terrified screams of their victims.A well told frightening tale that I couldn't read in the dark.

I think from the description you think the whole storyline will be about the lessons he teaches these women and that it will be nothing but sex scene after sex scene when in reality it turns out to be more of a love story.  I liked his attitude and the way he expressed himself but I absolutely loved Ally.  She cracked me up.  Not to be missed: the dance scene.  I was weak with laughter!  Even though it wasn't what I thought it would be, I really liked this book and would definitely recommend it.

$REVIEW.: As one man is born and reborn and reborn as different animals, the reader gets to see how Chinese history since 1949 played out in a single town: Gaomi Township, and especially Ximen Village.  China makes the transition to communist and then to capitalist, and it is all reflected in the interconnected lives of the villagers (and their animals, of course).  It is fascinating and sometimes hilarious.I really enjoyed this story, but I have two criticisms.1) Something seems missing.  The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution led to the deaths of tens of millions of people.  HUGE numbers.  Yet based on Life and Death are Wearing Me Out, they didn't seem horrifically bad.  Yes, villagers are mistreated.  Yes, villagers are beaten or wrongly imprisoned.  But there aren't widespread government-sponsored mass murders in Gaomi Township.  But at least we do see quite a bit of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.  On the other hand, Tiananmen Square and the protests of 1989 are nowhere in the novel.  They don't appear at all, not even indirectly.  That seems rather odd for such a epic work of historical fiction.2) Life and Death are Wearing Me Out is sometimes irksome to read.  a) There are multiple narrators, and it's not always clear when they trade off.  They are related to each other, but it took a while to figure out their interpersonal connection.  b) Mo Yan has made himself a character in the book.  Not only does that seem a little narcissistic, but Mo Yan (the character, not the actual author) is pretty annoying.  His presence does not do much to advance the plot or overall storyline until the very end, though it is clear that the author Mo Yan seems to find it amusing to have such a goofy and annoying character named Mo Yan throughout most of the novel.

$review_text.: Sassy's critique is spot on. There are far too many plot developments and world-building elements that are left hanging, unexplained.  On the other hand, some of the writing is really good, and the fantasy elements are creative and intriguing.However, our leads are basically an alpha male, and a damsel in distress that we are supposed to believe is male.  This character has an androgynous name, is blonde and slight, says "please" during sex to beg for penetration, is always the passive partner, is insecure about his partner's interest, and states at one point, "I belong to you, not the other way around" to his alpha lover.  It is a feminist nightmare starring two male leads.  The sex scenes are repetitive, and the final one is badly written.So overall I am just barely giving this an "it's okay." Some other day of the week I could just as easily rate it a "dislike."Must say this clearly ... note to authors:  Guys don't say "please" to each other during sex.  We just don't.  Ever.  (And yes, I *am* presuming to speak for every other gay man on the planet.)

$REVIEW.: THIS BOOK IS AN ANSWER TO PRAYER!  I kid.  You.  Not.  As alluded to in a previous post, about how hard it is to find suitable reading material for young kids with high Lexile scores... well, it's really hard to find reading material suitable for young kids with high Lexile scores!  I once put my then-eight year-old's score into a Lexile "find a book" page, and the first recommendation to come up was Twilight by Stephenie Meyer.  FOR AN EIGHT YEAR-OLD?!?  I won't even let them read The Hunger Games yet (someday, just not yet), precisely because they are old enough to understand what is going on in the story... and have a month of nightmares because of it.  Thanks, but no thanks.And then... along came Stout Hearts and Whizzing Biscuits: A Patria Novel by Daniel McInerney.We have Oliver, a young American hero who accidentally finds himself in the middle of a war.  There's Farnsworth, a wisecracking, biscuit-shooting prince from the country in conflict, who we absolutely know will never be friends with American Oliver Stoop.  Like, neverrrr.  Then there's Princess Rose, who is a hilarious combination of Princess Giselle and (a far more mentally stable) River Tam.  The plot zips along with just the right pacing and just the right level of complications to keep minds young and old working for their entertainment.  There are just enough "go get your dictionary" words in there to provide a nice stretch for the younger reader and to prove that the novel is never dumbed down.  I laughed out loud through the whole reading of it, and am I very excited to pass it along to my kids old enough to read independently.If there were six stars on Amazon, I'd give them to Stout Hearts and Whizzing Biscuits.  Alas, there are not.  There is, however, a brilliant Web site for all things Patria, where kids (adults too, why not?) can explore Patria, interact with Oliver, Farnsworth, and Princess Rose, and buy the next book in the series.  I hope it's the next of many, many more.

$REVIEW.: I feel like I'm being a party pooper by bringing a 3 star review to a party of super high ratings. While this book was enjoyable, I had some issues with it that I couldn't get past.To start, this book felt both like the middle of a long series and the start of a new series. Now, I know you are saying, &#34;DUH, Heather, that is because it WAS&#34;, but let me continue. I have a pet peeve with certain first books in series. When I start a book, I want to read about the couple at hand, not get 1,000 sneak peeks into other books that are coming in the series. I felt like much of the interactions with John's housemates were just that- setting up for their books. I didn't constantly want to know about the sadness in their eyes or what types of guys they were looking for. It became almost distracting for me. While I really enjoyed the tight-knit bond that these housemates had (though the speed at which they became so close didn't really read true to me, but that is another matter), I just felt like my attention was too divided.At the same time, I also felt like I was lacking a bunch of back story about some of the side characters, though this book is billed as a standalone. A lot of the guys from the &#34;Learning to Love&#34; series make appearances and I felt like I was missing something by not having read that series as well.Another issue that I had was with Brett and John's dynamic. Though I ended up liking them together, I felt like John was a little too doormat-ish for my taste. When Brett keeps dicking John over and then coming back to him, I needed some SERIOUS grovelling to make me forgive him for being an insensitive jerk. When John kept forgiving him without a peep, I felt underwhelmed and a little peeved.Also, as you guys may know, I'm a gay-virgin lover (ahem, understatement alert). Give me a gay first-timer and I'm a happy woman! However, I felt like some tension was missing with John and Brett's first few encounters. I could have used more hesitation, more anxiety, more... something. I know that what went down is sort of key to how the rest of the plot played out, but it felt a bit anticlimactic for me.My last complaint is that, honestly, the beginning of the story was a bit... boring. I had trouble getting into the plot and connecting with the MCs.Okay, okay, I got all of my bitching and moaning out. Now, onto the good stuff. As the book went on, I think the plot really picked up and ended up having some nice action that kept the pace moving well. I got into the groove at around 50% and smiled my way through the second 1/2 of the story. I also really liked that one scene with everyone playing truth or dare. I don't know how the scene really fit with the rest of the plot but... DAMN, can I sit in next time, guys??? To be a fly on that wall...I also enjoyed the overall feel of the story, if that makes sense. It is easy reading, a light book despite some moments of angst. It was a nice way to pass my time, even it I don't think it will stick with me later.So overall, a solid &#34;like&#34; read for me and a decent first book in a new series. I think I'll be tuning in for more, especially Alec's story.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**

$REVIEW.: Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.I have been reading a lot of very heavy, emotionally charged books lately and I was looking for something light and fun to read
Instead of going to one of the many hundreds of books already waiting for me on my Kindle, I took to NetGalley to see what might be out there for a quick read

Enter, Playing For Keeps.I'm not sure if I'm still coming off the Super Bowl victory of my beloved boys in blue (12th man in the house!), or if I'm caught up in the Valentine's Day revelry, but I just absolutely fell in love with this book
I was looking for fun, sweet, easy and that is exactly what I got in Playing For Keeps
I know we're not talking classic literature here, but this book is exactly what I was looking for when I most needed it.Erica is an up and coming career woman trying hard to make it in the male dominated world of advertising

Soon she finds an opportunity to make a pitch that could catapult her to A-group stardom, but she has to watch every step she takes

She wants to make it based on her merits, and not because there happens to be instant molten attraction between her and the star of her commercial, Portland Lancers quarterback Johnny Spurling.Johnny Spurling is the golden boy of the NFL

He was given the nickname, "the player" for his prowess on the field, but the media, being what it is, has taken the nickname out of context

Johnny is not known for womanizing, despite his "player" status, and at his father's urging is actually looking to settle down and start a family

Unfortunately, his family has an idea of who he should be doing that with, not allowing him to make those decisions himself.The Spurling family, two generations of football royalty, don't do advertising; especially not for beer


So when Erica and her team pitch the idea of a beer commercial, one that capitalizes on the fact that Johnny is known as a gentleman (the tag line of the whole campaign is, "don't be a douche"), Johnny sees this as a chance to solidify his nice guy status, while giving him an in with Erica

Of course Erica needs to keep any relationship with him on the down low, given their working arrangement
Not to mention, Johnny's sister-in-law Beth has plans to set him up with a nice teacher friend after the Super Bowl.I love reading romance novels that involve sports


I am a sports fan, I will admit, not just to see hot guys in tight uniforms, but I actually am interested in the game as well
So it's really nice to see a strong heroine that can talk shop as well
I also appreciated how driven Erica is in regards to her career


She has her priorities in order and is not willing to sacrifice her goals in order to make others happy


And Johnny...sigh
Johnny does NOT disappoint as a hunky quarterback

I absolutely loved how their relationship evolved and he wasn't afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve, in spite of being the tough football player
Real life emotions are dealt with in a real life way


Nothing too over the top, as the characters were both likeable and believable.Playing For Keeps was a five star book for me


I know, I know...it's syrupy sweet, a little predictable, but it was well written and kept me engrossed from cover to cover


We all have our guilty pleasures and a hot quarterback, a strong, independent heroine, and a cohesive storyline are some of mine
This book had all of the elements for a fun read that kept me warm on a chilly winter's night, and helped alleviate some of the book hangover from the more serious books I've been reading lately

Thanks Ms


Donovan, I'm looking forward to meeting again...how do you feel about baseball players? Pitchers and catchers report soon...

$REVIEW.: The book is not a detailed start to finish account of what happened in the torture center. It is more of an emotional work that tells the story through artistic means such a poems and short barely related chapters. I found this work to be a poor artistic endeavor so I was not only robbed of my opportunity to be informed ,but also entertained. Since so many loved this book the purpose of my review is to ward off anybody who might accidentally think this work has ANY historical value. I will not speak  against its literary value as after having argued my way through a MA in English Literature I am done pushing that boulder up that hill.

I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth, but at the same time after you have read all three books you already have a good Idea of what they would be without actually having seen them....so my disappointment is more out of being HUNGRY for it all to not be over.

Just as this review will be, the book was very informative about the subject, but at the same time simple and to the point, giving you all the information you were looking for when you picked up this book. The book looks back at the previous 3 tetrad blood moons theat fall on Holy days, and information on the next occurring in 2014, but in no way does the author write about any predictions as to what will happen, because we just dont know. The author also does a nice job placing scriptures from the word of God where they should be in the book. It was a nice read, I read it very quick and look forward to picking up more of his books.

$REVIEW.: This is the raw foodism version of other books by the same authors about veganism for example, what I didn't like in this one like in the others two, is that the criticisms are kept to a minimum and solved in a too semplicistic way, the recipes are bland and unapealling as usual and I don't think a serious scientist would back up raw foodism as it's based on bad science, so I've given it away with the other two.

The author not only kept me enthralled with the love story of Jesse and her hero, Simon, but there was the great friendships they had with some of the other characters in the book.  It's not often you read about a heroine who has a handicap such as her deafness and the author has shown how she was able to overcome it and actually live a very productive life.  I really liked how they coped with her deafness and fell so romantically in love!

$review_text.: Does being raised a victim of abuse mean you will continue to gravitate to abusers? Stephanie, a teen who was literally kicked out of her abuse father&#8217;s home and sent to her aunt, the one thing that tore her heart out was leaving Eric behind, never saying goodbye. Ten years later she is a beautiful, grown woman, married to an extremely handsome and successful businessman who is fast becoming a clone of her abusive father. Alcohol spurs his cruelty to new heights, but Stephanie is too afraid to leave. Was it fate that reunited her with Eric, the warm and caring boy she never forgot? Will she be able to resist the pull they still feel for each other? What if her husband Travis finds out? Clandestine meetings, the feeling of safety she feels with Eric and her lack of self-control may get them both killed if her powerful and twisted husband finds out.Evil of Love by N. L. Echeverria is one of the most gritty and twisted dark romances I have read in a while. There were times it was painful to keep reading. Stephanie was too timid to escape; she &#8220;loved&#8221; her husband as much as she feared him. Travis had issues from his own past that haunted him, driving him to hurt and humiliate the woman he professed to love. Eric rode in like the knight in shining armor, or boxing gloves, as his method of dealing with his hurt and anger over the loss of Stephanie without even a note or a goodbye, was to become a champion fighter. He at least found a channel for his pent up rage at the loss. One other noteworthy character was Travis&#8217; limo driver, who sided with Stephanie, covered for her affair, but did nothing about what was happening to her. The mental images created by Ms. Echeverria are brutal, chilling and so well done, that the reader forgets this is fiction, the distorted world she has built is not real. Each character was pivotal to the plot, as were their actions.I particularly like how Ms. Echeverria doesn&#8217;t try to &#8220;pretty up&#8221; what is going on. Three, actually four people are in the wrong, all for different reasons. For me, there were no real heroes, but there were people who had each suffered in their own way, dealing with their problems with only the tools their mental arsenals had.The plot is disturbing, yet intriguing on many levels as I tried to see the character&#8217;s point of view. Still, whether I disagreed with many of the actions and poor choices made by all of them, I can definitely say that Ms. Echeverria can write, timing each twist well, sending out her message and evoking powerful emotions from her readers.I received a review copy from the author as part of the Evil of Love Blog Tour

$review_text.: Bottom line: A different take on werewolves that starts strong, but loses itself in a swirl of indistinct action scenes and unconvincing villains.How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? The novel is set in the present day, but all of the characters in the novel are accepting of same-sex relationships, with no one reacting to them any differently than they do to different-sex relationships. Since the novel is told from the point of view of the main character, a middle-aged divorcee, we do hear some of her doubts about whether her feelings for another woman are sexual and what it would mean for her to come out as a lesbian, but none of her thoughts are self-loathing or repulsed.Does it have explicit sex scenes?: No. There's a f/f kiss, but that's it.Would I read it again? No. I didn't mind reading it, but there was nothing that would draw me back.Would I publish it? No, not as it stands. The concepts (older women becoming werewolves at menopause, werewolves as an all-female community, a werewolf novel that's not all about romance and sex appeal) are worth a novel or several, and the book starts out strong, with a smooth early action scene, but the later plot is a hazy blur of imprecise action scenes, periods of inactivity, and villains that don't seem half so intelligent or as much of a threat as the characters seem to think they are.I'm not usually a werewolf (or vampire) novel reader, because I'm not usually a paranormal romance reader, and it's rare I don't see the one being synonymous for the other. Alphas falling for mortals, mortals falling for alphas, vampires falling for werewolves, new wolves learning to run a pack and being courted by multiple stunningly attractive romantic interests...it's not my thing. So I very much appreciated the new twist on the concept of werewolves in Silver Moon! In Lundoff's novel, (some) women become werewolves when they hit menopause in the idyllic town of Wolf's Point. They then serve as protectors of the town until the town's magic releases them and new protectors are chosen. The novel deals mostly with their work of protection and the "coming out" of the main character, Becca, a middle-aged, menopausal, divorced woman who knew nothing about the town's legacy, as a werewolf. There's a very slowly developed romantic subplot between Becca and Erin, another Wolf's Point werewolf (and an out lesbian), but it never takes center stage, nor does it ever get steamy (I do like a good sex scene, so that's a little disappointing-but sudden, explicit, passionate sex wouldn't have fit well in the story, so I don't mind its omission).The concept is the strongest part of the novel. Becca has friends and a job at a hardware shop, but she doesn't really see her life going anywhere new, now that she's divorced with no children. The novel's menopause-equals-werewolf conceit makes it clear that each new stage of a person's life opens up the opportunity to discover new things and reinvent ourselves, to a degree-and form new relationships! As a 28-year-old who already worries that, at 30, I'll be Too Old (to do what, I'm not sure, but there's definitely the feeling-too old to have kids? To have questions about life? To not have taken over the world yet?), I found it reassuring to read about an older woman, childless and divorced (that is, without the nuclear family structure developed that society tells me is one form of "success"), still having time and room to learn heroic (and romantic) things about herself. The strong friendships of the women, who come from a variety of backgrounds and have different sorts of families, were also a pleasure to see in a novel (as were men who were decent folks, too-I wondered if the wolves would be protecting the town exclusively from male threats, since that seems to be a trend in lesbian SFF: keep evil men in check-but no, they protect the town from all threats, gender-equitably).On the negative side, the plot fails to live up to the premise. The later half of the novel blurs by in a combination of vague action scenes and long plot lulls. The villains, who the characters treat as a dire threat to the safety of Wolf's Point, keep leaving windows of opportunity open to the protagonists that only the chronically incompetent would leave open. They make warning after warning, leave powerful protagonists alone with vital supplies and very little guard, and drop without much of a fight, despite the narrative and protagonists talking up how tough the villains are, how seriously they need to be taken, and what they might have done in the past. Speaking of which, what *did* the main villain do in the past? The novel hints at it, but it's never fully explained.Worth buying and reading if you're interested in and want to support alternatives to the usual heterosexual paranormal romance take on werewolves. Pass it up if you're not a devoted werewolf reader.SPOILER WARNINGContent warnings (may contain spoilers): Kidnapping (of a child and of an adult), imprisonment, knocking out with drugs, child abuse (sexual, not shown but alluded to), murder (by main character), nonconsensual medical (pseudo-medical) treatment, possible Stockholm syndrome on one villain's part?SPOILER WARNING

$REVIEW.: This is an entirely awesome story. The concept of the story and how it is set up to be played out is phenomenal. The main character Laney has had a year long 'dry' spell. Her best friend Becca decides that they need to try something different to get their love lives jump started. They end up joining a private club that allows them to broaden their horizons. Becca is made to be the beautiful best friend with tons of confidence whereas Laney feels like she is a plain jane. What happens at their first night at the Club is not to be missed. This is a fantastic journey that the author, Emma Payne, has created. I look forward to whatever comes next from this author.

$review_text.: I loved the first book of this trio of stories. It reminded me a bit of characters meeting and starting out on "the yellow brick road".. the tin man, the lion, etc. loved the sense of humor, similar to Piers Anthony. the second book was just as fantastic. but the third , although funny, just didn't go anywhere. no answers came up.  So who was the mysterious lady with green eyes and her pet squirrel? what happened to her? she just got left at a town after T. doesn't kill her. are we to assume she just gave up?  and what of the Shadows? that was never explained. and what a sad ending for Sir Danth, and even sadder for T. and the princess. -- at least in my mind.  next sentence is a spoiler so stop reading herethe best the auther could do is have the princes sneak around while married to someone else? really? moral's for the young at heart? a lot of different ending could have come up here that would have been more satisfying.  ie the prince ran off with someone else... or died... or the princess's father disowns her...anything!  and why didn't the auther come up with a magical lover for the tin man? what is the mystery with his lost people....just a lot of loose ends that were not tied up...

At the end of the book we finally find out that it has been three months but while reading the book you think it is a couple of weeks or so.  I am glad that I did not have to pay for the book.  I give the book 3 stars because it did keep my interest.

$REVIEW.: I'll start with the bad: the writing style is simple to the point of being childish. Sentences are short. The hero is perfect. He has no discernible personality. Nevertheless young women invite him into their bedrooms and take their clothes off.Rodney Smith's astrophysics is, to use a polite word, imaginative. Spaceship performance is inconsistent, sometimes they can "jump", other times they just have to make speed as best they can to get from A to B.Despite all that I downloaded the second book in a flash onto my Kindle, and kept reading. There is lots of action and the good guys, as other reviewers have pointed out, always win easily. Kelly, the hero, is an ace pilot and strategist and never makes a mistake. As I said in the review title, "Scout Force" is addictive despite its faults.

$review_text.: It's not often that you come across a novel that shows you a completely new world. It doesn't rely on works such as 'The Lord Of The Rings' or 'Dune' for it's basis as do so many other books.I loved the descriptions of the different realms, the flora and fauna and the adaptation of the people. I could just imagine the large pupiled eyes if the inhabitants of Glour.Llandry is, of course, the pivotal character. Her attraction to the Istore stone, the fact that she discovered it and worked with it so closely, give her a unique relationship with it.This is book 1 and I am looking forward to reading on to see where the story leads and if the promise in this book is fulfilled.Recommended to anyone who likes great Fantasy.

$REVIEW.: I know I've said this in pretty much every review I have posted on The Squeaky Clean Mysteries series but I love this main character. Gabby St. Clair is intelligent, up on her pop culture and musicals and humorously sarcastic and snarky. She reminds me a little bit of Veronica Mars.In "The Scum of All Fears," we get to see a little more involvement from Riley Thomas, Gabby's fiance, as well. Gabby and Riley seem to be working more as a team in this book and it works. It shows how their relationship has evolved.It's been a pretty full year for Gabby and Riley as all five books take place over the course of a year but I really hope there will be more of their adventures in the future.
$SUMMARY.: Great characters, engaging stiry.

$REVIEW.: The Stephen King Universe is a pretty decent attempt to consolidate all of the best-selling Author's stories and characters into one cohesive "Universe", I.E

all of his stories and characters exist in the same reality, and the various struggles between good and evil that King relates are all skirmishes leading to the eventual war that will be fought for control of the mythical Dark Tower

(Comic Book fans are familiar with this type of scheme- The Marvel Universe, The DC Universe, et al....)Sounds good.There are a few problems, though: 1)- Die-Hard King fans, like me, already know pretty much everything they have to say in this book

That's ok, though

Sometimes it's nice just to see that someone else agrees with you


2)- There are some glaring errors, most of which other reviewers have spoken about, so I won't

(Well....just one! It drove me NUTS that they say on one page that Mike Hanlon, from IT, lives in Hemingford Home, Nebraska


A few pages later he lives in Derry


Come on, guys...Where's the Editor? There are a LOT of little things like that.) 3)- Towards the end of the book, the Authors seem to just lose interest in tying all King's work together, and just start summarizing stories


The Richard Bachman chapter especially suffered from this....King Fans will probably find The Stephen King Universe a pleasant way to spend a few hours, kind of like a trip down memory lane

Everyone else should probably just go right to the source, and pick up one of Mr


King's books

Ain't nothing like the real thing.....

$REVIEW.: I don't read a lot of fiction but like most people, enjoy a good book once in awhile when I have a bit of "downtime" available. Business is both a personal and professional interest and Russia...well, I've just sat on the sidelines watching the numerous changes over the years with a great deal of interest. Basically, this book sounded promising which is why I opted to give it a try.There were a few rough patches early on...in fact, I found it a bit slow going before I could get into the story. The writing was/is solid and the characters were quite believable - in fact, so much so that I found myself constantly thinking back to real life American versions of many characters in the book. However, I couldn't get myself to "care" about any individual characters and just as there seemed to be a mystery brewing to hold my attention, things would seem to drift off. A few timse I almost opted to put it aside but in the end, there was just enough to keep me reading.Things did change by the end of the book or perhaps it was just the investment of time and energy into reading it. Either way, take it for what it is...an entertaining example of "business" which could easily apply to the USA as Russia. Reverse mergers, shell corporations, pump and dump type schemes etc...it's all here. Those that enjoy business intrigue are likely to find this a quick, non-taxing read but still entertaining.

$REVIEW.: So, what do fireflies, curling irons and horseshoes have to do with inter-dimensional portals you ask???  Well, you'll have to read the book and find out.  Boy are you in for a FUN ride!  The story is very well done; the story is very believeable and the pacing is excellent (no feeling worn-out and tired from reading the exploits of the team).  Each character is very real, the dialog is spot-on, the humor perfect for the situation and you feel something for each person introduced in the story.I was hooked from the first paragraph and only put the book down to sleep and go to work -- if only I'd had my own version of "Ivar" -- hint, you need to read the story!  The Nightstalkers team you definately want on your side and I can't wait for the future "Fun" exploits of Moms, Nada, Eagle, Roland, Mac, Kirk, Cleaner, Ms. Jones and Pitr.Buy the book and settle down for your very own "Fun" adventure.  Yes, you need to read the book to get that reference, too.  Now, back to work singing "Warewolves of London".

$REVIEW.: Melanie Wells has her hand in many pots, including a private practice as a psychotherapist, as well as being a musician and author. She hails from Texas, where she attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, beginning in music as a violinist. She ended up with a degree in English and obtained graduate degrees in counseling psychology and biblical studies. She has published two prior "soul" books entitled WHEN THE DAY OF EVIL COMES and THE SOUL HUNTER.Dylan Foster is busy ushering her latest degree candidates from the small college where she teaches psychology. She attends a birthday party for six year old Christine Zocci, a special child of a friend visiting from Chicago. A happy birthday party turns to tragedy when Nicholas, the child of Dylan's friend Maria, is abducted from the park. Christine immediately begins having breathing episodes that nearly kill her, but her "gift" enables the frantic adults around her, including Maria's boyfriend, an investigator in the case, get a handle on just what have happened to Nicholas. A few people help along the way, including a mysterious man who calms Christine at the hospital just before she is scheduled for x-rays:"Instead, a sixtyish man with close-cropped gray hair, a phenomenal tan, and a bright, affable smile leaned into the booth and tapped Christine on the shoulder. He wore a faded hospital gown, his muscular, browned legs poking out the bottom and set off by a gleaming pair of white athletic socks. The man shot me a quick wave like he knew me and sat on the bench beside Christine. 'Are you afraid?' he said to her."Melanie Wells combines shrewd acuity towards the human condition with almost a New Age take on angels and their help when we humans least expect it in this snappy suspense novel. Her writing style is mature, and her portrayal of Dylan Foster is just crazy enough to add a light touch to the story. Dylan is a likable, if extremely eccentric; academic who probably couldn't keep her tennis shoes tied without help. But on a deeper level she has a heart of gold; is self deprecating enough to offset what might be academic arrogance in any other character; and is herself on her own mission of redemption. A good read!Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer

$REVIEW.: In my professional life I met many people who suffer from bi-polar disorder or what used to be called manic-depressive disorder.  In this well written novel the author, a therapist, brings to life a brilliant artist and his struggle with this illness and the effect it has on those who love him.  This is not an easy read.  The depth of despair Jake experiences and what it does to his family often brought me to tears.  If you have never known someone with bi-polar disorder, or loved someone with bi-polar disorder this book will open your mind to the suffering it brings to the individual and his/her family.  It really is a must read for anyone interested in understanding this illness.

$REVIEW.: This is a very serious book.  It does have a certain amount of mystery to it as to the identity of the autistic child's rapist, but the highest value of the book is the light shed on child abuse, rape, AIDS and such issues in Africa. Corban Addijson is suitably blunt in  dealing with these issues.  His use of Zoe as a voice crying in the wilderness for justice is the novel's notable upside.  The one down side is that we don't hear as much about the book's truly most appealing character, the child, Kuyeya.

$review_text.: &#8216;The Psychology of Jury Selection&#8217; written by Frederick Crouter is a short book that talks about one not so often encountered subject - the election of the members of the jury.At the book beginning author somewhat humorously quotes two gentlemen with their comments &#8220;&#8230;Never forget, almost every case has been won or lost when the jury is sworn.&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;Never accept a juror whose occupation begins with a P.&#8221; and thereafter at his 30-odd pages discusses various aspects important for selection of right people for jurors.Claiming that each year juries decide thousands of cases, though the majority of these are not settled by juries, he emphasizes that predictions about juries frequently influence the decision of whether or not to pursue a jury trial. In the first part of the book he deals with an analysis of the pre-trial investigation of the jury panel and the data that should be collected, while in second part he speaks about non-verbal and body cues of the jurors.Crouter&#8217;s book will be interesting, especially to someone who is not versed in this subject, but still somewhat gives the impression that it deals with general psychological topics that are applicable in various professions, and not so much related to the process of selecting jurors.Given the work shortness, this is a booklet you will read with ease that will probably motivate you for further study. The book comes with one nice add-on that certainly increases its value &#8211; bonus software called &#8216;The Jury Selector&#8217; which enables reader to go through the topics covered in this book the other way as well.

$REVIEW.: It is said that the majority of criminals are impulsive. That certainly seems to be the case with Harry Parnes. On the day he is released from prison, without any forethought whatsoever, he walks into a small town bank and robs it. Unfortunately for Harry this will set off a chain of events that run the gamut of hilarity to tragedy.This is an engaging book that I read in one sitting. Most of the characters are somewhat quirky but decent. Actually, some of the criminals are relatively decent (but they are still capable of brutality).The ending left me definitely anxious for the next installment. Who knows what kind of trouble Harry will involve himself in next!

I actually enjoy some of the lighter weight versions of the apocalypse, which I assume the writer was trying for.At first I liked Harry but found the lack of character development too tiring
We get it, you're " too old for this shit" .The detailed back stories that raved about how amazing these men are...? Exhausting

 Yes, Darwin rules


The best would survive but this was all overkill, in my opinion.There were long wordy adjective laden monologues that made me want to scream, "zombies! Coming now!"Probably try the next installment just in case but only if it's 99 cents.

$REVIEW.: The subtitle of this book hits it straight, &#34;The role of reason in the life of the soul.&#34; Any Christian who wants to do a detailed analysis of their faith needs to read this book. JP Moreland does an excellent job exploring the mind of Christianity. He challenges fellow Christians to really understand what they believe - and be able to defend that faith with solid reasoning and logic. This book is no leap of faith. It is similar in some ways to Lee Strobel's works and compliments them but dives much deeper. This book is not for the faint of heart (or mind in this case) - I had to re-read some sections to make sure I really followed where JP was going but the journey is well worth it. The well read Christian will want to have this book in their library - top shelf stuff.

$REVIEW.: I've always been fascinated by angels and this book has clarified for me the various traditions on angels for the last few thousand years
 Barker is a scholar who has studied Biblical and extra-Biblical works from Christianity and Judaism and seems to have a good handle on the changing world views of these groups

 In this book she has done an excellent job of classifying the many types of angels and explaining their roles and how they have fit into our views throughout history


 The points are made by many illustrations of works by artists over the last 1500 years
 This is mainly a picture book with captions, interviews and short essays
 The artwork consists of high quality reproductions.There are 13 chapters consisting of topics such as the Ranks of Angels, Archangels, the Holy Wisdom, The Fallen Angels, the Hebrew Scriptures, the New Testament, the Lost Bible, and Angels as Guardians

 Each chapter begins with a short essay explaining the topic and cross referencing her sources

 Some chapters will have more than one essay


 Many illustrations follow with captions emphasizing a point and there is usually a quote from one of the sources
 Some chapters end with an interview from a leader or scholar from a religious tradition that explains their views of the role angels play in their belief.I enjoyed the book very much and the artwork she selected was very good and did an excellent job of illustrating how artists through the ages envisioned angels and the roles they play in our lives

 I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the topic of angels.

I enjoyed all the relationships within the story
However, I thought the twins, especially Ranger, were a little whiny occassionally, and since they've been so close and shared everything all of their lives, I thought it odd that Ranger had difficulty sharing some of his thoughts and feelings
Overall, I enjoyed it.

Its not often I read a book that I could not put down and not since "Twilight" have I been this caught up in a novel. Very well written and I could almost smell the flowers as she gave wonderful discripton.  It was just the right amount of romance, suspence and intrigue that left me giddy! I have a very active household and as the mom of two it was just the right thing to wind down the day with. I will look for more of this authors work!

$review_text.: This tiny anthology explores an all-emcompassing topic - fear. What holds us back. Why we cling to crazy notions. How we paralyze ourselves into apathy. Dianne Ascroft has a keen eye for observing the little things in life that many overlook. It's a writer's mentality for noticing the bigger picture among the miscellaneous details of everyday life. The daily monotony of going to work, doing the chores, taking care of children doesn't have to be humdrum, if we can develop an appreciation for the beauty hidden within the ordinary.Ascroft ferrets that out in her stories, redirecting our gaze and encouraging us to look beyond what meets the eye for the deeper, underlying meaning. Nighttime sounds aren't so menacing when you have someone to share the loneliness with. Mucking out a stall isn't so bad when the man you're attracted to shows up to lend a hand. Living in another country isn't so hard when you have a piece of home to take with you. Listening to your nagging mother sometimes is the best course of action. And stalking a man on a church's webcam can lead to him asking you out.When all of the strong, compassionate women in these stories face their fears, they're able to let go and experience life to the fullest. Sometimes, we're our own worst enemy. We don't take care of our health because we care more about our job. We don't take a minute to talk to a neighbor because we have things that have to get done. We don't stick around a social event because we feel awkward or out of place. But it's only when we put ourselves out there, that amazing things can happen. Things we never expected were even possible. And that's the kick in the pants, Dianne Ascroft brings to us. Don't ever shut life out. The journey's way too exciting to sit on the sidelines.

$REVIEW.: This collection of short stories that all are actually pieces of one larger story is indescribably amazing. Funny in a way that sounds corn-pone if I try to describe it, these stories are also gripping and will keep me up reading until I finish each one so I can see if the problem is solved, the danger averted. I can't describe it better than the actual product description on Amazon. Probably the nearest comparison I can come up with is to Suzette Elgin's Ozark trilogy (begins with the book Twelve Fair Kingdoms)  where the down-home, seemingly ignorant folk are not as stupid as they seem and the world they inhabit is increasingly fabulous to discover.The best tribute I can give is to say that I picked this up free to try on the Kindle and will be purchasing the paperback for my library as well as giving it as gifts. Don't miss this one.

$REVIEW.: I do not recommend this book to anyone but perhaps a student who is required to read it with no other choice. While it provides a good deal of scholarly information it is excruciating to read. My impression of the book is the author wrote it to enjoy the presentation of his own words with little interest in whether anyone else might enjoy it. It is peppered with untranslated Latin and Italian the author assumes everyone should be able to understand. He sowed the text heavily with every archaic and obscure word, term or phase he could excavate. He prefaces the book with the statement that it will be an fair and objective view of Cesare Borgia and then proceeds to violate his own preface by exonerating Borgia of almost every accusation against him with no more real proof of his viewpoint that exists for the accusation.I read the entire book which was a slogging ordeal to finish.

$review_text.: Story: GOODIntimacy Level: VERY GOODEnjoyment: GOODLength: 4226 kindleWow, by viewing the cover of this book, I didn't expect to enjoy it

This book is titled, A Date With Destiny, however, I think it should have been titled, Karma, Caught up, All that Glitter Isn't Gold, or even, W.T.F, because of everything that happen within the story.The story starts with Destiny waiting on a blind date, and once  that date took place, things start to happen that had a domino effect

Destiny's previous relationship mold her into the person she currently is


Her last boyfriend cheated on her and did something also that was unforgivable
Now she's met Hakim, a hot director who does music videos


She then meets Ace, a new and hot rapper on the music scene

What happens from one guy to the next takes Destiny through hurt, drama, shame, pain, lost and denial

Some of the decisions Destiny made was unbelievable to me, but I also understood why

 Being that she is a stylist for celebrities, when her life transitions her to the music industry and she becomes a singer and gets more caught up, it was sad to see the path she took

Bet yet again, through hurt comes joy in the morning


I'm also glad to see who she ends up with in the end
I thought their ending was worth it and sweet


Both Hakim and Ace, definitely kept you wondering who is the right person for her

But half way through, true colors starts to show and you knew whose intentions were right

I also liked that the author uses singers like, Jill Scott along with others, to pick a song to select the moods the characters were in at certain scenes in the book
It made me want to go straight to my itunes and start playing.This is my second book by the author and it definitely won't be my last


By reading this author's work, I like how you think the story would stay on course, but the author throws in little twist and turns that does make you wonder if things will go as plan.

$REVIEW.: I loved Throne Of Glass so much that I had to read Crown Of Midnight ASAP. Crown Of Midnight is an excellent followup to Throne Of Glass, but I wasn't 100% into the book. This is NOT Crown Of Midnight's fault nor is it Maas's fault, I was in a reading slump so that really marred my experience of reading CoM. I have a feeling that I'm going to need to re-read CoM before the 3rd book releases due to my self-inflicted, poor reading experience.Crown Of Midnight is an epic, high-stakes, action-packed sequeled and is filled with scenes that will fill readers with adrenaline. Each page thrums with heart pounding actions and terrific dialogue that really showcases Maas's talent. The dialogue is humorous, and undeniably clever; Maas writes some of the best dialogue I have read in YA for sure.The romance in Crown Of Midnight is top-notch and I can't believe how often I flip flopped between loving Chaol or Dorian. After book #1, I was 100% Team Chaol but CoM messed with my mind so much. One page I was annoyed by Dorian and rooting for Chaol and in the next moment my opinion shifted so radically. It takes skill to manipulate a reader so effectively and Maas proves herself completely with the romance. That has to be one of the strangest compliments I have ever given an author.I have only love for Celaena and I completely love what Maas did with her character arc. I loved watching Celaena interacting with both old and new characters. I just love everything about Cel, whether it be her humor, her kick-ass attitude, or her insecurities. It really doesn't matter because I'm completely invested in Celaena's character and she is definitely one of my book girlfriends. Don't judge me--guys can totally have book girlfriends, if female readers can have fictional beaus.Reading Crown Of Midnight is a must for fans of Kristin Cashore and R.L. LaFevers. This is one of the few sequels that is just as amazing as it's predecessor. The last quarter of this book was absolute perfection and the ending made me tear up. Honestly that ending is absolutely cruel and yet so well done--it's just too much for me. Crown Of Midnight ends on a cliffhanger that will make you lust for the sequel desperately. This is a book you won't want to miss out on!

$REVIEW.: I normally reserve books of this genre for flying on a plane en route to a conference (which was what I did with _Faking It_)--like the protagonist, I have my own composition classrooms to worry about.  I find the author's blending of the real trials and tribulations of a composition professor mixed in with her own tragic loss to be extremely refreshing and honest.  Not all people get through tragedy in the same period of time or in the same ways, and the author conveys that fully and explores options available for those who have ever wondered if they were abnormal while grieving over a loss (of any kind).  What perhaps is this author's best message is that in order to love others, one must love oneself first.  Andi portrays that beautifully in this novel, and more importantly, the author allows the reader the intelligence to write their own ending.  Perhaps this is the greatest gift of all:  the message of allowing the reader the opportunity to apply Andi's life to his/her own and to choose their own ending.  Beautiful.

It starts with the most important part ---the stories from the gospels of Matthew and Luke of Christ's birth and gives the differences in what each gospel is telling us.It goes on to explain how Christmas started being celebrated near the date of the shortest day of the year the winter solstice. (Note to everyone who keeps the outside lights on through February I thank you especially when I'm driving after dark.)A lot the customs in the book are good things to do with your family.  My mother always had an advent wreath she light every Sunday afternoon.  The book contains antiphons (prayers or meditations) to say during advent. We also celebrated St. Nickolas on December 6th ( I guess now that would be called a prequel to Christmas) by getting something small like candy bars in our shoes.For me the the book was very enjoyable to read because it reminded my of all the things my parents did for us and gave a lot of information I didn't know. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I have not stopped thinking about Kat and Jake since I finished this book several weeks ago.It started off slowly for me, as I associate the somewhat overwrought style of writing with romance novels or soap operas


But what kept me turning the pages was Fasbinder&#8217;s unerring instinct for intriguing and well-drawn characters who are flawed in interesting and sympathetic ways


 Jake, often gentle and endearing, is a world-class artist with a rather conventional mental illness


Kat, a talented but nave young surgeon who falls headlong and heedlessly under Jake&#8217;s spell, struggles to maintain her own sanity as Jake cycles through the manic and depressive phases of bi-polar disorders.Fasbinder has written a book in which the jaw-dropping ending is both wholly unexpected and wholly consistent with the characters she has created


 Once you start this book, you will not be able to put it down.

$REVIEW.: I wrote one review for both books...Two damaged souls, find each other and learn to cope with the past and how to love and trust again.Skater Boy and My Skater Boy told a phenomenal tale of Rory Gregor and Hindley Hagen and their trials on their journey to finding a Happily Ever After. The story was well written and talked about some difficult situations in life. It was also about becoming whole again when you have only felt like a half for so long.I can honestly say I didn&#8217;t want these stories to end. I loved how it was told from dual points of view. I also loved loved loved the inner dialogue of each character. Most of the time it was hilarious reading their internal thoughts to themselves, it really helped the reader connect to each character more.Of course, Rory and Hindley faced some trying situations. Things I would never want to face in my lifetime. They struggled to come to terms with the things of their past and situations that life had dealt them or that others had created for them. Some people were out to destroy each of them individually or as a couple no matter what the cost.They also felt inadequate themselves and had a hard time moving past those feelings. I loved how they always thought the worst of themselves but always thought the best of the other. I enjoyed watching them help heal each other and move past their own insecurities to become the power couple they were meant to be.There are definitely scenes that will break your heart, there were also some pretty steamy scenes but thankfully that didn&#8217;t take away the impact of the story overall. I will also never look at Hello Kitty the same again!

$review_text.: I enjoyed this book which had angst, sexual tension and dealt with overcoming loss. Kate was an insecure girl and her miscarriage and lack of employment immersed her further into insecurity, guilt, and depression.  Encouraged by her mom, she attended a grief support group and met hockey super Ryke who lost his wife two years ago. Attracted to her, Ryke approached her and even hired her to become as an assistant.  Kate could be frustrating, being very insecure and continuously pushed Ryke away. But she learned to move on after putting closure on her situation. Ryke was really patient with her and it helped that he understood her grieving process.

$REVIEW.: OK story, decent plot, characters that I could at least think about caring about. The story runs a bit long and drags in places. It would have benefitted from being about 20% shorter, with a tighter telling, but was worth reading.The ending left a lot to be desired: I mean we have outside influences, a lot of sub plots to work with and a sudden threat of death to everyone in the "world". That's a great place to provide some sort of closure and a setup for the next book. Instead we get a vague sense of doom and a hint of maybe something to come.It's a pulp novel worth reading to kill some time at $1-$2, but don't pay more than $4.
$SUMMARY.: Don't expect to much, it's a pulp novel.

$review_text.: Ellie Campbell brings us into the relationships of four women who were teenage friends and are coming together after twelve years without any communication. She reveals for the reader the struggles, secrets and compassion each has for the others as they have come together as women under uncertain circumstances.Jennifer, Georgina, Rowan and Nutmeg became friends at school mostly because they were being picked on as new students and formed a strong bond. They were all different in their own ways but melded together as a force to be reckoned with. After a prank that got out of hand they all take different paths in life and go their separate ways. Twelve years later they are summoned together at the request of Rowan and everyone shows up except Rowan. Being brought together at her request the others begin on a quest to find Rowan and uncover secrets and feelings that must be dealt with on the way.The characters are brought to life and might remind some of us of relationships we had in school. They all have their own secrets but struggle to find a balance as a group. As I was reading I could feel at times great compassion for them as well as disgust for them. The writing is powerful as you are privy to the balance it sometimes takes to keep relationships together and working thru the differences.I enjoyed this book and felt as if I was a fly on the wall as these four women come to terms with their lives as well as with each other.

$REVIEW.: I loved reading this book
It affirmed things I had been feeling for some time about modern day church and tithing

The points were very well put and Biblically backed

Not only was the Old Testament law of tithing explained, but the modern day tithing beliefs were explained and shown to be misunderstood by most of the modern day church
I liked the way the author showed that tithing is no longer required thanks to Christ giving Himself as the final sacrifice and final tithe

I also liked how he explained we are no longer required by law to tithe, but we do need to have a giving spirit and let the Spirit lead how and where to give

We are free from the law through the death and resurrection of Christ, but we are not free to hoard and lavish ourselves with the money we would have been tithing.

$REVIEW.: &#34;Trickster, bamboozler, grifter. There were lots of names for what I did, but only one that everyone seemed to know &#8211; con artist. That was me and I was good at it.&#34;I really enjoyed what Elizabeth Lee did with Give Me Something. She started with two completely flawed &#8211; and more than a little unlikable &#8211; characters (Lila and Nick), took them in two completely different directions and ultimately made me love both of them by the end of the book. It took awhile to get there, particularly with Nick, but the important thing is that I did. I was completely caught up in their story and that of the latest mark, Tucker. There's a love triangle in this book, as you might have guessed, and honestly, up until the very end of the book, I had no idea which way it was going to go. More than that, I had no idea which outcome to root for either. I knew I wanted Lila to find her HEA because she matured and became a better person and I felt she deserved a chance at love. I could have made a strong argument for her to end up with either of these men.&#34;When you spend the majority of your time lying about who you are, it quickly becomes a spiderweb that is impossible to navigate.&#34;Give Me Something kept me on my toes. Filled to the brim with lies and deceit, backstabbing friends, manipulations, swoony boys, super sexy moments, redemption, second chances, and just a lot of good ol' fashioned drama, it was impossible to put down. I read it cover to cover in the matter of just a couple hours. I guessed a couple of the twists, but didn't even come close to some of the other ones. It was a wild ride and, while it wasn't super angsty, it did make me feel some feels. I enjoyed every minute of it.

$REVIEW.: In my copy of this book, I couldn't find one notation at all as to where this book is fiction, a memoir or what.  So, I read it thinking it was true (it's a little more fun to read that way), but ended suspecting as I did all along that much of this story was made up.  But, I'm not sure...my copy just doesn't have any info and what I look up online seems to vary.Moving on....I really enjoyed this book!  In fact, I liked it more than A Million Little Pieces.  Probably in part because this was a much happier book, even though a lot of depressing things happen.  Also, once you're already familiar with a set of characters, it seems the second time around you enjoy them even more, almost as if they are friends.  Either way, I liked the book for the most part.As with AMLP, Frey's writing style can grate on your nerves.  The fact that many of his sentences are run-ons and omitt proper punctuation, it's just annoying.  The editor should have fixed this.  I don't feel it added anything to this story.  What I did like, was how some pages only contained one paragraph or two.  This was done I believe to demonstrate a significant event or show a passage of time.  Either way, I liked that aspect.What sealed the deal for me?  The last few pages I was in tears.  I'm a very avid reader, but this doesn't happen often.  I was that attached to the characters and what was written was that moving.Overall I'd recommend this book to a friend.  Although I still don't know if I'd recommend it as fiction or non.

$REVIEW.: First off, let me start by saying that this book is not a normal read for me. Therefore, I was a little hesitant to review it but am glad that I buckled down and ended up reading it. I enjoyed reading about the journey of Melanie's trial and tribulations of everyday life. We are all at some point trying to figure out who we are and trying to find that one special person we want to spend the rest of our lives with. For what the story was the book was great. I found a lot of quirkiness in the book that was refreshing. Definitely a read that many people may over look but I believe you should take the plunge.This review was done by Kelleylynn as a part of First Class Books

$REVIEW.: This book may not be the most informative biography of Mandela, but as I didn't know much about him prior to this book has been an informative introduction


We get brief glimpses of the different sides of Mandela, told in an affectionate manner by Schechter

Admittedly, the &#34;A-Z&#34; concept seems to limit the amount of detail that can be covered, and also causes his story to be told non-chronologically
Despite that this book will still be enlightening for people not very familiar with Mandela's life, and also may be worthy of a read by those who already know a lot about him.

Berkow is a sports columnist and feature writer for the New York Times, but his journey to that point was long and hard - and is chronicled here in FULL SWING: HITS, RUNS, AND ERRORS IN A WRITER'S LIFE

From his early years as a poor student who flunked out of college in his first semester to his later passion for writing and determination to become a writer, FULL SWING charts a course through the literary and sports world which will engage and delight fans of Berkow


From his early inspirations to his tales of life at the Times, FULL SWING is a lively survey of a literary life and many achievements.Diane C

$review_text.: I adored the first half of this book, and slogged through the second half.I understand exactly where the author is coming from, by being disillusioned by all the places she visited - she was searching for things that no longer exist
 But her research and her journey had me completely hooked


 I'm only a casual Little House fan, but I absolutely understand her hope to see into the past, and her disappointment when it's not exactly how she would've imagined.But right about the time she journeys to the "working farm" is when the book starts to lose it


 At this point it doesn't feel like she's doing these things because she wants to, but more like she knows she's going to write a book about this whole experience and needs more fodder to fill the pages

 Just use more Laura stuff!  She obviously did the research and had obscure Little House info in abudance
 But instead there is a whole section devoted to the people who happened to be at the working farm the same weekend she was
 Who cares?  Not me, I was skimming, and had a hard time getting back into the book after that.So, in a way this book led me on the same journey the author had - I started out thrilled but ended up just a little disappointed


 But I definitely recommend this book for the first 180 or so pages - it is fantastic, her enthusiasm for the subject grabbed me, and I had a wonderful time on her search for the past.But one gripe - WHY oh why does she use the phrase "couple" instead of "couple of"?  Like nails on a prairie school slate


 "We saw a couple people."  "There were a couple things there."  WRONG


 So wrong.

Strength really focus on what you are good at and after taking the online quiz you can really hold on in on your abilities especially in your education and/or career. The one thing to really overcome is noting that for the other strength that may not be specified as your own strength, its not a weakness and I often times we can let this become barrier label in the realm of leadership so we have to really come back this idea so that we don't take away from anyone elses view of themselves and others.if you are someone who really loves leadership and believes in leadership theory then I highly recommend this book, but make sure you buy it new because you will need the code to be able to take the quiz.

$review_text.: There is an awesome interview of Sasha Summers in the blog:[...]And also check the great prizes to be won.The Story...When I started reading this book images of Uma Thurman was playing havoc in my inner mind. How the hell should I read a novel where the main protagonist has snakes dancing on her head, who is evil personified? Then Sasha Summers presents Medusa- A love story where she comes out as a beautiful priestess of Athena, whose beauty not only captures the eye of  mortals but also the Gods of Olympus.She was not born a Goddess and due to circumstances is turned into a monster. Till now, even when I had read that it was a curse which had turned her such, I always thought she enjoyed turning people into stones. Medusa the evil woman was replaced by Medusa the wronged one.[If I had to go through what she went through, I would happily be turning every man to stone and then chipping them off- and the Gods would be part of my sculpture collection too!!]Medusa was given to Athena to serve as her priests because her father had flooded the olive orchard of Athena. [What a way of life for the young child, not being given a choice of how to lead her own life!!] But she fulfilled all her duties with devotion and love. And then she met Ariston- a soldier of Athena, a guard for the priestess.Medusa's beauty was captivating and Ariston fell in love with her. But both of them knew their limitations and never crossed the line. Medusa had to remain chaste, not even a touch of a man was tolerated by Athena and after serving like that for many years, she was given the freedom for two days to lead her life as she wanted to. She chose to follow her heart.What happens after that forms the core of the tragic tale of Medusa's lifestory. How Poseidon becomes the part of the love story and how Athena rewards her followers makes you wonder are we mortals so bad after all? Do the Gods have no responsibility at all?What I liked...The relationships. They formed the core of this novel. Whether between the sisters of Medusa or between the two lovers - each had a place in the novel. Nothing was forced. The flow of the story kept me going[ Did I tell you I finished his book without taking a break and my DH did all the cooking :)] Well, to put it delicately-the power of the Gods was awesome and I found a writer whose books would always be a part of my collection. It was so damn interesting. [Need to freeze up some casseroles for the next book]I loved the way Poseidon feels true love washing over him when he washed over the two lovers on the beach. It was the lover's feeling which is depicted through Poseidon's emotional turmoil. Beautifully depicted, Sasha!I also loved the way how the two lovers, Medusa and Ariston, worked towards keeping each other safe even without meeting each other. Such a tragedy to be a slave to another being's [even if he or she is a God] wrath or desire.But mostly what I loved is the mythbuster that Medusa is all evil. The way she felt after she turned her first victims to stone was so unlike the image of Medusa, I had in mind.What I didn't like...Nothing that I would want to change. Yes I am a Greek mythology nerd and I did watch Percy Jackson at least 12 times. So when I got to read a different version of Medusa, I lapped it up. Medusa is projected so beautifully not only physically but also in thoughts. Of course I did not like P........[Sorry could not help it but I am sure after you read this book you all would agree with me. He is evil or what?]

$review_text.: It is well known that JFK was a womanizer. Unlike most of the women he "enjoyed" in this way, the artist and free-spirited Mary Pinchot Meyer meant something significant to him beyond the tryst. When JFK was assassinated, Mary, the wife of CIA operative Cord Meyer, knew right away that something was fishy. So she looked into it. She put together the facts available to her as a Beltway insider into a mosaic that clarified what really happened, who planned the operation, and why. Her biggest mistake was personally confronting the primary scoundrels prior to going public with the information. She knew them, and they knew her. They knew she could be vocal and non-compliant unlike other understandably reticent "company" wives. Mary's Mosaic is the story of how and why the CIA permanently silenced her.It's also the story of how they, as usual, set up an innocent fall guy to take the blame, and how attorney Dovey Roundtree, a lawyer with integrity - yes, some actually do exist - saved the life of the falsely accused Ray Crump. In addition, Mary's Mosaic reveals the story of Janney's awakening to the facts that had percolated under the surface of his life as he grew up. His father, Wistar Janney, was also a CIA operative with insider knowledge of the workings of CIA assassinations, and the Meyers were their friends and neighbors.Janney's work is well organized and well documented. He accurately covers Mockingbird, MKUltra, and other covert operations with details that put names and motives with dates and specific events. I was not surprised to see that it was issued by Skyhorse Publishing rather than a more conventional outfit. Get to the bottom of it with Peter Janney and discard any mainstream notions. The CIA routinely influences official and widely broadcasted ideas to cover their trail, but Janney's voice has demonstrated that, again, truth will always out.

$REVIEW.: In the first two volumes of THE COMPLETE CASE FILES you can still see Dredd forming. By this third volume he's fully formed into the stone-faced law-enforcer that the fans know and love. The consistency is now there. Tons of fun to read because the dry wit is finally showing up. Bolland's impact on the character is seen clearly regardless of artist at this point.

I gave 1 and 2 five stars but in all conscious I didn't feel this one like that there were more errors then the two previous ones. Sometimes when an author has a cut off date things can get hectic.

$REVIEW.: Ellie Stanton is the quintessential disgruntled teen who appears to have one helluva chip on her shoulder towards authority. As a decidedly grownup adult, it's easy for me to dismiss her angst as nothing more than misplaced, whiny anger. But she's a far more complex character who deserves a much deeper look into who she is. Ellie is basically the product of her own upbringing and situation. In the poignant story--one that struck very close to home for me as a 16-year veteren classroom teacher--Ellie's introduction into public school (and her eventual loathing of school and authority figures) happens all the way back in kindergarten when she's treated horribly by a teacher who abuses her power and humiliates a five-year-old child.While Ellie's runaway car trip may seem selfish, it's not. It's an attempt by someone whose own control has been revoked to exercise some measure of participation in the decisions that affect her. Even if the choices she makes at times aren't sound due to her age and maturity level, she owns them.I would have liked to see a little more common characteristics that would let a broader audience identify with Ellie instead of just watch her from the sidelines, but over all, there needs to be more books like this one for all the Ellie's of the world.
$SUMMARY.: For all the Ellie's out there...

$REVIEW.: I was on a "Zombie" kick and some how came across Nick Steckel's The Animals.  It was an engrossing read, that gave a bit of character developement,not unlike a short novel by the Great One-Stephen King, then the whirlwind of a ride started and didn't stop. I was actually reading this while on the road to Thanksgiving dinner, and did not do my share of the driving since I wasnt going to put the kindle down until I completed this. I happen to have a cat much like the mascot at the restaurent and now will look at her somewhat askance. I have to hand it to Nick Steckel for keeping the suspense going right up to the end.  I only wish it were published as I have some Stone Age friends that would enjoy this on paper. I will look for more of Mr. Steckel's work.

$REVIEW.: I was given a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.I was lucky to discover Rena Koontz when I read Love's Secret Fire.  When I was offered the chance to read The Devil She Knew, I was certain it would be a book that I loved.Cassidy is any of us.  She was a normal woman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She did the right thing and stood up to right the wrong that was committed against her friend, Jill.  That put her in the crosshairs of a seriously messed up mob boss.Rena amazes me with her writing.  I can see, touch and taste everything she is describing and it makes the book so much more real.Clay is a forever guy.  He is the guy that believes in his instincts, loves his family, cuddles babies and will kill for the one he loves.  Those are the types you hold onto forever.Tears gathered in the corners of my eyes at the loss of Amber and I was devestated at the devious behavior of Lauren.  This book is full of intrigue, suspense, and passion.  Cassidy can never deny that love healed her.

$review_text.: This isn't my normal type of book, but I picked it up during a free promotion and I'm glad I did. It's written in deep third person, and it's nice to see this perspective done well. Each character's voice was distinct, so I always knew whose perspective I was in. I've never been to South Africa, but the descriptions were vivid and I could really picture the surroundings.If you've never read Roger Smith before, you might want to read a sample first. This is not a light, cozy read. It's full of violence, foul language, and disturbing situations. For me, this just made the characters more real and the story more harrowing, but if you're offended by obscenities, you might find this book off-putting.Ishmael was a great antihero. Although his bad-to-good switch happened prior to the story, I don't think it was fully realized until he discovered Cindy's secret. Then it was on. And I really felt for Cindy. Some of her scenes make you want to look away, but you can't because you need to make sure she's okay. I do wish some of the other characters had been fleshed out just a little more, but for the most part, the characters were real and well-rounded.I would recommend this book to anyone who's okay with bad language and enjoys an antihero you can root for.

She trusted someone unworthy of her affection, leading to a kidnapping and the introduction of an amazing FBI agent. Her life is unraveling and she finds an anchor in Rick, the agent assigned to protect her.I appreciate that it wasn't instant love, but a friendship that developed from trust and mutual respect.

$REVIEW.: In Betrayals, book 2 of the Strange Angels series, we find Dru and Graves at a schola where Christophe has promised that she will be safe. Turns out her mother was part vampire and has passed that part along to Dru but she won't reach full power until she "blooms." As the only female in a school full of boys Dru feels out of place and alone at times. Graves has been accepted by the wolf boys and taught to fight whereas Dru is allowed to skip class and is always protected by someone. The discovery that someone in the schola is a spy and that Dru's mother was killed by none other than Christophe's father rocks Dru's world as she debates on whether or not to leave her friend Graves behind and just escape. I'd go into detail but I don't wanna spoil it too much. I don't usually like sequels more than the first ones but in this case I did. Christophe is mentioned more in the second book and is kinda introduced as a potential lover. However I can't deny the chemistry between Graves and Dru. Even though they are friends he clearly cares for her. He's always defending her and starting fights if someone picks on her. Dru is always thinking about him and how hot he's becoming. Dru makes a decision at one point to leave him behind but she decides against it because in the end he's all she's got. Once again the author repeats herself. Also Dru's feelings about Graves and Christophe are like a yoyo always bouncing back from one to the other. In the end I think it comes down to the fact that Graves seems to be the one who'll be there for Dru when she needs him.This is a fabulous sequel and I'm so ready for the third one!

$REVIEW.: These are some uncommonly twisted, irreverent and wholly amusing short stories, with the underlying thought being "just where did that idea COME from" running through my head.While seemingly unconnected, these thirteen stories all manage to carry a singular solid thread throughout: Frissore's ability to turn a phrase and make the mundane slightly absurd.  There are certainly stories that will provide you with a new perspective on the everyday life adventures, and others that will have you wondering just where one could encounter these characters in your daily life.  Particularly effective for me was the slightly more sarcastic responses and comments made by characters: we all have that interior voice that has a tinge of edge, his characters don't hit their mute buttons.Completely entertaining, this is not a book for the dour, the realist or people who can't appreciate some offbeat moments of levity in their life. With sock puppet art, and some clever pen and ink (it appears) sketches appearing throughout the text, there is also visual interest that enhances, separates and even just gives a feeling of light-hearted fun to stories that are just that.I received an eBook galley from the author for purpose of honest review.  I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$review_text.: An amazing series that keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Rene Folsom is the queen at cliffhangers.Jonah and Ella are in the middle of the world that they thought they knew, but it turns out that they really don't know it at all. All sorts of twists and turns are thrown at them but yet, they stay strong.Voices of the Soul: Holy WOW! This is an exceptional book. The ending blew my mind away. Knowing that this is a series makes me want to go get the rest of them and just sit and read them to find out what all happens next. I can not believe this, my mind is still reeling after having finished it.Ella is a college girl who lost her mother six years ago but is also a girl with a gift. She is able to hear the thoughts of others. While in an art class, a new student comes in. Not only is he like her, but he has an interest in her! After class they spend time together and Ella is unable to stop thinking about him. Later that night Jonah and Ella go on a date. Everything ends well when they go back to her house.Just as things start to heat up, the unexpected happens.....Go read Voices of the Soul to find out what happens between Ella and Jonah.Eyes of the Soul: Eyes of the Soul is not only book two in the Soul Seers series, it is also Jonah's point of view. This time every event that happens is how Jonah sees it and reacts to it.At the end of book one Ella finds out that her dreams weren't real. In this one we see Jonah dreaming of Ella and how it effects him. For six years he's dreamed of her and not been able to really see what she looks like. He knows her eyes are amethyst and that's it. Suddenly one night he gets her whole vision. Her blonde hair, how her body looks, everything.Jonah's father tries to understand but he doesn't want his son to be stuck on a woman that could turn out to not be real. He only wants his son to be happy. When he sees the picture that Jonah drew of her, he sees that he might know who she could be related to.Jonah's mother is worried since he's not eating and always waking up heartbroken. She wants him to be healthy and she supports his dreams as much as she can. She always comes over to his apartment and leaves food for him just so she knows that he's eaten at least once that day.At the end of the story Jonah meets a new member to his studio. Who is she though? Is she just another girl or is she the one that he's been dreaming of for the past six years? Read Eyes of the Soul to find outTruths of the Soul: Rene Folsom has me hooked! Every time she puts out a new book in the Soul Seer series, I have to read it right then! I am in LOVE with this series. Ella and Jonah have a very special place in my heart.Does fate ever play a hand in life? It would appear for Ella and Jonah that it does. After Ella wakes up from her coma, she believes that Jonah is just a figment of her imagination. A delightfully wonderful dream that she had while she was in her coma. Only, she soon finds out that he is real.Jonah first sees Ella when she comes in with her mother. He watches her from a distance scared to talk to her. Scared that if he touches her, she'll explode into glitter fire like she did in his dreams. He asks Jay who her mother is and when he hears her name, it all clicks for him. His Ella is real!When Ella comes back alone, he finally gets the nerve to talk to her. The two talk and have a good time while she is there in the studio with him. When she goes home, he's not ready to let her go and calls her to ask her out on a date.To find out how the date goes, you HAVE to pick up a copy of Truths of the Soul. The ending is one that will kill you but keep you holding on until the next is released. Changes are coming for Ella and Jonah...but are they good or bad?Blood of the Soul: Ai yi yi! This is one of the best ones yet in my opinion. Rene Folsom does a great job at keeping the reader wanting more Ella and Jonah. This has both heat and mystery."I just showed the man that I am all too quick to run for the hills when things get a little intimidating."Jonah and Ella have a rocky start but quickly everything is set back into place when they both admit to each other that things are moving a little fast for their first day together. Although they've known each other for six years in their dreams, things are different in real life." The abrupt and passionate movement caused several drops of rain water to fall from his hair and cascade between my cleavage."Throughout their first date, Jonah and Ella get a little hot and heavy several times, but each time they are stopped because Jonah doesn't want to push Ella and she said she wasn't ready. They both want what the other has to give, but they don't want to mess up a good thing. As long as things are looking up, the want to keep doing things the way they are."What was odd about this day is, my father usually forbade me to donate blood...ever."Ella and Jonah are finding that they seem to be connected by more than just love. Their hearts beat as one and when Ella talks about pain, Jonah feels it. Can the two lovers be connected by blood as well as love?Rene Folsom is notorious for leaving a cliffhanger that leads into the next book. The ending of this one makes me antsy for what the next one might bring. There are so many things that can happen between Ella and Jonah and their situation. There are truths to be told and answers to be found. But will they find those answers and still be together?Secrets of the Soul: By far the hottest book in the Soul Seer series! I loved this book from the beginning to the end.Rene picks up this one after Jonah saves Ella from her fall in the bathtub. He takes her to her room and lays her on her bed. The situation looks bleak so he calls his father and the doctor so that he can try and figure out a way to save Ella. But, the cure is closer than he thinks.Even though Jonah isn't getting the answers he needs from his father, he finds that he is the one that can save Ella through their bond.After Jonah saves Ella, he and her have a steamy meeting in a field of lavender flowers, only to be interrupted by who Ella thought was her best friend and Jonah knows as someone who works at his studio.Afterwards, Ella and Jonah go to his apartment for some quality time that ends up with them getting what they didn't get to do before.But, is this all there is for Ella and Jonah or will they end up having to split up because soul seers can't stay together. Can they beat the odds and find out how the bond of theirs works?Hearts of the Soul: The final chapter in the Soul Seer series! I'm sad to see it end but a lot of things were wrapped up and even an ending that leaves the reader questioning what they thought they knew before.Ella and Jonah are still together and still working out the things that happened when they found out that Ella has Jonah's blood in her. Their parents answered as much as they could but that still left a few things open that they had no clue about.Plus, the woman that Ella thought was her best friend has a different role in all of this. She has a personal interest in Ella's case but no one knows until she tells them.Jonah is still running his art studio with his best friend and now Ella. He's still head over heels in love with her and wouldn't change it for anything in the world, even if it is against the laws of their kind.When they finally meet with the council.....Bet you thought I'd give something away didn't you. Sorry but you'll have to pick up Hearts of the Soul to find out what happens with Ella, Jonah, and all their friends and family.

$review_text.: I must have bought this on a Kindle Special Offer because I never would have paid the asking price now. I only got about half way through &#34;The Forest&#34; before I was so bored I had to stop. I tried twice more, all to no avail. This is absolutely boring and never getting to a point at all. All affectation as if characters from some 1950s movie discussing nothing at all and solving nothing at all other than dropping names and who they know, all the while showing how far they themselves have apparently fallen. I can see the likes of Talluah Bankhead, Truman Capote, Joseph Cotton, and other arty-types praising themselves and discussing others not there to defend themselves. Where is the story?I will try again in a few months - or another year.12-6-12:  With all of the wonderful reviews I will try again with another story other than The Forest and perhaps will be able to change my low opinion of this book and its verbosity.Comment Comment | Permalink

 I felt the pace and arc of the story flowed well
I enjoyed David, Sophie, and the other characters, and the story had appeal and substance enough to draw me in
I liked this book very much


I feel it's a well-written romance about a couple who might not seem to be a match and have a bit of an awkward history

Overall, I definitely recommend this read.

I was utterly blown away with awe!Eloquence and inspiration is the captivating weapon used by the author to mesmerize readers. Indeed I was held captive by the efficient explanations and recommendations outlined. The uses of these essential oils were clearly presented. Certainly this awesome book reveals recipes for weight loss and face wash. All in all this is a great edifying and practical book.This is a must have!

$REVIEW.: As I'm writing this, I just realized that I needed to breathe....I think I was holding my my breath for most of this story, not because of being afraid but rather feeling as though I was in a trance the whole duration....Varian Krylov's novels are not like any other.....having read some of her other works of art, I can soundly say that they are one of the most erotic, thought provoking, intense and steamy reads of all time. I'm sure that anyone who has read either Abduction or Hurt would agree....This story revolves around the lives of Dario and Aiden. Dario, a writer, endured a horrible trauma earlier in his life, has his own remedy of putting a band-aid on it and waiting for it to heal....but, sometimes, wounds need to be more carefully treated in order to not spread. Enter Aiden, a cubicle inhabitant in a white collar job, who's real passion is his music...and, well, Dario. The two know each other as Dario has a warehouse and he allows bands play there on weekends....Dario is gay. Aiden is not labeled...The fact is that they are drawn to each other like moths to a flame...As these two move ahead with their feelings for each other, it's as if the heavens have destined them to be coupled. There is a passion, a lust, a love so strong, and that's why I found myself breathless...Dario deals with his demons, his insecurities, his kinks, with Aiden by his side, perhaps as his guardian angel...As this book moves along, there are two other characters that we meet. The first one is Vera, Dario's friend from NY. I didn't feel that she needed to be involved or included in this book. The second was Xavier, who I wasn't sure about at first, but I can see how necessary his character was for Dario to function...in the end, love is love, and isn't that what everyone deserves?This is a must read, it truly is...I think Varian Krylov is a genius and she is one of my all time favorite authors....Dangerously Happy surely gets put on my Re-read list....&#10084;&#65039;

$REVIEW.: This story does not live up to other books in the series.  But it is a short story and inexpensive.  Worth reading if you like the series.  A poor introduction to the series if you are not familiar with the series.  Perhaps too much to absorb for someone not familiar with the series.  But good pieces of background information, kind of like filling in the cracks in the mortar for those who are core fans of the series.Good buy for the price but don't use this to judge the series.

$review_text.: Swedish writer Henning Mankell is best known for his Kurt Wallander police procedurals. But his new book, DANIEL, is a heart-wrenching and moving stand-alone novel set in the late 19th century.It tells the story of Molo, an African orphan, and a Swede named Hans Bengler, who has been looking for insects in the Kalahari Desert. His plan is to find one that nobody else has discovered and to travel around Sweden displaying his collection. When he reaches an oasis in the sand, he sees a black boy who is being kept in a crate like a wild animal. In a rash moment, he decides to adopt him and "christens" him Daniel. Bengler has no idea nor does he care that within himself the child is still Molo. He tells Daniel to call him Father, but the boy remembers the parents who brought him up. Neither understands the other's language, which makes communication between them very awkward, especially since part of Bengler's plan is to display Daniel as an oddity in his show.They seem to be traveling endlessly as they make their way back to Sweden, and when the two reach Lund, a farmhand stands frozen in his steps upon seeing Daniel. He keeps repeating, "What is this?" "His name is Daniel," replied Bengler. "He's a foreigner on a visit to our country." The farmhand wants to know if Daniel is some kind of animal: "I've never seen anything like it," he said. "I've seen dwarfs and giant women and Siamese twins at fairs. But not this." "He's here so that we can look at him," said Bengler. "Human beings are made in different forms. But they are all the same inside."Bengler is a strange man who is very inward-thinking. He is solipsistic, which makes life more difficult for Daniel, who lives an active inner life planning to get back to the Kalahari Desert --- the polar opposite of the cold forests of Sweden. Daniel hears the story of Christ walking on water and sees a wooden crucifix hanging in a church. In his head he believes that these (Swedes) are more primitive than he had imagined. Daniel plans to learn to walk on water and make his way back to the desert. He sneaks out at night and goes to the local wharf to practice. Bengler is furious when he discovers that Daniel is leaving their crummy hotel room and wandering the night. Thus he ties him up and keeps part of the rope around his own hand. While it seems that Bengler might be trying to "humanize" Daniel, readers will be on to his game early in their relationship.When Bengler realizes that he will not be able to make a living showing off his bugs and the coal black boy, he abandons him to a middle-aged couple who doesn't have any children. Again Daniel is transplanted, abandoned and winds up with strangers who have no idea how to communicate with him or deal with him to make his life easier. This takes him further away from the water, and he plans constantly how he can get back to the sea and learn to walk upon it.But here he meets Senna, a retarded girl who tells him she's crazy. They become friends of sorts, and the two outcasts get along to a certain extent. Slowly Daniel learns to speak Swedish and is able to communicate and understand enough to get by. Senna is the first person he thinks he can trust. They want to run away together, but "life happens."DANIEL is a jarring book that provokes readers to remember that racist prejudices are not just a 20th- or 21st-century phenomenon. In the book's epilogue, the narrative jumps forward to 1995, and we are told about a man who is searching for information about Daniel and Bengler. He meets a tribe of nomads and tells them the story of Daniel and his tribulations in Sweden. They cannot help him with any information, but they seem to know the story from beginning to end as if it has been part of their consciousness for 120 years.In the afterword, Mankell writes: "This is a novel ...[and] does not necessarily depict what actually happened." The twists and turns in this almost mystical story prove the truth of those words.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum

I completely love her work and think is she pretty amazing.This story is a little different from her other work. It's Darker and Deeper on a whole other level.This book is an amazing setup for what is going to be an Emotional, intriguing, Controversial Love Story.Ryan is young and naive. Vera is a complete mess. Tony is very flawed on so many levels. This book was a little shortfor my taste but I am sure every installment will be packed with all the excitement we can handle and the angstthat drives us mad for more. Bring on the next installment. We are waiting with baited breath.

$REVIEW.: Good Lord, I was never able to read The Color Purple and having taught writing for years refused to let my students read it. Some of them actually thanked me later on. It fascinates, in a rather grotesque way, that Walker (last June) refused to allow a Hebrew translation of the novel, but the Israelis should be pleased at not having to submit their brains to the truly bad writing therein. Walker is a plain as day anti-semite and this book is chock full of it. She describes Israel's actions vis-&agrave;-vis the Palestinians as "genocide," "ethnic cleansing," "crimes against humanity," and "cruelty and diabolical torture." (And hey, what about AIDS? We know it was created in a Tel Aviv laboratory along with the Protocols!) The book also devotes 80 pages to a "screed on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict replete with fervently anti-Jewish ideas and peppered with explicit comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany." Twelve essays therein are filled with comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany. Walker has been an activist for Palestinian rights for some time, traveling to the West Bank and Gaza to protest Israel's treatment toward the Palestinian people. They deserve her. This book is an embarrassment.

$review_text.: HOLY CRAP!!!! Talk about emotional roller coaster!! Just as a fair warning you might want to keep some tissues handy, this time not just for happy love notes from Brady.  You also might want to prepare yourself for some yelling.  In my case there there were some STOPS!!! and NOs!!!! and NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! A few others but I'll let you figure those out while you read it yourself.  After IB and learning who Brady's parents really are and then Sheila's suicide, I thought there wouldn't be anything or anyone that could come between Brady and Tori.  Their love is so strong and amazing they can make it through anything, and anyone right?  The things they are put through in Irreversible Damage could be more than even their love can survive.  You thought that there were shockers in the first book, well Ms. Bell saved plenty for us in this one.  And then there is Tug... Oh Tug, all grown up and wearing suits, running a company.  I am so looking forward to his book!  In the meantime I am going to be thankful that I have a great case on my e-reader (there may have been a point I threw it into the couch like it was on fire because I was afraid to keep reading for fear of what was going to happen) I am also hoping my voice comes back, from yelling at them (seriously, why don't they listen?) and the crying (don't worry there were happy tears too).  It was all worth it and will be when I re-read it again, and again.  Thank you KJ Bell for giving us more of Brady and Tori's story!

$review_text.: A very well written and excellently researched view of the attempt of various down-and-out criminals to make easy money.  The 15 stories highlight the inexperience of the perpetrators, poor planning and the sad results for many of the victims.Every story was gripping and detailed to give a clear view into background and motives. It was difficult to put the book down and I admit I spent some late nights enthralled with the various stories.Sad to say, there were some very grim results in some of the stories.  After gaining insight into this horrible "cottage industry", I now better understand the severity of the laws governing punishment of kidnapping perpetrators.A great read, I recommend this book to crime and crime history buffs.

$review_text.: Looking back on this Kindle purchase, I now realize that I was desperate to fill the void in the Western Historical Romance genre that I've been experiencing lately; I've plowed through a myriad of Catherine Anderson, Jodi Thomas, and several other auto-buy authors.  Being a voracious reader, I read the premise of &#34;An Unchained Love&#34; and was intrigued with the beginning.On his way home to his hacienda, rancher Dustin comes across a lone cabin and decides to stop and ask for some neighborly assistance with shoeing his horse.  Though the farm's apparent owner, Hoover, begrudgingly assists, Dustin is horrified to find a young girl literally chained to the kitchen, forced to serve her Uncle Hoover as a cook.White Knight Time, right?  Well, Dustin does take the girl, Charlie, with him, convincing Hoover he needs her as a cook.  But first, he sleeps inside the cabin while the poor girl is locked in the frigid barn!  Jeez, man!  And poor Charlie is just glad to have someone be decent to her, I felt like she would've fallen for the first guy who didn't slap a manacle around her ankle.Something about the developing romance didn't ring true.  The conversations between all the characters, not just the hero and heroine, were stilted and simple.  And there were a lot of commas flying around where they shouldn't be.  The end was also so abrupt, I didn't think it was the actual ending.  It was like, &#34;Will you marry me?&#34; and &#34;Yes, I'll marry you.&#34;  Ta-da!!!It as a quick read, and it had a lot of promise, but the characters and storyline just weren't fleshed out enough for me.

$REVIEW.: Our Review, by LITERAL ADDICTION's Pack Alpha - Michelle L

Olson:I'm a big fan of big cat shifters, so I figured that I'd like A Jaguar's Kiss

I didn't think that I'd enjoy it quite as much as I did though...Gabriela is a strong, confident, alpha female jaguar shifter who works for the CIA and is coming back home for some R&R; after an incident leaves her shaken


She's looking forward to her time off, but not looking forward to running into her high school fling, the one man who broke her heart.Owen is Bear Mountain's wolf Pack Alpha, and an ex-military man


He's sexy, sensitive, and capable, yet he's stepped into some pretty big shoes, taking over the pack at the tender age of 23


He's also never forgotten his best friend and the woman who he was never able to get out of his thoughts - Gabriela.When a jaguar shifter killing humans brings the jaguar and wolf packs against each other, Gabriela and Owen find themselves working together to find out what's going on and confronting the still smoldering attraction between them

Owen has never forgotten Gabriela and while she's spent the last 10 years incredibly upset with Owen, she's never been able to get him out of her heart.Katie did an unbelievable job of fitting a story this intense with romance this steamy and emotion this strong into a novella


I was hooked and only wanted more when all was said and done


I would have liked a bit more story, but it is a novella and there are only so many pages to work with
So, if asked to choose between getting into the bad guys' heads a bit more and getting a bit more backstory vs

what Katie gave us with the romance and Owen/Gabriela storyline, I have to say I'll take what I was given

:)LITERAL ADDICTION gives A Jaguar's Kiss 4 Skulls and would recommend it to pretty much any Paranormal Romance fan.

$REVIEW.: I have to tell you that there was not much about this book I did not like.  It was well written; written by the way from the heart.  It dealt deeply with rescue efforts on the author's part and the part of her friends and associates and it was primarily about Boston Terriers...a breed of dog I admire and love.This is a personal record of the author's journey of self discovery through living a goodly part of her life through her dogs, beginning with her first Boston Terrier Otto, a rather "not so good looking dog" by Boston standards.  Through him and the other dogs in her life she found much about herself as a human being and it is most obvious that the dogs in her life helped her as much as she help the dogs.The author is a city dweller; a world I avoid almost at all cost.  When I first started reading the book I felt I would have trouble identifying with Julie Klam's story simply for that reason.  I am a country dweller; actually a deep woods dweller in a somewhat isolated area where my wife and I live with our four present dogs, two of them being dogs of this breeds.  I need no have feared though.  Emotions are emotions where ever you live and dogs are dogs and the author's delight over her animals and her bonding with them is no different than ours have been here in the hills.The book is very well written with parts being quite funny...the author has a wonderful sense of humor and the ability, so often lacking in we humans, of laughing at herself.  I liked that.  I do not take myself very serious and it is pleasant to run into a kindred spirit.This is an excellent read.  It is most certainly a book animal lovers in general and dog lovers, especially those who share their lives with Boston Terriers, in particular will enjoy.  It is a rather quick read and well worth the time.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks

$review_text.: What an incredible read.100% plot driven, but then.. Er, 100% character driven.  If you know what I mean? Everyone has a story, the secondary characters are so beautifully fleshed out and darkly endearing.. And who is going to betray Val next? Or first? IsLucas a lying, controlling meglamaniac who can't be trusted or a vampire on his way to redemption.  This is a pretty dark character..A dude so utterly evil and twisted that as he destroys an entire race of people, he kept his usually blond hair black, coated in their blood, of course.. And the dialogue.. Wo couldn't be affected as Lucas taunts his enemies before ruthlessly and efficiently kslaughtering em. And then, our poor Val who can't work out if she can save him and love him, or just toss him to the wayside to be devoured by all the peoples he's really pissed off over the years.  And she doesn't even have a chance to think about that when she has vampires, the Fay king and werewolves breathing down her neck. Oh my!Valerie is very fallible. She makes mistakes, and as a woman it is very easy to relate to her & see how her heart and dreams cloud over the facts and reality.. Especially when dealing with the men in her life.And to the author:I know you are no doubt being pestered from all quarters Mrs Hanson, but leaving me hanging to Summer 2012  is somewhat akin to ripping out my heart and leaving it on an island surrounded by rotting dead bodies and a few slivery eyeballs.. uck, well, maybe not quite akin.

This one I kept at steadily until I arrived at the end which indicates that the action and story line kept my attention. Some where between a military and romance story. I would suggest this book to anyone that enjoys military stories.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this book. It kept my interest and the romance was fun to watch grow. It's starts right away with Kelsey snipping at Matthew Benedict, and really that sets the tone for the book. It makes you laugh and want to cry, and then laugh again. It introduces you to a lot of people you just can't wait to read about.  It's one of my favorites by Ms. Covington.

$review_text.: Mike talks a lot about all of the pictures his partner, J&uuml;rgen Horn, took. However, I felt like they were really stingy on the photographs. I really love photographs and would love to have seen more. He kind of talked down about a lot of different aspects of the city. The book was more a scrapbook of their opinions regarding  their stay more than anything else. But,if you want to tour Savannah,or are as interested to learn what Savannah is like (as I am... and NO, not because of Paula Deen nor "Midnight in the Garden Of Good and Evil" as Mike complains too many tourists flock there for) this is a kind of fun read (in a snarky kind of way). It needs many more photos, though, and less snobbery.

$review_text.: In this second book of the Cotillion Ball series, Becky Lower continues the stories of the Fitzpatrick family. This time, we're learning more about Heather Fitzpatrick. She and her twin sister, Jasmine, are about to come out at the cotillion when she meets a young Army officer who was instrumental in saving the lives of family members in St. Louis. David Whitman is a southerner, however, from a slave owning family. Heather and her family are abolitionists. In fact, the night she meets David in a New York restaurant, she and her family rescue the very slave he is in the city to find and take back. That sets up the conflict between the two as they fall in love but have to overcome their political and familial differences to find their way to a happy ending.Lower has the knack of weaving actual places and bits of history through a lovely romance and making it all seamless and fun to read. The time period she has chosen to write about is an important one in American history. But the battles and politics we've been taught in school don't tell us much about the consequences of the turmoil on the lives of ordinary people. Lower shows us some of that in her books with style and grace.This is the second book in a series but it stands quite nicely on its own. However, I would certainly recommend you read the first book. And pre-order her third which is coming soon. I have.

$REVIEW.: Limerick is the second book in the Shimmer Trilogy, a novella book series that I find to be surprisingly addictive. Jensen  had a lot of info dropped on her in book one and she went straight into the deep end of the reality of her life, that she is half Fae and her family isn't who they claim to be. Jensen retains that bravery she showed from the first book and puts it to use. Her voice is also really good and I enjoyed her personality for the most part, since she's the narrator it makes the book really easy to read and get into. I really like the inclusion of the Lady of the Lake myth and it's really interesting to see how that pans out. There is also a variety of fantasy creatures involved in this one, including Dragons though they do take a much more human appearance of course. I wish that some of the creatures had been explained a bit more, I think the book would have been better for it. There were also a few issues with the romance and the resulting quarrels that came with it, because it honestly just didn't work for me. Of course there is also the matter of the cliffhanger...which drives me crazy! I love that they keep me interested but at the same time I hate that it cuts off with no answer, ugh. Overall I think it's a promisingly series and while it has it's issues I enjoyed it for what it is, though if more was added to the book I wouldn't object because I think it would benefit from a tad more depth.

$review_text.: I sometimes like mysteries where the plot is secondary to the atmosphere. I'm a Chandler fan, after all, and that was his forte at least some of the time. However, it gets pretty hard to take when the setting is only interesting in some of its aspects, and the characters are less compelling than they ought to be.Fiona Fitzgerald is a homicide detective in Washington DC. She grew up there because her father was a senator. In this instance, Fiona and her new partner Izzy (a black Jew, no less) investigate the death of a prominent conservative political columnist, who fell, jumped, or was pushed in front of an subway train. Since he was in disguise, wearing a fake mustache and glasses he didn't need, things are very confusing, to all but the reader. The author opens the book with a prequel chapter than explains the disguise, so that there's no suspense as long as the detectives are trying to figure out why he was wearing it. That takes (literally) about half the book, and by the time they begin to unravel the clues and discover new things, if the killer hasn't occurred to you, you're not really paying attention.The setting is in places interesting, and the main character is at times interesting too, but the rest of the characters are frankly not that fascinating, certainly not enough to hold a book like this together when the plot is so plodding and slow. I just wasn't that impressed.

$REVIEW.: This is a book that provides more questions than answers. The author, an engineer, proves how hard it would have been for the ancient Egyptians who built the temples , created the statues, etc. to achieve the precision they did. However, in the absence of any evidence his suggestion that they used, among other things, giant (2.5 meter diameter) copper saws with diamond studded teeth to saw through blocks of granite sounds preposterous to a layman like myself. Still, well written and very interesting indeed.

The 3-D lizards and "food" rocks are unique, and the mystery eggs are easy for the youngest painters. I collect lots of beach rocks and can see a use for them other than just tossing them into the garden. This would be a wonderful hobby for those who enjoy crafts and don't want to do large paintings. I am now making a "kit" for my nieces for Christmas that will include all the necessary materials and the book.

$review_text.: Not Quite Mine is a terrific contemporary romance, and if you've read a Bybee novel, you know just what you are getting: believable characters, realistic dialog, humor, 'aw-that's-so-sweet' moments, and prose as smooth as warm caramel sauce. This book features a cute baby, a hunky hero, and a heroine that grows up over the course of the book.While the baby's parentage is very obvious, it really doesn't matter since we all know the story will end happily. And, the fun is watching Katie grow and the love between her and Dean reignite. There's not a lot of excitement and no one is wrenched emotionally. It is just plain, sweet romance. There are great secondary characters, and by the end of the book you will be hoping Ms. Bybee has Happily Ever Afters planned for all of them...including the PI.For those who like to know, there is sex, but it is described in very spare, general terms. There is some foul language in the dialog, but not a great deal. The tone of the book is positive and fun, not dark and miserable, so it is a perfect choice for a quiet afternoon, lounging by the pool, waiting for the kids, or any time you just want to escape into a romance. 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Terrific contemporary romance!

$REVIEW.: Very well written and fascinating story of what was the greatest church in the world before St. Peters and the order that ran it and much of Europe.  It really fills in a definite blank spot in history as far as I am concerned.  By "greatest" I mean largest and most important.  Until tbe construction of St. Peters, Cluny played at least as major a role in Christendom as did Rome.  As far as Europe is concerned, Cluny and its clergy were probably more influential among all but the ruling class.

I liked that he admitted to her about how he felt towards her and the way she was being treated. I wasn't expecting the accident to happen but I wasn't too surprised when they did the blood test. I kind of expected that to come about when Julianne substituted and she thought to herself as to how they looked similar.

BUT

I think ultimately, I have to say Aeron is the hands down sexiest, and Arthur was maybe the most heartwarmingest.Saranna DeWylde once again gives your favorite legends and myths a fun new twist in this Desperate Housewives installment, and man, those folks in Avalon really needed their happily ever afters, because they were soaking in guilt and duty and complacency for far too long.and maybe that's why I loved Aeron the most

He wasn't soaking in anything except awesomesauce
And if this book doesn't make you want to look him up and read all his myths, then..


nothing can help you.and that is what I love about DeWylde's Desperate Housewives stories -- they get me excited about mythology and make me want to read and reread all the myths I know to find her inspirations for the twists she gives these familiar characters.

$review_text.: This book reminded me of the TV show 24.  Fast paced and unpredictable.  And the story was interesting.  All the talk about the KGB, espionage, deceit, and spy games... it got me hooked!  It had a very engaging cast of characters.  I wish some of those introduced early in the story stuck around until the end, or maybe an update on what they were doing at least.  Talanov might already be out of the KGB but he was surrounded by another group of well-connected people.  I hope the author revisits these characters in the sequel.  (With an ending like what this books has, there's got to be a sequel!)It was very in-your-face.  The author did a fine job playing with the story, weaving different plots leaving Talanov in the center of it all.  Talanov is a pretty cool dude -- ex-KGB, a polyglot, sexy, resourceful, master gunman, and very adept in hand-to-hand combat.  It's an action movie in a book.  Even his wife got into the action.However, I found some of it very... convenient.  Talanov has a lot of friends who know a lot of people.  And all of them were willing to help a complete stranger, let alone someone labeled a fugitive.  Talanov is a really slippery guy!  He should've been hurt a couple of times but he Talanov was saved by his wit and abilities.  And with a little help from his friends.Rating: 4/5.Recommendation: Fans of Robert Ludlum and other similar authors.  It's an action-packed thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat.  Visit the book's website for the book trailer.

$review_text.: I saw this book several times at the library and brought it home twice and ended up taking it back without reading it. When I went back a few days ago and couldn't find anything else, I brought it home yet again. This time, I actually starting reading it.... and couldn't put it down. I fell in love with it about 10 pages in.Raised by Wolves is such a well written story. If there were any editing flaws, I didn't even notice I was so immersed Bryns world. It is fast-paced and exciting, but it is also an emotional story. I loved Bryn from the first page. She is a sarcastic, pain in the butt girl but she is also strong and courageous and loving and respectful. She has issues and heartache and fear that she deals with, but she handles it without being mopey and miserable and whiny about it. She is a great creation. Every character in this book was written well. I was drawn to every one of them, in one form ar another; from Bryn and Chase to Devon and Casey and Ali and Lake. The emotions, from good to bad, through the pack bond or just someones own personal emotions were so strongly written that I felt them myself. I felt like a part of the story, not just an observer. THAT is what I look for in a book. Something that sucks me out of my world into a completely different one. It sounds silly, but thats what reading is about for me, an escape.This is such a fantastic story. I am glad that I finally took a chance on it. Can't wait to read Trial by Fire. J.L.B is an awesome author. She has a fan in me for life. And, finally, a Werewolf fan.

$review_text.: I thought this book was a very nice read with some great tips for gaining self confidence through the use of neuro linguistic programming. I personally believe in mind over matter, and try and utilize the technique as much as possible, especially in times of stress.NLP is very similar to mind over matter in my opinion. The Author gives a very simple, yet informative explanation of what NLP is. I'd bet that most people don't even know what it is. And many people that do may have thought it to be some sort of hocus pocus type of quackery. Well the Author explains also that it isn't that, nor is it as complicated as the name it was given makes it out to be.I liked the part about anchoring in the book. I am personally going to practice this technique. I will figure out my own way to implement this into my routine, if I see it to be a benefit to me I will continue to utilize it until it becomes a part of who I am.Overall a very nice read, and I would recommend this for anyone wanting to learn more about the mind.

Loved that the main characters were from Southie (South Boston) I could totally picture them in my head,This book was funny and romantic.  I found myself laughing out loud!

$REVIEW.: John F. Kennedy's 1939 journey through a Europe on the brink of war involved something other than simple research for a senior honors thesis?  That is the premise upon which Francine Mathews bases her novel of speculative historical fiction "Jack 1939".In Mathews' book, Kennedy is combining his research trip with a spot of intelligence gathering at the behest of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Young Jack's diplomatic passport, charm, and family connections (his father is the American Ambassador in London) are supposed to ease his way for both his stated and unstated purposes for traveling across the European continent.I found this book much easier to take if I forgot all about the fact that the protagonist was supposed to be John F. Kennedy, and read it simply as an espionage/spy story.  Without the Kennedy connection I was able to enjoy the book for what was, in my opinion, a sort of political thriller.It would take a very unusual person to think that sending a young man who speaks only English, poor French and knows Latin to sniff out intelligence in countries that don't have English as a primary language.  So, not knowing the lingua franca of most of the countries he lands up in, our hero bumbles around Europe pursued by a thuggish assassin and relies on the assistance of a beautiful woman, her husband, and a German diplomat of questionable loyalty.Outside of the characters of FDR and Churchill, the historical figures that appear in the story are fairly accurately portrayed.  Heydrich was a vicious personality, imperfectly hidden behind a veneer of sophistication; Joe Kennedy Senior was a successful businessman and lady-chaser who was not necessarily the best choice of diplomats; Rose Kennedy was highly religious and turned a blind eye to her husband's philandering since she did not believe in divorce; George Kennan was an intelligent career diplomat who disagreed with many of his superiors; and Kathleen Kennedy was in love with William Cavendish, son and heir of the Duke of Devonshire, which distressed both sets of parents.Mathews' writing flows nicely, and "Jack 1939" is very readable, once I got past the basic implausibility of the plot.

$review_text.: The lecture by Dr. Weil is excellent information on the dynamics and scientific work being done with medical hypnosis.  The sessions with Dr. Gurgevich on Disc 2 were a review for me having already been trained as a hypnotherapist.  Therefore, this is a CD I would only listen to once and/or refer to if trying to start someone else out with hypnosis. However, I did go to Dr. Gurgevich's website and order 4 of his CD's specific to some medical issues and impending surgery I am dealing with.  Therefore, I do belive their information is accurate and effective.

$review_text.: It's almost baffling how long it took US publishers to start licensing Kano Miyamoto's BL titles.  The first offering available in English, by the newer Deux Press, succeeds as an introduction to her style.The thing I would have to say is Miyamoto's strength is her ability and will to show both the best and worst in human relationships.  Not everything is the idealized perfect first love experience where two men just "happen" to become attracted to each other and live happily ever after forever with no question about the stability of their relationship.  Miyamoto's characters are human, flawed, make mistakes and those mistakes have longer lasting ramifications in the story than as plot devices to bring together love interests.  Not every relaionship ends happily, and in fact, many relationships fail before an individual finds someone they can truly be happy with.  The repetitive cycle of this concept in her works might be Miyamoto's greatest contribution to the genre.The title story about the gay high school teacher and his prostitute turned lover is at times sweet, touching, heartbreaking and disheartening.  Mr. Sakura is a gay man in the difficult position of being a teacher in a religious school and therefore being forced to hide his identity to his colleagues.  Ryoichi is a younger man who works for and frequents a male brothel where Sakura picks him up for a loveless one night encounter.  Their relationship continues when Sakura hires Ryoichi to stay with him over his week long summer break for reasons he won't discuss, but seem to be related to his own loneliness, having just ended a relationship to another man.  The events that proceed reveal a lot about both men and a lot about what it means to be gay in a society that looks down upon alternative lifestyles.  Miyamoto doesn't skirt around the negative attitudes of people put under this kind of strain, either.  Sakura in particular seems to struggle with his life choices and takes a lot of his frustrations out on Ryoichi, and we aren't expected to "forgive" him for those weaknesses, either (as the one "non-con" scene shows).  He must come to terms with those mistakes and make new choices to bring about a more postive future for himself and Ryoichi.If the title story isn't enough to draw you in, however, the book also includes what I would argue is the first part of Miyamoto's best and longest spanning universe with the short story, A Bird At Sea, A Door in the Sky, where she introduces Ryuu Utsumi for the first time.  Ryuu goes on to star in a more complete manga series, Hydra, yet to be licensed for English publication, but in this short story we learn about the most tragic part of his life, the event that would shape all of his future dealings with other people, for better or worse.  He meets another "outsider" in the gay former US serviceman, Stephan, and through their meetings and friendship they find in one another some brief comfort from their lonely existences.  It's a heartbreaking story and just the way to introduce the characters and situations that will surround Ryuu and the people that will have longer lasting interactions with him in future stories by Miyamoto.  While we wait for the release ofLovers And Souls (Yaoi), a story taking place in the same universe almost ten years in the future and starring a completely different cast that who we meet in this story, we can use this one to whet our appetites.Miyamoto's love scenes are never particularly graphic, but her style is more psychological and emotional.  You spend more time thinking about the ramifications of the human interactions in her stories than focusing on the actual panel by panel presentation.  It's refreshing and endearing at the same time.  Even when these scenes aren't "pretty," they are important and necessary and draw your further into the story.In all, I highly recommend Kano Miyamoto's works, including this one.  Her art style is a little different, but I personally like it very much and look forward to hearing about many more English licenses of her works in the future.  As an introduction to the genre this title is a nice one volume addition to a new or growing collection of BL.

$review_text.: Cut & RunReviewed by Ann & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogTwo Alpha FBI agents. A murder case and a whole lot of steam.That's how I would describe Cut & Run. In the first book in the addicting series that stars Ty Grady and Zane Garrett, my M/M fantasies have been brought to life.There are so many things I loved about this series. I don't think I could name them all. First off, I just need to remind everyone again that I LOVE TY AND ZANE!!!! Seriously, the next couple that is next to them on my "favorites things" list is Blay and Qhuinn from the BDB series and you know how much of a fan I am of them already. Ty and Zane are on the same field. In this book, we see the claws come out. When Ty and Zane are unwillingly put together on a case, things get rough and though they bicker the entire time, it's always entertaining to read their banter. No one does it better.Paired with the good humor, there is also a stellar suspense plot that pulls the entire story forward. I was hooked from the first page and really couldn't stop until the very end. As Ty and Zane work together on the case, you can see their relationship slowly changing. They go from hating each other to insulting one another to finally learning to trust their new partner. There was already so much growth to their relationship and this is only the first book!I noticed that there was some lagging in transitions. I think this may be due to the fact that two authors are working together to make this work, so it wasn't as tight. But I still really enjoy this book!If you're looking for an M/M romance series that will blow you away, this is it right there. Look no further.

$review_text.: In 1946, after intensive research, Peter Drucker wrote Concept of the Corporation, a study of decentralization at General Motors

Drucker's book had a profound influence on the business world, particularly on Japanese auto manufacturers, such as Toyota, which incorporated many of his ideas into its operations with great success
Flash forward to 2006, when Ori Brafman and Rod A
Beckstrom wrote this pivotal book about "leaderless organizations." Their insightful analysis concerns the remarkable organizational revolution under way as hierarchies (spider entities) give way to decentralization (starfish entities)
The fundamental tension between these two forces remains a pivotal dynamic in business
Today's decentralization movement makes awareness even more critical


GM failed to learn from Drucker's book

This turned out to be a huge mistake

We recommend: Do not make the same mistake with this important book; it should not be ignored.

$review_text.: This is a motivational book. It is one about taking responsibility for your life. The book is not only for the late teens or early twenties. It is also a great inspirational book for people in their 30's right up to people in their 70's.One of the important points that Tom corson-Knowles emphasizes is that rich people don't only behave differently from the majority of society, they behave differently as well. While middle-class earners focus on being comfortable (and saving some money), rich people focus on earning money, and a lot of it. Rich people also don't think that having a lot of money is evil.I love these three passages from the book, which I will post on one of my websites or in one of my quote books:"If you still believe that the economy is the reasonyou are broke then you will always be broke.Because the economy is never going to solve your problems.ONLY YOU CAN SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS."-- Tom Corson-Knowles"I'd rather aim for trillionaireand settle for millionaire than aimfor nothing and stay broke all my life.How about you?"-- Tom Corson-Knowles"Financial independence gives you thetime and the resources to truly makea difference with your life instead ofjust trying to get by. True abundancecomes when you have financialindependence -- and the entire world benefits."-- Tom Corson-KnowlesEven though this book may not necessarily offer anything amazingly new for people who have already read books such as "The Millionaire Mind" by T. Harv Eker or "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki, Tom Corson-Knowles's "Rich by 22" is a great book to use as a daily reminder for what it takes to attain financial independence and true prosperity. Tom also makes the important point that prosperity is in the eyes of the behoulder. Some people can feel rich and prosperous with a lot less money than it takes for others to feel rich and prosperous.

$REVIEW.: Like the original Color Me Beautiful, this book has limited value.  I refer the reader to the more accurate More Alive with Color, if you are a "spring" in this book typing, for like in the original, this book limits your palette unrealistically. For example, I am an ivory skin, blue eyes with gold flecks, golden dark blonde hair (spring in this book). I look terrific in sienna and some warm burgundy colors, warm old world colors--people always exclaim when I wear those color--more than any others--but are they in the spring palette? No. They are in autumn, a much darker "color"....Black and pink are forbidden, nonsense--it depends upon how you wear black--it can be beautiful on an ivory skinned blonde! Again, many compliments when I wear black with gold jewelery. And pink--rosy yellowy pinks--again, beautiful, but the book says for Springs not to ever wear pink!  The makeup pages are very limited.  The book doesn't have much useful information and lots of fillers, and seems to benefit those most who are winters or summers. The author appears to be a winter...  In More Alive with Color, there are 3 palettes. I am a Sunlight in that system, and all the colors are there that look good on me, and a much more meaningful discussion. The author is a fashion expert, used by major magazines. It also has a much better discussion about how to type yourself.

I want to be polite without compromising my own beliefs.  This little guide is a must for anyone who has been in that situation, or who will be in the future (which probably includes most of us not living in a tree or a cloister.)The book is concise in providing a overview of the correct behavior in a variety of different religious contexts.  Some religions have loosened their strictures over the years.  But many expect that guests will follow proper decorum.  This book helps a person to be comfortable in any surrounding, and to ensure that others are comfortable also. It also allows you to skip a religious experience which you might find not to your taste.Recommended.

It stays open much better than the bound BCP, of course, but I have yet to think of a way to conveniently find the lectionary entry for the day.  There's only a header for the lectionary section as a whole, but I'd love to have a function that allows me to choose which lectionary I want and has me jump to the current date.That said, because the kindle remembers the last open page, I don't need that jump very often, so it's not a big deal.

$review_text.: I started reading, and couldn't put it down! It was not a wise choice to start this book late at night. Sleep is a bit important.Right away you are pulled in to the life and mind of Lil. A teenager, who is still trying to figure out who she is, comes into her powers with a twist. New home, new school, new friends, supernatural powers? What? That's exactly what Lil is feeling, and Ednah portrays that so well. Lil is a character that every teenage girl, or those who've been through their teenage years, can relate to. She's discovering herself for the first time; who she is, what her purpose in life is. I'm sure guys can relate to that as well, and if not, there's enough "manly" action to keep their attention. Fast moving, with just enough background to keep you guessing till the last chapter, this story comes right off the pages.The characters are exciting and refreshing. I loved the idea of a strong female lead, with just enough problems to make it personal. But even before you dive into the story, you meet Bran. *Swoons* Yes, Bran. Tall, mysterious, and gorgeous. Come on ladies, you know the type. The one that flutters your heart whenever he's in sight. I wont reveal any details, but I need to mention the fact that he's a darling. *Wink wink*Actually, I enjoyed every character in this book (that doesn't happen very often). Serious kuddos to Ednah for taking this story to a very interesting level, with very interesting people. She does not over do it with descriptions, but lets the simple words and actions speak for themselves, which I find refreshing :)I recommend this book to anyone! Whether or not you enjoy YA fiction, you can find something in this book that makes it worth reading. . Happy reading!

$REVIEW.: I'm rating this book on the strength that it is the authors first novel...here it goesThe story revolves around four friends, Syria. Nikki, Shani, and Monica. They are the best of friends and truly have each other backs. They get &#34;booed&#34; up with some ballers, Coke, Tre, and Mike, but there friendship remains strong as ever. Coming to there girl rescue, causes a strain in the girls in unbreakable bond. After this situation, all kinds of drama comes at the girls and their boos. Will they survive the hardships that life is sure to bring?This book would've been so much better if it was edited. There were misspelled words, change of verb tense, omitted or duplicated words in sentences, etc. the grammatical errors took away from the story, but I'm not counting that against the author..this time because it is her first book.  Decent &#34;hood&#34; love story.

$REVIEW.: This is the perfect gift book for someone that loves tea. Or for someone that you want persuade into drinking more tea. Jenna Mars has managed to do something very special, she has captured the essence of tea in more than one way. She has shared her childhood memories, shed some light on the history, described some unknown health benefits (at least to me) and ended with some very special recipes. And when she writes how tea &#34;... always brought us together and allowed us to celebrate the good times and gain peace of mind and relaxation in times of difficulty.&#34;, I know exactly what she means: Tea can create magic.

$REVIEW.: This is a new author for me.  This book was recommended by a friend and I was unsure as it was described as a sweet love story.  I am not an avid reader of love stories without mystery or suspense.  So sweet love story sounded a little to slow for me.  Well this is a sweet love story with a lot of suspense an over abundance of wonderful people who I quickly fell in love with.  I actually laughed out loud a few times and cried a few times and teared up about 6  times.  I really don't know how to explain how all that happened in a book with less than treasures 200pages.  Mary Manners writing ability is amazing.This book should never be described as just a sweet romance.  The characters are so wonderful you love them, root for them laugh and cry for them.I will wrap this  up by saying I will give nothing away about Buried Treasures except that if you don't read it you will missOut on a real treasure.  As soon as I hit submit I will be going to find out what other books are available by this author.  I truly loved reading this book.

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ve been looking forward to reading It Began With Ashes ever since I read David&#8217;s short story From Man to Man, which was sort of an interlude/teaser for this novel. I have to say that the book was worth the wait, as from the first chapter you are drawn into the story! The novel is based in the fictional world of Wroge, which after a time of invasion, war and conquest, has held an unsteady peace between the various Kingdoms and Clans for the last twelve years. The wars fought over a decade earlier saw the rise of the Arneutons, who now rule Wroge with a strict hand, and the exile of the Vikir, a fearsome tribe of horn-helmed warriors, that were banished to the icy wastes in the North of Wroge.In amongst these tribes are the Keltir, a clan that fought for the Arneutons during the war. After their loyal service during the war, the Keltir are now forced to scratch out a living on the border of Wroge. The Torne, a subsection of the clan, mostly live in and around Hearth Village, which is only a short distance from the exiled Vikir.On the road to Hearth Village, Astartes is nervous. From the seat in his father&#8217;s cart, he is convinced that someone or something is stalking them through the forest. His father tells him not to be ridiculous, as no bandits would dare attack them this close to the village and more importantly, this close to the Mercenaries&#8217; Guild. However, Astartes is not convinced and as the cart passes through a dark clearing, he notices a human shaped figure watching them, but this is not what scares him the most, it&#8217;s the fact the figure is wearing a horned helmet&#8230;Meanwhile in Hearth Village, Draven is part of the Keltir and has a dark and dangerous past. Serving as a mercenary, Draven fought during the Arneuton invasion and numerous other wars. However, after the birth of his son Kale, Draven gave up the hard but well-paid life of a mercenary to settle down with his wife and son.  Draven and his family managed to survive in the small village of Hearth after Kale&#8217;s birth. However, twelve years on, things have become dire and Draven must return to his job as a sword-for-hire to feed his family, much to the distress and anger of his wife Morganna. However, on the eve of Draven&#8217;s departure, fate turns against him and sends an old and dangerous enemy to Hearth Village resulting in Draven, Kale and Morganna&#8217;s world being turned to ash.This book was great! Interestingly, when I was reading this book I was also listening to The Warded Man by Peter V. Brett as an audiobook. Both of these books are quite similar- they&#8217;re both fantasy novels and are set in a medieval sort of environment. However, out of the two novels I can honestly say that I preferred It Began With Ashes! As I said above, the vision of the helmeted warrior in the first chapter really caught my attention and after that, I was totally hooked with the novel!  I love that fact that you find out more about Draven&#8217;s past in this novel, whereas in From Man to Man it is left really mysterious.I can&#8217;t wait for the next instalment of the Wroge Elements to find out more about Draven and Kale&#8217;s story! I would suggest this book to anyone who is a fan of fantasy novels. I also think that fans of The Warded Man would really enjoy this novel and should definitely check it out! I&#8217;d also say that you should definitely read From Man to Man before you check out this novel, as it really adds to the plot in this book. Plus, as a short-story on its own, it is a really great read!For more book reviews google adam-p-reviews

I loved Marcus and his love for Kat that he even put his own feelings aside for her true love. And doesn't every girl want someone like Stephan in their life?

$REVIEW.: This author should simply be asked to run the problem that is unknown to most Americans

Crime is crashing and inmates are exploding


In this context Jens Soering is a top intellectual leader with real world smarts and an IQ that likely is to the moon--and my job is sensing intellects in minutes.HERE IS REALITY IN AMERICA:YES, WE HAVE LESS CRIME, BUT AN EXPLOSION OF MORE INMATES!This means the USA is becoming ANTI-LIBERTY


And we are the leading jailers in the world, and when a FBI top detective warns sharply that many police and other arrest hunters need to be feared as in the top book ARREST PROOF, you know the USA is not the land of the free.And God help you if police notice you have a carry permit for a gun to protect yourself
Some will actually make some type of arrest just for that reason! Thankfully, others are calm and know you support a safe county, state and country.Unfortunately, in terms of quality citizens carrying firearms, some police who are afriad of guns--other than thiers, seem to even fear theologians, missionaries, pastors and model citizens who carry
Perhaps they worry you are going to add to the 16,000 murdered in uniform as heros
I think some forget who is often present at a crime when they are not around._________________________________________________Jens has material that is in the top 1% in this area


He is a phenom and an exceptionally clear writer with content that is fantastic


Required reading form ANY PERSON OF ANY FAITH INVOLVED IN JUSTICE AND PRISONS
If you are not a Christian, ignore those limited parts.This man is nothing short than a gift to the planet.He is also a gift to the USA


Since America is the leading PRISON NATION, with 25% of prisoners, we are a total joke in terms of freedom

Please, I am not saying this to be mean, I say it because I am watching arrest and jail mills, in which those without good lawyers are simply destroyed.We crush all nations including Russia, Iran, N


Korea, China, etc in the % and numbers we have in jails.The get "tough on crime" approach in the past which I stupidly believed, made sense because I had low contact with real courts unless I was an expert

This "jail em all" approach shows many people with a fetal level of knowledge who have no idea what is going on in the USA--they are like me ten years ago.We have police and sheriffs moving from peace officers to paramilitary arrest mill workers


Many weekly abuse their power

Yes, some police are utter wonders and really great and balanced people


But I have sensed a great shift in 40 years from the police as my protector, to the police as the enemy of freedom, as more and more paper laws and other laws exist.Dearest Jens, as with others I talk to who are in prison, and who call my home daily to talk of life, faith, justice, prison reform and family, I would prefer an hour with you more than perhaps anyone on the earth.You are a great and immensely wise prophet

I fear for those who ignore prisoners, because as CHRIST JESUS said, "Since you never came to visit me [in prison], I never knew you--depart from me you wicked ones."While no one can do all Jesus asks, rejection of inmates is simply anti-CHRIST
Obviously, he does not mean those who might try to kill you during a visit--these exist, bit are NOT the norm.We are already seeing the end of justice in the USA, as noted by our UTTER LACK OF SOLUTIONS other than the stupid, inept answer to all problems of "jails, jails, jails," which should make some pause who despise the convicted.In the real world, the arrest reports are cooked as often as a Julia Child's cookbook, some sheriffs and police routinely violate ethics and act criminally, Internal Affairs is utterly a joke, the AG's are looking for wins not justice, and some judges are clueless about what an hour in jail is like and can be frankly impaired or sadistic.I support firm sentences on those who are clearly guilty and certainly repeat violent offenders

Meaning, people obviously criminal to someone with an IQ of 90--below average

If you need a lawyer to know the law, that is messed up in any aspect of criminal law

It means the crime is not obvious.I DO NOT SUPPORT PAPER CRIMES UNLESS the criminal STEALS THE PENSIONS OF MANY, AND DO NOT SUPPORT NON-VIOLENT DRUG CRIMES WITH LONG SENTENCES.I do not support the secret war against people who carry firearms to protect themselves
The notion the police or a sheriff is going to save you during a crime--one that might last two seconds to four minutes is fascinating denial.Having one item on a restaurant menu is usually a junk place to eat
Well that is the USA's answer to everything wrong--prison, prison, prison, and it makes me see why we are a country on the decline, because the smart people with ideas are on the edges of power.Jens, I love you brother and keep writing
You are as good as any top international reporter--only better.

$review_text.: This is far and above the best small/independently published novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading, in addition to being well written, extremely gripping and packed out with believable characters, Dawson also includes a fantastic (albeit almost anticlimactic) twist that I thought was extremely clever, I didn't see it coming and it added a great deal to the strength of the novel.The three main characters' intertwined stories are told in separate chapters, whilst all the while the reader is also wondering about the infamous Black-Out Ripper, who is he and where is he right now?With the darker side of the law and its enforcement displayed in full force, I was hooked from beginning `til end and had a particular soft spot for Charlie's character who, despite his flaws, worked especially well for me.The historical accuracy of this novel also had me engrossed. It's hard to believe that whilst London was being attacked by World War Two bombers; petty and even more serious criminals were still wreaking havoc throughout the city and causing a huge deal of trouble for the Met.This novel is extremely gritty, doesn't shy away from the reality of brutal murderous crime and had me absorbed from beginning to end. The ending itself is absolutely perfect and the author provides a fitting conclusion.My only small misgiving is that one particular loose end isn't tied up and it seemed a shame when the rest of the novel was so tight.Beth Townsend - The Kindle Book Review

$review_text.: Warning: there are no arch-villains or spectacular fights in this book; there is not much of a plot either.But if you belong to one of these types of people, this book MUST reside in your library:* Batman followers* Classic Graphic Novel enthusiasts* Alex Ross' art collectorsThe story line is simple - Batman sees a reflection of himself in a young boy whose parents are killed by an act of futile violence, which Batman was too late to prevent. Unlike young Bruce Wayne who had the family wealth and a loyal butler to fall back on, the boy has nobody to look out for him, and he is just on the brink of submitting himself to a life of violence. Batman reaches out through both his identities to make better of the boys life as well as the part of town he lives in.But don't buy this book for the story.Batman has never been more human then in this book. Both in text (which, thank God, is elegantly placed amongst the pictures, without the typical "balloons") and in the artwork.What can I write about the artwork that has not been already written?If you are not familiar with the work of Alex Ross, this is a very good starting point. If you are, you may appreciate it even more.I find his work in this book downright touching. Unlike works like "Kingdom come" where the fine lines of the muscular superhero forms and the details of their costumes and weapon sometimes compete with the amazing depiction of human faces and bodies, in "War on Crime" there is more then enough canvas space to let a true master show off his skill. Here Alex Ross shows you Batman for what he is, a man in and out of a costume, his face showing a spectrum of human expressions, and his body showing the scars of many years of harsh crime fighting. The sheer power and strength embodied in this human form are ever so evident, without the anatomically-exaggerated, pumped-up, vein-throbbing muscles so frequently found in other comic artists works.In addition, some of the full-pane pictures are utterly breathtaking, like the classical two-page view of Batman looking down on Gotham, understanding that he may never have a complete victory over crime.Well, this is one of the cornerstones of *my* graphic novel library, anyway...

$REVIEW.: In his first book, "Memorize the Faith!," Kevin Vost taught readers how to recall key elements of the Catholic Faith using the "method of loci."  This method, used both by the ancient Greeks and medieval giants such as Thomas Aquinas, consists of mentally visualizing a familiar place (such as a room in your house) and then sequentially placing memorable (often funny) items at various locations.In "Memorize the Reasons!," Vost employs this method to different sections in a cathedral (facade, left side of the nave, sanctuary, right side of the nave).  In each section he then draws our eyes to ten different locations where we see vivid images to help us recall the reasons to hold the Catholic Faith.  In the course of the book we are led through three cathedrals: St. Peter's (where we learn 40 reasons for Catholic beliefs regarding the Papacy and Church), Notre Dame (40 reasons for Catholic belief about the Virgin Mary), and the First Catholic Bible Church (40 reasons for beliefs regarding the Bible and Tradition).The reasons Vost provides are enough to make the book an apologetic goldmine, but the tools he provides for committing them to memory make it like no other book of apologetics in existence. The images Vost chose as memory aids are extremely effective.  For instance, whenever a reason is taken from the Acts of the Apostles, an "ax" appears in the image; if from Philippians, a person "flipping;" if from Ignatius of Antioch, an "igniting flame," etc.  To me the most difficult aspect of using the method of loci is creating the images; here it is ready-made.The majority of Vost's reasons come, as they should, from Scripture; but he has also provided meaty quotes from the Church Fathers and even Protestant Reformers!  An example: Location 29 in his Notre Dame Cathedral is the main sanctuary's altar, and there at the altar is the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., holding up "a pure white filet of sole in a fuse."  The image reminds us of a quote from Protestant Reformer Martin Luther.  Luther preached that Mary's soul [thus, the "filet of sole"] was infused ["in a fuse"] with grace at moment of her conception, "... while the soul was being infused, she [Mary] would be at the same time cleansed from original sin and adorned with the gifts of God ... in the very moment she began to live, she was without all sin."  Even Martin Luther believed the Immaculate Conception was perfectly consistent with Scripture - an important point for Catholics to be able to recall and share with separated brothers and sisters!I do not say this lightly:  I can easily envision future generations using this book.  I believe we are witnessing the birth of a classic, and it is pretty amazing to have a ringside seat!

 Unfortunately, this leads her on a path to self-destruction

 We find her with a list of 30 things she must do
 Some are daring, while others are just socially awkward

Will completing the list make her whole?  Will she learn to love and trust?  The answers are inside.I loved how she went back and forth to let us know how Elle got to where she was
 It was a nice change of style


 However, I was not happy with the ending
 I did not see the &#34;note&#34; stating that it was book 1 of 2.

$review_text.: I had so much fun while reading &#34;To Bed A Montana Man&#34; with its witty heroine and just the right amount of sex.I would have loved to find that again in this paranormal fantasy book.Unfortunately,there was way too much sex and very few story!I love full-novel with sex or short erotica, but a full-novel erotica is just boring.I wasattracted by this book because Kyann Waters is one of the authors and because i liked the synopsis to this story: a world withan ancient Elemental race and dragon shifters.There were indeed some explanations about this world, but not much obviously, or not enough, because i only remember sex scenes page after page!

$review_text.: Story Rating ~ 4 StarsWriting Style ~ 5 StarsHero Rating ~ 4.5 StarsHeroine Rating ~ 4.5 StarsHeat Level ~ 3.5 StarsEnding ~ 5 StarsOverall Rating ~ 4.5 StarsThis is the third book in Maureen Driscoll's Kellington series. I was hooked with book one, and this series just gets better and better.Never Wager Against Love was a truly pleasurable read. Maureen Driscoll's writing and storytelling grabs hold of the reader from the first page and doesn't let go till the last page. The characters have a lot of depth and are well thought out. I also LOVE the fact that all of the characters from the prior books are brought back throughout the series. The storyline was excellent with lots of action, as Vanessa and Arthur go on a quest to find and retrieve priceless artifacts before the villains can get to them first.Vanessa's character was highly unusual and unique. She was an agent of the Home Office, was unheard during the time period that the book is set in. She was extremely intelligent, and it was quite often an asset as Arthur and her journeyed from place to place to locate the priceless artifacts.I adored Arthur. He was so protective of Vanessa and I loved reading his thoughts and feelings in relation to Vanessa, how they changed and grew MORE as the story unfolded.It was easy to feel the attraction and chemistry between Vanessa and Arthur. The sensuality in this book is VERY HIGH and when they finally joined together it was EXPLOSIVE! This book is no way erotic, but for those of you who enjoy some steam in your reads you will be very happy with the overall heat factor.The book ended on a high note with an excellent epilogue, complete with a happily ever after. It left me satisfied, but still wanting more! Fortunately, there are two more books in the series about the remaining yummy Kellington brothers and I can dive right into.If you are a fan of sensual provocative historical romances, where there is an underlying family theme, then I can't recommend this book and series enough. You will not be disappointed.

$review_text.: I got this as a free book a LONG time ago & swiftly forgot about it, heaping it under my many other downloads.  Thank goodness amazon sometimes runs books through again or I wouldn't have re-remembered it.  As soon as I saw it again, I knew it was the book I was to read next.The plot is more than a little intriguing - the faux friend in seek of the ultimate revenge.  There was a bit of predictability, but it did not matter as it was hitting all the right buttons otherwise.  As an American reader I truly enjoyed the British flavor built in.  I love it when a writer speaks from their heart, the 'true language' of their environment.  I read a bit of English literature, but I found some new dialect in this one...nip down the chippy, lark about...and I had to look up several words as I went along as well, which is not usual practice for me.  But it was fun and contributed to my enjoyment of the story itself.The end seemed a little rushed but overall it brought a decent end.  Definitely recommend FRY to anyone who has interest in psychological thriller or even horror.  Not one gory moment, no language, very very few sexual encounters.  Still managed to fulfill the thrill seeking & a reasonable scare that I was in the mood for when I started the book.  Fabulous read!
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic thriller!

I did not get the feeling that the main characters were truly in love because it was so short and fleeting. And the ending just seemed implausible to me.

She needs a job and when her former high school love Greg offers her a job working undercover at a strip close she decides to go for it. She gives both the job and her rekindled romance with Greg her all.This is a really fun book. With lots of LOL moments. Jenny is all around likeable, and I really enjoyed her antics. The hero Greg is crazy sexy, but that's to be expected. This story has some great dialogue and secondary characters. There isn't much I didn't like about this story.

$review_text.: Heidi Ruby Miller is a multi-talented writer. Where most would say this in reference to her roles as a wife, educator, and an author; I wish to speak only in regards to her writing. Do not discount her other roles in life; I am sure that like other authors they very much inform her writing. Rather I want the focus to be on her craft. Where most excel in one or two specific areas of writing, in my opinion with &#8220;Greenshift&#8221; she excels in all.I will allow the description in the listing do the heavy lifting as far as a plot synopsis.First the obvious: world building. She has been interviewed on several blogs about her gift with creating fully-fleshed out universes. The &#8220;Ambasadora-verse&#8221; as presented in &#8220;Greenshift&#8221; is an incredible example of how to do it right. It is at once alien and familiar, with recognizable concepts found in other science fiction worlds (interplanetary governance, modes of transport, energy weapons, et. al.) but made very much her own and very much a cohesive whole. She does not waste the reader's time with Clancy-level technical detail, nor do the details she does choose to include appear in one passage and then are never touched on again. The &#8220;Ambasadora-verse&#8221; feels lived-in, a believable reality.Which brings me to the details she does include. Miller fills all of your mental senses. The tactile, olfactory, auditory, and taste sensations that she includes complement, rather than overwhelm or upstage the visuals and more importantly the story itself. When Miller writes a scene, you not only see the setting, but hear the peculiar inflections of speech, smell the gently wafting aromas, feel the sparks when the protagonists hold hands. Her writing is in a word immersive.All of this rich setting development would be be moot if not for her beautifully conceptualized characters. Boston Maribu, David Anlow, and the rest of the cast are incredibly human. Flawed but talented. They are not superheroes (though due to some minor genetic steering, slightly super-human in some areas.) They have real problems, believable motivations, and emotionally touching interactions. The villains are not cookie-cutter bad guys, with simple goals or one-dimensional description. They are complex, and dare I say enjoyably sickening in their actions, making them all the more disturbing. Miller deftly creates a looming dread when these monsters take their places. These things certainly increase the satisfaction of learning the protagonists' triumphs over the adversaries.Tying all of this amazing prose together is the story, which combines the best aspects of an action thriller with a satisfyingly enjoyable romance. One does not overshadow the other. The two strands work together to maintain the pleasant pace and compels the reader to keep the covers open and keep going non-stop to the end. That's not to say the pacing is monotonous, rather the ups and downs are seamlessly put together in a deceptively easy-going manner. Combat scenes are not slowed down due to excessive description, nor are the dialogues rushed. &#8220;Greenshift&#8221; achieves that Goldilocks zone of perfect pacing.In closing, I can not wait to further explore the &#8220;Ambasadora-verse.&#8221; I am thoroughly impressed by this book. I am also comforted in knowing that while it is relatively short, the story doesn't end with the last page. &#8220;Greenshift&#8221; sets a gorgeous stage, and I would be surprised if &#8220;Ambasadora: Marked by Light&#8221; was any less well done. I tip my hat Mrs. Miller. Grab this new classic now.

$review_text.: I'm confused that this book gets such good reviews. Almost every page I looked at included over-simple statements that I would find unhelpful if I didn't already know...Page 12: After pressing the power on button (a good picture is shown), "The first thing you will see is the Mac desktop." Well, yes, if the Mac has been set up already to autolog you into a user account. If this is the first time out of the box, you'll get some initial set up instructions.  The picture immediately following this paragraph shows the Finder open to the Applications folder. How'd that get there?Page 65: "OS X Lion ... automatically install[s] new printers as soon as they are connected to your Mac." This statement says nothing about wireless printers.Page 65 Side note: "Beware. If you have an old printer your Mac may not identify it and you will have to install the print driver from the disc that came with the printer." Not said: this will almost certainly install a down-level driver. Go to the printer manufacturer web site for an updated print driver. If the manufacturer does NOT say the printer works with your version of Mac...then what?Page 114 Side note: "Before you connect to the Internet you have to have an Internet Service Provider (ISP) who will provide you with the relevant method of connection i.e. dial-up, cable or broadband." Well, this is true if you do not use a WiFi hotspot.Page 178: I'm glad this book mentions the existence of malware for Mac. However, it does say to "install a firewall." My advice: turn on and configure the built-in Mac firewall. There are a good number of security settings and good practices for Mac. Hint: In System Preferences, open the Sharing option. Do you want your Mac to include your first and last name if it should ever share something on the network you are connecting to? Second Hint: Check the Sharing preferences in iTunes, iChat, and iPhoto.I know this book was intended to be "easy" and not too heavy to pick up. But it skips so many things. I hate to think of people being shortchanged.Please find a topic you know something about -- browsing the web, using tabs in your browser, installing software (such as Firefox or the Prey Project), editing a spreadsheet -- and see how the particular book you are looking at stacks up. Do you really want a book that skims the surface?

$review_text.: When you read a blurb, 'How exploration transformed medicine in the twentieth century,&#34;  you expect the book to be about &#34;how exploration transformed medicine in the twentieth century!&#34;This book started out in that vein...talking about the death of Robert Falcon Scott in Antarctica...but that was the last time exploration came into this book! I expected to learn about how folks were going into the jungles of the Amazon, looking for plants that could cure horrible diseases, or diving in oceans looking for kelp or the toxin of some dangerous fish that could actually help mankind...but it was not to be.It was more a reminiscence of Fong's time as an internist, and recounting of various modern day medical stories.So to begin with I was pretty annoyed that I wasn't getting what I had expected, but to be honest the book as it is, *is* pretty interesting. We do learn a great deal about medicine - told in terms a layperson can understand - and about advances in medical care and how the determination of a patient can tip the scales for the better...So I do recommend this book for anyone who is interested in healthcare and medicine and how doctors are helping patients through hypothermia, burn victims...all the way through to what astronauts will have to face on the way to Mars due to the health deterioration caused by weightlessness (as a matter of fact, what astronauts today have gone through - those that have lived on the space station for months at a time.)If you're looking for how exotic plants or animals might help improve medical care, this is not the book for you. If you're looking ot learn how doctors have helped people who have suffered extreme health issues due to accident, check it out.

 However, I love the Joanne Walker series

 One of the central characters is Gary


 I have always wondered about his back story and was thrilled to hear Ms


Murphy was going to write something about him
 I was also lucky to get in on her Kickstarter and was kept on top of what was going on with the whole story.Gary is a wonderful character
 Over the series, he has been the father Joanne has always wanted

 This is a story about Gary's beloved, Annie, and what lead up to so many things
 It takes place as part of RAVEN CALLS

 You should read that book before you read this one.This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Joanne Walker.

$REVIEW.: Do you have flat, one-dimensional characters running madly towards the climax of your story? Or do you have amazing, fully fleshed out characters with nothing to do other than twiddle their thumbs? How do you create memorable characters with an exciting plot that will have your readers remembering your book long after they finish it?Plot versus Character has the answer.Plot versus Character is unlike most books I have read on writing. Most go on to detail the nuts and bolts of writing, but Jeff gets to the heart of the matter: the story. He pinpoints exactly what will make your main character relatable: the inner conflict (or knot as he calls it). Step by step he helps you create that flawed character.But Jeff doesn't stop there. He also shows you how to weave the inner journey of your character into the plot. You character will not only be racing through the outer circumstances you push him through (whether that is running from the bad guys or trying to get the girl to like him), but changing on the inside as well. That is what will make your character relatable. And that is what your readers will remember.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been wondering what their story is lacking but couldn't put their finger on it.

$REVIEW.: A hot quick paranormal read that will satisfy one's urge for a fast fix of a sensual paranormal romance that will leave you wanting more in the very best of ways at the same time
Fate's Wish is a story any fan of the genre will enjoy!I have to start off by sharing who my favorite character of this story (hands down) is, Shar's mother
She's a trip! Any mother that pokes her nose (very bluntly) in the most personal of ways into her daughter's business just to see her well and happy is A-OK in my book! You see, Shar is going through a mysterious magic problem


It's slowly leaving her, leaking away out of her being


After five years of being separated from her husband, it's only gotten worse


After some poking around by her mother, she finds out the answer, the one and only solution to fix her magic problem and just cannot go through with it, sex

Yes, it's a great thing, but when your mother is pressuring you about it, offering to set you up with various men and in the most embarrassing of ways, it's just awkward


Besides, the only man Shar continues to desire in her bed is Zahir
But he wants nothing to do with her.April created some very lovable characters and a great story that I hope she will continue on with, a sequel, possibly a spin-off? Either one would be a great addition to her collection ;)

$REVIEW.: Nick and Tesla's High-Voltage Danger Lab transports us to the small California town of Half Moon Bay. Here, twins Nick and Tesla are sent by their parents (agricultural scientists Albert and Martha Holt) to stay with their Uncle Newt. Apparently, the parents have been assigned to study methods of soybean irrigation in Uzbekistan. We begin to realize that everything-their Uncle Newt, their parents, the neighborhood and even the creepy house down the street-is surrounded by mystery, danger and orange goo.The characters are well-developed and humorous, from mad-scientist Uncle Newt (my son's favorite) to Nick and Tesla, themselves. The authors make us really care about the characters. The plot is fast-paced and intriguing, so that both my teen son and pre-teen daughter (who is especially picky about the books she reads) were engaged throughout. I cannot emphasize how much my children LOVED this book...Admittedly, there are a few instances where the twins say some mean things to each other, like "stupid" and "shut up," but it isn't at all excessive (my children are usually sensitive about that).  As fascinating as these siblings are, they're more like colleagues rather than friends. These twins brilliantly work together to invent a number of makeshift gadgets you can even build yourself (directions for these projects are throughout the book).Overall, our family highly recommends Nick and Tesla's High-Voltage Danger Lab for intelligent and adventurous adolescents everywhere.

$review_text.: I loved every moment of this book! I purchased this book to give me a better idea of the people and orphans of Ethiopia. I wanted to better understand their culture and have an understanding of who they are. The book illustrates how one Ethiopian woman builds a safe haven for orphaned children and shows the circumstances of each child brought to her home. It informs the reader about the aids epidemic and other diseases that have plagued this beautiful country. For anyone interested in adopting children from Ethiopia, it presents real-life stories and how adoption made a difference for them. The stories and photos are real and the author personally involved.  I started to read it more slowly at the end so I wouldn't finish it, I loved it so much!

$review_text.: This short story is a great reminder of the Gift we all received on Christmas Day, Jesus, and the purpose for which He came; forgiveness
How many times have we had someone offend us, walk on us, or make us feel flat out rotten? How many times have we been quick to forgive them? Sometimes we fight between what we know is right and how we feel, leaving us on emotional roller-coaster

Unforgiveness can be deadly to our spirits, among other things.Jody Pettit O'Dair's family has been fighting this battle for seven long years
Although this fight has most certainly taken its toll on each person in her family, they are reminded of God's grace and forgiveness, and how He can use the worst situations to bring the best outcome for all involved.If you need a little reminder that God is quick to forgive us for all the wrong or hurtful things we have done to others, or if you're in need of a little push to forgive those who have wronged you, I recommend this short story


It is the gentle reminder we all need at one point in our lives or another: To forgive even when we feel it is impossible.****Thank you Nester | Litfuse Publicity Group for the free eBook in exchange for my honest review.****

$REVIEW.: Fushigi Yugi for me was a very difficult story for me to get into. It was so slow paced, that I lost interest about half way through volume 3. The story and plot just didn't keep my interest. I don't know, maybe its the whole 15 year old girl finding the love of her life in less than a week's time, or silly (and rather pathetic fight) between the two best friends. I will say however, that I did enjoy the artwork if anything. If your currious about this series, see if your local library has a copy (I know mine has a bunch of Fushigi Yugi volumes)instead of buying it.

$REVIEW.: I am honestly not quite sure how I feel about this book


On one hand, I sped through it, and I hungered to find out what happens and hoping that I got the ending I was hoping for.This is more of a mystery than I usually read, which is maybe contributing to my mixed feelings

The plot unfolds at a slow pace at the beginning, but then it picks up
Like Haven, I was constantly wondering who can really be trusted, and on the edge of my seat not knowing what is really going on


But, Haven seemed almost to naive- she was back and forth it seemed like every single chapter.The premise of a love that cannot die, and reincarnation is such a compelling premise, but I felt like this book was too focused on the table tennis trust this person, no wait, they are lying, no wait..

I guess that I just wanted more of the love story than the mystery.I also am torn as to what this book is trying to convey about religion

I am a christian, and although there are two different churches and sets of people portrayed in this novel, and it could be said that the ones with the real faith can be redeeming, it just does not sit well with me.So-- on to the things that I liked: this was not predictable-- I honestly did not know who to trust, I was not ahead of Haven, and I was in suspense
I also really like the character of Beau, her best friend


He is amazing- and different from any best friend/brotherly like characters that come to mind.

$REVIEW.: I have to admit I'm surprised this book is getting so many rave reviews


Fortunately, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.:) So, here is mine:Byron Frazier is a world renowned family psychologist
Extremely successful, and revered, he draws much of his empathy from his own personal traumas and tragedies

Apparently, he never takes his own advice, since he manages to handle trying to establish a relationship with his long lost son in the worst possible manner.If my thirteen year old son came home and told me he met a really neat male stranger in a cemetary who wants to give him free guitar lessons at his place, I would be dialing 911! There is a whole Big Misunderstanding that goes on way too long about whether Byron is a pedophile
I guess it was supposed to be humorous


I found it all too understandable, and a little creepy.Most of Byron's dialog sounds like he's leading a group session, or has read one too many romance novels


He is also manipulative, and a liar


But, it's o.k., because he had a terrible childhood, suffered a tradgedy, but now &quot;wants to do the right thing.&quot; I might have accepted this had he not been a professional who is supposed to know better! He makes an extremely good living from dealing with family traumas and disfunctional people.Byron's soooooo good dead wife, Lori, is a sort of smiley, pure at heart flower child
Everytime this character pops up,you can practically hear the angelic childrens' choir behind her.His assistant/agent,Celeste, is a way over the top character

Byron can't stand this pushy, nasty woman who does exactly what he tells her not to do and is rude and conniving


But he doesn't fire her until the end of the book,when it's a convenient plot devise.Ms
Cameron is at her best describing the small Cornish village and it's colorful inhabitants

She is right on the money describing these good hearted people, most of whom mean well, but are often thirty years behind the times

They are far more realistic and likable than Byron.Jade, while loving her family and home town, is doing her best to become a modern woman, and find her place in life
She knows an affair with the egnigmatic Byron is the last thing she needs, but of course there would be no story if it bothered her too much
Doesn't bother Byron much at all

He lies, he psyco-babbles, but it's all because he's suffered, and/or, he cares.Jade's father, who loves her, but doesn't understand her, all but pushes her into the arms of an abusive, neanderthal ex-husband who cheated on her

This guy is a piece of work! He has an adorable five year old daughter to raise, having had an affair with the girl's mother, who then skipped.Everyone including Jade,loves this child and tries to help with her


It's the ultimate &quot;it takes a village&quot;....scenario


Even after the ex slaps Jade around,and tries to rape her, she raves about what a great father he is, and how this little girl &quot;will be the making of him


&quot; Please! A pretty heavy load for a five year old to handle

Not to mention what kind of values and ideals this child will learn from daddy


You know, a really nice guy who just happens to think women should know their place, and it's acceptable to knock them around if they don't.Ian is a boy who commands our sympathy at once


He is understandably having a difficult time,dealing not only with grief, but a completely different lifestyle and culture


Conveniently, at just the moment Byron makes his appearance, Ian is finally settling in, deciding life in Cornwall isn't so bad, and his eccentric, but well meaning Auntie is o.k


after all


Oh yes, and he's also a guitar virtuoso.In the beginning, Ian sounds and behaves very much like a real adolescent in this situation.By the end of the book, that choir is back

Too bad.For me, this is a book which had a lot of promise, but did not live up to the expectations I had for it


It's just not the book it could and should have been


Support your local library if you want to give it a try.

$review_text.: I don't know if writers read these reviews but to Christopher Williams: The book is in logical order, the story is a great idea but it's like reading a beginning reader. You need to add some colorful descriptions. I never did find out what any of the characters looked like. YEah, blue eyes, tall, short, etc.I suggest you take some creative writing classes to learn how to make your characters and landscapes form pictures in the reader's mind and use descriptive verbs for action.As of now, The Guardians is kind of like reading an instruction book. No color, just the facts.  The saving grace is that it is a good story.

Been there, done that.This book is chock full of ideas. Color coded for Northern, Central and Southern California, each trip has a map, an approximate amount of days it will take, and what it is best for. It highlights places to see, eat and rest.There are lovely pictures to go with the text. The trip outlined that really makes me want to go on a trip soon was Chap 15: Around Monterey and Carmel" with the aquarium and the beautiful Mission San Carlos de Borromeo de Carmelo. It looks like a do-able trip as described and that's what is the selling point of this book. It makes you want to go.So I don't know if these are the "BEST" but they definitely look good to me!

$review_text.: In this second entry to the hidden world of the panther shifting psychically gifted Ikatie, former member of the Ikati counsel, Morgan, is under a death sentence for treason, but has earned a chance for a reprieve if she can uncover the base of operations for the Expungi who seek to wipe her people from the Earth. Morgan only has two weeks to accomplish her mission and accompanying her is assassin Xander who is there to make sure that she stays on task -  and to carry out her sentence should she fail.I was surprised by how much I loved the start of this book. I had put off reading Edge of Oblivion book because I wasn't fond of the leading lady Morgan from her part in the previous story, but seeing what is hidden behind Morgan's bravado helps a great deal in her appeal as a lead and the initial sparring interactions - and forbidden attraction - between Morgan and Xander are just really good.  I was also initially intrigued by the expansion of the Ikati world as Morgan and  Xander encounter a hidden cell of Ikati, but actually that group's part turns the story in a different direction and events ensue that change the dynamic between Morgan and Xander in a way that I didn't love as much.I love enemies to lovers as a trope, plus this pair are so opposite about how they've dealt with their lot in life that I wanted them to struggle to connect. So, I was a little let down that the adversarial dynamic pretty much goes away and there also is a catalyst which took their relationship in another direction without a lot of agony over the fact that Morgan is likely to be Xander's mark and he will most likely be Morgan's executioner.  And when they took a 'time out' and pretend that a happily ever after is a possibility for either of them, any sense that the clock is ticking and Morgan is running out of time, which would have added some tension to the story, is missing.In the feral colony of Ikati, Geissinger expands her world but the manner of their introduction left me less connected with the band of warriors who look to be the focus of the next book. Because of the interaction of several of the members during Morgan's first encounters with them, I ended up with the impression that, as a group, the colony were bad guys and that colored my view of the all of their warriors even as we see that their loyalty is misplaced and the bad seeds are weeded out. But, I guess the part of the world that Morgan has escaped from isn't entirely composed of good guys either - the alpha leaders with the exception of the male lead from the last book, look to have a streak of cruelty - so I guess it isn't surprising that the new group has it's share of black and gray characters too.Even though my issues with the second half of the book landed Edge of Oblivion in 'like it' vs 'love it' territory, I am still really a fan of  Geissinger's writing. From a perspective of appreciation the artistry of her writing, she has a beautifully descriptive style that really shone here in bringing the Rome setting of the book to life.  So, expectations aside, I still enjoyed this second book enough that I am won't drag my heels so much when the next one hits the shelves this summer.Complimentary copy for review via the Vine - finally getting around to it, way after the release

$REVIEW.: I rarely leave a review for a book that I give 3 or less stars because I don't feel that It is fair to an author that put their heart and soul into a story. This book was very difficult for me. I've read MANY dark books. I didn't find this to be as dark as people made it out to be. The problems that I had in the story was that through most of it, I had a difficult time figuring out who was saying what. Leaving me to go back and re-read. I felt that this book left SO MANY open questions for me. Who are they? Who hired him to do this? Why? Who are &#34;her people&#34; being left to clean up the mess at the end. I thought that there was SO MUCH conversation....talking, talking, talking and I just wanted to tell them to shut up and get to the point. The times that she went back into her mind where she was reliving the past with her son and husband were confusing as well, I was like ok, we are in the past again but then back into current time in the same section. It was rather difficult for me to finish this story, but I felt that I had invested so much time into it, I needed to see it through. I am so sorry if I've offended the author and those who loved this book but I felt that I needed to put my feelings out there because I am rarely this disappointed in a book.

$REVIEW.: I first read Mr

Kay's books, Good Intentions and Natural Consequences

 I thoroughly enjoyed them both


 Last night I read Poor Man's Flight and I could not put it down!  My eyes were watering by the end and the bags under them are scary but it was well worth it.Poor Man's Fight is about two worlds colliding


 The first is the world of Tanner Malone
 Tanner, an accomplished high school student is denied a college education due to debt (sound familiar?)  from his previous 12 years of school
 His father and step-mother are leaving the star system for greener pastures

 Tanner's only recourse is to join the Navy and hope for an education later.The second world is the world of vicious space pirates


 I know this sounds corny but think of the pirates that troll the waters of the Red Sea

 They make three vicious attacks which kill countless people


 Of course the two worlds collide.Mr
Kay sets an adventurous course

 Tanner's military training is realistic

 (I'm a veteran and I wish I learned half the stuff Tanner learns.)  The pacing is very consistent until the end when it becomes fast and exciting
 Some of the situations are unbelievable (think comic book hero) and some is preachy (commentary on the educational system) but all in all an exciting fun read


 At the end of the book the stage is set for a sequel.I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: Wow. This is a great story but it's no light read in my opinion. Biz is a college student dealing with anxiety due to something that happened to her the previous year and she is desperately trying to get back to being herself. Davis is the super hot guy of few words but they are instantly drawn to each other even though he is engaged and is also known as a player...yes, even while being engaged! He also has some things in his past that he is trying to work thru as well. From the start I wanted these two to get together and was drawn into the story not just about them as a couple but about what was driving them to act the way they were.The author wrote a very real, complicated, emotional and intense story here. There is a fabulous romance in this book but it's not your typical one by any means. The other characters are great and add to the story especially Jules and Charlie. Emme Burton tackles some serious issues including mental health and sexual abuse/promiscuity and she does it very well. While this story contains these subject matters, there are some great funny scenes too and it's not all intense or serious.You do indeed get a happy ending although....that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I wanted or needed more at the end. I still had a few questions and felt like I could have used another chapter at least. There is no cliffhanger though.If you like your romance stories with real life issues and not just angst or 'fluff' then this is a great book for you.

$REVIEW.: I had the pleasure of meeting Victoria Allman at a writer's workshop

She's charming, gracious, unassuming, and of course, has a fascinating story! Since I'm a fellow writer with a passion for food and cooking, I was anxious to read her books
I began with SEAsoned.I found this book to be a very fun escape


Several chapters in, I had left the realities of life (chores, household budgets, to-do lists), and found myself following Victoria, her husband and their crew through the waters of the Caribbean and on to Europe.This book is very easy to read, and Victoria does a great job of painting a picture of life on a luxury yacht, from the perspective of the crew
She gives us a firsthand look at the challenges -- difficult guests, mechanical problems -- and the perks -- seeing the world! -- of life as a yacht crew member.As a foodie, one of my favorite things about the book was traveling with Victoria through markets in the Caribbean, Italy, Cannes, Greece, and Spain, and baking coconut bread with Vivian in the Bahamas.As a bonus for those of us who love to cook, Victoria includes more than 30 recipes, like Poached Eggs with Mango Salsa and Avocado, Warm Lobster Potato Salad, and Seared Shrimp with White Bean Puree and Proscuitto
I'm starting with Vivian's Coconut Bread.An additional note: while I do most of my reading on my Kindle these days, I chose the print version of SEAsoned, and I'm glad I did

For starters, I loved glancing back at the yacht on the cover as I read, but since I plan to try out many of Victoria's recipes, I believe the print format will be more user-friendly than the smaller Kindle screen.

$REVIEW.: There is no question that how this book sits with the reader will depend to a great degree on the reader,s background knowledge.In the last 15 years or so,I have read 8-10 biographies about Audubon and have another dozen or so books about him and his travels and art along with several different"Birds of America"
A few of these books are huge and include all his paintings.I've noticed this book on the shelves for some time,but passed up on it for a couple of reasons


The main reason being that from the cover it appeared to be a novel about Creation by an author I've not heard of.The other day,I picked it up again ,and after reading the inside jacket flaps I discovered it was about Audubon and written by an author who lives here in Toronto.I have been an avid birder for some time,very familiar with the 'birding community',local bird artists,writers,and people at the museums and libraries;so this author was a surprise to me.Needless to say,I had to buy and read the book.So,I'm writing this review from quite a different viewpoint than someone who is unfamiliar with Audubon and is reading it simply as a novel,or an adventure story.Being a seasoned Birder,we always keep a list of birds when on a trip;so just for fun I wrote down all the birds mentioned in the book.This proved to be interesting, particularly since many of the birds mentioned are called by old or colloquial names of the period.I came up with a list of 101 species


If you are a Birder,I suggest you give it a try and see how your list compares to mine.I must commend the author for the map at the front,the several interesting pictures,although with the researchshe did,I'm sure she came across many others that would have been interesting to have included.An index would have been helpful.I did enjoy the experiences encountered by meeting the "Gulnare" and its Royal Navy Captain Bayfield and all the crews.I guess that part of the book was what makes it a novel.Also,the author tries to show us the deep seated and complicated personality of Audubon and relationships with family friends and one of the loves of his life Maria;that is if he ever had any other than the birds.This approach by the author certainly makes the story of Audubon's trip to Labrador a much more interesting read ,particularly for someone new to him or not a birder.Even for a Birder,I found it a good read,especially for someone who enjoys 'the human side of birding'.I would further suggest you have nearby a copy of Audubon's"Birds of America" as there is quite a bit of detail of his paintings and how he went about them;all the way from his field sketches to the finished products.We are fortunate to have one of the complete sets of Audubon's Birds at The Toronto Reference Library ,here in Toronto and periodically some of them are put on view,and what a treat!To someone unfamiliar with the Audubon paintings;there is a lot of interesting things about who actually did what part of the work,conflicts about similarities with other artists,etc
This side of it is mentioned ,more in passing,in the book.For instance,on page 67 when discussing his painting of the Golden Eagle some prints show Audubon crossing on the log while others do not.Also some paintings of his Ground Doves show 4 and others show 5.Although a great read about America's most famous bird artist,I get left wondering what in the book is fact,what is legend and what comes from the imagination of the author.n

I really like the 10 steps for transitioning to a Paleo diet and the 10 steps to keeping kids happy on the Paleo diet


The book offers limited advice on how to explain the Paleo diet to kids; but on the other hand the author appreciates that parents are busy and spends the majority of the book talking about ways to make the Paleo diet less expensive and time friendly

There are recipes for all occasions and meals including favorites like pizza, chips, and chocolate chip cookies.

$review_text.: I must say I didn't find the author's writing style appealing not even in the first book of the series but still I kind of liked the world she'd created and wanted to read how the sexual tension she'd built up between the protagonists of this one in the previous book "developed".Said this, having read its prequel, I found this one a bit repetitive, a bit too similar to the other one. The plot is interesting enough, the sex scenes are steamy and the male characters are ok, but I can seem to get a like for the female roles in these books.So even if I've read much worse books than this one, I don't think I'll be reading any other books from this series.

$review_text.: It's very rare that I write a review with a title as effusive as this one.But this book deserves it. Ms. Ford is a writer, a real writer, a first-rate writer of mysteries. There is mayhem, blood, solutions and redemption - all of the touchstones of any good mystery/action thriller.But then she layers it with some very, very deep stuff, much of which resonated with me well beyond most of the other M/M books I've read - and there have been tons of them.She deals with loss, with love, with fear. But above all, she deals with the heart of the gay man, in our culture and others (Korean and Japanese, particularly). She writes beautifully of the pain caused by a lifetime of being told we are all sinners, condemned to hell, second-rate citizens and unworthy.There is one particular scene in which her protagonist, Cole McGinnis, ponders the closet. Although he's been out for years, he admits that, in some part of his mind, he still feels the tug of the relentless pressure "to be normal", the futile drive to "fit in", the desperate desire "not to be different". I think every gay man (and likely woman), has felt this at some time in his or her life. No matter how proud we are, we still seek approval and acceptance. Why? Because we're human. Rhys Ford gets this, like no other author I've ever read.But most of all, her books are about family, and the way that parents can, literally, throw their children away when they discover they are gay. This happens, today, more often than we'd like to think - that's why the Trevor Project exists.And the hope that she holds out for all of us is that we make our own families, and because our families are built out of choice and love and shared experience, our families are stronger and more supportive and even more loving than many families that exist only through the accidents of birth.Perhaps that is why Ms. Ford's books move me so profoundly. I find myself in tears at several points in her books, not at the obvious tear-jerking moments of loss or pain, but at the moments when characters find the courage to love themselves and each other.And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the erotic scenes. They are indeed erotic (and rare), but they serve the story. They are never there just for titillation. I usually skip through most of these in other books, but not in hers, where the intimate scenes are not just sex, but deep explorations of the love between two people, and moments of discovery and grace, which is infinitely hotter!Thank you, Ms. Ford for your wonderful books! I look forward to whatever you publish next. You are a great writer, and I'm so glad you have chosen a genre that needs them badly. That means so much to me and others like me.I cannot recommend this series highly enough.

$review_text.: Two things were apparent after I read the blurb of this novel. First: I loved the idea of it. The perfect romance... it all goes horribly wrong... can they figure out how to make it perfect again. It immediately had me asking all sorts of questions about the scenario. The second was I better go buy a new box of kleenex! When you well up reading a brief extract then you'll probably going to need them!Fortunately the novel lived up to my expectations... and then some. It starts how most romances finish, with the perfect HEA, and I mean perfect. I could just read chapters and chapters of Bea and Jeremy in love and being perfect without any kind of story and be happy! But then it all goes wrong and that's when the real story begins.I'm not going to spoil anything... just read it... and bring tissues.

$REVIEW.: I read a good review of the first book and picked it up because I needed something to read


 I really liked the characters, I enjoyed their development, and the world creation was acceptable
 What did not impress me, was the author's story telling skills

 There were periodic lengthy monologues which felt pointless to me, and even the action scenes periodically happened with what felt to me like inadequate build up and inadequate consequences


 Still I did enjoy the book and purchased the next book in the series
 After all, as long as you have interesting characters doing interesting things, the story telling is bound to improve with continued practice, right?I have enjoyed this second book much less than the first book

 I still like Bisbo, but his relationships with the other characters are more one dimensional in this book than they were in the first book


 He is less successful in his physical conflicts in this book, but seems to struggle less against his own limitations and his ultimate triumphs feel more as if they were fated, than as if he actually accomplished something

 At this point I have lost interest in the series and will move on to something else.Many other readers greatly enjoyed this book and series, and individual readers vary greatly in their taste in books

 I think the first book was free and I would encourage anyone looking for a new author to give it a try

 After that you will have a much better basis for making your own decision than any review you might find.

$review_text.: That One Summer is the third novel in the Boys of Summer series by C.J
Duggan
I found that with this series as a whole, it is very easy to pick up the last or middle book without having read the previous ones
This is because a minor introduction is given every time a character is re-introduced, making it easy to read without having read the previous one.That One Summer was my favourite ending of all three books


It was so sweet and even made me tear up a little


In fact, the entire story was a great read as the characters and storyline were always moving
In addition to this, I love how C.J

Duggan used a fair amount of foreshadowing within this piece
I won&#8217;t tell you what that was since it would be a spoiler but be sure to look out for it while you read! Try to make that your challenge as you read this novel.My favourite thing about this novel, and the series, is that things always end up working out for the protagonist and her friends
Although they go through hardships &#8211; like all of us tend to once and a while &#8211; they always seem to find a light at the end of the tunnel, which makes for a good moral to any story.This novel, and series, is something you surely don&#8217;t want to miss


Especially if you are like me and love reading stories where the characters are relatable.

$review_text.: This was a very interesting and informative book


 I had no idea that workers in the pearl button industry along the Mississippi River endured such bad working conditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
 This was an informative look at the beginning of a labor union for these workers, showing why unions were needed and how they were formed.Most of all, this is simply a good read

 I picked it up every chance I got; it was a page-turner for me, and I really wanted to continue reading to see how the plot unfolded.The main character, Pearl McGill, is from a small Iowa town; she is perceptive and intelligent and she had a lot of influence in the beginnings of the labor union movement
The author, Dr

Jeffrey Copeland, has done his research well, so the entire book rings true.I'd be very interested in reading another book by this author (I've already read "Inman's War", a terrific book), perhaps even a book that continues on with Pearl's life
 I'm positive there's another good novel wrapped up in the rest of her life!

$review_text.: Melanie Marchande is a new-to-me author. I was on my Kindle Fire and looking at "recommended for you" books and noticed this and grabbed it. The blurb really caught my attention. I love the marriage of convenience trope. In I Married A Billionaire, Maddy Wainright, a graphic designer at the company she works at has given up on men and relationships. She doesn't believe in love at all. This makes her the perfect fit for Daniel Thorne. He's in jeopardy of being deported and needs to get married quickly. Her aversion to relationships and disbelief in love is a perfect fit for his plan.Maddie can't believe Mr. Thorne is serious, even if he is the answer to all her debt-ridden prayers. She takes a few days to consider his proposal, and after a mishap with her car, she's all in. That's where the fun starts.These two have some pretty steamy chemistry and they both try to ignore it at first. They want to keep the arrangement all business. The kisses and caresses in public put a chink in their armor though. Then the honeymoon from heaven blows them all to smithereens. Or it does for Maddie anyway. Daniel on the other hand acts as though she doesn't exist.Once this couple figures out they both want the same thing and feel the same way, by way of a meddling sister, they start a beautiful relationship. One issue I had with this book is Maddie's relationship to her parents, it wasn't really explained why she didn't have one. I mean what parents don't have time to come to their only daughter's wedding?I will definitely be reading more from this author. I really like her style of writing, how the words just flow together. I Married A Billionaire was a very well written and edited book, a rare find in today's market, especially for new authors.

$REVIEW.: I found this book to be an incredible surprise!  I came into reading this novel expecting something along the normal lines of the paranormal genre...but was blown away by this EPIC Adventure. I could even see this being an amazing movie one day.This book starts with just two young kids who grew up together, but it ends worlds away from anything you could possibly imagine. Brighton and Lilian face more trials and hardships than I could ever possibly imagine in just one novel....and if you are reading one an e-reader.....you may think you are coming to the end of the book, and realize you are only half-way done, and it is just really getting started (true story in my case). Its an incredible journey that I haven't been able to get off my mind since I read the last page, and I finished the book a few days ago.  If you read the first chapter, and then skip to the last chapter of this book, aside from the character's names, you wouldn't even think it was the same story. It changes and progresses more than you could have ever thought possible for one novel, and I loved every minute of it. There were new surprises around every turn, and I really couldn't wait to find out what happened next.I feel that the story that the author created is genius in how it was portrayed. The journey doesn't always go where you want it to go so its never really predictable or boring, but the author knows his audience well enough to know when to give in and give them exactly what they want to happen. It keeps it interesting, and keeps the reader happy, which in my case made it incredibly addictive.I loved each of the characters, but really loved Mischeif and Velvet (you just have to read to find out who they are because I am not telling). There is a love story that transpires, which is a little predictable, but its works for this book, because it is not the main focus of the novel, and everthing happens exactly as the reader would want it to happen. Its everything that any reader would be secretly hoping for when it comes to the two main characters.  What really surprised me was how much I really loved and enjoyed the supportive characters in this book. They are really what made it amazing! They are unique, and you will fall in love with each personality. You will laugh, and cry, and be incredibly angry along with each one of them on this journey.This book really sucked me in, and I was right there each step of the way on the adventure, struggling when the charcters struggled, fighting when they fought.....and often eating when they ate....(no seriously this book could have killed my diet but I am not at all mad about it). I only put this book down when I absolutely HAD TO, and almost burned dinner one night because I was standing by the stove with my kindle, and got sucked back into the story line and forgot to watch the food even though I was standing right beside it. Once you get into it, you just "have" to find out what happens next.  Just a warning, Bedtimes will be obsolete until you finish reading. You will lose track of time as you are brought into this wonderful world, and fighting for your life along side all of the wonderful characters.I was thoroughly impressed through out the entire adventure, and can't wait to continue it in the next book!!

$REVIEW.: 4.5/5Trisha Wolfe is such an awesome world painter. The entire world, this book takes place in, comes to life as you read. I found Of Silver and Beasts to be an original and refreshing read for me. I love the idea behind the book, and the execution of it was spot on.  We are taken on a ride to the queendom of Cavan where Mercury is the main power source and so very important. We are given characters that are full of depth and rich in their our individual roles.Kaliope is our main character. She is, with no better way to put it, kick ass. She is a strong and capable heroine. She is driven and determined to protect and serve the queendom she resides in. Even when given orders she does not want to follow, she carries them out to the best of her ability. I loved how loyal she is to her friends. She does not take any of them for granted, and she appreciates each friendship. She would die for her friends, because they have also became her sisters. She learns about herself and what she is capable of throughout the course of the book. She has to accept her abilities and realize that she is not invincible.Our main guy is Prince Caben. He is a swoon worthy hero. He is serious in his commitments to his realm and grows to want to save the other realms just as much as his own. He is full of surprises and keeps our Kaliope on her toes. I love his humor and wit. He has such a likable and rich personality. He helps bring this book to life.What can I say? I really enjoyed this. I couldn't put it down once I started and I didn't want it to end when it did. I want the next one as of yesterday. (I don't handle cliffhangers well.) The adventure and story of Kaliope and Caben has only just begun and I CAN NOT wait to continue on with it.

$review_text.: Crazy Dangerous by Andrew Klaven a book written for a younger crowd is very well written and I think most 12 and up kids would enjoy it."Sam Hopkins is a good kid who has fallen in with the wrong crowd. Hanging around with car thieves and thugs. Sam knows it's only a matter of time before he makes one bad decision too many and gets into real trouble."  Sam ends up meeting and strange schoolmate, Jennifer. Jennifer sees stuff and may be a little "crazy". Sam and Jennifer become friends and Sam learns things that now he has to deal with.I enjoyed this book as an adult but it is obviously written for youth. I like all genres so it was a good read for me. If you know a young person who loves mysteries I believe I can safely say they will enjoy this one. My daughter is now reading it. It is a little slow to start with but after a few chapters it starts picking up. I didn't figure it out right away but near the last few chapters it started getting easier to figure out what was happening.I would purchase more books from this author for my daughter.Crazy Dangerous was provided to me a no charge from booksneeze.com in exchange for an honest review.

Anna and X go to the diner and she thinks to herself  how much she wants him and he thinks to himself how bad he is for her.  Finally they go on the road together and it's gets slightly more interesting, then abruptly ends!!!!  I didn't realize this was a series, but I guess that's my fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I'm sick of theses series though.  Especially when I don't like the book because I feel like I paid to read half of a bad story! There was nothing original here.

$REVIEW.: Reading Shakespeare this way (modern translation paired with the original text) is extremely helpful if you are going to be quizzed or have to write an essay for a course. There is a concise introduction and synopsis at the start, a scene-by-scene summary and character description at the end, and helpful clues throughout to contextualize the material - like word definitions, points of reference, performance notes and historical commentary. After a while, however, I found myself unintentionally just reading the modern translation, since it was easier to decipher, and ignoring the original text. This seems unfortunate. My comprehension increased, but my appreciation of Shakespeare&#8217;s poetic genius did not.

$REVIEW.: Incredible graphic descriptions and details of the photographic process succeeded in painting vivid images directly on my mind. So damn tangible they transported to my art directing days and photographic explorations of my own experiences.Historic manipulation of light and shadow color to generate visceral responses in the reader/viewer. Those wonderful images achieved by the curious fictitious photographer untilzing intelligence, chemistry are now easily captured. Today almost anyone can use computerized digital software. This seems to me a sad technological leveling, a denigration of the achievements of an original artist.Mixed in with this verbal melange of graphic images captured photographically are glamorous flights of sexual fantasy, graphic couplings and peccadillos from the dark side of light.Linton Robinson is a master storyteller evident in his word paintings  displayed in this graphic tour de force. A recommended adult read.

$review_text.: This is a fairly easy reading book, and moves through the basic zone system background, and the all important color management in the opening chapters. Digital metering and exposure follows and I can say I wish I had this when starting out in digital photography.The author takes us into the Digital Zone system from there, luminosity and zone masks and their use in balance in photography and especially HDR. I have learned many different ways to achieve most of these ends in Photoshop, but many new techniques in the bag are always welcomed, no? Its primarily Photoshop targeted, with a light covering of Lightroom. Again, I felt I was duplicating some techniques in post, but in my case that was only if my intention was an online post of a photo. Where I believe this book will separate itself from the normal photo processing manual is the final chapters on soft proofing and printing. Of course, the printed image is what we mostly strive for.I agree with some other reviewers in the pictures could be better. All in all, I believe this could be very useful for the intermediate to professional photographer that wants to take his craft to the nest level, especially those interested in HDR and quality photo printing.

$REVIEW.: Not good!Let me tell you how I even read this book in the first place.Over the summer we had a women's Bible study (more like book and talk study lol) and my friends decided to choose this book to read.I read it in two days because I just wanted to get it over with.This book I feel like is for people who are married, and have been for quite some time.Or like my friend said, this book makes it seem like we don't know men at all!For me, being a single lady, this book was quite discouraging, I was like, then why do people even get married in the first place?!It made it seem like most men think and act that way.I feel like if I had a husband this book would make me rethink everything about him; I would be suspicious I don't know but not what you want to be in a marriage!Honestly, if you have a boyfriend or are married, just ask them what they think, or ask them questions if you really want to, since it might be different than what the book describes.Also, for a Christian book I felt like biblical stuff was just added into it- that was the part I hated the most.Hello! Where's Scripture?? or prayers maybe? Talk about God He's the one Who is the Designer of marriage!I wouldn't recommend this book at all to anyone. Save your money, talk to your bf/husband, and enjoy your life together- have fun!Also read the Bible together.:)

Second, while the story was good it was a bit of a repeat. The concept has been done over and over. The author could have added a little something to change it up a little bit. Otherwise it was a good story. I will continue to read the others in the series.

The characters were well done and kept me laughing and guessing throughout the whole story as they make their wager to foil the Duke's dastardly plan to keep them from marrying as soon as possible.

$review_text.: This book has a wealth of information presented in a clear, easy read style. A comparatively short book that packs a punch !!Conway covers such topics as:&#8226; the two broad  categories of emotion; those of duplication (such as happiness) that tell us &#8220;do that again&#8221; and those of change (such as anger, guilt and hopelessness) that tell us &#8220;something has to change&#8221;,&#8226; how to perceive, understand, manage and use emotions - basically how to master emotions for our own and others benefit,&#8226; how to create the emotion you desire and need right now &#8211; instant emotional power,&#8226; how to identify and assess your own personal rules, and&#8226; how to forgive and learn.The book breaks down the emotional minefield and gives it back as a structured, practical, step by step approach we can apply as needed to gain mastery. The chapters on some &#8220;major&#8221; emotions of duplication and change are particularly useful. Everyone would identify with at least something here. Feeling angry? Which of your rules has been broken? Is it a rule that needs changing or do you &#8220;sell&#8221; your rule with emotional pictures to others? It really is that simple. Conway persuades us of this and provides us with the tools so we can get going immediately.The kindle edition mentions that a clickable table of contents is planned for a future update; this will enhance the useability of the book. There are some proofreading issues; whilst these are annoying they do not detract from the message. Finally, some topics are repeated which tighter editing could remove without diluting the message.Overall a very useful book that creates structure and sense to emotions. Everyone should read and know this. Perhaps it could be presented in senior schools &#8211; would save a lot of heartache later !!

$REVIEW.: There are some books that are just captivating that you can't stop reading, and left you I awe in the end.  With this one I have mixed feelings about it, but I just can't put my finger on it.  Rich Miller, star diver, is openly gay and had carried a lot of resentment over the years- issues with past relationships, himself, and his family, mainly his father, Dan Miller.  Johnny Milloway, aka John or Dragon is my favorite character in this book.  Star football player, jock, bruiser- Rich's protector, and a realist.  Just hated him for hurting Rich at one point, but it led him to a self discovery in the end.  I just wished it were longer to really see in the end how the two ended up.

$REVIEW.: Ooooooh my dear sweet waffles!The second I found out about this book, I was like WANT! Ever since the first book of the Blemished trilogy was released last year, I was all over it. I absolutely love this series with a passion, and when I found out there were novellas, I went as crazy as a caffeine addict with an energy drink. Like holy crap! I didn't have to wait freaking five months to read the next book! Wooooo baby!I finished this book within hours of starting it. The plot of this novella follows one of the secondary characters, a GEM named Elena who used to be a bully. Her heart was changed by none other than the main character of the series, Mina Hart, and now Elena wants out. She wants to get away from Area 14 and escape to London, and the way she does that is through entering a beauty pageant.Might I just say that Jake was the most amazing character ever. From the first moment of meeting him, I knew I would grow to like him. And damn it, I fell hard! *swoon* Such a shame how things turned out though :( I cried...I honest to cheesecake cried.Loved everything about this! It was so interesting to see what Elena was up to in the months after Mina, Daniel, Angela, and Sebastian escaped to the Clans. And now Elena's got a plan, so I'm super excited to see how all of this turns out!And I just realized that now I have to wait....for the final book of the trilogy...well, crap.

$REVIEW.: I had been considering trying macrobiotics for a few years before it became trendy and this book was released. The first books I consulted were by Kushi and incredibly dry; they made it seem too challenging; focusing on foods I could not find and appliances that needed to be bought in order to start. Then I read Jessica Porter's book and it convinced me to take the plunge.Her writing is accesiible and she includes entertaning anecdotes from her experience with discovering macrobiotic philosophy. Hte personal conversation stlye makes the information easier to remember and apply than other texts. She makes macrobiotics seem posisble for any one, any where they live. I do not live near a thriving organic community, but she supplies a wide range of resources, online stores, helpful web sites and other useful books to help in the transition. Though she was trained at the Kushi Institute, she gives readers knowledge of the full range of approaches that exist.Did you know that there is a macrobiotic equivalent to Reese's peanut butter cups? She gives the recipes for these, as well as other deserts for special occasions, in addition to the staple dishes that constitute a macrobiotic eating system.  I do wish tht the book had more recipes, and found the book "Cook Your Way to the Life You Want" and Cooking Whole Foods" by Christina Pirello excellent complements. They are not necessary additions, but Porter made me eager to read much more about macrobiotics.Macrobiotics is learning how to balance food to meet your body's nutritional needs, which will vary depending on your daily activities and stress. It tkaes a life time to master, but Porter provides excellent ropes to help you start immediately, if you so wish. She also provides a gradual (her recommended) approach. An excess of sweets, for example, is not recommended as healthy on average, but she give recipes for safer alternatives to combat cravings caused by mass marketing campaigns of the food industry, as you being your journey into macrobiotics.There were times when I thought the book indulged a little too much into "feel the power of the universe" rhetoric, but the truth of the matter is that what you eat affects not only your health, but also your moods, and an improved diet helps increase your powers of perception, by making you less vitim to illenss and mood fluctuations.There are some macro books that I have purchased and had to read again and again, because they were so complicated. This one I reread because I enjoy and am inspired by the writing.
$SUMMARY.: This book convinced me to take the macro plunge

It was my first book from Kelly Gendron and I'm sure that after this it certainly won't be the last.Lucky had my heart the hole time. I can relate a bit about his guilt and how he faces his inner demons. I loved the way the author approached the whole situation. Kaley is a determined girl, who knows what she want and I was happy to see this. I would've been quite disappointed if she was a girl who doubted herself and struggles because of it with Lucky.I can even say I would like to read more about Fallon, about his story.

$REVIEW.: When I started reading this collection I had a vague idea of what to expect. I knew the stories were about normal people and the consequences, good or bad, of the decisions they make.The first story, is about two brothers who seem to never do anything right, and Phillip the homeless man. A robbery gone wrong, money found when needed most, but what does someone do with that money? A wonderful story about the ability to do the right thing.The second story is about a man who gets an unexpected response to his romantic overtures. He storms off, and chaos ensues, and bad luck prevails he finds himself in a cabin. This is one story I wish had been longer, which is a credit to Mr. Browns writing ability. When this story in particular was over, I wished there was more. The reason being there are so many things that could explain the cabin and what he finds in it, and my imagination went (and still is) in overdrive.The last story is about a man recalling his abusive childhood. It speaks clearly to the fact there are somethings that no matter how hard we try to bury, they will always find a way to come back and haunt us - always.A fantastic collection and all I can say is I want more from this writer.

$REVIEW.: If you find yourself on a long journey, or sitting in a deckchair during the holiday season, this book is a perfect companion. And even if you are not traveling anywhere, this book will transport you. From the opening murder scene, the writing is superb: there are layers of descriptions and intricate details, every clue is clever; conversations and innuendos are complete with wit and humor that puts a smile on your face. A seriously thoughtful and intelligent page turner. The distinct style is telling. For me it says this book is a masterpiece in its genre.
$SUMMARY.: Seamless and unforgettable.

$REVIEW.: The &#34; Immanu'El&#34; series is definitely my favorite series of &#34;Biblical Fiction&#34; books. These six books, including &#34;Talmid Bread&#34; follows the life and times of Jesus, His apostles, John the Baptist, and other Biblical people from the courtship of Joseph and Mary through Jesus birth, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection. The author has beautifully brought the characters to life so that it is easy to understand not only the circumstances in which they lived and interacted, but the deepest emotions, family dynamics. hopes, fears, and loves of each of them. The events in the novels closely follow the Biblical accounts as well as known historical information. I truly loved this whole series and was sorry when I closed the last book,

$REVIEW.: I loved the continuation of the storyline for this fantasy universe which picks up at a point before the ending of Final Formula and expands what happened during a time when only Addie, the heroine of the story, was onstage.  We have a fascinating interlude with James and Rowan, our heroes from Final Formula, that sets up future adventures nicely while being pretty thrilling all in itself. There are trips through time and space, an unremittingly evil bad guy, all wrapped up in a satisfying way.  Keep going! Love this saga!

$review_text.: A LUSH BETRAYAL is a brilliantly written story by Selena Laurence about the members of the rock band LUSH who are lifetime friends that are silently being torn apart by a lone act of betrayal committed in a moment of pain and vulnerability. An event that was not meant to cause pain, but should not have happened and can not be taken back. An event so regretful that it is tormenting and poisoning those that feel they must keep the secret to protect the others they love deeply from even worse pain. I can only say I loved everything about this deep, heart-wrenching, intense and multi-layered story. It ran me through the gamut of emotions and kept my interest on every single page.On the outside, Joss Jamison, the gorgeous, talented and drop-your-panties sexy lead singer and the driving force of the band LUSH is every woman's dream. He definitely has the irresistibly charming, cocky, sex-on-a-stick bad boy vibe down and can have any woman he wants in his bed. On the inside, he feels like he is slowly dying. The guilt of his actions is a like a poison he willingly accepts even as it slowly destroys all his joy for life, and especially for the life expected of a rock star. Joss was not alone in his betrayal, but for much of the story he and everyone else seems to be okay with letting him take the full blame and shame for what happened (this was the one gripe about the book that made me rant out loud a few times at his so-called friends). Ms. Laurence does an incredible job of letting the reader into Joss's regret, despair, anguish and protectiveness that it's impossible not to love him, to root for him, and to pray he finds forgiveness and peace to get past this.  He is a good man and has been a loyal and faithful friend his whole life. He deserves happiness despite the mistake he made.The story begins with the band about to begin a world tour. Lush's manager hires Melanie DiLorenzo, a photo journalist and videographer to accompany the band on their summer tour at the urging of her older sister Tammy. Tammy has been Walsh, the bass player's girlfriend since they were all fourteen and Joss, Walsh and the lead guitarist, Mike, were just starting up the band. For the last thirteen years she has  traveled with the band, expediting and facilitating their needs on the road. Their drummer, Colin, has been with the band almost as long. She and these four men are a family of brothers (and sister) who have grown up together, had each other's back and kept each other grounded, through the lean times as well as the riches and fame.Mel, who through Tammy, has known Lush almost all her life, but never spent much time actually with them.  She has always had a bit of a fangirl crush on Joss, but for the moment she's sworn off men. Especially bad boys who have a history of nothing but VERY short term relationships, like Joss, who are certain to break her heart. She is dealing with unexpected ramifications of a poorly thought-out relationship and breakup that has brought consequences to her future she never imagined and has shaken her confidence to her core. She is very excited about the exposure this opportunity will bring to her career since she is just finishing her MFA and doesn't want to do anything to screw it up.Despite Joss's state of mind, and debatable past of man-whoring ways, he is hit like a ton of bricks when Mel joins the tour. She is like a beacon of sunshine into his dark world and he can't stay away from her. He doesn't even try, he recognizes the emotional connection and that he needs her, that she is meant for him and pursues her regardless of the additional animosity it adds to the already strained relationship of his band. Tammy especially does not trust him with her baby sister and does everything she can to undermine him getting close to Mel. Because I was 100% team Joss, I didn't like Tammy much, but I have to say Ms. Laurence again does a remarkable job of writing the depth of all these characters and I couldn't truly begrudge Tammy her motivations.Mel is falling just as deeply in love with Joss as he is with her, but she really tries hard to fight it. The circumstances were complicated and the emotions were all over the place. I admired Mel, she kept true to herself.  She didn't let anyone else make her decisions for her. She stood her ground, fighting for what she wanted. Yet, she wasn't jaded like the others, a true breath of fresh air and an innocent in this drama. The passion she and Joss created was seductive, steamy, and loving. Never just sex, not that it wasn't hot, because OMG!!! The progress of their relationship and feelings for one another was masterfully written. A perfect love story. I hung on every scene when the two of them were together because they literally sparked. And not always in a pleasant way, but always in an intense way which relayed the depth of their emotional bond. I loved them together and hoped they'd have their HEA right up to the end!This story is more than a true love romance between two people. It is about the consequence of actions on the lives around you. A reminder that some things can never be taken back and you should choose your actions wisely. Because when the betrayal between these friends comes out the tightness of their lifetime bond makes no difference. Their world unravels and completely tears them all apart. The secret revealed leaves a destruction that was painful to read because Ms. Laurence has made you love them all and feel their pain as if it were your own. So yes, I cried reading this book, but I also laughed. Many times. The wit and dialogue was real and brilliantly written.  Do not miss out on this book.  Do not miss out on this series! Selena Laurence has earned her place firmly on my must-buy author list with this incredible story. I rate this book 4.5 stars but only because it pissed me off how Joss took on all the responsibility and consequences of what happened too often, lol!~Complimentary copy received from Author/Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

I love how naive Jess is made out to be but at the same time she is tougher than she gives herself credit for.

$REVIEW.: Window is a very different kind of erotic romance story that I have never read before.  This tale involves no touching or even talking, but instead has some very erotic moments in front of a window with a very sexy neighbor across the way.  It definitely is a very steamy and hot read that will have you wondering if the two characters will ever meet.  TheBy day, she&#8217;s a day research assistant and by night, she&#8217;s stripping and teasing for the neighbor across from her.  She has no idea who he is, and what he does for a living, but she is all for making impression with him.  In fact, she even comes out to say, she is usually introvert, staying in reading romance novels, but she&#8217;s being very bold and brave with the sexy man across the way.  She moved to Paris to make her mark and she definitely is at her day job.  She gets to explore the beautiful city of Paris and eat all the wonderful food there and Michelle Renae did a fabulous job of describing everything and making me want to travel back to Europe again.  How I miss the food overseas and the shopping.  *sigh*Michele Renae gives you a story of a female character trying to do something different and not rush into things, but to enjoy life to the fullest.  She wants to guess about the male across the street and just have fun. We get just the female point of view, and not the male&#8217;s, but that makes it even more interesting.  He definitely cares for her, especially during one scene, where she has all kinds of thoughts going through her head due to jealousy.I look forward to reading what happens next in the tale of the two window seducers and hopefully, they will eventually get to meet or at least talk to each other.  I hope the female character is open up more to finally meet him and not be scared about it.I give this book 4 full moons and recommend it to readers out there looking for a different kind of erotica story that involves just looking and not touching.  There are just windows to separate them and space between the buildings.  I will say this, they do change it up and keep it spicy.  =)I received a complimentary copy of the book from the Author in exchange for an honest review.
$SUMMARY.: 4 stars - "Window" by Michele Renae

$REVIEW.: Just a short review as others have expressed better than I the unsurpassed job of interpretation of the Holy Qur'an into English which Asad was able to achieve - his interpretation and footnotes are far, far better than any before.The layout of the book is also a gift to those who are learning Qur'anic Arabic: with English, Arabic, and a transliteration on one page (along with the all-enompassing guide to pronouncing the transliteration) Asad has provided a powerful tool to those who are students of Arabic.A wonderful, wonderful work. The best interpretation of the Holy Qur'an in English that I've read, and a book of beauty printed on fine paper and with exceptional typography. This should be the standard text for all English speaking Muslims as well as any English speaking person desiring to raed the Qur'an in the very best interpretation.My only complaint, and the reason I 'deducted' a star, is that the book with its fine heavy paper does not have a proper heavy-duty binding. After 2 or 3 weeks I had to have my copy re-bound as the cover began to tear off and the signatures began to break the stitching. I would hope that in subsequent editions the publishers would provide a better binding so that this text would not unravel after a short period of heavy use,

$REVIEW.: The story starts out with the protagonist in a serious jam, and you don't see how she got there for some time.  I've read and enjoyed other books taking that approach, but for some reason I found it more distracting than anything else.  Since this is based on a short story, maybe I should read that first and then give the book another try; the author's writing is crisp and moves right along, but I wasn't concerned about the hero after passing 100 pages.

 It gives minimal instructions for creating garments out of found clothing (sweaters), but it is jam-packed with the neatest ideas and everything is doable with minimum skills

 What is especially nice is that the photographs, writers, models are not from the U.S


 It is always nice to really get a look into the style of people from different countries

 Excellent book and "search" offered by amazon does not highlight the best parts

$REVIEW.: A little background about me first: I'm a senior developer on a large database-centric project.  I bought this book to give my intern (and coworkers needing a refresher) an introduction to databases.  Before I loaned it to him I read it over a few nights.  It turned out to be a good refresher for me as well!  Shortly before I got this book I was discussing database normalization with a coworker, and neither of us could remember which normal form was which (we knew to implement them, just not which went with which number).  This book explained normalization very clearly - probably the most concise definition I've seen.The book is heavy with examples and ties everything into a "real world" example: how to create a database to organize the data in the protagonists' kingdom.  The format of each chapter is the same: comic to advance the story and give context to the database concepts being introduced, followed by explanatory text and review questions.  The book covers everything from "what is a database" to database security and data replication.Before I could give the book to my intern to read our database administrator took it and read it.  He had very high praise for this book - he felt it was an engaging, accurate introduction to database concepts.  The book was equally helpful to my intern - the SQL examples really helped him out.If you're going to be studying databases or need to become familiar with how they operate you won't go wrong with this book.  You'll even learn basic SQL syntax...this book is a great introduction and good start to working with databases.

 What I will say, though, is that I'm honestly glad I found this book

 I was review hopping on a thread when I came across the name, and did a search here on Amazon for it


 What popped up was a 3 books in 1 download for a price that made me take a chance on someone previously unknown to me


 Lucky me!  The minute I hit send, I grabbed Eye of the Burning Man and dove right back into Mick's world, which I finished last night

 I am champing at the bit to get to One of the Wicked, and then Running Cold

 I'll be so very sad to have no more Mick Callahan to lose myself in, I'll just have to go in search of everything else Mr

 I hear tell he's written some good horror..

$REVIEW.: This is a series of short stories so this first one is just a tease of things to come. Jennifer is a busy real estate agent just getting out of a serious relationship. She thinks it would be a good idea to place an ad to find a successful businessman who wants a one night fling, no strings attached. After getting several takers & hanging up the phone on them, William calls her & she is hooked. He is a businessman from London with an adorable accent, and something between the two of them connects. He asks Jennifer to a charity ball so Jennifer is able to dress up like Cinderella before the &#34;one night fling&#34; occurs. William is calm & cool but his kisses are steamy hot & Jennifer has to take a moment after their short fling is over when she realizes she just experienced a life changing event. I'm sure they'll both go their separate ways but it seems like they wouldn't do that if they hadn't agree to part ways so soon. Looking forward to book #2! Funny, clever banter & hot bedroom action!

$REVIEW.: My very first book by Michele was Never Say Never and while I was in Chicago earlier this year at Slam 2 girlfriend of mine was telling me about Michele book, and since they know what types of books I like they told me to get the book. Well before I left Chicago I purchase the book and when I return home I read the book. It was so good and I recommend that you read it.So when I find out that Michele was doing a sequel to Never Say Never I pre-order the book as soon as possible and I tell it was worth the wait.  For Sexton Johnson it was love at first sight when he met Sasha at her friend party.Sasha Diamond is a registered nurse who has a problem picking the right guy. After Sasha has a argument with her boyfriend and leave in a hurry she runs into her friend Tiara.  Tiara is at the table with her brother and his friend Sexton Johnson. Once they are all sitting around the table talking Sexton reminds Sasha that they met at her friend party and at that time she was not interest in him.Sexton Johnson is an up and coming NBA star who when he see Sasha again he is reminded of the first time they met. For Sexton he sees this has a second chance and he is not about to let this chance slip by so before he leave he give Sasha his card and ask her to call. Sexton & Sasha feels the instance attraction between as well as Tiara who once her brother and Sexton left made a comment to Sasha.When Sasha broke up with her boyfriend after catching him cheating, Tiara invited Sasha to the Basketball game that her brother got tickets to for Tiara and her husband. Once they was at the game Tiara brother invited them to after party and once Sasha met again they knew the attraction was there and this time they was going to act on it.I don't want to give to much of the book away, but this is a great book and I recommend it.There is a great review on amazon on this book by a reviewer from Romance in Color.Louise

$REVIEW.: Seldom do I read a book with fewer than 10 existing reviews and 4 stars. I'm glad I did. This was a fast paced, interesting read with well developed characters and a good romance. There were a couple of obvious editing errors, but really the only complaint I have is the ending felt abrupt. However, the story starts right where it left off in the sequel. Unfortunately, I won't be reading because I won't pay 3.99 for book only about 150 pages long. Even though I'm a little irritated, I'm glad I read it and did genuinely enjoy it and recommend it with a warning about the cost of the sequels.

$review_text.: Yesterday, I started Tempted in the Tropics by Tracy March

We all know how much I enjoy the Bliss line and I couldn't pass this delectable read


Plus, the story eventually ends up in an island paradise

By the way, I would love to go to a resort like the one described in the book.Anyway, we have Paige Ellerbee who owns a little bakery in town
Cute little store, and she's also helps the locals with her baked goods
Though she gets a little help from Doctor Hartley

However, he ends up going on vacation and turns his practice over to his nephew till he returns.Lane Anderson got himself in some trouble with his practice in Austin
Even though the situation wasn't his fault, he doesn't want to continue helping Paige while his uncle is gone
Well, you know this is going to cause some tension.Let's just say that Lane and Paige got off on a rocky start
Paige would probably understand more if Lane had been upfront with her about his troubles
However, we couldn't have that could we; that would make the situation a little too convenient

Basically takes an island get away to bring these two together


Just to let you know, it wasn't all peachy king on the island either


Let's just say there were a few bumps in the road


Some of those bumps were awkwardly funny.Overall, I enjoyed this sweet read

My end I was getting little teary eye

I was a little worry, Lane would miss his chance with Paige
However, he came through like a true hero


Since this is a Bliss book, you will find that happy sappy feel good feeling
So, if you are looking for something like that, I would suggest Tempted in the Tropics


If not that, then for resort paradise
I'm not kidding when I say I would love to go to a place like the book.Copy provided by the publisher

$review_text.: "A man's feet should be on the earth.  It is where we belong.  As long as mankind keeps on walking, we'll make it to tomorrow."If you are already a fan then you know that Iain has a way of intertwining his story lines.  All of his books are stand alones, yet they subtly reference the going ons of stories past.In Savage we find a group of apocalyptic survivors living on a secured pier. During the latest foraging outing they find a man wounded by gunshot and decide to bring him home with them.  Unbeknownst to them this man is being hunted by Samuel Raymeady, a wealthy mad man with a twisted agenda.With supplies dwindling part of the pier group decides to venture out further to see what they can find. While they are gone a caravan of ships, yachts, small boats appear in the sea. While the pier group is at its most venerable, three men come ashore looking for the wounded man. This is the point when the story digs its talons in and won't let go until you are finished reading it.We have Garfield and his group fighting off zombies and other men while looking for supplies.  We have the group left behind dealing with Roman, a henchman of Samuel Raymeady and we have Samuel himself ready to destroy anything that stands in his way to New World Domination!There are so many twists and turns that kept me guessing and then leaving me totally surprised by the outcome.  I really enjoy this author and have to say I have read all of his books!

$review_text.: I have read the first book and thought it was good and had potential
 Unfortunately, I didn't like the 2nd book quite as much
 The book seemed a little all over the place and I had a hard time connecting everything
 Also, Scarlett seemed to have lost some of her inner spunk

Her inner thoughts weren't as sarcastic or funny as in the first.The love triangle was predictable but annoying since she's obviously not going to pick the guy that I like.I don't think that I will be continuing with this series if another book is released.

$review_text.: Very interesting book. I strongly recommend reading Destined to Reign first, however.This book is about 345 pages long. Interestingly, the first 90 pages or so are very "new and fresh". Hope you are good with relationships, because right from the getgo Prince shares that it's not so much what you have in your life but rather WHO you have in your life.After that point seemed like some page space was used to revisit some of the ideas from Destined to Reign. Still, I certainly appreciated Chapter 11 on the next generation of believers.Prince tends to be notably good about encourageing readers to test what he writes against the Bible. I haven't been completely accepting of his take on Galatians 6:7-8; but I realize that is just one moment in an excellent book. Could I possibly be wrong about something?About the last 100 pages the book seemed to get stronger for me.When I write a review I try to stay away from writing the author said this specific little thing or that specific little thing. I prefer to just write something general like this book is a good starting place to think about how we might begin to experience more grace in our lives.But that doesn't mean that Prince had any shortage of interesting ideas throughout the book. As an example, he writes that it is not enough to read and just mentally agree with what we have read. One needs to speak one's faith; and speaking it magnifies the works of Jesus on the cross. I had never thought of that before, but it(magnifying the works of Jesus on the cross) seems like a good thing to me.Actually, the big "ah ha" moment for me was the realization the New Covenant was GOD's decision alone. (seems it really isn't all about me, after all.)Hopefully you will find something helpful in reading Unmerited Favor.

$review_text.: I related to the politics of this revenge story, of a soldier who lost his family to a thug who was never adequately punished and I really liked the elaborate machinations he put into effect to fully extract his revenge. The reader was left in the dark for much of the story regarding how Gray was pulling it all off, and when we get the final explanation, it turns out that much of what had been revealed was not reliable.  I have to say, the revelations at the end did damper my enthusiasm for the book.  I will read the next one, but I will be a lot more wary about being suckered.

$review_text.: Essentially this novel is about one major mystery that the reader almost forgets about among the other mysteries that revolve around it
 The resolution is rather spectacular and breathtaking in the 'bigness' of the idea behind it


 I know this probably makes little sense, but I don't want to give away anything that might remove the impact of the novel.So, the idea behind the novel is pretty darned good
 It's exactly the kind of idea that would lead me to give a book a five star rating if the author executed both the idea and the writing well

 Ian McDonald executes the idea pretty nicely

 But his writing style is maddening
 One item which no longer bothers me is the use of the 'present tense' in his writing, instead of 'past tense'


 I got used to it, and I believe it has something to do with the underlying premise of the novel


 He changes his writing style somewhat at various times, I assume in an attempt to bring out a certain change in the reader's feelings, but it felt distracting.However, the part that dragged my rating down to 3 stars was his use of Indian terms throughout the book
 Obligatory disclaimer here..


if what I describe below doesn't bother you, upgrade my rating of the book to a '5' and have at it!Having to go to the glossary every paragraph in some of his chapters just is inexcusable


 Yeah, the reader could skim over words that aren't understood, but some passages are more or less unintelligible without the translations
 Even more maddening, some terms aren't even IN the glossary


 I finished the book and still have no idea what a 'ghat' is
 My best guess is a dock or a sidewalk
 It was used a fair bit in the beginning, and then seemingly every paragraph in the last chapter


 Now, if the word describes something uniquely Indian that can't be described in one or two English words, then I have no problem with using the Indian term


But there are many cases of him using simple Indian words for simple English words


 Unless an Indian alley has unique characteristics that make it different from other alleys, why was it necessary to use the word 'gali'?  The glossary just says it's an alley, so if there is a subtle difference, the reader isn't let in on it


 There are a few other cases like this

 And when an Indian word IS used which has a more subtle meaning, McDonald often makes using the word redundant


 I didn't write down the sentences where this occurred, but as an example he did things like "they went to the Basti settlement"


 Well, the glossary says a Basti is a settlement or slum
 So translated, it would read "they went to the settlement settlement"

 In other words, he often used many of the English description of the word around the word itself, making the word redundant

 He either should have just used the word, or just described the scene in English, instead he used the most confusing mix of the two methods possible.I had discovered that there was going to be a follow up to this novel before I finished and I was torn on whether I would get it if this novel didn't end more or less cleanly
 Fortunately it doesn't feel like an obvious set up for a sequel so I can get away with enjoying the wonderfully done wrap up, and not have to feel like I need to get another book in the 'series' that might have the same language issues


 I do however intend to try some of his other novels as the idea in this one was one I liked


 A lot
 I do recommend this book, but you may need a lot of patience to get through it.

$REVIEW.: This is how the man saw himself, and what is most interesting is what was important and noteworthy to him -- his family, Scotland, his adopted country (US), his advancement in his work (in spite of limited education), his relationships with his employees, and his overall success

 But, most of all, his generosity and good works was how he defined himself -- and what he is remembered for today
 I grew up in Pittsburgh and my family has a connection to &#34;Carnegie Tech&#34;, as it used to be called (now Carnegie-Mellon Institute of Technology)


 That may be the reason why I enjoyed the book so much, even though his recollections of the recognition he got for his &#34;good works&#34; late in life got a bit tiresome to read


 It was obviously very important to him, however.What is most interesting is that he wrote this autobiography in real-time (except for his early life), and his writing style was easy to read and I loved his sense of humor

 All in all, a good read!

$REVIEW.: A dark romance, but a lot of the elements that make a story dark aren't really included in this book; they've already happened prior to the main characters meeting. What starts out as a plan for revenge slowly morphs into a unconventional love story. This is one time I think a book should have been drawn out into at least two books in a series: one so that we can the early histories of both Zachary and Serenity, and this book could have been the conclusion to their story. But overall still an entertaining read.

$REVIEW.: Reading this book is like going back in time for me. My mom and older sister were avid seamstresses as I was growing up. I remember hearing the terms &#34;presser foot&#34; and &#34;bobbin&#34; and &#34;zipper foot&#34; - but since I don't sew (yet) I had forgotten the terms. I wasn't expecting this sudden journey down memory lane when I started reading a sewing how-to book. What a refreshing treat for me.Even if you don't get the rush of memory that I did, you will enjoy - and get loads of use from this book. She starts with a simple project and takes you right through to the more advanced projects with clear and concise illustrations. I can see myself making a lot of Christmas gifts for next year using her sample projects. Even the first project - a simple tote bag - will make a nice gift, and it's something I can use myself. So cool.Oh yes, one thing I almost forgot to mention -- I've been planning to buy a sewing machine for a few months now, but could never get past the hurdle of &#34;which one should I choose?&#34; Margo Price starts right there - choosing the right sewing machine and getting to know it. Very helpful.If you're brand new to sewing, or just need to gain confidence in your ability then this is a great book for your library. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Wow, Where Words Fail is a great book!Abby and her brother Alex are no strangers to tragedy.  In high school Abby meets Jamie.  He was her world then but he left without telling her and she hasn't seen him since.  Abby and Alex have lost a lot in the lives but as adults they have made themselves successful.  The own a record label and Abby is a famous musician.  Abby uses drugs and meaningless sex to help her cope with her past.  She had made a family with Alex, his daughter, her friend Tuesday, and her band mates.Nine years after Jamie left she shows up uses his real name Jameson.  He is the temporary guitarist for Abby's band.  He recognizes her pretty quickly but she doesn't recognize him.  I wondered why she didn't recognize him.  It seemed unrealistic that she would not recognize him.  But then I remembered in my own life not recognizing people from high school.  Boys seem to change so much after high school.  So, at first glance this part didn't seem believable but it is very much believable.  When she finally realizes who Jameson is, it rocks both their worlds.  Will they fight for each other or will they walk away?  You are going to have to read the book to find out.Where Words Fail takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride.  The characters in the book have so much bad stuff thrown at them.  The characters are so wonderfully written and strong that you can't help but root for them to get some happiness.Katheryn Kiden does a wonderful job balancing the good, bad, and the OMG moments in the story.  Where Words Fail drew me in from the beginning and I could not put it down.

$review_text.: Freeing Asia is a great lovely book. This book has a great heroine in Asia Fuller and two HOT GORGEOUS MEN, Jay Clark and Marcus Avery vying for the attention of Asia. Both men are complete opposites: one wears suits and one is comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt but both have one thing in common: ASIA.The supporting cast were awesome!!! There were plenty of sweet, hot intense scenes and LOL moments in this book.What I love about this book is that Asia, is not your typical blonde or brunette heroine.She is half Japanese and half American. Its refreshing to have an Asian American as the main character since there aren't many books which has that. Asia is smart, funny, beautiful, sexy, talented, lovable, a tomboy and is surrounded by great family and friends. There are two gorgeous men, who were smitten and enamored over Asia: Jay and Marcus. What i especially love about this book is that there is never a love triangle and no cheating. Jay, is rich, gorgeous, and is being trained to be CEO for his father's company. He was a total sweetheart to Asia and had me swooning. They had plenty of hot moments. As her relationship with Jay progressed, Asia found herself conforming to the image of what Jay wanted and needed her to be and that wasn't her. Marcus, on the other-hand was her first love and her brother, Shaun's best friend. Marcus is a professional skateboarder and business owner of a skateboard and surf shop. He broke her heart in the past and was suddenly re-entering her life after 7 years being away. Marcus knew and understood the real Asia. He accepted her as she was and was constantly reminding her how f***ing amazing and beautiful she was.They too had plenty of HOT and STEAMY moments together. Both men knew Asia was special, beautiful and cared for her.This book is about Asia and her self-discovery of who she is and being comfortable in your skin. Its about her finding herself through loss, heartache and love. Its about her opening her heart and breaking down the walls and fears surrounding her heart. In order for her to be free, she had to learn to love herself, face her fears and let love in. She learns through both Jay and Marcus, how talented and and amazing she is. Throughout the book, readers see the changes and character growth development of Asia. I find that not only, Asia learns to be free but also Jay and Marcus as well. Jay, learns what he wants to do professionally in life and what makes him happy. Marcus, learns to in order to be free he must learn to let people in. In a way, all three characters are learning to find their way to be FREE.What i did not like about this book was the constant weed smoking. I felt it was too much for my taste.Overall, i would rate this book 4.5. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend this book. I thought E.M. Abel did a great job in bringing a great main and supporting cast. i found myself liking all the characters.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this book


I love friends turned lovers stories and this one did not disappoint! You will want to give Gavin a huge hug at the end of this book!  I have yet to read a book by Mia that I didn&#8217;t like so trust me when I say &#8220;Read her.&#8221;Erik knew he loved Gavin and had known it for years
He really needs his &#8220;gaydar&#8221; fix though because he had no idea that the man he has known since pre-school was gay
I loved how much he cared for Gavin

He knew that Gav had reached a low point and needed some prodding to let get of all the bad in his life.Gavin has had a rough life and believes all the bad that people have told him

He made my heart hurt
I wanted to shake some sense into his mother and father! I liked that he knew without Erik he would be devastated

He knew subconsciously that he loved him even if he didn&#8217;t want to believe it


In the end he proved that he wasn&#8217;t weak at the beach when the man he loved needed him.This is beautiful short story
I was surprised at the depth considering the length

You get to learn so much about the characters in such a short amount of time


These two men are super-hot together but I think it because you can feel how much they care for each other.~Special thank you to the author for the loan of this book in exchange for a honest review.~

$review_text.: I just love Rachel Harris' books and was so excited when she decided to write adult contemporary romance in addition to her YA series

 The first book in the Love and Game Series, Taste the Heat, was wonderful and I enjoyed it so much


 Not only was the romance and the story itself outstanding, but the way Rachel Harris painted the whole New Orleans setting, pulling you in with her words, just added so much to the story


 In Seven Day Fiance we once again find ourselves transported to this picturesque setting with its unique culture and customs, something that sets New Orleans and the surrounding areas apart from the rest of the country


 The culture, the customs, the language, the food, the people, and the way things are different in the different parishes, even though they are only separated by a couple of hours, were so well integrated into the story and just added so much to it, and the food, well it's an experience in itself, something we learned in Taste the Heat, and again in Seven Day Fiance.Seven Day Fiance is Cane and Angelle's story


 It can be read as a standalone without any problem, as can Taste the Heat, which is perk I really like, while being part of a series, we are able to see some of the same people we have come to know and Love in Taste the Heat, which is an added bonus
 Cane Robicheaux is the brother of Colby and Sherry, both of whom we met in Taste the Heat, and he is also the best friend of Jason, his sister Colby's fiance


 He now runs the families Cajun restaurant, where he and both of his sisters work, Colby is a rather renowned chef that returned back to the New Orleans area to help with the family business, and Sherry is the bubbly outgoing and outspoken sister who is always looking for a fun time
 Cane is all kinds of hot, with the bad boy vibe going on, leather jacket, motorcycle, tattoos, and he has a reputation for being a ladies&#8217; man, never ever doing relationships, yet he is fiercely loyal to his sister

 He also finds himself very attracted to a certain pretty redhead


 We also met this certain pretty redhead, Angelle, briefly in book one, but we really get to know her in Seven Day Fiance
There is a lot more to Angelle and her background, including the circumstances that lead her to leave home and start over


 Angelle has landed herself in quite a pickle with the story she has fabricated for her family to keep them off her back


 She now finds herself at a bachelors&#8217; auction fundraiser with some of the sexiest Santa's you'll ever find, sporting abs to die for, the Thanksgiving is coming up, a holiday that she will have to go home for and either face the music or some up with a solution, which causes her to find herself making a kind of crazy proposition to a man that makes her swoon, melt, and want to run all at the same time
 Throw that all in the pot with a little Cajun spices and you have yourself the fixings for quite an entertaining story.I loved Angelle and I also really loved Cane

 Both have their issues to overcome, and what starts out as a ruse to get Angelle out of her predicament soon turns in to so much more - talk about blurred lines, well that is an understatement for Cane and Angelle

 The two of them have chemistry that will scald you, and they are crazy about each other, but Cane's past is holding him back in a major way in regard to commitment

 Meanwhile, Angelle's family, especially her ex, would like nothing more than to bring her back home and keep her there


 Seven Day Fiance is a delightful story that will capture your heart and make you smile
 Rachel Harris has delivered yet again, another fabulous romance that is something I would most definitely recommend all contemporary romance fans check out.

$REVIEW.: Literary serial killers are a strange conundrum for readers. On the one hand we should be repulsed by their actions. On the other hand they make for excellent character studies. It's rare to find serial killer characters that capture the public's attention (Dexter and Hannibal Lecter come to mind). Barbie Wilde's The Venus Complex delves deeply into the neuroses and mental degradation of a serial killer. It's a bold but flawed work and I found myself enjoying the novel for the most part.Recently I reviewed Hellbound Hearts, an anthology series of short stories related to Clive Barker's Hellraiser setting. Barbie Wilde's story "Sister Cilice" stood out from the bunch due to its strong connection to the deeply sexual themes explored in Barker's original tale. My significant other informed me that Wilde had written a full length novel. Wilde's first novel continues her exploration of the twisted depths of human sexuality and the connection sexual desire has with horror.To read the rest of this review and others like it, please visit my blog, the King's Crier: Book Reviews on Blogger.

$REVIEW.: On Halloween, when you pull on your cape, slide on those plastic fangs, and apply makeup, I'm sure you will be filled with thoughts of beauty and immortality that come with playing a vampire. But I want you to think about what a real vampire would be doing at that exact same moment.In Vampires Revealed, Bektamun, a 3000 year old vampire, takes us down a long and complex road of folklore, facts, fiction, and human history involving vampires. In a journal entry fashion, she spills all the inside secret laws, politics, behaviors, scientific makeup, and thoughts that come with being one of the oldest born vampires still living.That's right folks. I used the words "born" and "living" in the same sentence with "vampire". Bektamun's story unravels all the way back to the birth of the first vampires. While telling us all the mechanics of a vampire, she shows us small slide show pieces of her life, and the growing pains of discovering what she is.But don't fret, for those of you with dreams of becoming a vampire, the trade secrets lay within the pages. Being a vampire is not for everyone though, even if you get permission from the counsel (there is quite an extensive testing session), persuade a vampire into falling in love with you (almost impossible), talk that said vampire into changing you, you would still have to live through the transformation (which doesn't have a high success rate), and then have to shed your humanity and cope with your new and overwhelming existence (some actually go insane from the bombarding of new sensations). While being a made vampire is different from being a born vampire, Bektamun is unable to describe the feelings involved with the transformation, since she has always been a vampire. She introduces us to a made vampire, Nicole, as she tries to explain to the reader how it has changed her life.Overall the story gave us a look at what the hardships would be in becoming a vampire. The human disguises, the constant identity changes, the death of people you care for, always moving, always adapting to your surroundings, the strict vampire laws (almost all punishable by death), and the strange catch twenty-two of embracing myths because most of them are wrong and deter humans from their discovery. In another words, vampires, pretend to be human, pretending to be vampires, so that they can pass as human. Confused yet? Bektamun will do a better job of sorting it out for you.FROM THE BOOK:In all honesty, there are more than a couple of myths vampires themselves had a hand in perpetuating. We didn't start them, but when it became apparent we could use them to our advantage we shamelessly did.Rebeka Harrington style of writing and storytelling took me back to Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire, but the story has been revamped (pun intended) for a more modern and classroom feel. I found some areas slightly repetitive, but overall it is a fascinating read for vampire lovers all around. It's a compilation of the pros and cons of what a vampire truly is, and everything that makes them function, even down to their anatomy. Rebeka does a fine job of blurring the lines of reality and fiction as the story moves on. It is not a story of characters, obstacles, and resolution, but the teaching that vampires are killers, and always will be (no sparkling). A vampire may befriend you, and take you in as a pet, but in the end, you are still just a source of food for them. It leaves you wondering: Would becoming a vampire really be as great as some people think it would be? You'll have to read the evidence and decide for yourself.

$REVIEW.: Into the already crowded world of vampire fiction comes this series starter from Celeste Carrara


 Give Me Forever starts out at a feverish pace and never slows down until the rather disappointing cliffhanger ending
 It's told from the perspective of Serena as we travel with her through her transition into the vampire world through her training and battles to do her father's bidding, as well as LOTS of sexual encounters that threaten to overwhelm the story

 From battle scenes to bedroom scenes the action is vividly depicted though which helps in pulling you into the story


 I just wish the author had spent more time with worldbuilding and clearly defining who/what these vampires are


 How/why the transitions occur and their abilities are just touched on

 We learn very late in the story that there are other paranormal creatures residing here as well but it too is just touched on but is something I hope will enter into any future stories in this series.My biggest wish is that Serena were a more likable heroine


 There were times where she left me frustrated with her constant thoughts of sex

 I also felt she was a bit childish in her need to please her father

 It comes from a lifetime of dealing with his cold demeanor where he showed affection through material goods, but his actions have now left her a bit spoiled too as her actions throughout the story show
 I had hoped that her transition would've made her not only physically stronger but mentally as well, but alas it didn't

 Their father-daughter relationship is sad to witness, and though it becomes less strained by the story's conclusion, it's far from satisfactory


 To make up for a lack of love from her father she finds affection elsewhere
 First is a few fellow vampires, then comes the human Nick who is sexy and sweetly natured


 He'd do anything to make her happy


 He's a good guy but a bit bland when compared to the next man in line, Alex, who's her father's assassin-for-hire


 Alex is sexy though very similar to her father in that he has a tendency to be overbearing


 He also happens to be her soul mate so their instant attraction is understandable

 From her first vampire lovers to Nick to Alex though the sex is hot!  Ms


Carrara knows how to write a steamy scene that is immensely satisfying which is a good thing since these scenes occur frequently


 This story definitely lives up to the label of erotica!On a whole though this is a story that had great potential but fell a bit short

 The story's pace was too quick so it left the worldbuilding and deep character development short
 The sexual interludes were steamy and satisfying yet took over the story with their frequency
 Ms


Carrara has created a series starter that while flawed still intrigues me with its possibilities


 Give Me Forever was an okay start, but I look forward to where Ms

Carrara will take this series in subsequent installments.

$review_text.: Daddy Dates gives the average Joe easy steps to actively and successfully engage with his daughter and raise a confident woman-to-be.When faced with the reality of raising four (4!) teen daughters, Greg Wright went on a soul quest.He came back with a mission: Don't Screw Up.This funny, insightful, and relatable book poses the wildly original concept that should be a "duh" for most dads--but isn't: In order to raise a confident woman-to-be, show your daughter what it feels like to be treated with love, respect, and true interest by a man who loves herWith a wonderful five year old girl I got this book to see if there were any ideas in it for John and I to do with Infinity and Hayden as they grow older


Daddy Dates is a great book filled with encouragement to teach your children what to expect in a mate, the way you teach them that is by treating them the way you want their mate to treat them


I really like his idea of calling up his daughters and formally asking them on a date and giving them the option of denying him
Each of his girls has a different personality and likes and dislikes so it was not an easy one two take each girl on the same date


He stresses how important it is to get to know your girls and to take them on dates that they will enjoy, listen to them.I hope and pray that we will have the type of relationship with Infinity and Hayden that Greg Wright has with his girls
An open honest relationship where they can come talk to John and I about anything they are struggling with

This has been John and I's prayer since we found out we were having a little girl almost six years ago.This is a perfect book for fathers day to encourage a dad to either start dating their daughter or to give him more ideas


This book has a wealth of resources in the back of the book to help each dad get their 'game on'.[...]

They were in a very dangerous situation and could have ended up in trouble, but they both proved that they were brave, flexible and spontanious - they made a good team but were excellent investigators in their own right too.However, Marie Astor managed to raise a serious suspense novel into an 'easy-going', funny and entertaining book intervowen with romantic threads
Overall, it's a very enjoyable read!

$REVIEW.: Lovers of romantic suspense shouldn't miss this one! Fast paced, compelling, and well-researched with a sympathetic yet strong hero and heroine the book creates a thoroughly believable world, taking you into the depths of cybercrime
The heroine--geeky, driven, passionate--learns to trust her emotions and instincts, a wrenching and exciting journey


The hero is to die for, and we're introduced to his equally lipsmacking male relatives, so I think we'll be hearing more from Ms

$review_text.: I have greatly enjoyed many Bradt guides, especially for Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, and Mauritius, but the Montenegro guidebook is one of the most frustrating guidebooks I have ever used.  The author is obviously a great fan of Montenegro as am I, but she writes in a narrative style which is really not helpful to the traveler using the book on the road.  She tells the reader about dogs and old women you will come across, but neglects to include practical information, like several maps that could have been useful (for the daytrip recommendation into Albania, for hiking in Durmitor).  She is a great lover of food and raves about certain restaurants but fails to give many practical details about several of the top destinations in the country.  I could not believe that she did not discuss any of the great hikes in Durmitor, saying that it was "beyond the scope of a guidebook" to discuss the major hikes there.  Why didn't she discuss Podgorica's main landmark, the Millenium Bridge?  It was constructed a few years before the book was published. And her thesaurus use had me rolling my eyes at times (Podgorica's "propinquity" to the coast; Budva's beach "pullulates" with bodies...).  I would have given this book one star, but it's the only English-language guidebook devoted to Montenegro, so I give her credit for that.  I do not recommend the Bradt Montenegro guidebook.

$review_text.: The Title of this Anthology does not lie! This is shaping up to be a Red Hot read all the way through!! The Book I chose to review is &#34;Can't Shake You&#34; by Molly Mclain. This is actually my second time reading this book and I enjoyed it even more than the first!Can&#8217;t Shake You is Molly McLain&#8217;s debut and she is off to an awesome start! This book alternates POV between Carissa and Josh which is great because you were able to get into both of their heads. Carissa is a very normal and likable character and Josh is an ex-Marine/Contractor and is super sexy! The chemistry between these two was off the charts and the sex was H-O-T! Throw in a little mystery and some great secondary character and this was an excellent read :) I am really excited that this is going to be a series; I can&#8217;t wait for both Tony and Reed&#8217;s stories!Off to read some more books from this set!

$REVIEW.: As a mom I struggle with being what I think a good mom should be and what the Lord wants me to be, and I think other moms can relate to that feeling &#8211; we want to always be patient but in the end we end up yelling or losing our cool and then feel like failures.  In eleven short chapters Sue Detweiler takes moms through 9 traits that will help us in using God&#8217;s personality in how we relate to our children &#8211; love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, the other two chapters discuss how to become a life-giving mom and also how we can give life (it&#8217;s not just about labor and delivery of a baby).  We all have issues, even if we feel that we had a perfect child hood, and we can all use help especially if that help comes from the Lord.  Each chapter begins with a poem (it&#8217;s probably not technically a poem but it&#8217;s what my mind keeps saying) that deals with that chapter&#8217;s trait and each chapter ends with a prayer for that trait &#8211; which is great if you struggle with what or how to pray.  The written prayers are available on Sue Detweiler&#8217;s website as are videos, follow her YouTube link, for each chapter &#8211; for free.  They can also be accessed using the QR code in the book if you have a QR reader &#8211; which I do not so I had to go through the website to YouTube.Oftentimes life gets in the way of giving life and I think the chapter that spoke the most to me was chapter 3, titled &#8220;Replacing My Sadness with God&#8217;s Joy&#8221;, there has been much sadness in my life over the last few months and honestly that can make being there as a good mom, hard.  Maybe you don&#8217;t react to sadness over things maybe your more anxious about life events, or frustrated (I&#8217;ve experienced this alongside sadness too), or maybe you&#8217;ve learned to be prideful or a manipulator &#8211; if you&#8217;re ready to come to the Lord and give it all to Him &#8211; then this book is a step in the right direction &#8211; it&#8217;s not an easy book or one that will coddle you &#8211; it&#8217;s hard hitting.  You need to be at that place where you&#8217;re ready to surrender you, all of you, to the Lord and allow Him to work on you and become manifest in your life.  After the last chapter you&#8217;ll find the study guide section, what type of book would this be if you could just read it and forget it?The study guide gives Scripture and stories from real moms, like Ann Voskamp, Sarah Mae Hoover, and others, who struggled and still do at times (none of us will be perfect and without struggles this side of Heaven) so we know we&#8217;re not alone both in the eyes of God and as members of an elite club called Motherhood.  The reflection questions are much like the chapters &#8211; hard hitting and get down to the nitty-gritty of how to be a life-giving mom.  You&#8217;ll be going back to the chapters as you work through the questions and you&#8217;ll be seeking out verses in your Bible, the best instruction manual, as you seek to be a better mom through Christ.  If you&#8217;d like to use this as part of a group there are also group discussion questions that can be used as well as the reflection questions, which can be done at home to be shared and the group discussion can have a more open and honest group chat about what was learned.  I enjoyed the overall fact that while Sue gives us examples from her life and from others that the go-to source for her is God&#8217;s Word, while we can also use examples of others, Scripture is where we need to be focused.**I was given a copy of this e-book from Christian Women Affiliate in exchange for my honest opinion, no other compensation was given

$REVIEW.: This book is a great analysis of worldview from a fresh perspective, challenging those of us who are weary of ten-point presentations on how to think and act in the world. Mr. Bertrand's observations prompt the reader to carefully consider their worldview, and think independently from the status quo. With its sound theological foundation and classic critical thinking methods, this book would be a good resource for classes or seminars as well as for interested independent readers looking for a modern, unique perspective built on a traditional base. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: The book has a fairly thorough set of instructions for adjusting store bought sewing patterns for pants based upon variations in waist size, hip width, etc. The text is illustrated with photographs. While the style of some of the pants may be a little are out of date, that is less an issue than one might imagine since the fundamentals of sewing endure. (Were the pants with a tall elastic gathered waistband and wide legs fashionable in 1998 when the book was published?) The sewing instructions begin with cutting directions and conclude with hemming options. If one were a beginner this might be very useful.

$review_text.: The 2012 presidential election in the United States was a fascinating event, especially the activities that selected the Republican nominee. There were endless debates involving a seemingly endless cast of candidates, some of which edged very close to the bizarre. No one who watched it can forget the Herman Cain chant of "9-9-9", Rick Perry seeming clueless to the point that he said "Oops" on national television, Mitt Romney's devastating description of the "47%" and Clint Eastwood on stage talking to a chair during the Republican National Convention.As depicts the one-sidedness regarding the amount of news generated by the parties during the run-up to the election, most of this book is devoted to what happened on the Republican side. As was the case with their book about the 2008 election "Game Change" the authors provide you with many of the inner details of what took place inside the campaigns as well as the actions of many of the powers behind the scenes. In the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizen's United ruling, presidential campaigns are now billion-dollar operations, requiring massive amounts of money being donated. A great deal of that was done in (semi-)secret meetings, where the big donors demanded anonymity, much of which is revealed by Halperin and Heilemann.Without question, the most interesting section of the book is the discussion of the Romney campaign's vetting of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Their conclusion that there was too much negative baggage around Christie clearly has major significance for his political future. The general nature of this baggage has been discussed on the network news shows and was one of the major carrots that led me to buy and read this book.While the outer wrappings of the political campaigns for president in 2012 is all old news, the look inside is of course new and very interesting. It also has many implications for the next campaign, which started the day after these two ended. By analyzing what worked and what did not, political operatives are plotting the next round of presidential elections. Furthermore, even non-prudes will be surprised at how many times the "f-word" is used by politicians and the people that work to get them elected.  This is a great book and one that no doubt contains many accurate pointers to future activity.

$review_text.: OK, so where do I begin&#8230; Let&#8217;s start with the timeline&#8230; I started this book at 11:45pm on Saturday night. (I know what you are thinking&#8230; Ms. Popular, well what can I say Books before Bros.) I finished this book at  2 pm Sunday afternoon. So subtract the 5(ish) hours of sleep and that just goes to show you how amazing this story is. The writing was amazing with the perfect mix of romance, action and suspense. The story jumps from perspective to perspective giving the reader a well rounded view of the story. Each character is expertly developed with their own idiosyncrasies that just add to the fun of the story.  There are twists and turns you don&#8217;t expect and romances you can&#8217;t help but cheer on.The author does an amazing job creating a traditional Fae environment filled with mythical creatures and some new ones too. Not only are the main characters lovable but Jessie does an impeccable job of making you absolutely despise the villains (yea, thats right. plural). I cannot wait until I finish book 2 in the Star Series The Frozen Star releasing May 29, 2014.

But soon enough it became totally different with its own world, characters and uniqueness.It&#8217;s the year 3035, corporations rule the world and the majority is oppressed. Everything is merchandised, the earth, the air, the water, the woods&#8230;Ellie is the beautiful Governor Callum&#8217;s daughter. She lives in a privileged world were appearances are of the utmost importance to ascertain its position and power. She is engaged to Edmund, her father future heir.Whereas Ellie comes from money, Jared is from the poorest parts of district 8. At 27 and with his father taken away, he has to provide for his family. Governor Callum helped with in the arrest of his father and Jared&#8217;s hate for the Callums runs deep in his heart. He is bitter, dead set against the Corporations and its iron fist. Every day undernourished children die under his eyes. &#34;There  is nothing bad with rules if they&#8217;re meant to help you. Their rules though, are made to enslave us.&#34;When he meets Ellie, he is instantly drawn to her even knowing she is the enemy. They fight hard but they can&#8217;t forget each other.  Jared is obsessed with her : &#34;The instant she had touched him, his soul had recognized her as being a part of him. And now he felt like an invalid, clinging to life, desperate to live because she had become as vital to him as air.&#34;And Ellie does not fare better as she thinks constantly about their encounter : &#34;She blushed a the mere thought of how she had longed for him to wantonly possess her.&#34;But Ellie and Jared come from two different worlds. She is unattainable to him and engaged to another.  Jared despair grows even more when he discovers he is a chimera.  How could she accept a freak? He is desperate and has a hard time coming to term with his new identity. &#34;I live scared each day that I will slowly grow into an animal. That I will forget what it is like to be a man.&#34;Even when Jared will accept to become the rebellion&#8217;s secret weapon, The Winged Archer, he&#8217;ll still struggle with the role he has to play as he would have to put aside his love for Ellie. He did not see how she could love a beast but he still nurtured the secret hope they could end together somehow.&#34;He understood the importance of freedom&#8230;But he was no martyr. He had not chosen his fate. In fact, he was doing his damnedest to live to his best. Why should he have to be so sacrificial? To surrender the one thing he has begun to love.&#34;I won&#8217;t go any further in the plot, you&#8217;ll have to discover by yourself if they&#8217;ll be together, if the rebellion will grow,&#8230;I liked the idea of a chimera in a book, it&#8217;s a nice change from the vampires, shapeshifters and angels I usually read about.I also did enjoy Ellie&#8217;s determination. Hesitant at first, she&#8217;ll emerge like a chrysalis to unfurl her own wings, take risks and make a difference. She&#8217;ll fight for a better world too because :&#34;Fairness is not an attitude you carry proudly. It&#8217;s a skill that&#8217;s meant to be executed and exercised in order for it to manifest.&#34;This book is original, interesting with a balance between the power struggle and the romance.

$REVIEW.: Jared comes from a dysfunctional house. His mother is an alcoholic and his dad left when he was little.When Jared is 10- a new family moves next door to him, bringing a vivacious girl, Tatum (tate) into his life.They immediately bond and become best friends. They come to love each other and begin to fall in love.At age 14, Jared goes away one summer to visit his father for the first time - he returns a completely changed boy.He spends the next two years tormenting and bullying Tate.Tate goes away for a year for school in France. She returns a much stronger girl. She resolves to fight Jared and not put up with his bullying anymore.This book is completely from Jared's POV. The first book, Bully is from Tate's POV.Even though this book can be read as a standalone - you should really read Bully first.This book is not just the flip side of the same story. It's different, deep and incredibly satisfying.The author writes a great story. Jared's character is complex, but interesting. You want Jared to get his HEA. He needs it. He is a lost boy that doesn't believe he is good enough for Tate. He is is no way a perfect kid. He truly is mean to Tate. He fights. He sleeps around. He drinks. He disrespects adults.So how does this anti-hero become the hero? Read to find out.The HEA is wonderful at the end. It's not a 'wrapped in a bow' type of ending. You know that there are issues still needed to be worked on - what happens after graduation? What about Jared's dad? What about Jared's brother? Jared's best friend also seems to be lost as well. Many lose ends, but not enough to make you feel like you don't get enough closure for this book.There are a few steamy sex scenes, but it's not a central aspect of this book.Some people may not like how Tate puts up with Jared's cruelty. I think the author does a good job delving into their childhood years (ages 10-14) to show how strong of a friendship that they had. They were inseparable. They had a unique bond. Tate losing her mother, being raised by her father. Jared basically raising himself, Tate being the foundation of love and understanding that he doesn't have anywhere else. Unconditional love - that begins as innocent children, blooming to teenage love.They are young. The book ends with them as 18 year olds. So very young, but they have had to grow up quickly.It will be interesting to read the author's next book to see how their relationship progresses.The author does such a great job giving the reader insight into Jared's feelings and reasons for the things that he does. This poor kid has been through so much. He does make several mistakes along the way. But Tate brings out the best in him, helps assuage his angry and need to push good things away.It was a bit angst-y, but tolerable. They don't sit around feeling sorry for themselves. There is sadness and pain at times, but no spiraling of negative feelings; no major misunderstanding; no weepy female heroines. I enjoying reading how Jared was able to overcome his negative feelings about himself, to find himself back to Tate.This book was a wonderful read.It was sweet, a bit angst-y, sexy and interesting book.I highly recommend reading this (please read Bully first, though).Enjoy.

$review_text.: If you're a progressive, liberal, moderate or even a "thinking" conservative and want to feast on some lurid details of the train wreck of Michelle Bachmann's political career, don't waste your time with this book. The author trashes progressive politicians like Hillary Clinton and Al Franken with the thoughtfulness of a Todd Akin. I guarantee it will be hard for you to wade through it. The writing would be lucky to get a "D" in Freshman English. It is juvenile, borderline illiterate and is filled with the kind of logic and anti-intellectual thinking that you should expect from someone who could have believed in Bachmann in the first place.

However, there was some great sex in this book so don't go thinkin' this is a rated &#34;G&#34; book. And there was sexual tension all through it, which made it even better. I do hate when authors don't have any passion or sexual feelings then BAM there's sex.I really liked Rhiannon and Beltran but I don't know if I'll read the next book. We'll see..

$REVIEW.: Shannon Hale delivers again! I love how Shannon can switch between the beautiful, imaginative tales of her YA books to lighthearted, funny adult romances. Not many authors can write in two completely different tones so masterfully. I loved the characters in Midnight at Austenland and in fact, liked the entire book better than the first Austenland. The added suspense made this book hard to put down, and the men were sigh-worthy. I'm hoping this book will get optioned for a movie as well!

$review_text.: I loved the first book and equally enjoyed this one...I'm glad for once to end a book with such a happy ending. I just learned that the author is only 20 yrs old which is probably the reason for so many typos. With that said, I'm impressed that the author being young in all could produce a book that peaks the interest of a 40 yr old...good job! Overall, the story is very simple, and the author does not go in depth as she introduces other characters as well as his/her bio. But the author is still young and with time and experience the author will grow. Good job Leondra, no doubt you will be successful!

$REVIEW.: The Author of this book it a little long winded


 There are issues that are brought up over and over to the point of redundancy
 I have found in some points the introspective narrative to be nearly identical to text previously in the novel.This book continues the story started and well written in the first installment


 This particular addition was a little slower than the first book

 The end was inevitable and easy to foresee, but it was still entertaining to read and arrive at the final point.I am very concerned that this book will turn away from the fantasy driven flow and point itself to a overly religious/political bore of a book (as R.A
Salvatore did with his DemonWar Saga).In general it was a rather long-winded but interesting second installment

 I would recommend to a friend, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list
 I will however read the third, whenever it arrives

$review_text.: Jack Kenney and his brother Jeremy are brought in for questioning by the FBI in the death of Jeremy's professor and mentor after Jack was the last one to see him alive in the hospital after the professor was brutally beaten


Along with being questioned for the murder, Jack is asked questions surrounding the strange happenings in the small Alabama town in which he lived as a child
Jack and his brother were raised by their Grandfather after their parents had disappeared when Jack was just a baby during what the towns people called The Season


Jack, having found a talisman when he was young which marked him as a chosen one to enter the world of Genovene and her villagers who are the cause of many strange disappearances in the area for centuries


The ensuing story brings back many horrible nightmares as Jack tells his almost unbelievable tale to the agent who takes over the investigation and who also had an experience in his past similar to Jack's.The Forgotten Eden is one of those stories that you think you have figured out only to find...you were wrong about what was going to happen
I am a fan of Aiden James and the way his writing is so detailed and intriguing

The Forgotten Eden is a mixture of supernatural and mystery and will have you wondering until the end! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a really good book to sit enjoy.

$REVIEW.: &#8220;Live each day being the reason someone smiled, the inspiration for someone to fight, the strength for someone to heal.&#8221; By the time I read that line spoken by one of the characters in Circle in the Sand, I was completely captured by the story of four friends so different and yet so perfectly linked. Three women and one man, each takes their separate journey, yet they are never more than an emotional heart-beat apart.I enjoyed the eccentricities that bound these friends together. Small things like passing page-worn classic books back and forth over the years, each friend making notes in the margins in different colored ink. Short notes reflecting their emotional responses to the book at that particular time in their lives. A very engaging quirk.It took me a few chapters to get comfortable with the changes in the characters&#8217; POV but once I got with the rhythm I enjoyed it immensely.Author Lia Fairchild takes the reader on a journey from longing to terror and back. This is an honest story about love and friendship and how it continues to change and grow throughout our lives.I received a copy of this novel as an Advance Reader Copy in return for an honest review.

$review_text.: My Review:I was sucked into this book from the prologue. It captured my attention immediately and I couldn't put it down after that.  This book starts out with Cassandra coming home and finding that her boyfriend is home...but he's not alone. They share a house together. Her friend Hilary, tells it's probably nothing, he may have just been sick, but Cassandra knows that jeep parked in her drive-way, and the reputation of the girl who drives it. Against her better judgement, she goes into the house. When she realizes her worst fears are true, she leaves the house, never to return again. She moves into her grandparents house which was a childhood home for her. She has focused on school and left men alone. Determined to get a teaching job. An entire year goes by and she's out jogging with her friend Hilary, (I absolutely love her) almost getting run down by a moving truck, she notices that the house next door has sold. Between wondering who would want to spend that much money on the mansion just to live in Harmony, and the fact that she won't be able to use the pool anymore since their are new owners she shrugs it off. That's until she sees the Super Hot Sexy Irresistibly handsome man standing on the porch! Delicious.Logan West, has everything going for him. He's rich, has a beautiful sister who loves him to death and an amazing little boy that looks up to his daddy. The only thing missing his Oliver's mother. Logan, is the player of all players. Not wanting to settle down, he uses sex as an escape. Never spending more than one night usually with a woman or two. So when he lays on Cassandra, he knows he has to have her. But she's not like any other woman he's met. For one, she's not throwing herself at him. And she actually acts like she wants nothing do with him. He's determined to change that pretty little mind of her. Oliver, the cutest four-year-old ever, ends up playing in Cassandra's child hood tree house and the two quickly strike up a friendship. Julia, Logan's younger sister, warns Cassandra of her brother and tell's her to stay away. At least she seem's super nice and is easily lovable. Cassandra and Logan, eventually can't help but to run into each other...A lot. Cassandra is looking for a long term relationship but Logan has made it obvious he is not. These two quickly strike up a wonderful friendship, all thanks to Oliver. So what happens when both their pasts show up full force and drama and tension is brought into the mix? Well you will have to read to find out. I will tell you that it is a Cliff Hanger ending and I for one, hate Cliff hangers. But this one was so perfect. All cliff hanger endings should take note from Angela Graham, because she definitely knows how to really leave you wanting more. Watching Cassandra go from being shy and reserved to gaining so much confidence is so amazing. Hint: Pool dance for Logan! It was fun and had me smiling.This book was very enjoyable for me. Watching the characters grow in their own way. Seeing a friendship blossom. You even see Hilary come out of her shell. I connected with Cassandra on an emotional level. Not to mention, the sexual tension is through the Roof! You will definitely need a cold glass of water while reading this Hot Book! Angela Graham has an amazing talent. She really let's you feel what is going on and her writing is fantastic. When I was done I actually sent her a message personally thanking her for a job well done. I loved it. So definitely go check this book out!I give this book 5 Amazing Hot Stars! It deserves no less.

They were all thrilled with the book, and they're excited to fill it out.  I can't wait until we get them back this Christmas.  It's a great idea for passing along information from one generation to another.  We live overseas, and our kids only see their grandparents every-other year, or sooner if they come over to see us.  I never knew my grandparents, and I wish I had something like this, sharing their lives with me.

$review_text.: I think it's been a while since I've read such a sweet honest young adult contemporary romance. My smile didn't leave my face from the moment I finished the first page.Brooklynn has known since she was five years old that she would become a fashion designer. Unfortunately some bullying from on Grayson Banks and a total lack of support on the homefront might have dented her self confidence a bit. She still designs and makes clothes, she just stopped wearing them.Now it's senior year and things are about to become real. Brooklynn is still very much set on pursuing her dream, even if that means having to fight with her dad over college every single day. When her childhood nemesis returns, Brooklynn feels like the world is out to get her. After some time she does realises Grayson isn't the same boy as four years ago.Grayson knows he's made some stupid mistakes back then and after apologising to her several times, he suggest he helps her chase her dream. Brooklynn agrees, but she is still doubtful. Slowly though she gets to know him again and trying all she wants, she can not deny the pull she feels towards him.It was so easy to relate to Brooklyn. She is still trying to figure out who she is, who she wants, and all the while trying to survive high school. Brooklynn knows what she wants to do, achieving her dream unfortunately wasn't that easy.The BFF's in this book were awesome. They were really cool and always so supportive of Brooklynn. Adding that note of humor really made it complete.I liked the growing relationship between Brooklynn and Grayson. The guy had to work for it, but it was all worth it. No instant love here, but a friendship tentatively growing into romance.Falling by Design was such a fun read. It has great characters, an amazing romance and enough drama to keep things interesting.*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: This book has potential, but fell flat for me. The cover is intriguing and of much higher quality than what is usually seen in the indie market, &#8211; but a cover alone can&#8217;t support a story. (Still, kudos on the cover.)The characters lack almost all meaningful characterization. At first I thought the author was going for an objective third person point of view, but he&#8217;ll occasionally hop into characters heads, so that&#8217;s obviously not what he&#8217;s going for. Or at least, not consistently. Granted, I like what I got of the main character. She&#8217;s powerful and carries the story almost entirely by herself, even if her emotions remain at a constant throughout.The formatting is a distraction. The most glaring thing is that there are no quotation marks in the book. I understand this might&#8217;ve been a stylistic choice, but it&#8217;s a confusing and unnecessary one, making it difficult to separate out action and dialogue. No book benefits from not having quotation marks. However, they can easily suffer without them.The plot lacked conflict for the first 80% of the book.The writing has promise, but is bogged down by excessive description. (One might want to look at Chapter 4: Proportion in Self-Editing for Fiction Writers. It&#8217;s a gold mine of information.) Even the dramatic scenes suffer from this, stealing the appropriate &#8220;oomf&#8221; and punch from them that&#8217;d really make them pop.Free the writing of unnecessary sentences/paragraphs, format it according to what&#8217;s standard, add in more conflict and tension throughout, and give the cast true characterization, and this book would jump right off the page. As it currently stands, it gets 2 stars from me.Best of luck to the author in his future work.

$REVIEW.: Tempting The Beast is the first in the Breed series. The first three quarters of the book I was very disappointed by the story. The plot seemed thin. I personally don't mind a far-fetched plot line (this is the fantasy genre) when it's well and strongly done. That was missing at the beginning of the book. It seemed that this book was over-edited. There were times when passages seemed to be missing that would have added to the flow and continuity of the story and conversations between the characters. There were times I turned back a page because the conversation seemed to jump ahead with out real warning. A little more detail could have made this smoother.Merinus was also one of the most annoying leading ladies I have ever had to suffer through. It seemed both she and the author were confused as to who she really was. I honestly get tired of authors creating great alpha males and then trying to come up with an equally strong counterpart for them who comes off as a strubborn, irrational, screaming shrew an is no where near the males equal in anyway. Stubbornnes is not a writing shortcut for strength and a woman's smart-aleck response does not necessrily put them on equal footing or put the man in his place.There is the attempt to portray Merinua as a hard-as-nails chick. A strong woman more than equal to Callan (an alpha male), but the only sign of that inner strength was her foul mouth. When she attempted to stand up for herself it was not on her own two feet but her brother's brawn. I lost count of how much time she spent crying. She did not seem smart enough or mature enough to handle the assignment of reaching out to Callan on behalf of the family news business. For the first three quarters of the book she was more like a spoiled princess threatening to have her brothers beat Callan up. She was almost enough to put the book down...Except there was Callan, strong alpha male that he was. He made the first three quarters of the book readable for me. He on the other hand was smart and it was easy to understand where he was coming from.The book really starts to pick up in the last 60 pages with the action and Merinus suddenly joins adulthood in her maturity level (although when that finally happened I wondered what was the point of all the complaining in the first half of the book?) The plot pulls together for a strong ending that makes you want to pick up the other books. This book could probably have stood for another 50 or more pages to firm up the plot through the beginning of the book.Overall becuase of a great alpha male and a strong ending I would rate this book as a 3.5 and I'll acutally put the next book on my to read list.Warning: This book is more than steamy, it's graphic if you are prone to blush at all, you may want to skip it as there are a lot of sex scene's.

He is able to come to terms with who he is and with his part in the tragedy that takes place. It is a quick read that is at times hard to believe, but overall acceptable.

$REVIEW.: Eternal Hope is the second book in The Hope series by Frankie Rose. The story picks up a few weeks from the end of Sovereign Hope. Starting out in LA, Farley and company take a detour to Montana to search for their missing friends and then come full circle, landing back in LA. This installment is just as addictive as the first.The conflict from Sovereign Hope has morphed and splintered into several new and even more complicated troubles. Everyone Farley knows is weighted down with some burden, whether it's personal or it affects everyone. We see how Farley and Daniel are handling these new crises; it's a tight rope walk of suspense and anxiety. I literally had NO fingernails left by the time I finished this book.Gripping and emotionally charged, this tale was sometimes terrifying and yet hilarious at other points. Jam packed full of action, suspense and smoldering romance, this novel is extremely well written. The twists will make you gasp out loud and break your heart all while keeping you riveted to the narrative unfolding before you. It is like being on a roller coaster with a blindfold so you can't see the dips and drops coming; there is nothing predictable about this book.I love these characters. Farley is as impressive as ever, evolving as she tries to adapt to her ever-changing life. Daniel is just as focused on protecting her from anything that could take her away from him. I really enjoyed learning more about Kayden; he's a hugely intriguing character and we find out more about his troubled history with Daniel. Frankie Rose has created these wonderfully real characters who you simply want to know and have around in your life.I think one of my very favorite things about Farley is she never moans "Why me?" and she doesn't shrink away from her reality, no matter how dicey it gets. She does her best to roll with the changes and she NEVER gives up. We definitely need more heroines like her in the YA universe.Frankie Rose has crafted a highly addictive series and I cannot wait to get my hands on the final installment in this trilogy.~Mel

$REVIEW.: What an awe-inspiring novel that presents real life young adult situations!  As a beta reader for this novel and high school teacher, I was immediately sucked into the storyline.  Both Alissa and Kat are very well-developed characters and genuine in their actions, and Dillon, well, I definitely want to read more about him.  This novel touches on true issues facing many young adults today. It is worth the read no matter your age.  I am anxiously awaiting the next installment because I know Ms. Stone won't disappoint.
$SUMMARY.: Wonderful YA Read!

$review_text.: I'm also cold war era kid. My grandmother cried when Regan was elected, positive that he would, "Push the Button". We lived in the projects and our family was far from wealthy, but, between my father (Sensei), grand dad (Hunter), and great grand dad (World War I I Vet) my brother and I were taught a wide variety of survival and self defense techniques. (Lots of time in the woods. See. If your using a bow and arrows with fishing line then the only real expense is gas.)And yes, with all of the adults panicking and the news with gas prices and the "Twilight Zone " episode with the guy that can stop time for a small amount of time only to see a nuclear bomb hanging right over his neighborhood. I also had my own version of that cleansing hand as a child. What's wrong with a little hope?...

$review_text.: I absolutely love Dray! He's had such a rough life and has the worst luck, but with Cassie by his side, I'm sure everything will be good.Cassie left for an internship at the end of Clutch, and in doing so, both her heart and Dray's were broken. He refused to ask her stay because he didn't want to be the reason she didn't follow her dreams. They both struggled and are miserable because of this. She ends of taking a job in New York and moves for good. Both want each other, but he won't be the reason for her giving up and she won't stay unless he asks. I really was annoyed at Cassie. It was so obvious what Dray was doing, and she wasn't happy in New York. But when she finds out Dray is in trouble in Mexico, she can't stay away. She has to help him.Dray pulled hard at my heartstrings. I felt so bad for him and wanted him happy. These two had to be together for either to feel complete. We get both POVs and its always great getting into the heads of both the main characters so you get both of their feelings.I'm looking forward to reading Barrett's story. He's such a player, but now he's wanting to settle down. I have a feeling whichever girl accomplishes this, will be great to read about.

$review_text.: Will contain spoilers:::::::::I think the story had potential, and I really liked the cancer part, but I had this idea that it would be a sweet story with a girl, that can't remember her earlier boyfriend, and he will try through out the whole book to make her remember him with telling and showing her memories from their past......... it just wasn't. It was kind of an insta-love story with memory loss. Meaning in my head; within the first three chapters you are told the couple are so meant for each other (without them really speaking together) and within a day they have sex, and their conversations afterwards only consists of cheesy words. I know that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be a story you wouldn't love - but I think I have reached a point now, where I can say - insta-love just don't do it for me.The story starts with Evelyn, a 20 years old girl that just have survived brain cancer, just about to start on college, you hear her first evening when she is moving into her room that she shares with Adella. After ten minutes she decides that this girl is her BFF (they speak like ten words together) and they go to this bar to see a band playing. She meets the band, and discover that two of the boys in the band already know her, but she doesn't remember them. One of them are our hero Tristan. He has been hurting over this girl for years, and won't let her go again - and she just want to remember the four years of her life that she have lost during her cancer.The same night she is at his house to see videos from their past, they kiss, the next morning they have sex.The relationship between the two main characters feels very rushed, I would have wished that she at least would remember something from their time together, before something romantic happened between them, and not react on the fact that she saw a video with her 14 self loving this boy. It might have been special then between them, but both are adults now and have experienced things that should/could have changed them, and........ well it could just have been nice that they had known each other more than 12 hours. Giving me some story, so that I could follow too they had an connection other than just from the memories on the video.It annoyed me when the word infinity and crazy-ass beautiful girl was repeated for every ten lines. That was pretty much the only thing they told each other all the time. There are no deep conversations, that could have helped me to see that what they have is not re-living the dream of what they had as teenagers.Being told they are so infinity didn't really convince me.There were some other things that annoyed me a bit through out the book - some was the kind of things she couldn't remember. I can understand that she can't remember memories, or where the wine opener is, but her personality and things she normally do shouldn't be something she can't remember. Example; before cancer she is sassy of nature, but the first time she says a swear word she hold her mouth and tell like the church girl she is "I never swear". She always have loved to drink juice from the container, but that's a thing she can't remember either. She did still live through those 4 years with cancer, right?There were things that seemed unrealistic to me.And then there is a MEGA SPOILER here:::::::::And then there is this whole thing with her mom being the villian.Tristan and Evelyn lose contact after Evelyn is diagnosed with cancer, instead of telling her friends and Tristan what is going on (she knows that she quite sure will lose some of her memory at that time) she cut the connection to her friends herself, and let her mom do the telling for her. But what her mom do is not telling anybody, and forge her daughter's name to make sure she will get an abortion, before her surgery.I must honestly say that I hated that there needed to be a villian, when her actions could have been explained otherwise. Evelyn's reason for not telling Tristan is because she knows he will say "do as the doctors and parents tell you". The doctor tell her that with all the cancer treatment she will receive the outcome of her pregnancy will not be good - but 5 years after she is pissed at her mom for not making her keep the baby. Didn't she hear what the doctor said? You don't worry about an another humans life? Selfish really.And I really disliked that Evelyn (and everybody else really) blamed her mom that Tristan and Evelyn had been kept apart (I blame Evelyn myself, She knew she would lose her memory. Man up and tell people will you. It's just as hard for relatives, as it is for her) Cancer is a serious business, and that in itself would have been villian enough for me.But no - her mom is just one vicious bitch that dont like Tristan.It was an okay story, the cancer part was well written, and what made me want to read it to the end, but the rest of the story - the love story - wasn't what I had expected.
$SUMMARY.: Cancer part was well written and what kept me going, but the build up of the love story wasn't what I had expected

$review_text.: As the Father of a wildly imaginative three-year-old Boy, I totally get what's going on in the mind of seven-year-old AXE COP creator Malachai Nicolle


The wildly outrageous stream-of-consciousness adventures of an axe-wielding, gleefully murderous Cop, as interpreted and illustrated by Malachai's big Brother, Ethan, are just crazy enough to bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded comic-book reader


I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you that I laughed out loud, on many occasions, when reading AXE COP, VOLUME 3
That said, I do feel that the AXE COP premise works best in small doses....after 160 pages of AXE COP, there tends to be a sameness to each page
I'm not overly fond of the actual stories that the Brothers cook up, but I love the "Ask Axe Cop" pages

By all means, pick up a copy, just don't read it in one sitting.

$review_text.: This was one of the first &#34;superhero prose&#34; books I read, and I absolutely loved it.  A solid story, with enough world-building backstory to make me wish this was part of a larger series, so that I could read more about the characters.  At times it gets a little juvenile when discussing sex, but I think that's deliberate since the book is narrated by a character who went from a normal 16 year-old to a superhero and never had a chance to finish growing up, at least not in a normal way.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Jenny Twist's Take One at Bedtime is an anthology of short tales ranging from romantic to horrific. I'd recommend it for anyone who loves easy-to-read short stories.In fact, for many of the stories, I took Dr. Twist's advice and read one (sometimes two or three on a good night) while I rested in my bed. They're the perfect length for a quick tale before you turn out the light, or during your lunch break, or when you're in a waiting room, or riding on the bus...I think you get my drift.Most of these stories are set in England or Spain, and Ms. Twist employs her knowledge of both locales very well. The settings and personalities  really come to life with her vivid language. Every story begins in a way that pulls the reader in and brings you to a conclusion you usually don't expect. Each tale is unique and paced nicely. I enjoyed them all and was sad when I reached the last page. I think you'll see what I mean when you buy your copy.
$SUMMARY.: Before you turn out the light, these tales are just right!

Jen has loved Stefan forever. Stefan, well you'll have to read to find out how he really feels. While I fell in love with Stefan, who is the perfect alpha male, it was Jen's strength that really drew me into the story. I was a little concerned when I started the book that I wasn't getting enough of the backstory to really connect with the characters and feel their emotions, but as the story continued, everything fell into place and I felt every emotion they went through. This is a story with a great romance, fantastic supporting characters and a book that I will definitely be recommending to others! Can't wait to read what this author writes next!

$review_text.: Being a paranormal romance author, all I can say about this novel is, &#34;what a read!&#34;I was browsing around looking for a rather unique kind of fiction and noticed this book, &#34;See You In Hell.&#34; The title and cover captured my attention immediately. Although, the title and cover are nice, but in order to qualify as a good book to read, in my opinion, are quotes or sentences worth discussing. Here is one good sentence, &#34;So once again, welcome to HELL!&#34;... This sentence really made me realized that I am going to like this story. Unique setting and original erotic scenes.The novel is a modern paranormal dark fiction sprinkled with some romantic moments between Mel and other &#34;demons.&#34; Most of the scenes happened at the office since Mel is an intern there. There are some erotic moments between her and the CEO, Luce. In order not to give away too much, I would urge you to read it now.The main character is none other than Mel. She is an intern, adorable, pretty, and determine to bring down Lucifer that is on the verge to bring Hell on Earth. She is also soft hearted to demons as she has an angelic heart. However, sometimes, this got onto her way, and she finds it harder to fulfill her mission. The author really has a creative pen that created Mel, Luce and other characters on the story. Good job indeed.What I like most of this story is the constant erotic and sexy scenes between the characters, especially when Luce is trying to be naughty with Mel at his office. In my opinion, the author is using the moral of this story to educate that in our modern world, there are such characters around us and sometimes, it is rather difficult to differentiate the good and evil.This book is mainly for 18+ readers as it contain some sexual content. Thankfully, these erotic dialogues, scenes are moderate that any young adults can accept them. You will fall in love with the characters, especially Mel and Luce. Go and read about them to find out why I said that.If there's one thing I'd change about this book, it would be to have a more consistent plot and developing more diverse characters for the story. The idea is good, but I realized that there are too many associations with HELL. In my opinion, perhaps some scenes with the modern corporate would be adequate for the average reader. Not much issue on the plot, just my 2 cents worth comments.This book looked great on my Kindle Fire HD tablet, and has good formatting and layout.

$REVIEW.: The Ferro Family Series begins here...the characters introduced expand into Scandalous (1-2), Damaged (1-2), The Proposition (1-3), Stripped (1+) and the Secret Life of Tristan Scott (1-5) series. Some of these need to be read as you read through The Arrangement series, (now 1-14). And there is more to come for each of these except Peter and Sydney's story. I know that I love each one of these characters and the advancing stories of their relationships to come. Here is what I want to have answered....How did Aunt Connie and Lizzy become the Matriarch's of the family fortunes?What is the issue with Bryan's headaches and lethargy, possible drug addiction?Why is it that Sean, Peter and Jonathan's father, who must of at one time or other been in charge become so shallow and useless?If Connie is the one in charge of the family fortunes, she must be intelligent, driven, insightful and such.. why is she so predatory and hostile to the terrific woman that have come into the boy's lives? One would think that she and Lizzy would recognize the positive influence the strong woman have on the self-destructive natures of these boys/men.How did Jack Grey come to be someone of interest to Jonathan/Connie?What brought on the trio of loyalty in Jonathan, Tristan and Bryan?Why is it that Connie has such a strong ongoing power to manipulate and subdue the Ferro men?I would really like to see Sean and Avery get a happy ending soon.And why is that Bryan has maintained contact with Mari and Tristan has not?Love the characters and the stories that bring them together. Love that Sydney, Mel, Avery hit if off and find a common ability to enjoy some levity in such dire circumstances. Hopeful that Cassie will also be let in with this group of strong female characters.

$REVIEW.: Knight & Play - Rating:  3.5 StarsThe story of Lucien (Owner of BDSM clubs, Sex stores...all things sexy) and Sophie (married to Dan, personal assistant).  This is about a married woman whose husband, Dan, is cheating on her.  Bottomline, this is about one woman who is torn between two men, her cheating husband and a guy who she could fall in love with.  What's a girl to do?  In this book, we will not find out.  This has a cliffhanger as the stuff hits the fan.  There was lots of sexy hot scenes throughout this book.  Lucien is hot, controlling in the bedroom, but yet romantic.  Sophie is very shy and has not been exposed to many sexual adventures/enjoyments.  While this appears to be the standard love triangle, I found a few of the twists interesting.  The POV alternated between Lucien, Sophie and Dan which added to the intrigue.Why Not 5 Stars?While the sex scenes where hot, hot, hot, I would have liked a better balance with the actual story.  Perhaps more insight to the issues between Dan and Sophie, more on Lucien's backstory.  At some point, I thought OK, enough of the sex, let's move this along now.Knight & Stay -  Rating:  4 StarsThis starts at the drama with our little love triangle between Lucien, Sophie and Dan.  Book 2 focuses on the relationship between Lucien and Sophie.  As Sophie gets deeper into Lucien's fast paced world, it may be difficult for her to go back to her old vanilla life with Dan.  She knows that she can not afford to fall in love with Lucien as he's told her over and over again that he does not believe in Love.  It's rare that I like both H/h, and I did in this series.  Sophie was a strong woman who knew what she ultimately wanted and did not want.  She did not shy away from speaking her mind.  No crazy head talk either.  Her character rocked!  Every girl needs a sexy Lucien in her life.  Overall, great story and  characters!Why Not 5 Stars?When they were in Paris, at some point the story dragged and became boring to me.  I think it went on too long.  In fact, I put this book up and read another book and made myself came back to finish this.  However, when they come back from Paris, I was totally engaged in the story and could not put it down.Knight & Day - Rating:  2.5 StarsThe third, and hopefully final book in the series.  This is an extended epilogue 5 years into the future with Lucien and Sophie.  The main focus of the book is the beginning relationship between Sophie's BFF, Kara, and Lucien's newly hired club manager, Dylan.  However, there were plenty of scenes with Lucien and Sophie (thank goodness for that!).  What I initially thought was a cleaver idea for a book to continue the main couples happily ever after and mix in a new story...was not a good idea.  All of the scenes with Lucien and Sophie were excellent and kept my attention.  This was probably due to the fact that I bonded with the couple in the previous two books.  The wedding scene...AMAZING!!!  One of the best wedding scenes I have read to date.  From the start of the wedding scene to the end of the story was engaging (about 85% in).  I give thumbs up for all things Lucien and Sophie!  Let's let them walk into the sunset and enjoy their life!!Why Not 5 Stars?Dylan and Kara, I could not bond and relate to them at all.  I found myself skimming through their scenes.  There was just not enough time for me to want to cheer for the couple.  I had little interest in them.  I also did not like Kara in this book.  Her dialogue was OTT.  She was annoying and acted childish when she discovered Dylan's secret.  I hate the female character that runs and cuts off communication without getting the full story.Dylan's secret came too late in the book.  While it was interesting, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it would have come out earlier and then read how each of them dealt with it.  It all happened during the last 10% of the book and was quickly resolved.Unresolved/Open items at the end.  There were some lingering questions that I wanted resolved:  What was Justin's deal?  What did he stand to gain by ruining his brother's life?  Justin and Suzie, how could they afford to just jump on a plane and go across the country?  How did Justin find Dylan's exact location?  What happened to Justin and Suzie?  Did Justin continue to show up in Dylan's life?  Inquiring minds wanted to know!!

$REVIEW.: Jamieson offers some really good and innovative recipes at the end of this book.  They are fun to try and she even manages to make bok choy and tofu tasty.  There is no "diet" plan per se, just 8 things you need to kick, like sugar and caffeine.  The first part of the book has her and her boyfriend's nutritional journeys, and those are interesting and informative, and very representative of the kind of "you are what you eat" tales you read from other reformed adherents of the Standard American Diet.Be warned, though, much of this pastiche of medical details and alarmist nutritional info is cobbled together from less than reputable sources.  What good medical and nutritional advice she does dole out is directly taken from Andrew Weil, David Katz and other MDs or RDs who actually have studied the subject and know how to interpret medical studies.  Jamieson claims that everything in our modern life is killing us, and she joins her voice to the thousands of others in pop-culture who cry for a simpler time, a purer time, a chemical free time... which of course never really existed in this fantasy form because humans were dying of infectious diseases and cholera.  She and her ilk ignore the fact that people are living longer than ever, and now have the diseases of old age and over indulgence.This book address the over indulgence and there is NO QUESTION that you will be healthier and happier if you follow it.  But if you want more substative, and more reliable, medical and nutritional advice, you would be wiser to turn to writers like Andrew Weil, Stephen Gullo, or David Katz.  Weil has an actual 8 week eating plan that offers more guidelines and recipes than this book does, though very similar.

$REVIEW.: I got the first book free, Red Mojo Mama.  I enjoyed it so much I bought this second one.It is not a 'bad' book.For me, it was a disappointment.  It starts out with Red and Joe on a cruise.  Maybe I just don't like cruises..it just didn't ring true.  They make dear friends with two of those they are seated  with at dinner, but a third couple deserts their table for 'younger' people. ??The author wrote this book mostly in dialogue which I was disappointed about.  I like to know what the characters are doing and seeing and feeling.This woman, Red, is 39 years old and talks like a 60 year old much of the time.  She refers to people and times and experiences like a 60 year old.  She uses expressions a 30+ year old wouldn't use.I was glad when she was back in the 'trailer park' she had inherited, and I knew those people.  She brought back with her an older woman who was mistreated by her husband and she immediately has a man for the wronged wife. Those two have a dalliance, which is quite unlikely.I don't want to totally diss this book.I was just very disappointed.  I felt that the dialogue propelled me through the book much too quickly. A little more character development might have helped.But I bought it, I read it, and I will look forward to a third book by this author.Recommended ...try it.  Maybe I am wrong. I couldn't bring myself to give this book 3 stars.

$review_text.: An Amish Love contains three novellas by three different authors. All the stories involve - as you would have guessed by the title - the Amish community. The three novellas are connected in some way or the other.Ever since I read Plain Truth by Jodi Picoult, I have been fascinated by Amish culture. That was my main interest in this book.Unfortunately, I am not the right person to fully appreciate romance novels. Romance as a sub-plot doesn't bother me and I even welcome it. An Amish Love, unfortunately for me, contains three mushy romance stories. Also, there was just too much talk about God and faith - something I can't completely relate to.To be fair, An Amish Love is a quick and an easy read. It managed to hold my attention and I did manage to finish it after all. Plus, the three stories give out some great messages without getting too preachy. Though I could not connect to the characters or the stories, the situations which the protagonists find themselves in are not completely unrealistic or fairy-tale like. This is especially true in the case of "Healing Hearts" and "What the Heart Sees", where the character development was better and the situations more believable.The story that I sort of liked was "Healing Hearts" by Beth Wiseman. It's different from the usual boy meets girl romance; it involves an already married couple. Both "Healing Hearts" and "What the Heart Sees" involve strong female protagonists.If not anything else, An Amish Love did provide a greater understanding of the Amish culture. It was an okay escapist read for me, neither emotionally taxing nor having very complicated story-lines.I do not like to judge a book when I am not a part of the target audience of romance lovers. This is more like a personal opinion than a review. I am almost sure that fans of the romance genre would enjoy this, taking into account all the other reviews which are quite positive.Overall:Light, one-time read for romance fansRecommended?Only to those who like romances involving a lot of religion talk.

$review_text.: I finished the book just this morning and I got to tell you people, you are missing out if you skip over this book! The story begins with Bryn Dawson, as she begins a new but sad start at an Oregon college. Bryn is trying to move on from her past tragedies, but isn't really moving on at all until she has the "misforuntate" meeting with William. William is a new student who pretty much demanded a tour of the school, and Bryn hates everything about him. He's confident, arrogant, and surrounded by members of the opposite sex that are vying for his attention. Is William all he seems though? He may be just the person to smash down the walls around her heart whether she wants him to or not. Bryn is confused why someone like William would show any interest in her at all, but unfortunatly for Bryn, William isn't the only one who shows interest. I really feel it would be an injustice to reveal the plot of this book, but it's truly a love story through and through. It's character driven, so the supernatural elements blend in nicely but don't over power the purpose of the book. The backdrops and settings are very well written without being overly wordy. You can picture the surroundings in your head very well without the author taking 10 pages to do so, which in my opinion is a great art in and of itself. It's written for a YA audience, but I'm a 30 something and loved it! There are some small editing flaws with misplaced words or spelling but not enough to really be distracting. You will feel like you've been on a journey right alongside the characters, and grow to love Bryn and William! I am excited for Fallen Eden! Come on Summer!!!!

$REVIEW.: Description: When alpha male rancher, Raul Vega, meets innocent nursing student, Elaina Ruiz, he works hard to resist her, believing she's too young for him. Elaina finds Raul too intense and doesn't disabuse him of the notion, even though she's old enough for what he has in mind. But how long can they deny their attraction?The Good: Chance's writing has a lot of energy, which is harder to achieve than one might think. You won't get bored, and you'll keep on turning the pages. Also, this novella is a bargain at $0.99.The Bad:The Hero (Hispanic): It's a thin line between aggressive would-be lover and judgmental bully with Raul, and if you're sensitive to that line in alpha males, you might have trouble fully enjoying this story.The Heroine (white and Hispanic): When dealing with alpha males, the characterization of the heroine has to be even more on point, so that it doesn't feel like she's being completely overshadowed by a stronger personality. In this case, Elaina needs considerable character work, as her motivation is unclear and often shaky. She doesn't know what she wants from life or love, which happens all the time in real life, but in book life it's hard to give a character these traits without her coming across as wishy-washy and childish as opposed to truly conflicted.Craft: Contradiction issues. Ex. Elaina was stunned at his agreement and didn't even think to question his sincerity. He was sincere. She would bet on it. "Are you serious?" [she asked]. Basically, the character is saying she doesn't question the hero's sincerity before turning around and questioning his sincerity. There are a few contradictory turns like that.The Naughty: Sensual>Steamy.

$REVIEW.: This book started out pretty slow in my opinion but once you got into it and got to know the characters a little more it was hard to put down.Clay Powers is a UCF fighter that already has many titles under his belt

 He lives in a small town and while he's very famous he's just an average guy where the town is concerned
 He's a loner though that tends to keep to himself with the exception of his best friend (also the local Sheriff) Wyatt and Wyatt's sister Jules
 They all became friends when they were little and Clay moved in with them when Wyatt and Jules father found him living on the streets


 He's lived them ever since even though they are well off and could afford to live on their own


 The towns people tend to stay away from Clay not necessarily because they're afraid of him but because he doesn't have a very outgoing personality so to speak.When the new waitress, Melody, bought him a piece of pumpkin pie he was touched because no one ever went out of their way to be nice to him before without wanting something in return

 She had no idea that he had more money than he knew what to do with, only that he looked lonely and that he looked as though he could use a friend

 Melody was running from an abusive husband and could barely afford to feed herself and when Clay found that out it made that piece of pie even more special to him even though he HATED pumpkin pie

 Their friendship developed from there and Clay always made sure that he sat in her section and would leave her large tips, which returned, so he would then find other ways to get her more money
 Melody wasn't after his money though
 He made her feel safe for the first time in a long time and even though he was a huge guy, he was a little puppy dog when it came to her.I really enjoyed this book once it got started and the side characters, Wyatt and Jules were really good

 Jules was by far my favorite character though
 I loved her tough as nails demeanor and the fact that she was a high class lawyer that dressed to the nines but could probably beat up most of the men in town made me like her even more.One thing that I thought that could have made the book better was when Melody's ex found her

 To me it happened so fast from the time that he shows up to the time that he's taken down


 I feel that it should have been drug out a little longer so that there would be more suspense to that portion of the story.Another thing is the price, while this book was free for a limited time on Amazon which was when I picked it up, it's now back up to $5.99

 I tend to steer clear of eBooks that are over the $5.00 range because I read so many books and most only take me few hours to read


 I would love to read the rest of the series but those books are even more expensive than the first book at $7.03 and $7.49 so unless someone should loan them to me or gift them to me, I won't read them no matter how much I liked the first book

$REVIEW.: Thanks for this one, R. Cooper!  A friend insisted I read "A Boy and his Dragon" so I did that first (and loved it), but I am pretty much as enthused about this fairy/werewolf duo, Cal and Ray.This sort of supernatural fantasy romance isn't everyone's taste. Cooper's imagined world - an alternate America where all sort of supernatural creatures just exist and have been dealt with for decades (except, oddly, vampires, which Ray insists don't really exist!!!).Once you just go with that premise it's sort of marvelous. Seems that each of the books focuses on teaching the reader about the deeper truths of specific creatures. I do like me a good werewolf, and Ray Branigan is a good one. But I am just the kind of gay man who loves a sugar-infused fairy, and Cal Parker is awesome. Wings aside, they seem to be my type.The sexual repression and yearning fairly buzzes off the page, and Cooper pulls the same stunt as with the boy and his dragon - that very repression of desire and love makes the ultimate payoff amazingly intense from an emotional perspective. Cooper also infuses the narrative, which is wrapped around a peculiar murder mystery with its own complications, with wonderfully imagined cultural history about these magical creatures, exposing stereotypes and false myths that misinform and confuse the characters.That said, the lavish description of scents and smells, which of course the werewolf is very tuned to, play a significant role in this book, almost a character in itself. I can find the standard "scent of love" used in many m/m novels to be irritating and over-calculated; but in R. Cooper's sparkly pen, the very over-the-topness of smell descriptions adds to the slightly halucinogenic quality (then again, it could have been the Nyquil...). Not for everyone, but very much for me.

$REVIEW.: A paraplegic girl who metes out violent assskickings...You wanna talk about a comic book that people have been sleeping on, then you must talk about THE SWORD by the Luna Brothers


Folks often are pretty free with slinging around adjectives like "jaw-dropping" and "mind-blowing," and, sure, I've done it, too

But let me say with all sincerity and with utmost unexaggeration that THE SWORD is absolutely jaw-dropping and mind-blowing and one of the most stunning comic books I have read ever

Yeah, it's like that.The Luna Brothers believe in finite storytelling


They craft narratives with a clear beginning, a middle, and an end, and this so far has resulted in three fantastic series (Ultra: Seven Days,Girls: The Complete Collection Deluxe Hardcover, and THE SWORD) that resonate more so than the average ongoing comic book

Because ongoing titles, even with the occasional epic story arc, tend to reset to a kind of status quo and you do end up losing that sense of immediacy

With THE SWORD, the Lunas tell a story that spans twenty-four issues, and when it's over, it's over.THE SWORD Vol


4: AIR reprints the final six issues and, to a lesser extent, the reading of these last issues evoke a feeling similar to when I started reading the last Harry Potter novel, knowing there wouldn't be any more after the reading
To recap what's gone on before in THE SWORD: Dara Brighton was a 21-year-old paraplegic and a college art student until all of that lost meaning
A home invasion that ended with her family massacred

Three immortal demi-god siblings with control over the elements having done the killings

A mystical 4000-year-old sword, the only instrument capable of slaying these demi-gods

And Dara Brighton became a vessel of vengeance and rage.After surviving epic battles against Zakros, who could harness tidal waves, and Knossos, who could merge with mountains, Dara embarks on the final leg of her revenge tour
In this fourth volume, Dara faces off with the deadliest of the siblings, Malia, who reigns sovereign over air


But Malia is craftier than her brothers

Down the long years, she's studied humanity


In her day job, Malia is a psychoanalyst, and a perceptive one


Whereas, against Zakros and Knossos, Dara had only faced raw power, Malia applies her keen knowledge of man to turn everyone even more against Dara.One of the neat things about this series - because I could totally see this happening - is the media frenzy which erupts around Dara and what she's been up to (Dara, single-minded as she is, doesn't bother hiding in the shadows)

What happens is that she draws spectators that number pretty much up on the global scale (thanks to YouTube and such)

Dara's unbelievable and frankly very alarming feats immediately gain prominence on the world stage, and the sensible reaction from the average bloke is awe and paranoia and apprehension

Malia's words strike at the heart of the viewer's paranoia, and with the world already leaning towards labeling Dara a straight-up villain (and remember that Dara is already on the run from the law), Malia probably doesn't even have to be that persuasive

Huge chunks of Dara's senses-shattering battles with Malia - just as with Zakros and Knossos - are caught live on film.THE SWORD combines to great effect the everyday world with the fantastic
There's an effortless flow to the story


Events unfold with this sense of inevitability, but that doesn't stop you from still getting thrown for a loop
Some stuff here will boggle your brain, some stuff here you will not see coming
Dara has progressed from being this sweet, uncomplaining girl who'd been confined to a wheelchair for the past five years to this driven, implacable person who keeps going no matter how severely she gets hurt (and she gets hurt severely and often)
The sword, as long as she maintains contact with it, lends her amazing abilities

Dara Brighton with the sword just may be the most powerful, most unstoppable person on the planet
Thanks to Joshua (and probably Jonathan) Luna's words, this series is character-driven and even the frequent flashbacks lend depth and dimension

But, holy hell, is the script ever bolstered by some spectacular action set pieces
Jonathan Luna demonstrates a strong feel for visual storytelling

His lines may seem simplistic, but take a closer glance
The man has got solid composition skills, and the action sequences are well-defined, looks amazing and, equally important, very easy to follow

He puts the blurry lines to good use.THE SWORD gets my highest recommendation


Do whatever you gotta do, but get all four volumes of it


This is one of the best alternative comic books out there, just what fits you if you're casting about for worthwhile independent storytelling (Image Comics is still independent comics, right?)


THE SWORD deserves my getting bloodied fingers from violently flipping thru the thesaurus for other words that stand for "stunning." This is the kind of stuff that, days after reading it, you'll still be haunted by some of the imagery


THE SWORD flabbergasts you with the intense, gory combat
And Dara Brighton, because she is who she is, penetrates your gut, lingers in your brain
Malia herself is a fascinating character

Some days, I just really, really love comic books.

$REVIEW.: Just 23 pages but a heartwarming story of young love. It started three years ago when two boys eyed each other across a crowd of friends and really saw each other. The younger boy acknowleded his sexuality and lived securely among accepting and caring friends and parents. The other one has a much harder life and it was sad, even for a short story, to read of the consequences when he was braved enough to be himself.

$REVIEW.: This is subtitled "The Chronicles of Hope." Let us hope that it is the one and only such "chronicle." With an irritating main character, sloppy writing, no real plot, and no conclusion, this book is a waste of money even at 99 cents

It's neither science fiction nor fantasy; just classify it as "an inane political novel." Possibly I should have given it one star, but I kept reading because I couldn't believe it would never develop any plot or any interest

I was wrong.

$SUMMARY.: Pointless, dull, and ill-written; neither science fiction nor fantasy

$review_text.: I've just started my blog and "50 Ways To Grow Your Email Marketing List" is the right book at the right time

Pamella kicks off with the "why" of email marketing and then gives the "how" - 50 ways you can put into use right away to grow your list

She's also listed these strategies under different groups: &Ouml;ptimize Opt-ins, Social Media, Online Marketing, and so on.Quick tip: Reading the table of contents gives a good overview of the 50 strategies outlined in her book.The only problem with Pamella's book is that you are likely to be overwhelmed because each idea is better than the previous one

Although there is a range of skill levels to the projects, there is a great offering, from quilts, to apparel, to accessories. The projects are fresh and fun. These days when I open up a sewing book, maybe 1 or 2 projects impresses me, but I am thoroughly impressed with not only the scope of the projects (25!), but how many of them are so appealing to me! The photography and layout is also beautiful. I studied the Marcelle pattern, since that was the one that I wanted to make, and although it's very intricate, I understood all of the instructions. I also like that this particular pattern is written in a way that makes it scrap-friendly.

$REVIEW.: In the late 19th century, in the space of fifty years or so, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Belgium carved up Africa among themselves in an orgy of violence and greed. Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness (1902) was one of the first to narrate the devastating legacy of European exploitation and colonialism. More recent studies have included Adam Hochschild's King Leopold's Ghost, and Barbara Kingsolver's novel The Poisonwood Bible, both treatments of the Congo published in 1998. With nearly a dozen important books about Africa to his credit, Martin Meredith's massive tome begins where Thomas Pakenham left off in his panoramic book, The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912 (1991).There are very few bright spots for the 880 million people who live today in Africa's 53 countries. Nelson Mandela showed what sound judgment, integrity and a conciliatory posture can accomplish. Even so, most people in South Africa remain abysmally poor, and his successor, Thabo Mbeki, defended the psychopathic dictator Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and alternately claimed that HIV did not exist or that it was a white conspiracy. Compared to South Africa, most of Africa fares far worse. With only four independent states in Africa in 1945, Meredith documents this continental disaster country by country, beginning with Ghana's independence on March 6, 1957. Conventional wisdom argues that nothing could have been worse than colonial rule. Meredith demonstrates how and why this conventional wisdom is probably false.After nearly 700 pages of meticulous research (and moving prose), Meredith finishes with a concluding chapter. Despite rhetoric about an African "renaissance," by almost every conceivable index Africa today faces complex problems of epic proportions. Fifty years after independence, its prospects, he believes, "are bleaker than ever before." As for politics and democracy, for example, "when Abdou Diouf of Senegal accepted defeat in an election in March 2000, he was only the fourth African president to do so in four decades." Half of all Africans live on less than US$1 a day. Its world trade has plummeted by half since 1980. It is the only part of the world where school enrollment is falling--40% of all Africans and 50% of African women cannot read. Life expectancy is dropping. AIDS has taken a devastating toll. Worst of all, Africa will never succeed without significant aid from the West, but these countries, having poured $300 billion into Africa with very little to show for it, are more reluctant than ever to invest. Even if the West did help, Meredith believes, "the sum of Africa's misfortunes--its wars, its despotisms, its corruption, its droughts, its everyday violence--presents a crisis of such magnitude that it goes beyond the reach of foreseeable solutions." Ultimately, in his opinion, Africa's own "Big Men" dictators are to blame, for they are the ones who have plundered the continent for personal gain and political power.I am interested to see what Meredith's study does to conversations about Africa, especially in light of outspoken advocates for vigorous intervention like Bono and Jeffrey Sachs (The End of Poverty, 2005). Further, given the magnitude of Africa's dysfunction, this book renewed my appreciation for all the many NGOs, Christian and otherwise, that have not given up but have served Africa with expertise, passion, and love. Finally, having traveled to Africa five times, I echo Meredith's tribute to "the resilience and humor with which ordinary Africans confront their many adversities."

$REVIEW.: Nowadays technology and the Internet have really simplified our life: we have almost forgotten the smell of a a real written letter because of e-mails or we don't even use usual phones to make a call, because we can do it via net.These are simply examples of tools we make use of in our everyday life; but there's another way to communicate, which is blogging on the Internet, where everybody can deal about different topics, such as books, movies or marketing.Yes, that's what Stephen Williams explains in his book "Blogging": once again, his writing style is so easy, that even who's not very familiar with this kind of subject, so with this language, can understand it .I think that "Blogging" can be a useful tool to really enter the world of the Internet and its blogging,  specially if we want to find another path to success.Williams helps us finding what are the best steps to take, if we want to go straight to the point: every chapter hides a new piece of advice, to start building a new viewpoint in the information world, where everybody can share everything he/she wants with other people, who, as a consequence are free to express their opinion about it.So, if you are looking for a useful help in the world of blogging and really want to obtain the desired visibility, I suggest you to buy "Blogging": it will teach you how to make your ideas fruitful, through blogging, that won't have secrets anymore for you.

$review_text.: Lies the Government Told You by Judge Andrew P. NapolitanoI received this book in the mail from Book Sneeze, a site that gives you free books in order for you to review them. I am very interested in politics, so this book sounded like something that I would enjoy reading.This isn't the most interesting or easy to read book that I have ever read, but it is very informational, and I am happy to say that I have read it cover to cover. At first I found this book really hard to get through, and then I found it fascinating, and then towards the end I found it hard to finish.About the Book:This book is made up of seventeen chapters, each based on one of the lies that the government has given us and expected us to believe. Lies such as "All Men are Created Equal", "Every Vote Counts", and "We Don't Torture". Judge Napolitano shares how the government has broken those promises that they have made and how our government's leaders (regardless of their parties) lie to us for their own gain.Some May Disagree with....Judge Napolitano's libertarian type views, such as the belief that marijuana should be legal.What I Learned from this Book:I did not realize until I read about it in this book just how bad the Patriot act really is, and just how many of our constitutional rights it helped to take away.I didn't know that it is illegal for anyone to compete with the post office by offering lower prices for shipping items.There is more that I learned through this book, but you are going to have to read it and learn the rest for yourself.My Conclusion:While I did not agree with Judge Napolitano on everything he wrote about in this book, I do think that it is educational and informative, and I am happy that I have read it. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: John Whitehead, the founder of the Rutherford Institute, gives us an ominous warning that our freedoms and liberties are in grave danger by the growth of the police state in America.  This 233-page book spells out the problem looking through the lens of dystopian movies and novels and explaining the parallels between those works of fiction and the reality we experienced today.  Standard works such as 1984 and Brave New World are mentioned, but so are new works like V for Vendetta and the blossoming classic from 1988, They Live, a movie about aliens enslaving the world by keeping it in a materialistic stupor.The main concerns Whitehead explains through his work are the erosion of our privacy through the use of tools formed by the war on drugs and, more recently, the war on terror; the decline of the First Amendment through the establishment of "free speech" zones and restrictions of speech around top elected officials; the merger between state and corporate powers most notably through the "prison industrial complex" and the use of force to cow the public into obedience.  Whitehead is non-partisan in his approach, going after both parties for their advocacy of laws designed to rob us of our freedoms.  Whitehead goes after the right by blasting the work of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) for their control of some conservative members of state legislatures.  The greatest worry that Whitehead expressed was that the government would not need to use crude methods like beatings and firing squads to obtain their objectives, but rather use "friendly" intimidation and gradual elimination of freedoms to cow the public.  He fears that it might be too late to rescue this nation.  However, in the last part of the book, he gives us ways to get people educated and informed about their predicament.This is a well organized book with numerous footnotes and a good index.  There is no bibliography though.  A book well worth a person's time to read.  I highly recommend this volume of timely warnings.  Five Stars.

$REVIEW.: A sandwich for lunch? Perfectly ordinary. But offer your guest a &#34;panini&#34; and suddenly you have embarked on a culinary adventure. The Ultimate Panini Press shows you in interesting detail just how to create a wide variety of gourmet sandwiches that take their name from the device that grills both sides of the sandwich between two grates. The author even gives you permissiont to cheat and substitute that Foreman Grill that is languishing on your countertop rather than invest in an authentic Panini Grill. The array of recipes are mouthwatering and chock full of meats, cheeses, vegetables and other savory ingredients. Why settle for a common PBJ sandwich when with just a little extra effort, you can create a Homemade Peanut Butter and Carmelized Banana Panini?  And a plain ham and cheese will no longer suffice when you know how to prepare a Ham, Apple and Smoked Cheddar Panini with Brown Sugar Crust. So why not live a little in the coming year and learn how having a Panini Press and the skills to use it can transforming boring sandwiches into culinary masterpieces with international flair!

$review_text.: There are moments of serendipity in any given reading life, when you take on a book by faith and/or chance, and you end up with something better and more beautiful than you ever expected.  The cover and title of Lydia Millet's Pills and Starships intrigued me enough that I read the back cover copy - twice.  I've been drowning a bit under the weight of books I promised to read, so it seemed foolhardy to take on another.  I am glad I didn't listen to my practical side, because Millet's YA debut is a gem: unnerving and luminous in equal measures.Natalie (Nat for short) and Sam's parents have elected to do what many of their generation have done: sign a contract to manage their death experience.  The world has irretrievably altered in their parents' lifetime: oceans have risen, much of the world's wildlife has gone extinct, and massive storms and bugs now take out huge numbers of the surviving human populations.  This change has gone hand in hand with the rise of corporations, who offer to take over the entire death experience once life gets too harsh or depressing.  When Nat and Sam discover some of the ugly truths beneath the veneer of their parents' death resort experience, they must make a decision to cooperate, or (possibly) work for something bigger and better - Earth's future.I'll admit it first thing: I did not know how Millet would pull off this concept.  Widespread mood-enhancing pharmaceutical use, climate disaster, all-seeing corps that hark back to Big Brother - it seemed like an unlikely combination.  All credit to the author, because she made that mish-mash come together, in a believable, fascinating fashion.  There's the dystopian element, of course, but if I had to put this in a sci-fi subcategory, I'd probably label it as an apocalyptic novel, of the environment-crashing variety.  After two chapters, I had no doubts that what I was reading was not only well-executed and smart, but lovely as well.The story is told from Nat's point of view - she's writing in a journal that the corp provides to all `survivors,' to help them cope during their relatives' last week.  It's first-person narration, with Nat recounting events as they occur each day, along with flashback scenes and memories.  The writing itself is vivid, immediate, and poignant.  As the days go by, much of Earth's recent history is laid out, along with Nat's personal feelings and processing of what death means.  At the same time, she's in a pharmaceutical-induced fog, and anxious about her (and Sam's) future.  It could be cluttered and sappy, but it's not.  Millet writes this far-future teen's feelings and experience in a way that made my (rather jaded) heart light up.Of course, Nat's preoccupations inform the novel, so this is a book that deals with themes of beauty, perception of and interaction with the natural world, a reluctant questioning of the status quo, death, and environmental apocalypse.  These issues were treated with care, even in the short space of the novel (and within the constraints of Nat's narrow point of view) - something that counts as an impressive mark in the book's favor.  The dystopia/sci-fi elements, while decidedly soft, were well-executed.Millet evokes feeling by writing directly about emotion, yes, but this is no sloppy, adjective-filled wonderland.  It's pitch-perfect, dark and lonely at times, but filled with loveliness for all that, and at its core it takes a deep and abiding interest in the natural world.  An added bonus, in case you aren't already running to the bookstore?  Pills and Starships features a diverse heroine, and indeed, entire supporting cast.  This is a smart, soulful book that deals with heavy issues.  On top of that, it's entertaining, can't-put-it-down reading.  I call that a straight #win.  And I kind of want to hand it to everyone I know who has ever expressed interest in young adult fiction.Recommended for: those who appreciate inspired writing, fans of young adult sci-fi and dystopian fiction, and especially anyone who enjoyed Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series or Ann Brashares' The Here and Now.

$REVIEW.: Before I begin, I want to stress that when it comes to art, I try to take it as intended, as a whole.  I am neither prudish, nor a raving, childish fanboy who loves gore, gore and more gore.  That said, I was introduced to the Walking Dead a couple years ago, and it was a revelation to me.  It is taut, well-written (for the most part) with few missteps.  The thing I like most is that the zombies are almost incidental to the plot.  This would work in just about any life-or-death situation, it just happens to be after the zombie apocalypse.  What is great about the book is the interrelations between the main characters and how they deal with this life-changing event.First, this book is NOT for everybody.  Many people with easily offended tastes will be horrified at times, and disgusted in others.  We are talking hard R to NC-17 territory here.  There are certain elements in the story (the governor being the most prevalent), that I think are totally unneccessary and ridiculously extreme.  This is Kirkman's only real misstep in the entire plot (so far) as he wallows in truly unnecessary cruelty and lasciviousness.  Before and after this part, the book is violent and very graphic.  Childish fanboys often cite this aspect as their favorite part, and unfortunately, their are satiated in this part in particular.  Please soldier on through it and don't let this part of the book affect your overall opinion, because you will cheat yourself of some great entertainment.That said, the rest of the book is taut and well-told.  People react in unexpected and interesting ways that may or may not be what you expect.  The danger of the zombies is omni-present, so you never know when a beloved character will die, giving a wonderous unpredictability to the whole affair.  The characters run the gamut of emotions, and take you to stygian depths and skyward heights.  If you were a fan of Lord of the Flies, with children beginning to act out in strange and unpredictable ways without adult supervision to guide their behavior, you will love this book.  In place of adults, it is now society and its mores that are gone and we are thrust back into much more primitive times and being in survival mode.  You have to ask yourself, "How would I react in this situation?"  This is the book's real genius.  It makes you think.And for the raving fanboys, there is lots of gore, so everybody's happy, right?The compendium itself is HUGE.  It could also double for some weight training if you need it, but it is good addition to any adult library.  Do not give to anyone under the age of 17.  It is really not appropriate.Lastly, one can't talk about these books without bringing up the AMC TV show.  What I love about this book, and the show, is that they are not identical.  So if you read or see one, you have the outline for the other, but not all of it.  There is just enough difference that makes each experience uniquely different and lots of fun.  Treat yourself to a rip roaring good time and read this.  You will be glad you did.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this series and this story was a wonderful read.  It almost had me in tears at some points, and it had me laughing too.  I've been waiting for Eve's and Alex's tale for what seems like forever, and boy did it not disappoint.  I just love the whole team, all such differing characters but, all with redeeming features that just make you love them all.Now arghhhhh! I've got to wait for Ian's story!  He is one tough cookie and it's going to be great to see him well and truly hog tied I hope.  Seems like Kristen could manage the whole lot of them with one hand tied behind her back and putting lippy on with the other: with body of a goddess and mouth like a drain.

$REVIEW.: When It&#8217;s Love by Emma Lauren is a fantastic, roller coaster story that will leave you breathless. The journey starts with meeting Sydney Morrison, who is harboring a naughty, school girl crush on Professor Sparling. Their professional relationship changes when Professor Sparling reaches out to Sydney. This starts a chain of events that push Sydney out of her safe bubble and into the world of camera phones and button up shirts. At first I was convinced I knew where this book was going but then Lauren introduced Henry, Sydney&#8217;s best friend who happens to be smoking hot and will do anything for her. That &#8216;anything&#8217; just so happens to make Sydney&#8217;s world flip upside down. Along with hot best friends and drool worthy professors, Emma Lauren had me on the edge of my seat with Sydney&#8217;s dark past that seems to follow her. As Sydney&#8217;s fears catch up to her, she seeks help from the wrong person while pushing aside the one she should have gone to all along; but this will be a lesson Sydney will have to learn on her own.  The story really picks up when the suspense thickens as the past closes in on Sydney while new threats emerge. Just as we reach the top of the roller coaster, the book ends and it feels like the ride stopped with us dangling over the edge. Emma Lauren has brought back the infuriating yet thrilling cliff hanger ending, and I can&#8217;t wait until May for her next installment, When It&#8217;s Over.

$REVIEW.: I agree with many of the reviewers below that this book was helpful and often interesting. It gives a readable orientation to one of the most important movements in the software industry today, and the editors have  been fortunate to gather together so many contributors who obviously know  whereof they speak. In particular, the editors' Introduction, Eric  Raymond's &quot;Brief History of Hackerdom,&quot; Richard Stallman's  account of GNU and FSF, Bruce Perens's discussion of Open Source, and Tim  O'Reilly's essay on &quot;Infoware&quot; were informative and  thought-provoking.That said, it should be noted that the Amazon reviewer  above gets it wrong when she writes that the book gives a &quot;fascinating  look at the raging debate.&quot; In fact, *nothing* about Open Source is  debated in this book, which is a major disappointment. As the reviewer from  Princeton below notes, the goodness of everything Open Source and the  badness of everything Microsoft seems to be a given for many of the  writers. At the risk of criticizing the book for not being something its  creators didn't intend, I think it would be greatly improved with the  addition of a wider range of viewpoints and even a dissenting voice or two.  (There are a number of essays that could give place to some alternate  content: Eric Raymond's second essay, &quot;The Revenge of the  Hackers,&quot; leans heavily toward the self-congratulatory, as does the  Netscape cheerleaders' &quot;Story of Mozilla.&quot; And Larry Wall's  &quot;Diligence, Patience, and Humility&quot; seems to have been included  not on its own merits but on the author's reputation as the Perl  Deity.)A final wish is for the book to address a broader range of  readers. As a longtime computer user but a relatively new programmer, with  no formal business training, I found many of the essays to rely heavily on  the jargon of hackers and MBAs. More editorial control here, in addition to  a broader range of content, would make this book seem less like preaching  to the choir and more effective at spreading the Open Source gospel.

$REVIEW.: I have always been a history buff and I carried that on into college where I majored in history. I love learning about all the events of the past and how those events came together to affect our world today. I especially love learning about the average people and how they lived and also learning about the more quirky events in history. That is why I was thrilled with the opportunity to review Curiosities of the Civil War"by Webb Garrison. The subtitle is "Strange Stories, Infamous Characters, and Bizarre Events." That is right up my alley.I have thoroughly enjoyed looking through this book.  However, the layout is a bit different from what I was expecting.  I was thinking it would be full chapters of interesting information written in a story or essay format.  Instead, it is broken up into nine themed chapters that have tidbits of information that are no more than two paragraphs a piece.  While it is not what I was expecting at first I do like how this book was written. It is perfect for a very busy homeschooling housewife.  I can pick the book up when I have a bit of time and read a few snippits as I go along.  I love that.  That being said this book is not one you would want to sit down and read all the way through on a Sunday afternoon.  Read it here and there.The information contained in this book is fascinating.  Like I said before, I love rarely known and odd, quirky stories.  This fit the bill well.  The stories are no doubt strange and bizarre.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants a full view of the Civil War with themes, time line, etc.  It is probably good for people who already have a grasp on the Civil War and are interested in more random information to round out their education.Five Stars!!I received this book as part of the Tommy Nelson Booksneeze Blogging Program and this is my honest opinion.

$REVIEW.: 4 1/2 stars.How to Get Good Reviews on Amazon:  A Guide for Independent Authors and Sellers by Theo Rogers is a terrific guide for any author who is trying to navigate the treacherous shoals of Amazon.  It is full of interesting insights and comments that combine practicality with good business advice.  There are comments and observations that should help authors searching for a way to reach reviewers and gives tips on how to evaluate the usefulness of their rankings on Amazon.  A lot of very pertinent information is available in a compact dissertation.As a reviewer, I am grateful for some of the hints that are couched in polite terms but which remind authors that there is an entire culture of reviewers out there with its own rules and conventions.  I was intrigued to recognize various positives and negatives that I have run into during my own experiences as a reviewer.  I am in the interesting position of having started as a reviewer and gradually branching out to become first a proofreader and then a copyeditor and editor.  I occasionally write a review for a work that I have worked on but I definitely will only do so if I have enjoyed the story.  Evidently, that is considered a no-no by Amazon but I find it to be a matter of ethics and I certainly would not praise a book that I don't think is worth it.  It disturbs me that this could potentially harm the author and I will have to ponder what I will do about the reviews I have already posted.  I really appreciated the reminder to authors that most reviewers write reviews as a hobby but that we take ourselves seriously and devote countless hours to doing this therefore it behooves the author to be respectful of our time and preferences.  The only thing I really don't quite agree with is the role of 5 star reviews as I rarely confer those, even though I really like a work but that is why I personally give 4.5 stars to many of the titles that I have enjoyed.  I think this is a great work that both authors and reviewers would benefit from reading.A copy of this title was provided to me in return for an honest review.

$review_text.: Neve Macleod was recently involved in a MOC - this was a bit creepy if you thought about it and didn't make a lot of sense if you did the same, but....okay just.....DON'T.  So she tries to get on w/ her teenage stepdaughter, but she doesn't trust that Neve married her father for good reasons and doesn't give her an inch.  Seems stepdaughter is a bit spoiled, but that just sets up the whole story.  Severo Constanza has a nasty stepmom who was awful to his father and Severo doesn't think much of women that he categorizes like her.  However, when he first sees Neve she has captured him in some odd way as she then immediately jumps into his vehicle and flees after her stepdaughter in blizzard like conditions.  Inevitably Severo goes after her.I liked Severo for the most part.  He was a good guy and I liked both him and Neve together.  I found him to be a great hero and he did show a bit of his fear because of his childhood at one point.  When he showed this reversal I SSSOOO loved Neve's set-down to him!  That was so worth it and spot on.  Severo truly didn't have a reason to believe what he did given what he knew, but he couldn't seem to see past what was tossed out at him then.  Both these characters had some humorous moments, and they truly seemed to care about one another despite Severo's brief episode and Neve's believe of the very thing she told him not to trust in.  So if you suspend believe just a bit, as is required apparently in this HPland, then it really was a romantic read.

$review_text.: MAJOR REVISION - What I first wrote: I was really looking forward to this Bible, particularly the ability to move around within the Bible as described on the purchase page.  It does say that many of these functions will not work for the Kindle Fire, but, nowhere does it say it is ONLY FOR the Kindle 2 and above.  I was so disappointed.  I tried hard to see how easy it would be to move around despite not having the abilities as described.  It was tiresome and would be an embarrassment at any type of Bible study or just discussion.TODAY - OKAY- SINGING NEW TUNE - besides buying the paper version of this Bible, I went back and purchased the Kindle version again (after returning it.)  I did this so that when I am working on some sort of Bible study, I could pull the Bible up on my 1 of my 24" HD screens.  It is much easier when looking for test or for reading a long time.HOWEVER, it also downloaded to my Kindle 1 - the first Kindle.  As I have pointed out, it in no way can do everything that the Kindle II and DX can do as far as navigation.  This time, though, I have spent more time with the Bible on my Kindle 1 and am very happy.  I find it does much more than I originally thought it could do.When I need to go to a certain book, I do have to go back to the Table of Contents.  I place the silver tab, using the scroll device next to the book I wish to read.  I push the scroll device and it jumps to the book.  Then, I see rows of chapter numbers.  I go to the row with the number I need and I click the scroll device, from the top of the page comes down a list asking me which chapter.  I click on the chapter and I am there.I takes less than 3 seconds to do what I just described.  No, it is not as good as on the Kindle 2, but it is great on the computer, great on my Playbook, and darn good on my Kindle 1.BACK TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:I returned my purchase and I bought this:New American Bible Revised Edition - NABRE Premium Ultra Soft BlackIf you don't have the Kindle 2 or above, give this real and very beautiful Bible a try.  Or, see if you can find a way to master the art of jumping around with this Kindle version.  You may very well find a way to do so which will work for you.  It really is worth a try.  Everyone is different, I couldn't make it work for me, but you may find a method I failed to find.

As it turns out, however, the stuttering problem isn't what she always thought it was.  In fact, she learns that a lot of things weren't what she thought they were, and her world is upended in surprising ways.  And imagine the shock of her roommates when they discover she's a witch.  This is a fast, entertaining book, and there's bound to be a sequel along soon.  I'm looking forward to it.

$REVIEW.: At that ominous mid-life juncture, 45-year-old native Californian Kathleen Salerno responds with what she hopes is selfless, optimistic enthusiasm to her husband Tony's announcement of his three-month stint in Wellington, New Zealand, working as a film editor at Jackamond Studios. Realizing that this is Tony's big career break, how can Kathleen say no? Especially since their daughter is in college, and this mid-life mom realizes she can use a jump into the unknown...or down under. Sadly, real life rarely falls in line with one's preconceptions and dreamy illusions, which Kathleen discovers immediately after landing in the country recently renowned for hobbits and assorted other worldly inhabitants.Checking out their miniscule bungalow-style house, Kathleen spies some jumbo-sized men's briefs, displayed in all their glory on a drying rack within the confines of her new bathroom. Making light of this surprising addition to their compact living quarters, Kathleen soon realizes that for the next three months she'll be going without a clothes dryer, a car, Cheerios, or a friend to share a bowl over. By the second week of self-pity, she experiences an epiphany-like moment by way of a bike, her husband's concern, and a question. Kathleen, understandably overwhelmed by "primitive" life in New Zealand, realizes Tony's past sacrifices on her behalf --- and suddenly longs to give back to him the gift of contentment in spite of herself. With obvious relief, Tony heads back to his day job and Kathleen makes it her task to find the gumption within to make the most of this temporary jaunt into understanding her uncharacteristically hesitant mindset.With thoughts of lovely chocolate invading her awakening subconscious, Kathleen ventures beyond the local grocery to a coffee shop named The Chocolate Fish, where she is initiated into the charming local custom of doing something well in exchange for a chocolate fish, a four-inch long marshmallow sweet treat that has Kathleen smiling despite herself. When good things occur, the space is often small between them...and in Kathleen's case this truism is no exception.While she sits sipping her mocha, Kathleen greets and meets another Californian native, Jill, with whom she shares the same hometown, two orange trees, and best of all, renewed hope. Jill and the newly dubbed Kathy become soul mates from the get-go and traverse the city, the country, and even Australia during Kathleen's stay. During their wanderings both women unveil their hearts and fears, and learn to accept their ever-altering life transitions, secure that God's love is guiding their steps. Each friend offers something the other has need of, perspective and a gentle generosity of spirit.By the end of the allotted three months down under, Kathleen is surprised how grievous she feels to leave her newly adopted home. Yet, through the lessons she gleans from her New Zealand friends, her realization of life's constant change, and a subtle yet powerful shift in her spirit, Kathleen understands that no matter where she finds her home, those she loves remain with her --- and there's no better comfort than this.Robin Jones Gunn makes traversing mid-life seem almost welcoming, because she has that rare gift of communicating hope amidst trial and inner chaos. Not one to shirk the need for self-assessment, this author has found an effective mode of gently lending some instruction to women who sometimes feel overwrought and undone by life's unexpected curves. Women and older teens will relish this newest installment in Gunn's Sisterchicks series. Who says growing older can't be fun if you have a friend to share the journey?--- Reviewed by Michele Howe

$review_text.: Reading `The Edge of Darkness' felt like riding a roller coaster of emtions
This book made me sad, happy, angry or even in love
The best thing about this book is that it makes you feel


It makes you feel like you are one of the character


It makes you feel alive in the book.I have to recognize that I've always wanted to read one of Melissa's books and when I signed up for this blog tour I was fangirling inside

And when I received my copy of `The Edge of Darkness' I was so happy that I jumped in my bed.Oh my, let me cry a little


I am sad and happy at the same time

Happy because I read such an outstanding book and sad because I finished too early

I read it in 2 days and I wasn't reading to say Goodbye to the characters

I really need a sequel right now! *Ryland,I'mGonnaMissYou*I feel in love with Melissa's writing style from the start
It has something so beautiful and poetic that it made me jealous


I've always wanted to write like this


To be able to bring my characters alive, to make my readers fall in love with my writing
Melissa did it
She made me fall in love with her book from the start


It's easy to read her books- her writing style is fluent and has an outstanding musicality.Her characters? Bring it on! Oh, I loved their personalities, how alived they felt to me

I love how different they are from each other and how easy it's to love them

My favortie character? I can't decide between Araya and Ryland


They are just..

flawless and so good for each other!!Let me say that as a violinist, Julliard is one of my dreams


So one I saw it mentioned there, in `The Edge of Darkness' I felt joy
I'd love to study there, but I think this will remain a dream.The story is so sad in the beginning! I felt so sorry for Araya and for her situation that, even though I wasn't very linked with her I wanted to cry! I can't even imagine how horrible it must be to lost your dream.In the scenes when both Araya and Ryland were present my heart melted and I even laughed


I loved how funny Ryland is, how caring and lovely his peronality is.Let me go back to my corner and cry over this book


I.WANT.MORE.!This is a book that definitely teaches you something: Never give up!Everything about `The Edge of Darkness' it's outstanding: the cover, the characters, the story, the talent of the author..

$review_text.: I've wanted to do the Death Valley to Mount Whitney hike ever since I read an article about it as a kid in an early-1970s issue of Backpacker Magazine. Well, I still haven't gotten around to doing the hike, but Daniel Arnold did and his story is written better than just about any other nature/travel book I've come across in quite a while. His descriptions of the landscapes he passes through are marvelous and there really isn't any chest-beating in his story, even though his chosen route and style of travel were tougher than most. The historical vignettes scattered throughout the story are interesting and well-connected to the landscape. They provide another dimension to the journey and are some of the most enjoyable parts of the book. The rock-by-rock, handhold-by-handhold descriptions of his scrambles through a couple of the desert canyons gets a little tedious, and I found myself skimming over some of those, but in a few pages you're back into the good stuff. So maybe ten pages overall drag a little, but the rest of the story is first rate. That's not easy to pull off in telling a story of what is essentially a long slog through the desert. I've done a few similar hikes over the years and I consider some of them to be amongst the high points of my life, but I've never pretended to be talented enough to be able to tell my story well enough to hold anyone's interest for more than a few pages. Conveying a deeply personal experience like a solo desert walk in a manner that inspires others is way tougher than even the walk itself, but Mr. Arnold pulls it off quite well. This is an enjoyable book for all walkers, desert admirers, and eastern California history fans. If you never undertake the journey yourself, this book is probably the next best thing.

$review_text.: The Other Side of The Island is a totally enjoyable book. But it does contain a warning about letting love of nature overcome good sense. In this book we find Honor (what kind of H name is that?) and her parents living on the outskirts of society. No matter how hard she tries,she and her family never fit in. And to make matters worse her parents are going to have a SECOND child.I hope that Ms. Goodman writes a sequal as there are several unanswered questions.Happy reading!

$REVIEW.: The Diary of Teenage Girl series is, in my opinion, one of the best series out there for teens, Christian or not. There have been four girls spotlighted throughout the series and each has been different yet enjoyable to read. Some girls I've liked more than others and I will have to say that Maya's series is my favorite. I like Maya because she asks the questions that challenge Christians who think they know everything and isn't afraid of what others might think of her. In this book Maya feels that she's starting to become a normal teenager and is able to escape the jumbled life she used to live.I really liked Maya's reactions to the Christian girls from her youth group. I have felt that Amanda and Brooke represent a good deal of real Christians teens who are two faced. They act like they are the perfect Christians while they are at church but then in real life they condemn everyone but back down when challenged.  They also seem to throw themselves at boys a lot.  I've experienced this treatment myself and the way Maya reacted was realistic.  If she had just immediately forgiven the girls and let them walk over her, I would have been very disappointed in this book and would stop reading.  However, she challenges them, gets irritated and tries to seek justice for the wrongs they caused. I really liked the way that everything got worked out involving the incident between Brooke and Maya.  It's not neat and tidy and obviously Brooke needs to work on her attitude but it's an ending that I can accept because it's not sugar coated with fake Christianity. Also the situations with her and her boyfriend were handled tastefully and realistically as well.Throughout the book Maya shares tips on saving the planet.  Maya's green tips are great and I've tried several of them myself (although the tip about the car and not using the air conditioner or even opening the windows won't really work during summer).  They really make you think about saving the environment but they are not trying to push an agenda. The only thing I would have liked would have been a response from Caitlyn to Maya's questions about being green and being vegan. It would have just been interesting to see what she would have to say or what most Christians think about that subject.  This series is a favorite of mine and I'm looking forward to the rest of Maya's adventures.

$review_text.: First off, let me say that I enjoyed this story. I have only a few complaints about it, some others have tapped onto those small things already. Namely Caine priding himself on taking public transportation. There's no real reason given there for that, or the fact that he knew 'better than' to order iced tea. Again, no reason given as to why he couldn't, just that he knew better not to. Wish Ms. Tachna had delved a bit deeper into the reasons for those two bits. But, they didn't cloud my desire to read the story all the way through. I enjoyed Caine's determination to not let his stuttering problem get in the way of his desire for a new life, even if it was clear half way around the world, in a place he had never even visited before.The foreman of the sheep ranch, Macklin, is as hard to pin down emotionally as being unable to keep wind currents stable 24/7. He ranges from hot to cold and back again, and in a sense jerks Caine around, all because of his fear. The ending though, when a jackaroo named Neil threatens Caine, though Macklin intervenes, he basically tells Caine something that causes intense pain, and I have to admit, it hit me square center. If I had been Caine I would have reacted exactly the same way he did.We learn a lot about sheep ranching in this book, and it's obvious Ms. Tachna did her homework, but we never find out how, or if, Caine's ideas to better the ranch manifest. The 'bad guy' in the story is never really focused on. There is a slight mystery as to the ranch being sabotaged by outside influences, but again nothing is ever really looked at.Caine's character development is excellent and we discover that he, himself, makes those observations near the end. No one has to tell him, so for a lead character, and it's all done via his POV (would have loved to have had Macklin's POV as well), this guy is great to watch unfold. But, this story could have been done in first person, since it stayed within Caine's POV throughout. As it is, it's in 3rd person limited.I got the feeling near the end of the book that the story was being rushed to the finish. It was good, not knocking the entertainment factor at all. I did enjoy reading it and loved it, but again, I felt like the actual plot needed a bit more kick. The sexual scenes between Caine and Macklin are well played, letting the reader feel what Caine was feeling.The drawbacks, though are miniscule when compared to Ms. Tachna's writing style and the setting for the story. The trivial stuff has not turned me off to read her further works. Will be getting into the next installment of this series soon. All in all a good enough read for entertainment purposes. A good book to just get away from it all for a few hours at the end of the day. :)

$REVIEW.: I had this book on my TBR list for far too long before I read it! Once I started it I just could not put it down! I had it loaded onto my phone and I found myself reading a few more pages as I cooked dinner, or sitting with my children to help them with homework. Any second that I could pick it up and read my nose was in the book. I had to know more, I had to know Dani's story.I was instantly drawn to little Dani. I wanted to bring her to my home and give her a great home almost instantly. I shed more tears for her than I ever thought I would when I started reading.When I was about 17 I read a book called &#34;She's Come Undone&#34;, By Wally Lamb. The book stuck with me and I reread it many times in my life, something I have only done with a select few book over the years. As I started CEM I instantly thought of the love I had for SCU when I first read it. I know that Cat's Eye Marble will now be joining that list of select books!There is so much more I could say, but all you need to know is that this IS a must read book, for so many reasons. It would take me hours to list them all.Ms. Smith has written a story that will stand the test of time, CEM is something you will want your own daughter to read some day.

$review_text.: Change does not come easy to the human species. Wanting to change, even trying to change is not always successfully. It really comes down to how we raise our young and the examples we set not the words we speak. In today's society most children are &#34;raised in school&#34; starting with day care until young adults. Parents are tired after working all day. So from a young age children are conditioned to follow the pack,be the same because the school system is not designed for individuality. It makes it harder for teachers, plus parents blame the school system when something goes wrong but are too busy paying the bills to pay attention otherwise. Uniqueness is taught from childhood by parents supporting, encouraging and setting the lines for each child to developers his or her own way. The book was good but this part was overlooked I feel. Still, I recommend it to everyone because there is something in it that all of us could, and should,learn.

I just wish there had been a prologue of his rescue of her all those years before


Since I haven't read the first two books in series it may be explained there

She claimed to have all these issues with people touching her, but it seemed like she got over just a little too easy

I'm pointing out everything I had trouble with, but I really did like it
So much so that I just got the first three books in a bundle from Amazon (yeah, it was only .99).days later....Now after having read the first two in the series, I think there should be a prequel novel that explains not only her rescue, but also the whole capture and deaths of the team members

There are just too many holes that leave you saying...what?

The early date given to this epistle by some is intriguing
Clement implores the early Christians to think back to earlier times when Paul wrote to them as if many in their midst were actually present at that time and could easily recall, so the early date may be correct.

$review_text.: Now here is a long-overdue look at the VC offensive that had begun in 1964 and gathered steam as the American commitment expanded in 1965-66. Contrary to the popular view of the NLF as a guerrilla force, Wilkins depicts them as they were when the American war expanded - main force regiments and battalions conducting conventional operations that had decimated the ARVN during the previous year. This highly-detailed analysis of VC operations against newly-arrived US units fully corroborates Phillip Davidson's view that the only way to understand the war was to view how it was being fought during any one of its particular phases.Wilkins makes excellent use of recently revealed documents and journal articles that depict, in great detail, the political manueverings in Hanoi and the debates within the politburo over domestic and international policy and possible strategies to defeat the US before a larger commitment was made and thereby cause the collapse of the Saigon government. This information sheds new light on communist motives and deflates the old myth of solidarity in the North Vietnamese political and military command structure.The author gives a thorough description of the creation and background of the NLF units, thier commanders, armament, and experience. He then proceeds to depict operations conducted by them against various American units in diverse locations (from the Ia Drang Valley to Masher-White Wing to III Corps). As might be expected, the NLF (basically a light infantry force) did not fare well against heavily applied American organic firepower and air support.This work is well researched, heavily detailed, and well written. Having met Warren at the AUSA shindig in DC, I found him to be an intelligent and committed young man who will undoubtedly continue to contribute to a fuller understanding of the war in Southeast Asia. I can hardly wait for his new work on the battle of Dak To.

$REVIEW.: Twentyish Rita Del Vecchio lives in suburban New Jersey.  She works as a waitress making nothing.  At a mall, a psychic tells her she is destined for great things and will fall in love and marry a man in uniform, but must risk leaving her comfort zone.Deciding to take a chance on life, Rita applies for a position as a New York City police officer.  To her euphoria, she is hired.  She undergoes grueling training at the academy as instructor Sergeant Gary Hill takes no mercy on Twinkle Toes until she is at the end of her rope.  Still she survives the rigorous training.  Rita joins the city's transit police patrolling the trains.  She begins dating cop Billy Quinn who she assumes is her secret admirer.  However, as Internal Affairs investigates dirty cops, she becomes caught in the middle with only her secret admirer having her back.New York, especially the Lexington Avenue line, makes this an enjoyable police procedural with a romantic subplot enhancing the insightful look at the tour of duty of a transit cop and an internal investigation into a dirty cop ring.  Although the plot contains a bit too many spins, Rita makes the tale entertaining with her courage and determination.Harriet Klausner

$review_text.: A wonderful story from a debut author! The plot is original (the hero and heroine are standing in, by proxy, for their friends, who are serving overseas, and need to get married) and the story is a well-written, riveting read. This author does a fabulous job of making the reader really FEEL like they are experiencing the story right along with the H/h. Their thoughts and emotions and actions are executed extremely well. The secondary characters supply the perfect amount of tension and conflict and this reader is curious for stories on those characters as well. (Note to author, PLEASE give us Jen's brothers' stories!)A sweet, Christmas read that is perfect for any time of year! I hope to read many stories from this wonderful new author!

$REVIEW.: I loved this book!  It was exactly what I hoped it would be and I'm going to ask for the "powers that be" at the library where I work to purchase it for our young adults
 We need more books for young males to read, besides those that involve powerful forces and creatures that fly and flying saucers


 We need more heroes for our young readers that they can truly relate to and I believe that they will be able to relate to our hero in The Accidental Genius of Weasel High!

$REVIEW.: LB Simmons BLEW ME AWAY with this one!! This story had so many different levels to it that you are really taken on a ride of emotions.  It deals with such serious issues in such a beautiful way that I was left gutted and really speechless.  I am really at a total loss of words.  Raven/Aubrey is one very broken soul.  Death has consumed her and she has constructed a shell of a girl to protect her.  Kaeleb is a boy who loves a girl who doesn&#8217;t really know how to love back.  His patience and understanding were beautiful.  Quinn, the beauty queen with the heart of gold but the darkest secrets broke my heart.  The connection the characters share was simple and brilliant.  I don&#8217;t want to go into the story too much because in order to appreciate every facet, you need to go in blind.  It&#8217;s like uncovering a diamond buried deep deep down, but once you really dig in you find the brilliance and beauty there.  This is one of the best books that I have ever read and whatever I write will never do it justice.  It truly in spectacular.5 stars is simply not enough&#9829; Sophie

I understand why Jesus was baptized after his 40 days in the wilderness and why the Holy Spirit descended during Pentecost. I wish all Christians could realize that the Old Testament is meant to be studied and appreciated. That having a New Covenant doesn't mean doing away with the history behind the Covenant.Kasdan writes clearly and explains thoroughly. This book is balanced - full of weighty information without being a textbook. I also love the craft and food ideas at the end of each chapter.

$REVIEW.: Perhaps the greatest crime against literature happened when Frank Miller was allowed to (with full studio backing) write and direct The Spirit as a movie
Reading Will Eisner'sWill Eisner's New York: Life in the Big City (Will Eisner Library)makes one realize just how amazing Eisner could be in depicting urban life for all its permutations and eccentricities


It's truly one of the most honest and compelling books about New York ever written

By contrast, Frank Miller learned all he needed to know about urban living from watching movies likeEscape from New YorkandThe Warriors (The Ultimate Director's Cut)and old noir books


While the audacity of his vision is good enough to provide some twisted fun (especially in the case ofBatman: The Dark Knight Returnswhich has some redneck sensibility but still delivers a decent story), the more Frank Miller you read, the more it becomes apparent that Frank Miller is speaking for the scared suburban teenager who might have heard about the city but has never actually been to a city, or if they did go to a city they were tourists who hid in their hotel rooms the second the sun went down.This kind of paranoia plays well with suburban white teenagers who are both enchanted and scared of the big bad city but anyone else has to start asking questions like "how do you maintain the roads?" or "are there any women living in the city who aren't ninja prostitutes or thoroughly evil?" Frank Miller's vision has been consistently paranoid and sexist throughout his career and while that may work at one point, it does have an expiration date as far as the audience's patience is concerned.As far as this story is concerned, it's your average James Cain double-cross tale where a man gets involved with his old girlfriend


She seems like a damsel in distress until he helps her out and then she turns evil
This is not exactly a spoiler since she IS a Frank Miller character and since she isn't a prostitute with a samurai sword, she must be evil


Anyhow, instead of going to the gallows like a character like this usually does, the protagonist goes to the ninja prostitutes and has a grand old adventure which includes getting beat up
It's a pretty dumb story full of stupid characters who are allowing themselves to be manipulated all the way.At one point, Frank Miller was the giant of comics and some still may say that he is, but his vision has ossified and now his stories of prostitutes and evil women and criminals in the big bad city is just sad and tedious.

$review_text.: This entry in Rick Geary's series on Victorian murders examines the assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a megalomaniacal failure at preaching, the law, and almost everything else he had tried.  The drawings are evocative of the time and place, and give a clear idea of the events.  The lives of Garfield and Guiteau are traced, and Guiteau's mental illness is made quite clear; today, he would almost certainly be sharing a room with John Hinckley.  I'd like to see this whole series reprinted: one of them is out of print and apparently unavailable.

Confronted with the video surveillance by the security guard she is blackmailed into stealing from her employer's fierce competition, Panache, run by Houston's most eligible bachelor Chase Thomas

At an auction for charity, Alexandra on behalf of her employer, bids on one of the dates being auctioned with, you guessed it, Chase Thomas.Chase sees this lovely beauty and is intent on making her his

Though Alexandra puts up a good fight, her growing feelings give way to love and she gives her heart to Chase

The problem is she finds herself in the dilemma of how can she keep his love and betray him.Ms


Harris had a great premise and a good solid story


I was effectively caught up in the romance and dreamt about some day meeting a man like Chase

However, their relationship and the storyline developed too quickly for my liking

I wanted to savor the idiosyncrasies of budding love and excitement that moves with suspense
Ms


Harris' subplots (Alexandra's mother and Chase's new employee) were a bit underdeveloped
Because of this I felt the book was over before it actually ended


I also found some of the dialogue stilted


For example Alexandra quite often found herself in conversations where she would often reply "touch&eacute;."Nonetheless, I enjoyed the jet set lifestyle that Chase lived and lavished on Alexandra
I understood and could relate to Alexandra's plight in dealing with her son's illness and the characters in this novel were likable with some of them begging to have their own story told
(Hint, hint Ms


Harris) I say check it out on a lazy afternoon.KotanyaAPOOO BookClub

$review_text.: A really satisfying conclusion to this trilogy of short stories.  Some funny things happen in this story but the overall feeling is much more somber as reality sets in for this small group of survivors.  They are living their &#34;new normal&#34; and things are not terrible but also not great either.  This installment really drives home the point that living this rough, homesteader lifestyle is not for the lazy or faint of heart.  I loved the herbal remedies listed and the ideas the group comes up with to adapt.  This is not &#34;McGyver&#34;, or &#34;Swiss Family Robinson&#34; and they have to make do with what they have.  Even though this seems to be the conclusion, I would love to see the author revisit these characters in maybe a year to see how they are coping long term.

$REVIEW.: After acquiring a degree in Biblical & Theological Studies at a college that is steeped in the Calvinist/Arminian debate, I found myself unable to accept either theological position.  While I appreciated the importance of God's sovereignty espoused by Calvinists, I could not accept the way they developed it, which seemed to create a God more interested in his own "glory" than in the wellbeing of his children.  I could not worship a God who created people simply to send them to hell.  On the other hand, the libertarian free will upon which Arminians insist seems necessary, but results in a rather ineffective or unloving God.  Did he not foresee that so many humans would end up in hell?  If not, how wise could he be?  If so, why did he create in the first place?  [Example: I would not have a child if I knew s/he would suffer for a lifetime, and if I "though [I am] evil" would sacrifice my desire for a child for the good of that same, as-yet-unconceived child, "how much more [would our] Father in heaven" forego creating people if he knew they would suffer eternally (idea based on Mt. 7:11/Lk. 11:13)?]  If the "traditional" understanding of hell is true, I see no way of getting around these issues, and Mr. Talbott seems to appreciate this dilemma.  I found myself thinking, "YES!" as he objected to assumptions that go all but unquestioned by the majority of Christians.  In other words, he really thinks critically about Christian doctrine, rather than simply swallowing certain aspects of it without considering potential problems and contradictions within then.Fortunately, there is a way to maintain both God's ultimate sovereignty and human freedom... and simultaneously affirm that all will be saved!  Mr. Talbott puts forward a number of strong arguments, though he certainly does not exhaust all the biblical passages that we must exegete before decisively deciding the case.  One of his first points is well taken, however: We can find verses that, at least from a face value reading, support Calvinist, Arminian, and universalist positions.  Both Calvinists and Arminians must interpret challenging passages in a way that will allow them to hold consistenly and logically to their belief.  There are surely passages that speak of the salvation of all people, so why is universalism any different?  In fact, it may be the simplest to defend, since the Arminian "proof texts" show that God desire to save all people, and the Calvinist texts show that he is able to accomplish his redemptive purposes.  These competing doctrines have done a significant portion of the work for universalists, since universal reconciliation simply affirms the core tenets of both doctrines!  Talbott rightly insists that we at least place universalism on the table in this area of debate.I had hoped that this book would delve into more biblical passages that seem to support the doctrine of eternal/everlasting damnation.  But Talbott focuses instead on building a positive case for universal reconciliation, which he does quite well.  Certain passages make so much more sense given his line of thinking [Example: the idea that some people will be saved through fire (1 Cor. 3:15)].  He does also defend universal reconciliation in light of the infamous sheep/goats teaching in Matthew 25, used so often to dismiss the notion of universalism.  While there are other passages that we must re-interpret in order to reject the traditional view of hell, I am very grateful for this book.  Some works out there (for example, "If Grace is True," by Gulley & Mulholland) simply reject the infallibility of the Bible and the necessity of Jesus' work, so they no longer teach Christian universalism, but rather a form of pluralism.  Talbott, on the other hand, maintains an assumption of biblical authority and atonement through Christ, so evangelical Christians who are drawn to the idea of universal reconciliation need not fear that such core beliefs will be discarded in this book.Talbott responds to scholars who challenge his ideas (and those of other universalists) in the book "Universal Salvation? The Current Debate," edited by Robin Parry and Christopher Partridge, which I also recommend.  That book has a website ([...] with links to other sites/articles that are helpful to people who want to search out further evidence in the issue of universalism.

Not only does she have new job she finds herself with a stalker and a hottie protector Marcus Locke


As the story unfolds these two face many challenges

Vivian becomes a suspect in a string of events linked to the campaigns and Marcus is trying to balance his undercover work while protecting the woman he is falling for


With Marcus's secrets and Vivian's relationship trust issues can these two make it?I have to say that I truly enjoyed this read! Both of the characters were awesome! I love reading books where the heroine is a strong independent female


The whiney whoa is me characters tend to wear on me
Marcus is a total ALPHA male! If you like these type of hero's then you will love Marcus! Another thing I enjoyed about this book was even though the story line centered around a political campaign it did not go anywhere near Democrat vs
Republican *phew* Just two sides working hard with a Villian in the mix that I did not see coming! I highly recommend this read if you are looking for something fast paced, with two strong leads, suspense, romance and a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat wondering WHO IS IT!

$review_text.: I thoroughly enjoyed reading these short passages even though I am not a very religious person. I found them very inspirational and uplifting. A great way to start the day is to read these as you sip your morning coffee. Don't be put off that these are from a 14 year old boy, these reflections pertain to all of us.
$review_summary.: Inspirational !

$review_text.: Truthfully, I read this debut twice to ensure I could give it an objective critique. There are aspects of the story that touched me personally.Let's begin with the writing technique. Memories places the reader in the store very well with sensory details like, `It was the smell of book dust and potpourri . . .' and `It makes my body tingle to its toes and a smile touch my lips . . .' Then there's the shopkeeper. I applaud the author's choice for not going with your run-of-the-mill reaper or bony crypt keeper. Instead, the reader is treated to a `specter . . . flickering like a bad radio signal.' The shopkeeper's dialogue is brief, but courteous. Maybe his signal is weakened by being spread out to other outlets for many restless souls seeking something they lost? Moving right along at a brisk pace, the protagonist tells us about the love of her life.***SPOILER ALERT - SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU LIKE***My heart warmed up to the slow reveal of the protagonist's gay lifestyle. Perhaps the author kept the details about the life partner down to minimum to evoke a state of mind for the reader, however, I would've liked to've seen more details of the girlfriend's physical appearance. Also, when the partner dies, her demise is limited to `Two years later, she died.' A moment for suspense in the story is missed here. The author could've shown us the protagonist not catching sight of a yellow caution sign on the floor covering up a pool of blood she almost slips on, or since the partner died in a car crash, maybe she spots an item on the shelf. Perhaps a crinkled-up license plate . . . maybe a keychain she gave to her smeared with blood.***END OF SPOILER ALERT***Ultimately, the story is interesting and poignant. With these attributes, showing versus telling doesn't really matter IMHO.Now for the second half of this critique. Production values. I would remove `BY' from the cover. Most of the book covers in the marketplace don't say `written by' unless there's also an illustrator involved. Another element I would suggest revising is the picture. I admit that I don't know my flowers very well, but in the two read throughs I gave this wonderful piece, I didn't see the relevance of the flowers. Maybe they're supposed to be the potpourri? Not positive. Another production value that needed work is the front matter. If there's a table of contents, why isn't there a copyright page, title page, or even a dedication? Another small issue I discovered is that when I read this story on my Paperwhite the paragraphs were indented. When I read it on the Kindle app for iPhone the paragraphs were not indented. Formatting issue maybe?In closing, I would like to offer an historical reference that popped in my head after reading this story. I thought about how ancient Egyptians entombed their pharaohs with all of their belongings.I believe that any short story with social and/or historical significance is worth a read.

$REVIEW.: Leaving Annalise by Pamela Fagan Hutchins is a 2013 SkipJack publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.Leaving Annalise picks up right where Saving Grace left off. Katie is stunned to find that Nick has traveled all the way from Texas to see her. Now if you read the first book in this series, having Nick show up sort of left me conflicted. I felt like Katie had gone through enough and was finally going to have a little peace and then BAM! the source of so many of her troubles shows up and opens up all those old hurts again.Things are not always as they appear and Nick ,as it turns out, has a plausible explanation for his behavior. He also has his hands full with family issues. His sister has a child and is on the run from her psycho boyfriend. Nick has promised to help her which means he can't stay with Katie. So, Nick goes back to the States and Katie stays and works on her home. But, one thing after another keeps the work on the house from ever making much progress and Katie's former boyfriend, Bart, didn't take the break up all that well.Just when it seems that maybe Nick and Katie will finally have their happy ever after.... yep you guessed it. Life interferes and Katie will have to chose between staying in Annalise or going back to the States with Nick.I really love this series. In this second chapter we get to finally find out why Nick was such a little jerk in the first book and we can catch up with all the people we met in the first book.The charm of this series is that the author doesn't weave an epic unrealistic fairytale type romance. ( although I'm a sucker for those too)Katie's life is a challenge as she tries to stay sober, deal with a long distance relationship, an exasperating best friend, an ex boyfriend with a vendetta', and becoming a &#34;mother&#34; to Nick's nephew.Katie and Nick do the best they can with the cards they are dealt. This is what true love is all about. It's not always hearts and flowers. Life is tough and Katie and Nick don't always see things the same way and they argue, but they also work things out.Katie has done some real growing up since we first met her. She is doing a great job of staying sober and taking on some rather unexpected challenges.Nick is actually good for Katie after all. He still gets under her skin especially when he is the calm voice of reason and she wants to be mad.Once more there is a lot going on with Bart going off the deep end, Ava still trying to become a star, the sabotage on Annalise, crimes, intrigue, tragedy and yes, our ghost is still making an occasional appearance. There is laughter, tears, heartbreak, fear, anger, and disappointments, and there is also love, commitment, family bonds, and hopefully and there will be more adventures like this one in the new book due out next month! Stay tuned! Overall this one is an A.

$review_text.: I have now completed this series and, try as I might, I just did not get Elle at all.  For a woman who wants to be a doctor, she has serious issues making quick decisions and sticking to them.  Not a good combination for her chose profession.  She was too overly emotional for me about most everything in her life and I was just frustrated with her.  Her supposed friends left a lost to be desired and she just took all of their backstabbing and over the top behavior like it was nothing. As far as plot, there were twists and turns and Reed more than screws up, but in the end everyone winds up where they are supposed to be.
