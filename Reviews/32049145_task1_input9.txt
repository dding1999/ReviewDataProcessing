$REVIEW.: Only problem is that the bottom screw does not line up with screw hole.  Hopefully this lamp will last more than four months.Guess what?  Lamp sat in cabinet four months, bought as back-up, installed 10/10/13 after lamp in TV went out.  Lamp worked for about 15 seconds and blew out.  Media Monster 22 refused to replace as warranty was only three months, do not make any purchases from this seller, they ship defective merchandise.
$review_summary.: TV lamp is an excellent price.

$REVIEW.: Product is much better than I expected based on the low price.  I purchased this unit to help protect landscaping around a new home from being dug up and destroyed during the night by varmints such as armadillos and wild ferrell hogs running free in my new development.  It has worked well for me as I have already 'dispatched' two of the varmints to their final reward while in the process of digging!

$review_text.: Briefly: right length for most uses, right price, certified HDMI 1.3/Cat 2 and a 'super savers' item (free shipping when ordering over $25 worth of Amazon merchandise). Can't get much better than this. Or... it can. The ferrite cores, not really needed at lengths of 6 ft. or under could make a difference on a 10 ft cable as they help reduce high frequency noise on the cable. It's been working well for us.Given the 1 yr. warranty promise and the ability to easily return the wire to Amazon if you get a defective item, I see no 'negatives'.The 3-6 ft. are the optimum lengths to connect most electronics and just about any HDMI wire would work well on those lengths, longer cables benefit from 'quality' and the ferrite cores should ensure that the cable will work always - too much noise would sometimes confuse your device and the picture may disappear for a fraction of a second on a so-so cable.Just in case someone may feel guilty for not paying a lot more for a premium brand, it should be stated that at these relatively short lengths, you will get as good a service from a good quality no-brand cable as you would from a super-expensive brand. An HDMI 1.3x cable should be able to carry, error free, all the signal your electronic equipment may put out. In fact, you can buy one or 2 extra 'cheap' cables, just in case. At these prices they're easily affordable._________________________________________________________Note:10 ft. is a pretty long cable and you should be able to get away with a 3-6 ft. wire most of the time at home but, if a longer cable is needed, as I found we needed at the office, the BlueRigger proved to be the right pick and it saved our shareholders a few dollars. We've been using it with a projector for the past few months and, so far so good.

$review_text.: hello,our old d link router gave up after 4 years.  so, with all of the routers out there, we selected the netgear n900 dual band wndr4500.  it is sleek, no external antennas, and was extremely easy to set up.  the whole set up on the home computer was pretty easy, but we did have a slight problem.  so, the netgear customer service took me through the problem, resolved it quickly and it was ready to go in 20 minutes.  that is outstanding customer service.  the enclosed paper instructions were fairly clear, but there were a few things that needed to be cleared up.  now, there is a website link on my desktop that will show exactly what is going on the network system.  any adjustments can be made there.  it is so easy and simple.  now, the laptop can go much farther away and still get a great signal.  (no more alien ant antennas)  there is a neat addition to the netgear n900, several "guest log on to the network" links are available if you want to set them up.  they can each have a name and password.  that way a neighbor or friend can log on to your network access when they come to visit with their electronics and your own network is secure.  great product and great customer service from netgear.  the amazon delivery was also outstanding.

$REVIEW.: After upgrading from a Canon 40D to a 5D Mark III, I decided to give my niece the 40D. In order for her to be able to enjoy the full array of capabilities the camera offers, giving her a standard wide angle lens wasn't enough. I bought this lens and a 70-300 Zoom Lens w/macro for her as well. If it wasn't for the fact that this lens won't work on my current camera and my standard zoom lens is valued nearly 3 times as much, I would've kept it for myself.

This one is really fast(I don't have a lot to compare against) and I have had no issues with file corruption.  The only downside, it wasn't big enough.  120gig went fast especially with games, so I had to purchase another one.  Now, this one stores my OS and I use the other one to store my game files.

I was surpirsedto find out (maybe I didn't read the box) that it also has radio, TV, and weather stations. Neat!!The sound is AMAZING! Is this what those Bose radios sound like? They call the technology Reson8. I call it great! It sounds as good as my big stereo, but fits under the cabinet. I haven't installed it there yet. I'm worried about screwing into the wood. But for now, it works just as well inside the cabinet door.

$review_text.: I like the idea that these cases can be stored flat and then 'snapped' together when needed.  I store my CDs and DVDs in the standard white paper sleeves with the clear plastic windows and then in the box and I can easily fit over 175 per box this way.  When assembled, the boxes are sturdy enough for my needs but I don't use them to travel with the DVDs.  For those that comment about the snaps coming apart when moving the boxes, I might suggest a simple piece of heavy duty tape at the top four corners after assembly to easily turn that into a non-issue.  For the price and what I use it for I think this is a good product that looks nice on the shelf.

So far, this Blu-Ray player has worked beautifully
I don't know how fast (or slow) other Blu-ray players are, but the Panasonic seems just as speedy (or slow depending on your point of view) as my (current model) Sony DVD player

As long as this unit lasts and doesn't give me any trouble down the road, I'm very happy with the purchase.

Both vehicles have aux input jacks on the front of the stereo so I just leave them plugged in and have attached them to the vehicle using a small piece of velcro so they aren't just dangling from the wire.  It would have been nice if the manufacturer that included some velcro with the unit since this seems like an obvious aesthetic fix that most people would want to make.My other wish is that they could sense the stereo being turned on through the input jack and therefor cause the adapter to turn on automatically.  Instead, you have to turn it on manually every time you want to use it.  Again, not a biggie, but would have been a nice touch/feature.

$REVIEW.: I'm typically impressed with my Anker purchases. They go the extra mile to ensure a positive experience, from the unboxing to the installation. I don't know if they learned a few tricks from Apple, but they are going a long way towards building a quality brand. Nowadays there are a lot of unbranded or OEM products to choose from, but many lack fit and finish that you can be proud of. Anker has figured out how important that is to the consumer.The hub is working well. My only complaint is the angle of the cord on the back. It angles up which looks a bit off, however I'm being nitpicky. It functioned well without any additional drivers on Windows 7, Windows 8 and OS X. I'd also like the option of an external power supply. I've yet to see a powered hub that looks as well as it works.

I transfer images from the card to my PC by removing it from the camera and plugging it into the reader on my PC. I copy the images to the PC and then put the card back in the camera and format it. I NEVER format it in the PC. If I had to guess I would say I've stored and transferred 4000 to 5000 images. Not a lot but I've never lost an image or had a problem with the card.

The raised height prevents my palms from resting on the table. Instead it's raised and hurts after a few hours of use.2. The mouse is quite heavy. Moving the mouse around starts to feel heavier and heavier which intensifies the wrist hurting.3. The Logitech MX510 is still a more ergonomic mouse than the Performance Mouse MX. The Logitech Wireless Mouse M560 comes close to the comfort of the MX510. The MX is bearable for a few minutes at a time.4. What pushed me over the edge returning this mouse was that the middle mouse button doesn't click easily! You need to click the middle button in a specific angle that may have been designed specifically for the middle finger. Since I use my index finger the middle button just didn't click and enters scrolling. There's a dedicated website to fixing the middle mouse button click issue, but I didn't want to void my warranty so I returned it. If you have this issue and you want to keep the mouse then try this site out: "[...]
$SUMMARY.: Wanted to love this mouse but wrists hurt a little and middle mouse click doesn't quite work!

$REVIEW.: This device is currently sitting on my desk and is maintaining a temperature of 46 degrees Celsius. for the name it's not very cool, but for the price its an amazingly inexpensive item. Most Hard drives are made to operate from 40-55 degrees Celsius, meaning that this probably wont help or hurt your hard drive. Design wise it is very nice and feels great the bolts seem to screw on slightly at an angle, but it is not noticeable unless your aware of this fact. Now the connectors are flimsy at best but if you are careful while handling this won't cause a major problem. Great Item, Great Price, But look for another if you want something that actually COOLStotheMAX.

$review_text.: I recently replaced my Corsair H50 with this cooler


The H50 was an excellent cooler and served me well for four years, but I decided to go with this cheaper Cooler Master since I probably will be rebuilding some time in the near future


I really do like this cooler though

Installation was very easy, I didn't even need to take my motherboard out, and it cools very good, even under load

I paired this with Arctic Silver grease from Amazon, and that got my temps back down to where they should be
Another great thing about this cooler is it is super quiet


Even though I bought this cooler just because it was cheap, I would really consider putting one in a high end build because it does everything that coolers twice its price does.

$REVIEW.: I've been a fan of Samsung for years and this is the first time I've strayed from my usual brand. When comparing the features on this TV to a similar Samsung you will pay $300-$400 more. I wasn't sure what to expect with this TV and honestly I was ready to dislike it from the start. Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc&eacute;e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.  Hope this helps!

$review_text.: This worked perfectly for me - and ordering 2 more.I try to maintain old computers, and had 2 desktops without wireless.  I bought 2 different similarly priced micro USB wireless connectors, and this was the only one that worked the moment you put it in - for both Windows and Linux (tried with several variations on Ubuntu).  It didn't have a software disk because clearly it didn't need it.The other needed an install disk for drivers to get it to work, and it's been so difficult in Linux that I am just going to spend the $10 and get another Edimax.A great wireless connector.

Just little pain about the price I had to pay but it worthed.I would recommend this item to anybody who's looking for a this kind of product.Update after 6 months using:The thing started making horrible noise, sound like industrial fan you use for a factory. Well, that's why the stars i rated dropped down to 3 stars instead of 5.Customer support from taugus was great, quick respond. How ever they wanted me to ship it back to them and they would replace it within 10 days. And as i have top pay for the shipping so i decide just to leave it and buy a new one.

$REVIEW.: I bought this burner as a replacement for my apple superdrive.  Nothing wrong with the superdrive but I expect that it will quit working soon since I use it A LOT.  Anyway, I was looking for a cheaper alternative and this was definitely less costly.The device is bulkier than the superdrive but is capable of all the same things in terms of reading discs and writing to discs.  It's not as pretty as the superdrive but I wasn't going for aesthetics so that doesn't matter to me.  It does read some discs at a faster rate than the superdrive and the speed it has there is impressive regardless of what other drive you are comparing it to.  It does tend to get noisy at high read speeds but that is irrelevant to me.  It comes with a dual-headed usb cable to connect it to your computer and I suspect that both heads will need to be plugged in to power the drive with some computers.  I have a macbook air and the over-powered usb port on the computer powers the drive without connecting both usb heads.I haven't used this drive for much yet but it seems adequate and for 30 bucks, it's a good deal.

$review_text.: This router is currently the top of the range from ASUS. It has stellar performance and is excellently engineered. The unit is a breeze to set up &#8230;. and a browser will find the router without entering anything&#8230; Just enter a couple of settings and its ready to go in about 10 mins max.The vertical design allows increased cooling for the dual core CPU & the twin band radios, but also raises the antennas for better signal penetration. The LED lights indicate the status clearly but can be switched off as well. There are also physical on off switched for the unit itself and for the wireless radios.It has 4 gigabit ports LAN ports and a gigabit WAN port but one of the LAN ports can be used as a fail safe WAN port for those users that need totally uninterrupted internet access such as businesses etc.Although initial set-up is easy, every facet of the unit can be tweaked through the easy to use and understand interface. You can even change the power output / transmit power.There is also the option to add guest networks on the 2.4 and 5 ghz channels for your friends or visitors to get to the internet but not to your files.What is more important is the robust security that the unit brings - including restricting access to the administration panel to a single wired computer, blocking remote access and being able to change the LAN IP range etc.There are endless other features such as being able to ad an HDD or a PRINTER and use them across the internal network or access files from the internet. It has Apple Time Machine support as well as VPN and DLNA media streaming. There is a Dropbox like facility called AICloud as well&#8230;. I haven't used any of these features but might do later on.The only negative? Its a bit big and the three large antennas sticking up don't make it relaxing to look at &#8230; but mine is on top of a bookcase so I don't notice it.Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: If your reading a review for 10-20 dollar speakers, then I'm guessing your not looking for Bose. You have, however, found a gem. These little bad boys have a really nice sound for how much these cost. And what is that?!..... a sub-woofer? With a cheap pair of computer speakers!?!? It does a nice little job too if I may add. The extreme highs can come off distorted (shaky bass), but these speakers can carry through a household nicely while blaring some tunes. Having a know how about sound programs and settings will only make these little speakers shine more.Wires are long enough to stretch to either side of an average desk and connect to a computer sitting on the ground with no problem. Simple push button on and twist knob volume control on the one front speaker. The ones I received are all black and blend in nicely with all the other components on and near my desk. Only negative I can think of, considering price and quality, is there is no physical bass control, but this is easily solved by mixing sofware.So, grab these bad boys if your on a budget and want some presentable speakers. You WILL NOT find better speakers at this price!

$REVIEW.: Kudos to Monoprice for making a headset with great sound quality!  The Monoprice 7.1 Dolby Digital Amplified Gaming Headset produces nice audio when used for gaming.However, the headset does have several problems.  There is interference in the audio that can be heard both by the headset user and the other players in the game. This interference usually only occurs when the volume box is touched and when the headset is jostled excessively. Also,the connectors that come with the headset are a bit annoying to set up, so it is good to know that the headset has the option of an upgrade to Dolby Digital and Dolby with optical interface.Other than those things, the headset performs admirably.  The headset can be used with Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC gaming, and is compatible with Xbox Live communication.The detachable boom microphone is a nice feature with this headset, since the headset can also be used with some mobile devices (devices listed are iPod and some smart phones.  The included headset cable is 41 inches and the controller cable is a generous 10 and a half feet.All around, this headset performs well.

$REVIEW.: Folks, I have reviewed many mini-speakers from a variety of companies and have been impressed with the quality of all of them; however, now that I have experienced the Simple Audio Go Compact Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker (90B0001-US), I can honestly say that this one is in a class by itself.First of all the packaging is the most unique that I have ever seen. Housed safely within a double pyramid cleverly designed box this quality device produces unbelievably great sound like none other than I have heard in a speaker of this size. It has two stereo speakers and a separate bass driver that produces big and clear sound that you would expect from much larger and more expensive products.It comes with Bluetooth technology, 3.5 mm line-in audio cable, USB 2.0 charging cable, a convenient fabric carrying case, an AC Power Adapter, and a Quick Start Guide.The easy to follow guide shows you how to connect with any Bluetooth-enabled device that supports A2DP audio. Simply press the designated button at the top of the speaker, hold it for 3 seconds, wait for the tone that tells you Go is ready to pair and then go to your cell phone or other connecting device and select Simple Audio Go. A tone will then tell you you are connected. If you are listening to music on your cell phone and a call comes in you can take the call right over the device like a speaker phone by simply pressing and releasing the designated button. Pressing the button for 1.5 seconds allows you to hang up while pressing plus or minus buttons alow you to mute or unmute the microphone inside the speakerphone device.Very portable, this small conveniently shaped powerhouse fits perfectly in my wife's purse, my son's backpack and my brief case and adds a dimension to my android cell phone, Samsung notebook, Sony CD player, Kindle Fire and Toshiba Satellite computer that I would not have believed had I not experienced it firsthand.This is a user friendly, durable product comes with a limited 2 year warranty against hardware and accessory defects in material and workmanship. The speaker is easy to connect and has a big sound at a reasonable price that would make it a perfect gift for friends and family this holiday season.Enjoy!

I remapped the zoom slider in the middle to do page up/down so it acts as a quick scroller since page up/down are usually so far away and I changed caps lock to be left control so I never have to move any fingers very far. I have this keyboard at work but it has a good spacebar, again similar to the situation many others had.Overall a very good keyboard, plus there are some step by step instructions online on how to fix the spacebar if you want to pop it off and do some fenagling.

$review_text.: This really is as simple as it gets.  Unpack the LinkStick adapter, which includes a right-angle adapter.  Plug it in to the back of the Samsung Bluray player.  Turn it on, go to the menu.  Voila.  It sees the adapter and connects to your home network.  Select the correct encryption and password for your access point.  It took me just under 2 minutes and the downloads started.That's the good news.  The bad news is Samsung is essentially ripping off consumers by requiring a proprietary implementation of a stock USB 2.0 wireless 802.11 b/g/n adapter you can get for a third the money.  The difference?  This one has a Samsung tag read by the device that's required by the firmware.If I'd known this when I bought my Samsung Bluray - I'd have bought a different product.

$REVIEW.: Bought this item yesterday and am pretty impressed.  I tried to use the small HD antenna that came with it but I was only able to grab 5 UHF channels (mostly static and in spanish) and two HD channels (one in spanish).  Now maybe if I get a better antenna I will have better results but no such luck with the one included.  I live about 40 miles out of NYC so I thought I would have more luck.  So I decided to run my cable antenna through it instead.  Now I get about 80 basic cable (no HBO for example) channels playing on my computer.  The display is pretty good, a little grainy but thats OK.  You can either view and record with provided software or you can just use Microsoft Media Center (I have Windows Vista).  I like the DVR on Media Center much better than the provided software.  So now the cool thing is I can burn shows onto DVD or transfer them to a portable video player.  For $70 bucks it's very cool.  I might step up and buy a better HD antenna to see if I have any better luck.

$REVIEW.: Noctua makes the best fans and CPU coolers in the market, hands down.  You truly get what you pay for as the saying goes.  This couldn't be more true with this cooler.  Let's get into the review!This kit comes with everything you need.  I know most other kits do, but part of the reason this may be more expensive is you get the cooler (obviously), two fans, all the mounting hardware, plastic vibration strips, a two-to-one cable, and multiple cables to adjust the speed of the fans.  It's the last few items that really make this kit worth it.  Each fan gets 2 cables (so 4) that you can use to slow it down more.  I used one set for the included fans and the others on the rest of my case fans - so it's super quiet now.  The splitter was also helpful in a small case to utilize the limited fan plug-ins a micro-ATX case has.The cooler is great and solid.  Another reason this kit is worth the money are the incredibly easy to follow and accurate installation instructions.  They are written correctly (both in what to do and grammar)!  It is also very detailed and shows each step very well.  This is unlike countless other coolers that seem to show a parts picture and then a fully installed picture.  The cooler is short and fits with ease in my micro-ATX case.  It's shiny and looks very good - this isn't a gaudy product at all and that's what I like.  The edges are sharp, so do install the cooler with some care.  It mounts with a plate on the back of the motherboard and is super sturdy.  You aren't using push-pins that never sit in place right and you aren't going to break your board by torquing the screws in.The fans - Noctua's claim to fame!  You get two 92mm fans with this and they are completely worth it.  They push air and are quiet.  When you add the cables to slow them down more, I honestly think they absorb sound.  You can use 1 or 2 fans depending on your case and cooling needs.  I put both on and it's still quiet and stable and looks great.  It does not block any ram or other stuff on my case.  Excess cable can be easily managed and you can orient the fan in any direction to achieve clean cabling.  My only issue with the fans is they are 'regular' width and with both on, would have hit against my rear case fan.  Obviously these blow the air out the back vent well enough, but it's a point worth noting.  Noctua does make 'slim' 92mm fans that may be worth looking into to save even more space.  (Both on the cooler and for my back case fan).The cooling - the whole point, right? This thing keeps my computer ice cold.  At idle and even running a moderate load, it sits about 5-10 degrees above the ambient temperature.  Doing stress tests it goes 20-25 degrees above on average.  My CPU can overclock, but I haven't with it.  (It's an i-5 2550k that was on sale for a lot less than anything else - I didn't want/need overclocking).  I live in the hot desert so this being able to keep up when the house heats up is great.  Please when you read other reviews who give you specific temps and they seem incredibly low - they probably are.  If you look at the claimed temps, you'll quickly realize these people must be living in a freezer.  Whether you use a tower cooler just pushing air or any type of water cooling set-up, it CANNOT go below the ambient temperature.  It's simple physics folks and even water coolers are using air to cool the radiator.Overall - this is the best cooler I've ever purchased.  It's small, quiet, efficient, and not flashy - all key points for me.  The price is a bit above other items, but you truly get a full box of stuff and the quality of this item is excellent. I will only purchase Noctua CPU coolers going forward and utilize their fans for cases more too. (other case fan makers are great and have more to offer than Noctua at times).  Noctua is also looking out for you as a consumer - they will send you a new mounting kit if a new type comes out that you purchase for up to 6 years.  That's a LONG time to offer something they don't have to.

$REVIEW.: Since Microsoft, in their wisdom, removed Windows Easy Transfer from Windows 8.1, it has been difficult to transfer files and settings to a new Win 8.1 installation. The software bundled with this cable allows for a similar process, and eases the pain of setting up Windows 8.1. I use it in my computer network business whenever a new computer with, or a new installation of Windows 8.1 is required.

$REVIEW.: A pair of video glasses was the only thing on my son's Christmas list this year. After doing a lot of research I was happy to find the Vuzix Wrap 920 Video Glasses in stock through Amazon. For our young middle schooler, the Vuzix are just right: with a nod to other reviews, I can see how adults (such as myself) wouldn't like the size of the glasses for gaming use. On my head, I found the Wrap hard to adjust and not very comfortable, but my 11 yr old had no problem whatsoever. They're now his favourite gaming peripheral for use with the PC and his iPod.I agree that they're not just for TV viewing: for video game play they're great. As an experienced gamer, the (11 yr old) pro says they perform well, are very sharp and no apparent problems. He says the image doesn't appear as big as it's reported, but he says it's great and provides great game play, especially on trips and in the car.The 640x480 screen resolution is fine for most video games and video playback - certainly not HD quality but fine for casual gaming and watching movies. The most challenging thing will be the adjustment of the LCD screens for each eye: alignment and focus takes patience, especially if you use glasses for corrected vision. As noted in other reviews, it takes some dedication to get the glasses focused and fit, but once they are, they're fine. (This could be an issue if different people will be wearing the glasses at different times, but that's not this case in our home).I like that the Wrap comes with the A/V Adapter for iPod/iPhone but wished that the PC / laptop adapter (available directly from the company's website) were also included. Be prepared to pay to connect it to VGA or HDMI. I was delighted that the company processed my online order quickly and shipped the video adapter via USPS Priority Mail, just in time to arrive for Christmas!We also found that if you've have a jailbreak iPhone, the video playback won't work. (This is documented online - just Bing It for more details.) We have not used them with the optional VR module, but one is available (again, directly from the manufacturer).Overall, if you're looking for a pair of video glasses (particularly for smaller heads ;) the Wrap are a good value for the price, especially if you find them on sale. Just be sure to note the limitations on video input out of the box.
$SUMMARY.: Vuzix Wrap 920 are good value video glasses, esp for kids

$REVIEW.: This review is in comparison to the SD850 I just returned.  The SD870 is definitely the focus group evolution of the SD850 (Canon listened to its customers' complaints).  The SD870 on/off button is on top and much easier to access.  There is now a dedicated "review button" (no longer do you need to click the wheel back and forth to proof your shot).  The size and thickness of the cameras are essentially the same, but the SD870 is considerably lighter.  The 28mm lens gives the SD870 a wider shot, but it does have more of the "barrelling effect," but still ever so slight.  The viewscreen is much larger than the SD850 and does very well in direct sunlight.  I am not too particularly concerned with not having a viewfinder in that the SD850 viewfinder is almost cosmetic in nature (no crosshairs, no borders, not accurate).  I prefer using a viewfinder on SLRs, but on compacts I question the usefulness of them.  The start time for the SD870 is a split second faster than the SD850.  All the camera effects that the SD850 has, including facial recognition and color accent are all available in the SD870.  These subtle improvements may not be enough to convince you to dish out a little extra for the SD870, but the bigger screen size, wider lens, and lighter weight were the reasons why I made the switch.  I hope this helps in your decision.

$REVIEW.: I think someone else may have mentioned this, but I'll say it anyway..
it amazes me how many people leave negative reviews and badmouth a product when in reality the problem is their own ignorance
Many of the worries I had after reading the reviews were completely unfounded once I actually got the chance to use this product

I initially purchased a Samsung HW-D550 Sound Bar, but was so mad that it didn't have Anynet+ that I demanded that Dell exchange it


I am so absolutely thrilled with this replacement that I can't even express it! ..

but I'll try

(;The sound is great, as many of the reviews have said

I think it provides plenty of bass -- and trust me, I like a lot of bass


The sub sounds awesome for not having its own power source

Compared to the $350 sound bar I'm returning, the sub has a more well rounded and cleaner sound


Even with the setting on Stereo, only using front speakers and the sub, the sound quality blows a sound bar out of the water


I also love that in addition to preset EQ and DSP settings, there is a User EQ setting with a 6-band equalizer, adjustable six levels in either direction


If you're a bass fanatic and don't mind listening to music (or whatever else) in stereo and not surround, the Giga feature really cranks the bass! For TV, iPod and other external functions, you definitely CAN utilize all the speakers and listen to it in simulated surround

The manual says when listening to music that you must use the Matrix setting -- which works, but isn't the only setting that utilizes all the speakers
Using ProLogic, the sound is typical..
majority coming from the front with little quiet pops of surround from the rear speakers


This isn't ideal for music, which is why the manual says to use the Matrix setting..

it evenly distributes the sound throughout all 5 speakers

This receiver functions just like any other 5.1 receiver I've used

It's not missing any functionality.Anynet+ worked immediately


As soon as I turned the power to the home theater on, my TV pretty much immediately showed the setup screen without me having to press a button
It was smooth sailing from there
The auto sound calibration setup is rather noisy, as it sends loud bursts of a static sound several times to each speaker
I live in an apartment and I was worried about disturbing my neighbors -- I'll have to run the setup during the day

The user interface isn't quite as ugly as someone described it..


I actually like it


I like the font used, and how it has a kind of silver/monochrome background with highlights of color for different items on the screen
Definitely not cheap looking IMO.iPod function worked flawlessly for me
I have a 5th gen Nano, and I connected the USB before powering on


Once I figured out that the iPod had it's own source/function setting, I was off and running with no problems

However, it is rather annoying that if you are in a menu and hit exit by habit that it immediately turns off the music and goes back to the menu
On that note, it sucks that the music stops when you go to the menu/home screen at all


It would be nice if you could set the music to play, then go back to the menu and look at pictures or something


It would also be nice if the connected iPod always charged, and not just when in iPod mode
In any event, the interface works rather well and I'm thrilled to have this capability.The picture seems to be fine..


but honestly, I bought this more for the home theater aspect than the upscaling DVD player, so it was just an added bonus

However, I'm currently watching a low budget DVD that was shot in standard def, and the upscaling definitely makes a big difference

If you've ever watched an 80s or 90s movie on cable that you know wasn't recorded in HD all those years ago, but was somehow remastered or something and shown in HD..


that's what it reminds me of


Really good picture..

just a notch or two below real HD

Although, I just have a 42" Samsung 720p plasma, so I'm not a fanatic or anything.Length of speaker wires was more than enough for me, but I think it's rather absurd that for a wired surround system that they used jack connectors for the speakers with wires that don't unattach from the speaker itself


It's obvious that the speaker wire may have to be run very long distances for large rooms and to avoid walkways, and it's just a big oversight that Samsung wouldn't take into consideration that people may need to add additional wire to suit their needs.This unit is definitely capable of having wireless rear speakers, however like most wireless features today, the adapter is sold separately


The SWA-5000 unit to receive the audio for the rear speakers will run you about $100, and if I'm not mistaken, the wireless adapter (or TX card) is sold separately..


which is about another $100


After all that extra money, I believe the diagram shows that the rear speakers still have to be wired to the SWA-5000 receiving amp..


so it's not truly wireless at all

It is cool that you can cut out the wires in between the front and the back..
but I just don't think it's worth the extra money.I'll come back and edit my reviews as I use the product more, because I just got it today


However, I can overwhelmingly tell you that for a $200 price tag (or cheaper if you find it on sale), this home theater system is AWESOME and definitely worth the money! It has a lot of cool features and really great quality picture and sound

Read the owner's manual if you're not tech savvy and learn the features, and you can enjoy this home theater just as much as others that cost hundreds more
You won't be disappointed!

$review_text.: Most importantly: the sound from this Jambox is excellent and easily fills up a room. Especially with the LiveAudio update, it's great for music and Hulu/Netflix (which is always too quite on my Macbook). The bass is fantastic and clearly it's not going to shake any windows but it adds a good depth that's just not possibly with laptop speakers. Overall I'm incredibly impressed that so much quality can fit into such a tiny box.Audio types I'm listening to (for reference): EDM, Classical, Netflix/HuluFits perfectly in my messenger bag pocket. Battery life is great and I can listen all day without having to recharge. The rubber padding on the bottom could be a little stickier. If I leave it on my wood entertainment center or ceramic counters it'll vibrate itself right off in about five minutes. Luckily falling three feet a few times hasn't caused any harm.Customization is a fun feature that allows the user to change on and off sounds/voices as well as notifications.There is a known issue with the audio-in. They may have fixed this in newer models but on mine, if I plug something directly in it'll stick an internal switch and refuse to play anything via Bluetooth. Initially I thought the entire unit was broken but after reading through forums I just knocked the jambox around and it unstuck. Now I exclusively use Bluetooth without plugging anything directly in.

$review_text.: Here are the things I like about this TV:1) great image: extremely clear, bright, crisp edges, excellent-vibrant colors.2) great UI: the best remote, switches between inputs easily, good TV Guide to browse channels.3) great with standard definition images: best by far of all other TV's.4) great sound: great Sony sound with no need for external speakers like most other flat panels (unless you want 5.1).5) cosmetically appealing: one of the best looking TV's out there.What I don't like:1) flashlighting: yes, this TV does have the dreaded flashlighting that everybody complains about.  It's only visible on less than .5% of images and most of those are the all-black screens when programming switches between a show and a commercial.Conclusion: If you are planning to hook this up directly to cable (perhaps a cable box or a series 2 Tivo) and still plan to watch alot of standard definition TV, this is about the best TV you'll find.  If you are planning on getting an amp, 5.1 speakers, a universal remote, and basically using this set as a monitor only, you might want to move on to a cheaper set because all the UI and sound benefits with the XBR line would not be used.

$REVIEW.: The Klipsch Image S2 are decent headphones. The main selling point to these compared to other earbuds is comfort. The extended nozzle makes them very easy to put in your ear and get a tight seal. Much better and easier than the other IEMs where you have to go around the back of your head, pull your ear up then stick the headphones in. Less fumbling around. During use the headphones are extremely comfortable, I would even say the best Ive used and causes no ear fatigue. Sadly the sound quality is the let down. Bass is decent but loose, doesnt have the punch and slam I am used to. With every recording Ive listened to, whether it be flac or CDs the treble has a hollow sound to it and too bright. If you are looking for accurate sound these are not it. But I guess they can pass for causal everyday use. I will give them an extra star for comfort however even my $18 sony headphones have better sound than these.

Although I had the hardest time getting it to see my computers


I have a brand new custom build will all Intel components running Win7 Pro 64bit and it would not see it

It would only see my 3 year old Acer Win7 64bit Home premium and an old Toshiba laptop running XP media edition


Even though it saw the other 2 computers it would decide randomly not to see them

The first few day it would appear then vanish and just keep doing that

So now a few weeks later the XP machine is always visible but the win7 home premium machine will only be there sometimes...(this is an issue among many peoples device not just mine) When it is there I can watch from it but it just really makes me mad when it disappears

WD definitely needs to fix this issue


This is only the case when accessing computers via the network shares options


If you have a media streaming software like TVersity it will most always see it
But with TVersity you can't stream MKV files and that is the sole reason I purchased this device

So I hope that WD reads this and other people's reviews and releases a firmware upgrade to fix this random issue.

$review_text.: These batteries work as well as, or better, than the OEM batteries for the Fujifilm F550EXR, and you can't beat the price

If you like to use all the fancy bells & whistles of the 550, it's necessary to have a good number of spare batteries -- I got one two pack and will probably get another, just to make sure I never run out of power when I need it
Awesome value, no need to shell out for the OEM.

$review_text.: I'm disappointed in this cover--it functions correctly and properly, but it is not the same color of my iPad which is making me return the item and go for the slightly higher priced item. I also wasn't a fan of the keys not going all the way to the side of the keyboard. I thought this space could be added to slightly larger keys. I used the Logitech keyboard with my iPad 3, loved it, and had high hopes for this keyboard--alas, it wasn't perfect.

$REVIEW.: I selected this lens based on my needs and reviews of other users.  I can't give an in-depth review yet as I've only had it a couple weeks. However, I will say that so far it's performed exactly as I expected & in line with other reviews I've read.My only criticism is only an annoyance. When the lens hood is on, it's difficult to clip the lens cap back on. More often than not, I'll just take the lens hood off when I want to put the lens cap back on then screw the hood back on.

$REVIEW.: So you got a new dslr or you wont to upgrade to a better lens, so here is your answer a fast zoom f/2.8 lens so let me say this its non vc or non vibration control or if you are nikon user it has no  vr so it shoots like a prime  so if you got a twitch or hand shake get a monopod to make it rock steady to get sharp photos. this lens is F/2.8 all the way thru the range from 17mm F/2.8 thru 50mm f/2.8 so its great for lowlight or night time shooting. great for about anything and everything you wont to photo  so go to flicker and search for it and see all the great photos with this lens  and yes  you can manual focus this lens to so for $499 you can get a great,fast lens i will update this review after a few months.......update ok i was using a filter on this lens and the front trim/dust ring came off so ya its true the build quality rumors are true sometimes you get good ones and sometimes you dont but i am not worry because i got the 6yr warranty  so tamron will fix it for free  thats the great thing about this lens you got 6yr warranty with it  and i just love this lens it has exceed everything i thought it would be  if you got a basic nikon D3200 or a advance DX camera just get it you will see why it is so love the I.Q  is just amazing

$REVIEW.: We purchased 14 of these drives for our company. Twelve worked fine and I was able to format them.  Two of them would light up, but just beep faintly.  Windows 7 did not find those 2 drives.  I tried plugging them in to other ports and even other laptops to no avail.  On the Seagate website, many people seem to be reporting the same experience.  Seagate's standard response is that this MAY be a power problem.  However, I plugged the beeping drives into the same ports that other GoFlex FreeAgent drives from the same order work in.  I don't believe it is a power issue.  I believe the drives are defective.  A 14% failure rate seems like very poor quality control

$REVIEW.: Pros:Image quality.Colors.Brightness.No rainbow effect (common problem with DLP projectors, one reason I went with LCD).Good price, lots of value for the money.Cons:Auto-iris makes some noise, can be distracting during movies which very frequently switch between dark and light scenes (recommend positioning projector as far away from seating as possible.. ceiling mounting helps a lot).Blacks aren't as dark as I'd like, but I don't really notice it... the auto-iris helps a lot during dark scenes where it's the most noticeable.Other Thoughts:Using this for my first home theater!  Have some blackout cloth (from carlofet, $30 for 5' x 9') pinned to the wall (as tight as possible) for a screen.  Even though it's 720p, it looks infinitely better than the 19" 1080p hdtv I have been using for a few years lol.

$review_text.: I read quite a few reviews prior to purchasing this board and I was somewhat scared I'd have some issues - so far so good (after a week).This mobo looks and feels well-made, despite not being a higher end board

I really like the on-board power, reset and clear CMOS buttons - it made troubleshooting after turning my newly built rig on all that much easier
UEFI looks nicer than those funky old BIOSes, seems pretty user-friendly (lets face it, if you dont know what most of the stuff means or dont know how to use google, you shouldnt be building a system)


Came with some nice accessories
I also like that there is a PS/2 connector for older keyboards and mice.My complaints - could've used a couple more USB ports on the board (obviously why they included an extra USB 3.0 device), and I cannot fathom why there is an IDE connector on the board for floppy drives (seriously? serously.)


Not enough to take a star away, however


The gold painted caps are kinda overboard too but they look really nice so not really a complaint there.Overall this board is working very well for me so far and I'm pretty happy with my purchase.

$review_text.: I've had this microphone for a number of years, and having just used it for another project, realized I was delinquent in writing a review
I've used everything from free microphones and integral laptop mic's to professional studio mic's while doing various recordings for podcasts and voice overs
Now, to be clear, the sound produced by this little Logitech is far from pro quality...howEVER, for what you pay, you'll be amazed how well it works for simple things like podcasts, narration for PowerPoint presentations, etc.For the recent project I just finished, I only had access to this Logitech microphone, so I put it inside a Porta-Booth from Harlan Hogan (http://www.amazon.com/Harlan-Hogan-Signature-Series-Porta-Booth/dp/B00151YP18/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1299785825&sr;=8-4), and after editing and post processing, realized the quality was not that bad.I have used it in Mac OS 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and currently with 10.6 and it has been totally plug and play
Used it with PowerPoint, iMovie and Garageband without any issues.I don't imagine this mic would be very good for music, or even any remotely serious voice work, because you get what you pay for, but in this case, what you get is pretty good for not paying very much.

$REVIEW.: Update 7/9/10I bought another 740TM from Amazon a few weeks ago. I wanted to give it a thorough test before updating.This one is MUCH better; only one minor problem: it refuses to set a favorite based on the car's current location. It says "Poor GPS reception; are you inside a building?" When I check the satellite status screen, I have a lock on 7 or 8 satellites, so this sounds like a software bug. Best of all, no demo mode! Battery life is slightly disappointing, but you need to keep it plugged in to use the traffic feature, so that's not a big deal.After I bought again, I called TomTom and had a long talk with the support people about the problems I had with the one below. This is what I found out.1) This version of the GO has an updated GUI. The menu bar is now divided into 3 sections rather than 2, with the new center section being devoted to switching between 2D and 3D views. If you're following a route, the menu returns to its prior appearance (i.e., from earlier models); if you press the center section, though, you get the 2D/3D switch menu.2) The current versions of the maps and the navcore app are not getting along when it comes to traffic. They were supposed to update maps or app (can't recall) to make them compatible by sometime in July 2010. They advised me to call them before downloading a new map as part of the lifetime map guarantee.3) They said there are some issues with "Operate My Go" in TomTom Home. You can't do everything you can if you were using it manually. Some menu items are grayed out, and some do not even appear.In terms of use, the traffic seems to work pretty well, and in response to a commenter on this review, the 740TM is supposed to have lifetime traffic. The Live services are what costs after the first 3 months. Speaking of which, the gas search is kind of cool, but the Google search is next to useless; I was trying to get movie times and all I could get, no matter which search terms I used, were the theatre locations. I doubt that I will keep paying for this service. The new Garmin 1490T has free Google search for 2 YEARS, and after that it's only $5/month, I think. That model seems to have some issues too, though.Anyway, glad I waited and bought another. I gave it 4 stars because nothing's perfect, and this has enough quirks (favorites marking, google search) to make it less than perfect.Update 6/10/10TomTom tells me that to fix problem 3, below, I must delete a folder called "scripts" from the unit while it is attached to my PC. That's all well and good, but it's advertised (as I well know because of this very problem) as working right out of the box. You can use it, supposedly, without ever having to attach it to your computer.6/4/10Where to begin?I received this less than 24 hours ago, and already it has been such a problem that I'm sending it back.1) There is supposed to be a promotion code/activation code in the box that enables the lifetime maps. It was not there. The TomTom support representative to whom I spoke asked me to look again. And again. And again. I finally told her that the box was not the size of a hotel room, and that there simply was no such code. So, in order to get a code, I have to scan my receipt showing that indeed it is 740 TM and not just 740 or 740T. Then I have to upload that to their site. Finally, they want me to CALL THEM BACK to tell them that I've uploaded it. Yeah, I'm going to wait 40 min on hold for that. Customer service people are OK, but customer service POLICIES blow. In any case, she said that this would not affect usage, just map updates in the future.2) Ha. In the car, the traffic doesn't work. I get the message "Your RDS-TMC receiver will not work in combination with the current map." A little research tells me that this usually happens when people buy a unit in the US and take it to Europe, or vice versa. Clearly, I have not done that. Strike 2.3) The unit seems to be stuck in Demo mode. After 2 minutes, the map goes away and I am treated to a slide show advertising the virtues of the 740. It would be nice if these features actually worked. Research says I should be able to disable this by resetting the unit. Unsurprisingly, that does not work. Strike 3.4) Today I find that, even after charging it overnight, the unit will not stay powered on when not connected to power. I get the message "Shutting down your GO 740 Live in 10 seconds." I search the web, and there is a "Shut down when disconnected from power" option buried in the setup menus. I know that it is not checked because I went through every setting, but I look anyway. Not checked. Strike 4.For a company that advertises "it works right out of the box," this is egregiously poor quality control. I will probably order another when Amazon has them in stock again (1-2 months, according to the product page). When I do get it, I will call customer service and set it up with them on the phone. There are way too many "gotchas" for a product advertised as working right out of the box.This would have been my third TomTom. I had a GO 300 that I sold to upgrade to a 730, which was stolen. I never really even considered another manufacturer, because TomTom had the features I wanted and, for me, usability was perfect. Maybe it's time to check out Garmin and Magellan, but I'm guessing that to get even similar functionality, I'm going to have to pay a whole lot more.Very disappointed in TomTom.

The unit is small and has his own carrying case, the quality is good but my concern is the ability to put on a Canon 5D Mark III and shoot time lapse it's just not stable enough for that.

$REVIEW.: I have a few excellent Pentax lenses, which I use on Sony NEX 5N as fully manual. So when K01 went on sale, I decided to get one. I expected the same image quality, plus AF, plus image stabilization, plus aperture control. The K01 fell short in every department. The image quality is nowhere as good as I was getting from Sony: the noise noticeably higher (both OOC jpegs and RAW), the resolution and contrast also noticeably worse, and colors, especially at high ISO are not even close to Sony. I didn't notice if image stabilization added anything, and the AF is pretty much useless. AF is so slow I can manually focus with Sony focus peaking at the same speed, it's also less reliable than focusing manually. After seeing these results I shipped the camera back, even though I paid under 300 bucks for it.

$review_text.: I did a lot of research on BT headphones before settling on these and what I found was that there were four main areas to consider in searching for the ideal BT headphone.The first is whether the headphone is comfortable or not

Headphones that sit on the ear tend to cause your ears to get sore after a few hours


This can be frustrating


This Sony pair sits over the ear which creates a much more comfortable experience.Design was another area of emphasis

I have many bizarre looking headphones in my computer room but in public you want something that's sleek and allows you to blend in


This Sony BT headphone looks absolutely stunning


It's a very sharp design with quality materials.Sound quality is another area of importance
These support AAC and APT-X along with older BT transfer methods

They're BT 4.0 which offers the latest and greatest sound in consumer electronics.Lastly is the price
Some of these headphones can go upward of $300

The recent price cut from Sony has these at just under $150
Nothing really compares

Beats and Sennheiser headphones with similar tech tend to be all upward of $200

The cheaper brands aren't nearly as sleek and usually lack the technical features of this set (NFC, APT-X, etc.)These come with a pretty useless bag to carry around in

It's made of quality materials but the shape isn't sturdy like the bag that comes with the Sennheiser BT headphone


On the other hand the audio cable is made of extremely durable material


Though the cable is stuck with a right angle connector on one end


I've seen other headphones with mechanical connectors that switch from right angle to straight, this would've been a nice feature on the aux cable.Another disappointment is that some of the features on this headphone are not being accepted by consumer tech companies

Apple mobile devices like the iTouch5 do not support either NFC or APT-X
The Google Nexus 5, less than half a year old, does not support APT-X
 With how good these sound even without APT-X, I wonder if they might have been wiser to remove both APT-X and NFC and release these at an even lower price, or maintained the price and added other features (perhaps the ability for multipairing).Regardless of the direction of the BT headphone, I feel I got a great value on this product
The sound is really impressive and I can't imagine there are any headphones on the market that sound much better given the limitations of the BT standard.

Taking 800+ pictures while completing the Wonderland trail, it comes in handy to help remember exactly where each photo was taken.  While looking at properties for sale on a really big lake, I took photos from the boat and then imported them to Lightroom.

The speakers sound crystal clear and the quality of the cable are similiar or better than the cables you'd spend triple the price on. I would suggest using these cables as they are great.

$REVIEW.: After not getting enough range with their 150 router, I returned it and got the 300.  To be brief, it worked immediately when I plugged it in, and it delivers a really strong signal with no loss of speed through 4 or 5 walls to my laptop in the most distant location in the house.  I did have a question for customer service and they answered promptly.  The followup emails the manufacturer sends after a purchase are a very nice touch.Yes as some have mentioned, the blue lights are a bit bright. Our router is located behind a TV that we often watch with the room darkened, so I simply put a piece of masking tape over the LEDs. Problem fixed!
$SUMMARY.: Strong signal, good download speeds, excellent customer service

$review_text.: I purchased this item because a friend of mine had one and told me how great it was. When I received it it side edges were not flush to the screen, there was 1/4&#34; gap between the case and the glass in the middle, narrowing toward the top and bottom. I thought it would eventually come down, sometimes they just take a while to get broke in.After using it for a few months, the exterior fabric is coming loose from the interior material, cardboard or whatever. There are little folds and creases of 'leather' everywhere.I am going to be traveling for a few days and decided to take the case off and use the Apple iPad Smart cover for the weight issue. And what did I discover? Scratches all the way around the glass by the bezel. It is not a random scratch here or there, it is scratched all the way around, the lightest in the cornersNow, lest you think I keep a cruddy iPad. I have had an iPad since the first one released. I have had multiple cases and covers. This is my third case. I know how to keep the crud out from under the edges of a case. I know how to do it without removing the case and without scratching the screen.Snugg clames to have a lifetime guarantee on their iPad covers and cases. I will not be bothering to try to get this replaced. It is junk. I do not want more junk. I would like my money back, but will not be pursuing it because I don't want someone telling me this is my fault. Do not buy this cover. It will damage a very expensive device an you will just have to deal with it.

$REVIEW.: Really impressed. Even for the price i paid these are LOUD with great quality sound. The bass is great, i love the little control unit as well.The one drawback i'd include with this is the speakers are a bit too sensitive to whatever direction theyre facing. That is to say, if the speakers aren't directly facing you, they suffer a great deal of clarity unless you jack the volume much louder than necessary.

$review_text.: I was (and continue to be) a huge fan of the 1st generation Astro but Anker has upped the ante with the 2nd generation


 Here are some key points after about 3 months of putting it through its paces.The new baby includes 1 "smart" USB charging port and 2 "universal" ports and between the 3 ports it can support up to 4A output


 The 1st generation only had 2 ports.The 1st generation required a separate wall wart style AC charger whereas the 2nd generation will charge simply using a Micro USB cable plugged into any computer USB port or a USB wall plug.I am amazed at how much power Anker has managed to pack into the 2nd Generation Astro3
 With 12000mAh of power, I can charge my 2013 Nexus 7 tablet 3 TIMES or my Samsung Galaxy SIII 5+ TIMES


 This is more than enough charging power to last for a long weekend getaway.I also like the new "soft touch" coating and buttonless exterior of this model

 The thing just looks gorgeous (and intriguing!) and feels nice and solid.Charging the battery itself does take a good while, but that should be expected considering the capacity of this battery.The ONLY thing I can think of that would make this product better would be if it included any of Anker's wall or car chargers so you have the ability to charge it right out of the box, but that's not a deal breaker by any means.I would definitely recommend this to a friend

 This one's a winner, Anker!

$SUMMARY.: Great improvement over the 1st generation!

$REVIEW.: I have the D700 and D200.  The lens arrived while the big camera was at the camera doctor, so I got to test drive it on the D200.  Nice range and nice operation in low light/indoor setting (I took shots at a surprise birthday party a few days after it arrived).  The VR does it's job and the zoom was not sloppy.  I have a few shots that brought my attention to hot pixels on the D200, but that's no knock on the lens.  A couple of outdoor shots at close subjects proved that the focus is solid. This is going to get a lot of use as a carry around lens on both cameras.

No other mobile device matches what iPod touch has. The screen is just AMAZING. What's even more amazing is that iPod touch is half the size of an iPhone.Pros:-very light, thin-not plastic, doesn't feel cheap in your hands-amazing hi-res (Retina) display that no other device can (still) match-App Store with over half-a-million apps and games-Facetime, Skype!-Microphone, little speaker, Bluetooth, Gyroscope, Digital-Compass and long-lasting batteryCons:-although the screen is Retina, it is not IPS technology (slightly dims when looking from different angles)-low-res camera (sometimes you want to take a nice photo for Instagram, but it's quite grainy)-no 16GB optioniPod touch is great, it serves as an extension to so many things at home.

$review_text.: I bought this to replace a DIR-615 which had started having horrible speed recently.  It was very easy to setup but the initial performance was terrible.  Two bad routers in a row seemed unlikely so I started playing with some other new devices I bought recently and discovered that the Lorex baby monitor I bought a few months ago was causing the interference.  Turn off the baby monitor  and I get ~16 mbps (SpeedTest.net); with the baby monitor turned on, I get &#60;1 Mbps.  I blame the baby monitor as the culprit here so I'm giving Amped 4 stars.

 It was cheaper to buy this enclosure and take out the 4TB drive then it was to buy a bare drive

 Getting the drive out of the enclosure was a bit tricky

 There are some videos online that show how you do it though

 I did plug it in once while it was still in the enclosure to see how it worked and how the software looked


 It looks pretty nice and straight forward and I wouldn't mind recommending it to a non-tech person

 I didn't see any option for it to backup a &#34;system image&#34;

 I don't understand why that's not more common
 I know it's more on the geek side but I'd personally want a whole system image over just backing up my pictures, email, etc
 I know some people complain about how hot it gets but I haven't noticed it much

 It would probably do better at getting rid of heat if the case was aluminum instead of plastic but I'm sure they wanted to save some money there.

$REVIEW.: I initially purchased the Zaggkeys cover and really loved everything about it - design, quality, build, etc.  Only problem with it was a major problem.  I couldn't type with it.  I kept having typos and mistakes and thought initially it was just me getting used to a new keyboard.  Googled the problem and found others also had the problem with repeat key strokes.  So the Zaggkeys cover went back and I ordered the Logitech Ultra Thin as my 2nd choice.  This review is actually for the latest version which has the groove that is adjustable for multiple viewing angles for the iPad.I'm actually glad that the Zaggkeys didn't work out because I actually like the Logitech better.  What I like about the Logitech is:+  lightweight and ultra thin - this is one of the lightest and thinnest out there - the white color compliments the white iPad and looks like a perfect match+  very easy to get the iPad in and out of the typing mode - lift out or put in the magnetic groove and good to go+  best thing is that the typing is perfect - keys all work fine with no double strokes and no typos coming from the keyboard-  the magnets are not as strong as they could be - work fine to turn off the iPad but you need to be cautious with the groove magnets - iPad is fine when in typing mode but need to hold on when carrying the keyboard and iPad as a set

 The autofocus motor is MUCH quieter, build is more robust, the light gathering capabilities are so much better, the depth of field can be razor sharp, the bokeh glorious

 However, this lens tends to be finicky about focusing

 I popped it in my Onkyo TX-NR616 and I was streaming internet radio in about three minutes

 I'm very happy with my AVR and this dongle to bring wifi to it.

$review_text.: This is just a sleeve so it isn't thick but the padding is just right for the purpose of protecting your laptop from everyday scratches when you're not using it. It is exactly as described, reversible (since I've read reviews that some buyers did not get a reversible sleeve), completely black one side and completely red on the other. The measurements are right and fits my Toshiba laptop snug. The only down side about the sleeve is that it has a strong plastic smell, but then again, you get what you pay for and the smell will eventually die down over time. It's not everyday you find a laptop sleeve for under $3! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

I rarely am fast enough to get software. So when I got this item I was SUPER excited.The Corel Paint It isn't a bad product. It's neat if you want to playw ith your photos or make fun scrapbook projects. I honestly was looking for a bit more to the software.

$REVIEW.: I was shooting pictures of a BMW X3 for a magazine test-drive article.  My San Francisco-based editor was along for the ride. When I pulled out my Canon EOS 1V, she exclaimed, "You still shooting film?" Yes, I am. Or more accurately, was. For even a slow-moving guy like me, when fate steps in to help me make the decision, I get it.Here's the deal: My favorite film - Fuji Velvia 50 - was discontinued.  My E-6 film processor went out of business. A friend - a Nikon Tech Rep - spent an hour convincing me that digital was the best way to go for my magazine work. Finally, he said that the Nikon D70s was the sweet spot when you consider price, quality and performance. Bottom line, this is the camera to have if I was going to dip my toe in the digital water. When I expressed a concern about the number of megapixels, he made a point that 6 megapixels was all I needed. I was still worried but he showed me sample prints and I was convinced.  Oh yeah, my editor has the old Nikon D70 and she has shot several covers with it and lots of full page shots. They too looked good so I placed my order for a D70s.I have just received it so I don't have a lot to say about the camera except that it feels great in my hand. The manual is very well written. The controls are just where they need to be - experienced Nikon users will feel at home immediately.Another selling point - It uses compact flash cards so I can share them with my Canon point-and-shoots. In fact, I almost bought the D50 - a good camera that's a lot cheaper - but it uses the SD format cards. An expense that would blow the savings away as soon as I bought a couple of 1 gig cards.The built-in flash is a bit weak for pro use but since it's there, I don't have to buy a new flash just yet.I plan to use the D70s in 2006 for all my magazine work and thereby save its cost in film and procesing.  If it all works out as planned, I'll upgrade to the D200 when the price drops a bit on that camera and then use this one as my backup.Five stars for now - we'll see later.Update - I shot at the Cloisters in NYC on Christmas Eve.  The camera was easy to handle. The pictures had good color. Afterward, I made a large blow up (8X12) from a JPEG (Fine, Large) and the picture was quite sharp and had good tonal range.Still looking good.Second Update - A shot I took with the D70s with a Nikon 80-200 f:2.8 just was published as the cover picture and it's amazing. Seriously sharp, good color and (dare I say) better than film. And that's with just 6 megapixels.  I believe that most readers (meaning all non-pros AND many profesionals) would find this camera all you need and more.One or two minor gripes after 6 months of hard use and a few raves. The motor drive is too slow for motorsports - 3 fps is not enough. The build-in flash is convenient but with my 20-35 F:2.8 on the camera, anything shot close-up gets a nasty shadow.The battery still rocks - hundreds of shots and no charge needed.As for storage - with a 2 Gig card, it's like 10 rolls of film in the camera. Two 2 Gig cards and you could do a week's vacation without recharging and downloading.I have 3 articles I wrote and illustrated with this camera coming out in a couple of weeks. More on the camera then.PS - The new Nikon N80 is a 10MP camera (like the D200) - that tells me that the D70s is not long for this world. Discount / closeout / good used camera buys are sure to follow.

$review_text.: Replaced a 12" JBL Venue series subwoofer that literally caught on fire internally


Before that I thought the sub was very good to great sounding, but was uncomfortable with the safety factor after the fire

This Polk subwoofer meets or beats it in sound quality and I would say it beats it in the ability to transfer the rumble to the room

It seems tight and the rattle free, well built overall
Not quite as nice looking as the JBL, but who cares, it sits hidden in the corner of the room as most subwoofers do

The dark grille cloth helps it just disappear
Are there better subs out there? Of course, but at this price I doubt it


This is an outstanding buy at just under $200


I have heard subs in the $800 range that didn't perform any better so I am pleased
Amazon shipped quickly even with the super saver free shipping


Package was in perfect shape


Glad to have the boom back in my system.

While this did not make much of a difference in a Generic Lens Hood to me the following did:1- When attached for storage or use on the lens, it clicks into place but wobbles loosely.2- The Fotodiox 28-135mm Canon Lens Hood, was flocked on the inside of the hood, this one is NOT, and is of a reflective black plastic, and WILL PRODUCT Ghosting in your Photo's.3- The thickness of the Plastic is of a lesser grade than the Fotodiox 28-135mm Canon Lens Hood, lighter, and not completely rigid but a little flexibleAll in all Fotodiox must have switched the Manufacturers of these hoods, as this one is NOT UP TO THE STANDARD of previous purchases from this Company.Disappointed to say the Least!Suggested Optional Lens Hood that I ended up purchasing as a replacement for the Fotodiox Lens Hood:  Adorama Dedicated Lens Hood for Canon EF 28-200 USM Lens (EW-78D)This item fits properly, is thoroughly Flocked on the inside, and is of durable not flexible or flimsy Plastic!!

I immediately took it to the sink and did a very quick full rinse under the faucet for a few seconds.  Then let it to dry overnight.  Still works perfectly.  The manual recommended not to drench it fully but I did and it survived.  I got it for cheap.  I would buy it again mainly.It does have a very cheap plastic that helps it elevate slightly.  It detaches easily.  So make sure you close it up when transferring it because I almost lost it once when i put it in a bag.  There is also light indicator for scroll lock, cap lock, and number lock.

$REVIEW.: nice as it looked the day I got it, there are plenty of loose threads to be fixed on it. The shoulder strap has padding on it that I swear is meant to make it easier to carry, but since mine is not yet worn in, it slides right off my shoulder. I'm often looking through my viewfinder when it decides to slip off my shoulder and jerk my elbow, swing and hit me in the crotch. There was no manual, but I assume the adjustable hoops on the front are to hold a tripod or monopod, neither of which I would recommend. My tripod falls out when I'm walking and my monopod smashes into every door frame I walk through. It's a sturdy padded bag. It has several compartments and is enough to keep me organized.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this 200 series stylus to accompany my 300 series one, which I've had for about two months. Love them both immensely. The 200 series had a bit more heft, which I like a lot, and I like the more natural pen look. 300 series had held up well, so I expect this one will as well. No problem with the nib. In fact, it almost conforms to the way you write after a little while. Plus, it's super smooth and hasn't left one scratch on my iPad screen. All of my other (MANY) styluses are stored away now that I've got my GoSmart styluses. Totally recommend this one.Plus, the seller is amazing. Can't lose, IMO.

(I still had to use the back space key 100 times)This thing is terrible. The keyboard does not register half the key strokes and the mouse stutters.An amazing piece of crap, returning immediately. Anker owes me an hour of my life back. I think Anker wrote the other 100 reviews.**** UPDATE 12/04/13After my non-stellar review, on my cell phone, I got a call from Anker. To make a long story short.... I returned my original keyboard to Amazon for a refund. Anker sent me a replacement unit at their expense. The replacement unit works fine. It's solidly built, nice and small. It is about the same size as a laptop keyboard. The mouse is decent also. Honestly, I have not used it that much for a complete review, but it seems to do what I want.Now, in regards to them calling my cell phone. I'm pretty pissed off that Amazon shares my personal information with their suppliers. I consider that an invasion of my privacy. I could swallow an email from Anker, but a call on my cell phone crosses the line. I am going to take that up with Amazon.I would give a 5 star review had everything gone smoothly with the first unit but it gets a 4 for the first unit being defective. I left the review at 1 so people may actually read this review. Anker, if you want me to change it to a 4, I will. Just stop calling me. It's annoying.

I recommend you use some decent scotch tape instead.- Watch a YouTube video before installing, they show proper ways on how to install the product.- Wash your hands and make sure you don't have any dandruff or something in your hair.- Try to install without directly looking over while installing, for hair and other objects may interfere.

But I suppose that there are a ton of reviews that will cover the specs of the Mac much better than I want to here. I just wanted to encourage the Buyer that buying on Amazon is a great choice.I was able to save a few hundred dollars over the Apple Store and take the MacBook into the Apple Store and buy AppleCare there. Thus I get all the support I want from the local store, while saving money by buying from Amazon.

$review_text.: After purchasing my 7&#34; Kindle HDX last fall I immediately set about searching for a case for my new device. Amazon of course recommended the Origami Case which is seemingly the companies own brand of HDX case. I was immediately put off by the price. Despite how innovative the design may be I just couldn't justify spending $60 on a case (the price at the time). The price has no dropped and I was recently afforded the chance to try out the Origami. So here are my thoughts:--------------------DESIGN:Amazon has every reason to tout the design of the Origami Case. This is really a neat and innovative product. At the end of the day, yes, it's still just a case but how it gets the job done is wherein lies the difference. First, the HDX is held in place entirely by magnets that are built into the back cover. The magnets are sufficiently strong to prevent the HDX from moving around or slipping in the cover. This feature is great because removing the HDX doesn't require prying it loose from a plastic (or another material) back cover. I also have a Belkin case that uses a plastic snap-in style back cover that is difficult to pry loose. No such problems here.The front flap fits perfectly over the HDX and also has built-in magnets to secure the cover to the device. The front flap has multiple uses too. It protects the HDX, obviously. The magnet secures the front flap while also serving to automatically awaken or put the HDX to sleep. Waking the HDX is as easy as opening the flap. Putting the device to sleep (or shutting the screen off) is as simple as closing the flap. I love this feature and in over a week of constant use it has worked perfectly every time! Lastly, the front flap folds (the origami part) and is held in place by more magnets to form a stand. The folding action is simple and intuitive and after doing it once you'll get it immediately. It's a matter of simply pressing both sides of the front flap so that it folds along the creases, then flipping the flap back until it secures.--------------------USE:As I mentioned earlier the sleep/wake function that's accomplished by the built-in magnets has worked perfectly every time for me. I understand that at least initially some folks were having issues with the device shutting down when the cover was folded back in what I call &#34;reading mode&#34;. That has not been the case with me.In stand mode the case has performed similarly well. The device is held securely and doesn't slide even on surfaces like granite counter-tops. The magnets in the case are sufficiently strong to hold everything in place while giving easily when you want to change the configuration.--------------------WHAT I LIKE:(+) Cool looking, innovative design(+) The extras that separate this case from the pack, mainly the built-in magnets, work perfectly.(+) I love the auto sleep/wake function(+) The case provides a good level of protection for the HDX(+) Polyurethane construction seems rugged and built to last and still pleasant to the touch(+) The price is finally right. Especially compared to other cases that are significantly inferior yet priced comparatively.--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE:(-) When the back flap is folded back (reading mode) it's impossible to reach the power or volume buttons without loosening the magnets on the back first.(-) Not sufficiently rugged enough to protect the HDX from major drops, bumps, spills or toddlers.--------------------CLOSING:Amazon's Origami Case is much more than a simple case or stand. The innovative design carries beyond how the case folds into a stand and integrates perfectly with the HDX. Most definitely recommended!

$REVIEW.: Although the switch has an input for an AC adapter, none came with the product. No problem until about a month ago when we switched our DirectTV equipment to the Genie. The switch was not sensitive enough to the signal from the Genie to recognize that it needed to switch to that channel and I could not even manually get it to stay on that channel. As a result I disconnected the switch and ended up buying a more expensive, AC powered switch. This switch may do the job for you depending on the equipment you are trying to manage with it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this in February, 2012 to use for nightly backups of my Windows 7 machine. Today I started getting "Failed to read from sector '183,830,120' of hard disk '1'" errors during backups.  Repeated attempts give me failures on other sectors.Now I get to buy a replacement and copy all my old backups from this failed drive to the new one.  What fun.

$REVIEW.: I bought this LED Sony TV to replace the larger LCD Sharp that was moved to another room. I wanted to make the room feel bigger since it would be in a relatively small space.  Overall, I am impressed with the brightness of the TV and how quickly the picture appears. I have gotten used to LCD TVs taking several seconds to appear that I am pleasantly surprised when I use this TV.One of the main reasons I purchased this TV was because it had integrated Amazon Prime Streaming capability. I tested it on the first day, and it worked great.

$REVIEW.: I replaced the HDD in our 4ish year old HP TouchSmart with the 750GB version of this drive.This is my first SSD as a primary drive (played with a small one a while back as a boot drive), but to say that it woke up the computer would be an understatement


 Having everything on a SSD makes things so much smoother than with a HDD in the mix.Result: Stuff that's on the internet still takes time to load as you might expect (limited by my &#34;meager&#34; 10MB cable internet), but things already on the drive open seemingly as fast as the mouse clicks


Any faster and it would have to read my mind

To say that I'm impressed with SSD tech (when used as a primary drive) is an understatement.I can't imagine how fast it would be on more current hardware
(my MOBO is only SATA II capable, so I am only using half of the speed this SSD is capable of.)Yes it works fine on older SATA hardware, it just cuts the speed to the slowest element in the chain
 This drive is SATA III capable, but runs superbly in my SATA II system.I chose to do a clean fresh Win8.1 install, and did not use any restore options

 I had backed up just our files (pics/docs/videos, etc.....) on an external HDD before the swap, and re-installed them manually


 It's a little more work this way than using the old drive to clone, but the fresh start got rid of lots of things we don't use, which saved some space.Don't forget to order a drive carrier if this is replacing a 3.5&#34; drive like in my install


 For me, I put this SSD in a 3.5&#34; drive carrier, then put that into my HP computers drive carrier, and snapped it in

$REVIEW.: My iPod is a little over five years old now and this is the second battery I've replaced in it. Since I use my iPod solely for listening to the music in my car, I can't have it hogging the charger as I have other devices that need power as well. this was a perfect replacement for my battery.The tools worked perfect, and now that the battery is fully conditioned it works like new.I rolled the dice on this because it only had 3 stars and a lot of bad reviews, but it worked perfect for me. Just be sure to watch some YouTube videos so you know you're installing it correctly.. I.E. not putting the ribbon in backwards, or pinching/damaging the ribbon due to the battery being flipped the wrong way.

$REVIEW.: The Philips TiVo HDR112 Personal TV Receiver was super easy to hook up and setup. It takes only 5 minutes to make all the necessary connections. It does require a 1-2 hour set up, which is mostly an automatic download of  the channel line up and programming data.TiVo will completely change the  way you watch TV.  It really does learn your likes and dislikes and it will  automatically suggest and record shows and movies that it thinks you will  enjoy. Its really uncanny how it DOES pick shows and movies I enjoy.  You'll probably end up never flipping channels looking for something to  watch or watch &quot;live TV&quot; ever again.  Just make sure you go for  the 30 hour model as the 15 will fill up very quickly.TiVo has been the  best first generation product I have ever owned. Don't be afraid to take  the leap into Personal TV as it is really very easy to use and the  recording quality is MUCH better than with VCRs.

$REVIEW.: ...received power supply unit in good condition and well packed
Installed easily except for two minor problems: way too short connector cord between motherboard and DVD unit - had to order extension


Also, only one video card power connector..


needed two - had to order adapter (both available on Amazon for several dollars each - shipping actually cost more than the items - but easier and cheaper in the short run than running to a brick/mortar store - probably only to find they'd have to order the item anyway.) This unit solved several issues on computer that older defective power supply caused

$review_text.: The name says it all! Anker has done a superb job getting crystal clear audio in a small package. The BT speaker literally fits in the palm of your hand - it's so smooth and easy to hold without comprise to sound quality.Obviously, this device doesn't compare to large boomboxes or speaker systems; however, the loudness is still notable for the size of the product. More importantly, the clearness in songs and phone calls is exceptional. You won't use your iPhone speaker after using this speaker. It's that good.The portability aspect of the product is what tops this product over the edge. You can keep it in the car, in your pocket, in a backpack, anywhere really. It's just so small and easy to carry. With two simple buttons, it's easy to operate and fun to use!Unfortunately, the device does not encompass an Aux port, but in this age Bluetooth is more than enough. The range is average for BT products.Overall, a great job here Anker - the company has been able to compact the product without losing the most important aspects. An impressive achievement.

$review_text.: i have tried a couple of ipad keyboards and after testing them, I firmly believe this one is the best.The ones I have tried out were Sharkk keyboard case, Anker, and Logitech.The Sharkk keyboard case actually looks EXACTLY like this one with the keys, layout, and everything. But when I tested it, some of the keys would not respond at all. I would have to hit them twice in order to make out my word, and when you are in a fast paced typing situation, there are multiple typos that follow this. Also the &#34;lock&#34; key was at the top and for some reason I would accidentally hit it a lot. The &#34;lock&#34; key for the New Trent Airbender is at the top as well, but the difference is that you have to hit &#34;fn&#34; to activate the lock key or it wont work. this prevents me from accidentally locking it.Logitech was the same way, in which it was very slow to respond to my typing so it would cause lots of errors.Since I am reviewing about the New Trent Airbender, I'll focus on it- the keyboard layout is a good size. When the keyboard is smaller (such as the Logitech one), it feels unnatural and it takes a while to get used to. I feel with the New Trent keyboard, I felt I was able to tap the keys correctly, without feeling confused. Also- the keys respond VERY quickly! They are on point just like a computer keyboard. I really like this because I am a fast typer, and when I typed on the other keyboards I was constantly making mistakes because they wouldn't respond fast enough to input what I was typing or wouldn't type a specific letter at all. With the New Trent keyboard I am at ease with typing.It also has an auto wake feature. So when I close it, it will put the ipad to sleep and lock it, and when I open it, it will do vise versa. The top row function keys work properly as they should.I also love that there is 2 slots where your ipad can be positioned because on some keyboards it only had 1 position, so you had to adjust yourself to the keyboard to get comfortable. With the New Trent, you can position it closer or farther and it also has a tilt feature. So you can adjust it to your comfortability.I also enjoy the fact that it has a caps lock light and charging light. minor things, but they come in handy.The keyboard is not backlit, but if you're in the dark it can be easily seen from your ipad light.The outer back shell case over the ipad seems pretty sturdy and will protect my ipad (I have the ipad 4 retina)would highly recommend for anyone looking for an ipad keyboard that acts as a case as well.If you like the other keyboards that act as a stand, such as the Logitech and Anker, there are back shell TPU cases you can purchase that can protect the back of the ipad. BUT these cases will only fit on the Logitech keyboard, NOT the anker. I've tested it on both. It is too big for the Anker slot, but the magnetic hold on the Logitech keyboard is strong enough to hold it.
$review_summary.: this is the best ipad keyboard case out there

$REVIEW.: I have purchased 2 LG DVD recorders in the past 3 months. Both have failed.Both the 787T and the 897T take a very long time to "read" and the manual is difficult to figure out. The VCR records but playback is flipping and rolling, recording on DVD takes a long time to finalize afterward. Also the 897T would shut itself off after a short period on timed recordings even though recording time was set for 2 hours. I discovered thru a different forum the reason for this is that some of the commercials are now copy protected so when your timed recording gets to the commercial, it shuts itself off. This is so you can't fast forward through their commercials. I thought the recorder was defective??? Who knew??? LG is no help. They tried to tell me my problem was that I wasn't using the specified brand of DVD-R discs even though the manual states that it will accept any major brand of media.They also couldn't tell me how to view a VHS tape and record it on DVD at the same time. I had to find out from another forum.So after all that, I decided that I would buy a Toshiba DR560 and just hook up my old VCR to it and save myself the headache of trying to make the LG work.
$SUMMARY.: LG needs to go back to the drawing board

$REVIEW.: This is a personal cloud drive/backup device for Windows/Macs/tablet computers (Apple/Android). In the box, you will find the LinkStation unit with 1 3 Tb drive installed, an 80&#34;(2m) Ethernet cable for connecting the unit to your router, a power cord, a CD with LinkStation software, and 2 paper quickstart guides, one for computers and one for handheld devices. The quickstart pages are image-based, language-free.Installation of the LinkStation unit took 20 minutes for me from the time I opened the box. Much of that time was actually spent puzzling over the quickstart guide, trying to deduce the meanings of the images since there are no words. However, once I figured out how to read the pictures, there were no false starts, and the drive was visible on my network as soon as I made my way to the end of  the quickstart guide. One odd point about the quickstart guide is that the photos seem to suggest the drive should be set up vertically for operation, with 60 mm (2.4&#34;) clearance from the sides and top. Yet, the device itself has vents on the two long narrow edges and solid broad sides. If you set up the device as shown in the pictures, one of the vented edges serves as the bottom of the device, facing the flat surface of your desk. The &#34;bottom&#34; vent suggests to me that maybe the device would get better circulation if set up horizontally so that both the long narrow edges are in the air as sides and the 2 solid broad edges serve as the top and bottom.Once the physical installation is complete, then comes the &#34;fun&#34; part--trying to actually set up the drive to share files. At the bottom of the quickstart sheet is a cryptic web address. I typed it in and found it was a link to the full manual, which I downloaded in PDF format. I began working my way through the manual. Chapter 2 had me open EasyAdmin and start setting up access to my drive. I changed my admin password and read through the advanced settings as shown in the guide. I installed the SmartPhone navigator app (for managing LinkStation access) on my Android tablet without any problems, but the WebAccess app would not install (wouldn't install to the default location), so I'll have to find some alternate method for accessing my files from my tablet. Chapter 3 is about setting up remote access. I followed the instructions exactly for set up for my computer, but got an error message &#34;WebAccess is not configured correctly. Click here to view the user manual.&#34; Clicking on &#34;here&#34; took me right to the very page I had been reading in the PDF manual. Instruction 6 on that page gave me a new Buffalo address to access. That took me to a sign in page, and my sign in was rejected because I didn't have an account, and there was no link on the sign in page to create an account. In reading back through the manual, it seems there ARE instructions for creating the needed account for handheld devices. So I had to go to my tablet to create the Buffalo account. Once I created the account and password on my tablet, I tried again to follow the instructions for setting up WebAccess on my computer. Still no go. I guess that's a battle to fight later when I feel like an IT challenge. Chapter 4 of the manual was about restricting access to shared folders, but since I haven't been able to set up WebAccess, I skipped that section.Chapter 5 of the manual was about managing storage, starting with RAID. Since this system has just 1 physical drive and I need all 3 Tb for storage, I guess I won't be using RAID features with this system. This chapter also notes how the LinkStation has a USB port that can be used to connect to USB drives, card readers, and USB printers, and how to replace the hard drive if it should fail. Chapter 6 describes how to backup from the LinkStation onto other drives. It also tells how to use Time Machine to back up from a Mac onto a LinkStation drive. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell how to use the LinkStation as a backup from a Windows computer. That's probably possible, but you would need to find and install your own Windows backup software and see if you can get it to communicate with the LinkStation. Since that's not covered in the documentation, I'll leave it open as a topic for further research and tinkering.Chapter 7 covers how to set up the drive for DLNA or digital media sharing. BitTorrent is also covered in this chapter. Chapter 8 covers advanced features, including email notifications for device errors, sleep mode for the drive (very useful for saving electricity or allowing access to files only at certain times), and data encryption. Chapter 9 covers utilities, such as NASNavigator 2, which enables you set up shared network drives.In general, I was pleased with how fast I could get this drive running out of the box. Unfortunately, the 2 tasks I wanted to use this drive for most, accessing files from my tablet, and backing up files automatically from my computer, are both going to take a bit of research and finagling to get going. I'll have to figure out why the WebAccess app won't install on my Android tablet and whether there's a work around. And I'll have to see if I can find some backup software to integrate with the LinkStation drive since the documentation doesn't mention how to backup from a Windows computer onto the LinkStation drive. Overall, this seems to be a decent piece of hardware and it connects readily to networks. Documentation for Apple device and Mac users seems straightforward, but many non-Apple users may find they will need to do a bit of independent research in order to get the device to work as it should.

$review_text.: I bought this case sight-unseen when I ordered myKindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fia few months ago. After 10 days of extensive use, the case is holding up great. It looks good and meets my needs perfectly. I highly recommend it.Pros:- The Kindle Fire snaps into the case with a nice, tight fit. There are no visible straps holding the Kindle Fire in place. The fit is really clean. The speakers, earphone jack and charging jack are accessible through openings in the case.- The case feels good in your hand. It has a rubberized finish, so there is enough friction that you're not likely to drop it. The case is not heavy at all.- The cover is very light. Here I'm not talking about the entire case, just the cover that comes in contact with the Kindle Fire screen. Some reviewers have criticized this feature on the grounds that it is "flimsy". Personally, I think this is a matter of personal preference. The cover is lightweight and therefore a little flexible. If you're looking for a very stiff cover, then this case isn't right for you. I find that the cover provides ample protection while not adding bulk.- The cover opens completely. When the cover is completely open, it's actually in the back and out of sight. This means you're looking only at the Kindle Fire with just a small bit of the case showing around it. For me, this is great because I don't want it to be too bulky.- The cover converts into a stand. I have not had any of the problems some of the other reviewers have had with this feature. In fact, it seems like a pretty simple and easy way to watch videos without holding the Kindle Fire.- The band stays out of the way. When the cover is open, the band snaps around the back of the cover, completely out of the way.Cons:- The cover picks up a little bit of dust. The inside of the cover (the side that comes in contact with the Kindle Fire screen) is a felt-like surface. This picks up a minor amount of dust. I've been able to brush it away, though, so this has only been a minor problem.- Limited colors and designs. At the time of this review, there are only four colors available. I have the graphite version, which is fine. I would have liked a few more color options, though.

$review_text.: Overall happy with purchase of TV and Panasonic DMP-BD65K Blue Ray DVD player for $600 total at local Sears store last weekend (and esp happy that I could just pick it up with no black Friday crowds nor have the delivery hassle).  TV was well packaged and good finish quality.  However, don't care for the long thin remote design which results in an un-natural grip for my ladies (size large) hands (have not had this issue with my Sharp or Insignia TV remotes nor any other that I can remember).  Also, the stand is stationery, so would prefer swivel (new this when purchased).  Instruction book is adequate except the page on how to set up the stand - jumps from putting together stand to TV in the stand when actually there are 4 little screws that must be perfectly aligned in a little channel of sorts.  Combine this with the TV size (would be the same for all models/mfg), it's a two person set up for most of us : ) Sound is adequate with HDMI cable and excellent picture.  Finally, obscure factoid - two prong plug not grounded.  Not sure if grounding is done in the set these days or something to do with less current as energy star (so plug feels unsubstantial).
$SUMMARY.: Great value and happy overall

$review_text.: I like them a lot, I use them all the time.I bought them to replace a Sony MDR-V150 headphones. I guess Sony wants these to replace the others (the MDR-V150), and they don't produce de MDR-V150 anymore.These are OK, but I still feel like the MDR-V150 had a little bit more bass, maybe a little bit better sound. But these are more robust, will take longer to break.

This is much more cost effective than many other USB 3.0 extension cable solutions

There is no signal loss even at the long length

I would buy again and in general have gained a lot of trust in the AmazonBasics brand due to my positive experience with this product.

My only complaint is the cable
It is VERY thin and prone to damage, especially at the plug end


I had to wrap it with electrical tape.######Update: 1/2/13######The plug has bent from normal use and doesn't work on anything unless you push on it
I suggest opening the up the headphones and switching the cable with a thicker one
It's a quick soldering job.

$review_text.: This is a study little bugger!  Might look and feel flimsy but it's not! Keeps my overworked laptop nice and cool! I did however, have to make a small box to house the cooler, it sits halfway in the box so it's more elevated from the surface and my laptop forcing direct airflow to the bottom of my laptop


Now it's the perfect cooling unit! It's pretty small, more for a notebook and not so much a full size laptop


It's also fairly quite, very little humming noises from the vibration.

$REVIEW.: Got this unit to replace a sony ES2400 that the HDMI board went out on..(initially I tried the new Onkyo TX-NR609..that unit had problems..you can see my review on this site for that item)The RX-V667 is a great unit.My home set up for this review: Toshiba 55SV670U LED TV fed by Directv H20 HD receiver and Sony PS3 into Energy Take Classic 5.1 Surround...all via HDMI connection. (I won't review the zone 2 or HDradio/internet/Ipod connect functions as I currently do not use that stuff)Setup: Easy..if you have any familiarity with Home Theater gear in general..hooking up the wires is pretty straightforward..you can let the YPAO do it's thing or set up manually..YPAO detected speaker config/size/distance correctly..Sounded good..I tweaked the crossover on sub and bumped up volume a couple db to my taste on the surrounds..The on screen GUI is very easy to use and will insure you are able to dial up whatever you may need.Sound Quality: Overall very good..I'd say superior to the Sony ES and Onkyo I went through before this unit. Seems to have a bit more "detail" in the sound field...little things in movies or PS3 games like room ambience..echoes...voice quality seem to have more presence in the sound than the other recievers I've used..The sound quality of this unit really shines but you don't really "hear" it until you kick the volume up a bit...low/normal volume sound is okay but not spectacular...at a bit higher volume (you don't have to rail it just bring it up to about +4-5db) the sound really opens up and becomes more defined..power is not an issue for this unit...still clean and well defined even at upper volume settings...really works the sub well...nice defined low end without being overbearing...This unit's sound seems to be a bit more refined and nuanced than the Sony ES which had a more "in your face" sound...it also seems to have a bit more "girth" in the sound than the Onkyo had. I can say the Audessey sound settings on other units were a bit more varied than the Yamaha's...with that said, the RXV667's sound presets are more than adequate..you may scroll thru them easily with the remote and dial up what sounds bests for your particular movie/game. Just letting it go "straight decode" isn't a bad choice either...Video Quality: Excellent..with one complaint...It does seem to clean up and refine the picture...BUT..***this unit DOES NOT upconvert anything 720P or above coming in*** as the description leads you to believe. Page 115 in the manual tells you this and you would find that out anyway in setting it up. It only upconverts to 1080P any video signal >below&lt; 720P coming in via hdmi..but it does upconvert anything coming in from the analog inputs....**it only upconverts 576 or below resolutions**..720P/1080i/1080P resolutions are just "passed through". I know this from working with it..and I confirmed it with Yamaha tech support. If you want an upconverted 1080P signal from this unit output to your TV you'll have to scale down your HD signal from cable/directv box to output 480P or 480i. That seems pointless to me, but when I did try that it still put out a great picture. I see no degrading of the video signal either way. My main reason for buying a new A/V receiver (other than the previous unit's malfunction) was for the upconversion processing..Other brand units (and Yamaha Aventage 2000 series and above) upscale everything coming in regardless of connection/resolution and output 1080P. I've read that the new chips for this (Anchor Bay/Qedo etc..) do a great job of processing video and enhancing the picture to your HDTV. This unit does put out/pass through a good signal so do not discount that..it just doesn't do what I thought it would based on the product description. I am not returning it as I can't complain about the picture (doesn't make it any worse) I see on my TV and the sound quality is top notch.My summary...Easy set up..Sound quality is excellent...remote is functional...good clean power..does not degrade video signal...overall a very good unit in the mid range A/V receiver price point.

$REVIEW.: Intro:  The Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II lens is a: heavy, pro only, ultimate portrait, ultimate full frame, ultimate low light, battery draining lens.  Purchase this lens if you are a pro or own a full sensor camera.If you are not a pro have a cropped sensor camera (40D, 50D, Rebel etc) and want an easier to use lens with similar portrait taking ability, and have room to back up a little then go purchase the about half as expensive and easier to use Canon 135mm F/2 L lens.  The 135mm F/2: focuses much faster, feels lighter and is much easier on battery consumption.  You will be much happier.If you are a pro then read on.If you are a pro then you will want both this Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II lens and the Canon 135mm F/2 L lens.  I find myself using the 85mm when photographing the ladies and children especially in low light and I don't have the room to backup.  The creamy  dreamy soft images and great bokeh really compliment women and children.  I use the 135mm more for male portraits and when I either have more room to backup or need more reach and or if I want to be in stealth mode at public events like a renaissance festival.Cropped VS full frame:The ultimate portrait lens at F/1.2 to F/1.6 (and sharp lens stepped down to F/2 to F/4) on a full frame camera still very good on a 1.6 cropped sensor camera (40D/50D, Rebels).  You get almost exactly double the Bokeh on full sensor or 35mm film camera vs 1.6 cropped sensor camera.Tips:Always but always carry a spare batteryStep down a little say to F/1.6 or F/1.8Never use focus lock and recompose, always focus and shoot with one continuous motion or you will never achieve focus especially wide open.Use a single focus point.  I usually focus on one of the eyes.Find out exactly where your focus is, front / back focus etc and shoot accordingly.Only mount this lens under controlled conditions and take your time, the rear element is exposed and the mounting point is hard to see.If you want the lens focused at infinity before storing leave the camera ON and manual focus to infinityPros:Super BokehGreat lens hoodToo many clients!!Super low light event lensBest portrait lens for women and girls ever madeShoot outside at night with no tripod at 3200 ISO!Amazing looking photos that say professional all over them.Along with my Canon 135 F2 lens the finest portrait lens in the world!Sharp wide open in the center with wonder halo effect around outsideSharp edge to edge by F2.0This lens has Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments below:Chromatic aberration correction when shooting Raw using Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) to process see below for more.Cons:PriceHeavy! 1,025 GramsExposed rear elementNo focus lock and recompose!  It's always out of focusRemoval procedure (1 manual focus, 2 focus to infinity, 3 camera Off)Battery Hog!! I only get 300 - 360 shots or so with Canon 40D 200 with Rebel XTiInstall procedure (carefully line up without seeing red dot and protect rear element)Some CA (Chromatic Aberration) wide open totally gone when stopped down to 1.8 not an issue with most portrait photosAuto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:I haven't noticed much vignetting with this lens even wide open, but Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with this lens both in camera with JPEG's and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) when using newer Canon digital EOS cameras (Canon Rebel XSi, 40D, 5D Mark II etc.) . No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!! When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination. The cameras listed above have already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance and F stop from the lens and the camera has saved the information with the Raw file. You can then adjust the amount under Peripheral Illumination if you don't like the amount automatically suggested. If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount. SWEET!!!Chromatic aberration correction when shooting Raw:This lens does have some Chromatic aberration when shooting between F/.1.2 and F/1.8 if you have bright contrasty subjects such as a car bumper.  When shooting Raw using Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) you can click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Chromatic Aberration then choose the amount of correction needed.  Pretty Sweet!!!9-20-2008 Update:This lens save my life this weekend!!  I had a photo shoot at our church and they have it VERY dark in there.  I was at the ISO limit with my F/2.8 lenses even my Canon 135 F/2 L I was at 3200 ISO and still not stopping the action.  It's hard to believe  there is that much difference between F/2 and F/1.2 but there is.  I even managed to go back down to ISO 1600.  Thank you Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L!!!!01-03-2009 Canon 5D Mark II Update:Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L lens. Without a doubt this lens delivers the clearest sharpest and most resolving power onto any photograph you care to take with the Canon 5D Mark II. The clarity has to be seen to be believed. At F/1.2 the Depth of Field (DOF) is scary thin and the edges are super soft which is great for female portraiture. The super soft creamy dreamy Bokeh at F/1.2 is much smoother on the 5D Mark II over my 40D. But stop this lens down to F/1.8 and it gets scary sharp and clear. Step it down to F/4.0 and it's at its sharpest and the only lens I have that gives you 100% pixel peeping razor blade edge to edge top to bottom perfect clarity in every single area of the photo.Looking at a photo on my iMac taken with a 5D Mark II with this lens is like standing there looking through an open window at the actual scene!The 85mm F/1.2 is your low light monster on the 5D Mark II, I don't have to harp too much on what an F/1.2 aperture and an ISO 25,600 can do for you at night. Let's just say you can go out into what appears to be a dark night and do hand held photos.This is the very first lens I will reach for when using the 5D Mark II.1-20-2009 Update:The way the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L Lens eats batteries when on my Canon 40D may be a software glitch.  I got notice that firmware update Version 1.1.1 for the Canon 40D fixes a malfunction that in rare occurrence causes a low battery indication to be displayed when using the EF 85mm F1.2L II USM lens. Depending on the battery check timing of the camera, the battery level displayed on the camera's LCD data panel may shows Battery will be exhausted soon or Battery must be recharged, even though the battery capacity is sufficient.I am installing the fix and will see if this causes the early battery dead indication to go away.4-1-2009 Update:Photos from this lens continues to impress especially those I take with my new 5D Mark II.  Just got back from shooting the 2009 Arizona Renaissance festival where I shot 95 percent of the photos with the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L lens and Canon 5D Mark II.

$REVIEW.: Solidly constructed with a high-tech industrial appearance. The dual fans work well to divert hot away from your laptop. Very quiet on low speed; a bit more fan noise on high speed. I love the ultra bright, Chernoybl blue LED that shows the unit is powered. (Not sure why such a bright indicator light was needed, but helps bask the room in pleasant blue light if working in the dark). The only downside is that the way the unit is constructed, if you insert the support pegs, it won't elevate netbooks of the 9, 10, or 11 inch variety (which are too small to sit on all four pegs). If you plan to use it only with a netbook, don't put the pegs in. The only downside is that the shape and size doesn't make it too portable as far as getting it into a laptop bag.  Great value -- lower price than most of the Belkin and Targus items, yet a higher quality device. I like it!

$review_text.: When I first got this mp3 player I was surprised by how tiny it is

It looks almost like a toy


But even though it looks fragile it is actually made of a very sturdy construction


I already dropped it a couple of times and it didn't even get a single scratch
The battery life is excellent
On the package it says 24hour battery life and that is much more than any of my old mp3 players could claim


I have been using this player a few hours every day for the past week and I still have some juice left in it
Amazing

I'm also very happy with the sound quality and the FullSound feature

It does seem to make all the sounds more crisp
One downside I noticed though were the headphones

Even though they are advertised as "comfort headphones" they have to be the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever tried

I quickly replaced them with another pair and I'm happy now


Another point I would like to make is in regards to the Philips Songbird

This is a media player designed by Philips and it allows you to listen to music and sync everything to your mp3 player
I don't really see the necessity of this software since my windows media player does all that and I'm happy with it

But other people may prefer the Songbird

Overall, it's a small mp3 player that packs some punch and I would definitely recommend it.

I'm glad I did.  It is fantastic and at a much more palatable price.  Like many starting out in studio work cost is a huge factor but quality is important as well.  Don't hesitate if you need this Octobox.  I'm using a 400ws monolight and the light is superb.  I've used it for full body portraits with great success.  There are no instructions so assembly is a bit tough but if you have put other boxes together you'll have no problem.  When I have more space I might add a second.

$review_text.: I bought the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 and thought that was a sharp lens. This one's even sharper. I'm accustomed to the razor sharpness of the 85mm f1.2L II, and this one gets mighty close. Plus, it's capable of Macro 1:1 to boot. I won't go into the technical details as you can find that from other sites. But wide open, it's already tack sharp in the center and corners aren't much further behind, and the bokeh is pretty nice. The only difference I found compared to other sites that tested the lens, was that I can actually still use images at F22 aperture shooting macro.I'm finding it increasingly hard to keep my 50mm f1.4 on my camera over the 60mm f2.8. Portraiture, they perform about the same in sharpness, and bokeh is similar at exact aperture settings. I actually prefer the slightly more flattened, compressed look of the 60mm. Color saturation and contrast are very similar as well. Both focus at about the same speed, with the noticeable difference that the 60mm has a longer way to go from macro 1:1 to infinity focus.The only quirk, and why I almost knocked it down to 4 stars, is the working distance to 1:1 macro. But I knew that going into this purchase. It's a short working distance (~3.5 inches), short enough to disturb jittery insects. If you feel you're going to be doing a lot of insects and more shy creatures and you want to stay in the Canon lineup, you may want to look at the 100mm f2.8, or even the 180mm f3.5L if you have the money. The reason I went with the 60mm is because it still gave me the 100mm-equivalent full frame focal length for an excellent portrait. The 100mm would've been too long, and the 180mm is in no-man's-land for portraits.In short, if you want a razor sharp lens that does macro work very well and switches to an excellent portrait lens, and you're not going to be shooting jittery insects most of the time, then pick this one up. If you're doing a lot of insect work, I'd suggest at the least, the 100mm, and maybe even the 180mm. The tradeoff is you can't really use the other two longer lens for portraiture work unless you have an insane working distance.

$review_text.: I've owned this mouse since April, 2007, and it's been my primary mouse the entire time.This simple instrument was my first ever trackball mouse. I suffer from wrist strain because of using a normal mouse at work, and I wanted something better for home. I also *hate* mouse pads.I liked that I could still use the buttons like a normal mouse (with my first and second fingers), which is why I picked a thumb trackball instead of the ones that use more hand motion and require you to use your fingers for ball movement instead of clicking. One downside of this preference is that my thumbs are quite short (or "stubby," if you will), so I would probably have even more precise control with longer thumbs. Even so, I've learned to use this mouse very well, and I prefer it to normal mice.Cleaning: Yes, the contacts for the ball collect dust and skin oils. It's as easy as popping out the ball and quickly wiping away the dust inside the cavity to make the mouse as smooth as butter again. I do it about once every two weeks. Not a problem at all.I do recommend this mouse for the price, lasting value, and thumb ball feature.
$SUMMARY.: You'll be all thumbs and love it

$REVIEW.: I have not auto tested the unit yet.  The unit is not professional quality, but for $29.00 if it works it will be money well spent.  As for the comment that the instruction manual is worthless, that's true.  It is true that the unit's menu is in another language, but it is easy to get it in English, just play with the menu for afew minutes.  The description on Amazon should indicate that the unit does not come with an SD card, which must be purchased separately.

$review_text.: I tried this out on my New Generation iPad and my iPhone. Both products are protected with an Otter Box,so I am not worried about scratching my screen and I have not noticed any issues with my Otter Box protective screen getting scratched. It works ok for drawing. My biggest complaint is you can't swype text with this product,it is all over the place when I have tried to swype text. After using this for a few weeks, I really found I prefer NOT to use it with most of my gadget activities. Using my finger is just as good and more convenient, as I don't have to have the stylus pen handy. The only thing it is useful for is drawing fine lines, but even with that I have noticed the pen "jumps" and leaves blank spots while drawing. Bottom line, I don't feel like this is a necessary device to own,especially with an almost $30.00 price tag.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a bluetooth speaker to give a boost to the volume from my new iPad, and this works nicely.  It's reasonably louder than the iPad's built in speaker.  It's also useful that the speaker can be positioned where you want it regardless of how you move the iPad around.  There were zero problems pairing it with the iPad, and it works seamlessly afterwards.  You can control the volume right from the iPad, or the speaker itself has controls for volume, next track, etc. It's not stereo, but you'd expect mono from a one-speaker device.  The fidelity isn't wonderful from a small speaker, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  That's probably unreasonable on my part...

$REVIEW.: I've been using these for years.  It's to the point now that I don't buy it AFTER getting a new camera...I buy it AT THE SAME TIME I buy a new camera along with extra batteries.  These really are very comfortable compared to the OEM ones but they also don't scream out what type of camera I have.  The strap is soft and stretchy and is very comfortable.  It also has some soft rubber dots on the inside of the strap to help grip on your shoulders.  I have straps over five years old and they haven't worn off yet.  I'm not too sure about those though.  They do help but I wouldn't depend on them too much.I also use the OP/TECH dual harness when shooting events and I want to carry two cameras.  The quick release straps can quickly move from the single strap to the dual harness.  I do have to make changes to the length though.

$REVIEW.: It's a mini tripod, about six inches long to stand on the table.  The legs are flexible to angle the camera however you want.  It can practically bend over, perfect for taking good shots of knitting.  It holds the camera perfectly and is stong and sturdy.  You can adjust the height by widening and then bending the legs.  Within the limits of the size, it can contort into any configuration you want.  I've used it to take short videos of me knitting to help explain techniques to an Internet friend and it's fantastic for that.  Much better than a full size tripod.The big downside, and why it got four stars instead of five, is that there is no level.  Given how wildly it can contort, a simple bubble level on the top would have made it a lot easier to use.  It's tricky to make sure the camera isn't being held at a slight angle this way or that.

$review_text.: This item is well-made, fairly priced, and a perfect fit on the PowerShot SX40
The tulip design gives some protection from sunlight through the full range of the camera's built-in zoom lens
The idea is to prevent light from falling on the front surface of the lens and illuminating it (and any slight film or dust) to increase image contrast
The hood can remain on the camera even with the lens retracted.

Kudos to BestiProducts.com of Edgewater FL.Part of cost donated to very worthy causes.Cleans dust and some fingeprints.Looks good and is easy to use.Debris collected on eraser is easily removed with light brushing.Not So Good:Does not remove any debris that has hardened on the screen.Does not remove all fingerprints.Had to run down to the Dollar Tree and pick up some Awesome Orange to clean what the eraser left behind.I really hate to give this outstanding company only three stars but in all my reviews I strive for honesty.

$REVIEW.: For reference, I have been using the Bose SoundDock for some time with my Iphone, and so was interested in how this unit (JBL Beat Extreme) would stack up.I will start with a summary of the pros and cons of this unit:Pros:1) Easy to Use

I had it out of the box, bluetooth synced to my iphone, and playing my favorite music in under a minute
No need to read the instructions.2) Looks pretty slick3) Handles incoming calls well if someone calls while you are listening to music


It becomes a speakerphone.4) Sound quality is good when you are playing it loud.Cons:1) You can not dock your iphone to it if the iphone is in an otterbox


Even though the unit will sync through bluetooth, I would love to be able to use the unit as a charging station


If you have ever put an iphone in an otterbox, you know it is a big job, so you dont want to be taking the phone in and out of the otterbox just to dock it to a speaker system.2) Sound quality is poor if you have the volume low or medium

By low, I mean you are not blasting the music, but maybe listening to music as you work.3) Integration with Iphone bluetooth is not perfect
In some aps, it is hard to get the sound to go through the speakers, or if the sound is going through the speakers to come back through the phone


Some aps have a little popup that lets you choose where to send the sound, and some don't

This might not be a limitation of the speakers, but the particular ap on your phone


Just know that there is some frustration using this unit switching back and forth between iphone speakers and this speaker system.How does it stack up against the Bose SoundDock:The major advantage over the Bose system is the bluetooth sync feature
I like being able to find a song on the iphone screen, and then play it

Using the Bose system, you are sort of operating blind with the remote and the iphone mounted on the unit
Also, this unit will play a lot louder than the Bose, and sounds good when played loud.The major advantage of the Bose system is that the Bose sounds MUCH BETTER at low or medium volume
The music from the Bose is much more "crisp".For me personally, I am going to have to say I like the Bose better
That is because I am 50 and I don't blast music any more

I would bet that if you are in your 20's or 30's you would like the JBL system better


If you are in your 40's or 50's you would probably like the Bose system better.

$review_text.: The New Trent battery pack is lightweight and small, and works easily and well.  My only beef with it is that the 5000mAh rating may not be accurate.  I compared it to a Zaggsparc 2.0, which is rated to same capacity, and the Zaggsparc clearly carries more "juice."  However, Zagg's product is more than twice the cost!  So, for my money, this is the better buy.  The charging cables it uses can be a bit more cumbersome than some other options out there, but the cable is retractable, which is nice, and again, it's a much better price.  If you're looking for something to extend the usable battery life of your smartphone, this is what you want.

It's a huge improvement, and the thin bezel is great, makes it look like the picture is just floating in mid-air.However, I had two major issues with it. One is that the black level is not very black... it looked like the gamma was set too high all the time. It's possible this is something adjustable. It's not noticeable unless you're picky and in a dark room with a dark scene on TV.The other issue is more serious. Netflix seemed unreliable - it would just stop playing and say try again later, with many different movies. Sometimes it just looked like it crashed. This isn't really acceptable in an appliance, if I wanted to debug software issues I'd watch Netflix on my computer.

I think the material that holds the case is too thick and the magnets can't function like the Apple Branded products do.  You get what you pay for!!!  Very basic cover, no slot for stylis or any other type of storage, bummer!  If you want to protect your iPad, not a bad choice, however, the seller might have thrown in a screen protector for a few $ more and this would be a good to great package.

$REVIEW.: This TV was just delivered today and I've been watching it all afternoon.It is well worth the money - the picture quality is excellent. It does not have any competition at its price point.We have had no issues with smells that others have reported.We have had to make no adjustments to the picture that others have noted - we plugged it in, turned it on and it looks great.The speakers are just OK...we will probably run out and buy surround sound as the audio definitely needs an upgrade.Note that there are only one set of component jacks on the back of this set...since our current cable box and DVD player both have component output, we will probably replace our DVD player with a blu-ray that has HDMI output.As others have stated, you need to be at least 8 feet away from the screen to truly enjoy the picture.Delivery was done by CEVA and, when I ordered from Amazon I was originally given a delivery date 11 days out.  Well, the TV actually arrived 4 days after I ordered!  The two delivery men were very professional, pleasant, and ensured that the video and audio worked correctly before leaving...5 STARS FOR CEVA!!...and 5 stars for Sharp and Amazon...this has been an extremely pleasant purchase process.  Now back to enjoying our new toy.  :0D

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a portable bluetooth speaker to use outside, in the garage, in the car, etc.. After extensive research and YouTube reviews I thought I would give the SuperTooth Disco High Power Bluetooth Speaker a try. It received good reviews both on Amazon and YouTube despite the rather cheesy name. I gotta tell ya this speaker ROCKS!! Paired very fast and started playing immediately and continued from good distances even through a wall and garage.The bass is full with no distortion even at loud volume. I don't need to add the Bass Boost. This speaker is 14 inches long and includes 2 speakers on either end and a built in subwoofer which delivers a surprisingly full bass. The unit delivers a full 28 Watts of power making it one of the highest powered of the all that I compared. When not playing, it immediately goes to "Standby" and uses virtually no power. The specs say it has 1500 hours of Standby power. You can control the music from your device as well as on this speaker by using the controls on the front. A large Volume knob and side buttons for Play/Pause, Previous/RW, Next/FF, Bass Boost, and On/Off, also used to pair device.Only the Bose SoundDesign sounded a little better, but not enough to justify triple the price I paid for this unit. It blew the Jawbone away which was double the price of the SuperTooth Disco. This speaker comes with a high quality travel case that allows you to play and charge it while in the case. I cannot comment on the battery life yet, all reviews I've read state 4 hours at full volume (which is very loud!) and 10-12 hours at lower volumes. It will play and charge while plugged into the wall.  I have a car charger that works with this unit so this should be perfect to use in the car as well. It does not come with a car charger. It is listed as a stereo speaker, but with its size, it is hard to discern separation.Don't be fooled or dissuaded by the name. Check the YouTube reviews as well. I highly doubt that you will be disappointed by the performance of this little portable Bluetooth speaker.

$review_text.: I'm not a connoisseur or serious audiophile, but I know what sounds and feels good when I hear and wear it. These cans produce a remarkably balanced sound. Nothing along the frequency spectrum gets too much priority but everything is clear. The bass is present and full without being muddy and overpowering everything else. I hear details in music, from rap to classical, that are lost in other over the ear headsets I've owned. Also, these produce a unique &#34;atmosphere&#34; of sound around your ears that is just incredible. It's kind of 3-dimensional and you can pick out different instruments and voices almost as if you were listening to a live performance. I read about this in other customers' reviews when I was shopping, but I didn't really understand it until now. Now, I use these as a &#34;gold standard&#34; or reference set for comparing other headsets or earbuds I try.These headphones are very comfortable. They produce a good sound seal, don't touch your ears, and squeeze your head just enough to feel snug but not hurt. Passive sound isolation is fair, but don't expect to keep a lot of extraneous noise out. In-the-ear-canal type earbuds do a better job. I've tried wearing these with the music off in a library with lots of people talking in small groups scattered throughout a large, acoustically live space, and you can still hear what people are saying. I've never owned an active noise cancelling set (e.g. Bose Quietcomfort) for comparison, but based on my research I understand they do a pretty good job with low level, uniform noise. I tried a friend's Bose noise cancelling sets in a bar with a lot of talking, before a gig, and they seemed to block out noise well. In other words, I wouldn't get these headphones if you're looking for SUPERB noise isolation. However, if OKAY passive noise isolation is good enough and you want stellar, balanced sound that kicks your listening experience up several notches, these are the headphones for you.The look: I didn't get these for image, I got these for sitting at home or in the office, or as a monitor for recording. They are somewhat bulky and the lateral aspects stick out a bit. The cord is long, durable, and built for a recording studio or basically just sitting in one place with minimal motion within a radius of a few feet. These are probably not the ideal headsets for walking around town. There are sleeker headphones out there, especially of the wireless/bluetooth variety, for those of you who are always on the go. That said, the included carrying case is very nice and make these headphones very portable, considering their size.Overall, these are amazing headphones for the price. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid, well-constructed set with perfectly balanced sound. The carrying case and screw-on gold-plated 1/4&#34; adapter are big pluses as well.
$SUMMARY.: Best headphones I've ever purchased

It works great on my friend's camera, but she didn't need an extra so I ended up returning it. The PSP will not recognize the memory stick so you can't save nor format it. I have tried various methods, yet they have no success.This could be my PSP fault, but why would other 5 PSP also not recognize it. I'll probably head to a store on Sunday and buy one there. I'll bring my PSP along and try it out and return it if it doesn't work xDI'll edit this if it is my PSP's fault and not the memory stick, but so far it seems like it's not compatible with the PSP.Edit: 9/20 I have found that this memory stick will work with my newer PSP.

$REVIEW.: Let's be completely honest about the downfalls of this camera...1.  It has slightly noticable vignetting in some cases (i.e. shooting a clear blue sky) but nothing that can't be fixed easily with a few clicks of a photoshop brush.2.  It's zoom from about 8x-10x is almost useless (at least with my tests)4.  It's high-rez video recording has too many artifacts (too compressed) for my tastes...However, I still love the camera.  Let me list the ways.1.  It feels great in your hand2.  Its manual mode is incredibly easy to use and gives you 5x the picture-taking capabilities of other cameras in its class3.  the ability to attach standard lense filters is unheard of at this price.  I use a UV filter and it gives outdoor photos an extra edge.4.  If you are lucky enough to own photoshop CS2, you can edit in RAW > a feature almost unheard of for under [...].5.  I have made some beautiful 8X10 prints that look astonishingly clear.You're pratically stealing this camera with the mail-in rebate bringing the final cost to [...].  If all you need is a max 8x10 enlargement, this is about the best buying decision you can make for the money.good luck

$REVIEW.: I was a little skeptical when I ordered it. How good could it be for $30 and so small? Well I was blown away by the sound quality and size/weight. This MP3 player blows away my $80 Sony player. Bought it to take on vacation in case I lost it wouldn't be too upset because it was cheap but, now I'm gonna use it all the time! Ear buds are junk so you'll need to upgrade those but, this player is worth every penny. Small, lightweight, and suprisingly good sound. I am gonna use it on my motorcycle come spring time with my bar mounted speakers. Much louder than my Sony. Easy to synche music with windows media player or just drag and drop. Easier to use and MUCH cheaper than my wife's Ipod. Now she wants one of these. Clip works great too.

$review_text.: All I can say after clicking few shots with my Nikon D-5200 is WOW. It takes 5-10 shots to me to get adjusted with focus and few other settings and after that this lens rocks. Sharpness is top notch and I was easily able to focus as on D-5200 it is manual focus. Excellent Lens for macro and portrait work. Far better than Nikon 85 MM macro.
$SUMMARY.: Super Lens. Must buy if you are having low budget and wanna great pic.

$REVIEW.: These are the first Sony earphones/headphones I have owned in a long time.  I'm a big fan of Aiwa earphones, and Aiwa is a (low-end) subsidiary of the Sony Corp.  I decided to get the MDR-EX71SL after losing my awesome Panasonic earphones.In short, I'm very disappointed in these South Korean-made earphones sold under the Sony brand.First of all, the earbuds are very uncomfortable.  They press into your ears and can feel quite &quot;invasive.&quot;  They are made of thin, soft plastic rubber and can break easily.  (Mine did after a couple days.)  BTW, a total of three sizes are included; the medium size ones are already fitted on the earphones.  I tried all three sets of earbuds but none of them proved satisfactory.Second, there's no inline volume control.  I kinda expected this since it was not in the specs or description, but I was hoping for this price, it would come with the control, esp. as most Aiwa headphones do come with it.Third, the right-ear cord is longer than the left one so you wear it behind your neck.  I actually do prefer this design because you can take out the earphones and let them hang in front of you.  But, the right cord here is not long enough if you wear heavy winter clothing, and when you try to adjust the right earphone, you often end up pulling out the left one.  VERY frustrating.Fourth, and most importantly, the sound quality sucks.  My last pair of earphones, made by Panasonic and costing me less than ten bux at the Century 21 department store near the World Trade Center site, had much richer bass and much better response over the entire spectrum.  I was very disappointed in the rather muffled sound put out by this set of earphones.  BTW I used this on my Archos MP3 player, my RCA Lyra MP3 jukebox, my Aiwa CD player as well as my Cambridge SoundWorks CD/radio, and was disappointed no matter what music (classical, jazz, rock, pop, audio books...) I played.It would cost me too much to send this back to Amazon, so I'll give them to my friend who can use it to listen to audio books.  In the meantime, I'm going to go back to Century 21 and get the cheap-but-good Pansonic earphones.Is Sony really dying???
$SUMMARY.: Very disappointed

$review_text.: This is an awesome case for the HP touchpad.  I had picked it up originally to protect the back and screen, but I find myself using the case to prop the tablet up at various angles very often, and now consider this to be one of the best features of the case.  I wasn't sure about the velcro attachment at first, nor the lack of ability to secure to screen cover over the front of the tablet, but the velcro has proven durable, and the front flap has just enough rigidity so that it covers the screen when standing upright.  It appears quite durable; I can see some creases where I have bent the flap back at the left side of the case, where it hinges, but it does not appear to have affected the integrity of the case at all.  But just in case, I picked up an extra one, so I would not have to scour ebay for a replacement, in the unlikely event I would need one!  Would definately recommend this case!

$REVIEW.: I have to admit that when I first saw this product advertised that I thought it was a fantastic 2-in-1 idea. Hey, I grew up on watching Transformers after all. It was quite pricey when it first came out though, so I decided to wait. Now that the price was affordable, I finally bought one for my Canon S2. So, did it live up to all the hype? Heck yeah!Here are some pros and cons:Pros:1) Very fast read and write speed as advertised.2) Reliable (it's never messed up or corrupted any of my photos or data yet and I've had it for about 4 months now )3) USB feature works well too. Convienent not having to carry a SD card reader around.Cons:1) When it folds out to a USB drive, the hinge does seem a bit flimsy but it hasn't broke yet and I haven't heard a reviewer that has said it's broken on them. So I can't really count that against it. But it's important enough to note for you "attention to detail" guys and gals.Conclusion: This SD card really is the coolest card out there! To those of you that are scared that it won't fit in your SD device, don't worry, it should fit any SD compatible device. (it's not any thicker than a regular SD card folks!) I'm very happy that someone actually spent the creative energy to innovate and design this... and put it to market. The technology field is very lacking in innovation right now, so this is a refreshingly unique product. I'm waiting for them to come out with a 2GB or higher capacity with the same usb fold out technology. Imagine a 4GB one... how cool would that be? It's only a matter of time, I'm sure.Now if they could just come out with one that transforms into a ROBOT too :)I hope this review was helpful. If it was, Please Vote. Domo Aragoto... Mr Roboto!

$REVIEW.: PROs: Shiny , well designed exterior; lots of cables, bells, and whistles. Very appealing packaging. The instructions are adequate, but not comprehensive in explaining the numerous features. When this HVR-1950 eventually functions properly, the resolution is very good - same as the original broadcast quality; And it can produce an MPEG2 file.  But there are several unresolved technical issues amongst the several extra features. I purchased my two units at Amazon.com.CONs: If you have more than one window open, the Hauppauge player will occasionally overlap other windows by having a layering problem when you click on it to bring it to the foreground of your desktop. Tech support is virtually impossible to reach, and with long wait times before you discover nobody will answer, but they give a call-back message after 10 minutes if you want to leave your phone number. Each time to get the tuner to function each morning, I had to reboot my PC and/or turn the tuner ON and OFF several times. If you open another player or launch certain other video memory applications, the Hauppauge player will stutter or freeze, and the recording function will stop. Hauppauge admits that the Scheduler is broke; they claim to be working on a fix for this scheduling problem. You pay extra for the extra features, only to find out later that they don't work. I purchased two of these models (HVR-1950) and had the same issues with both units, so the problems are consistent.Summary: I want to point out that the problems are with the product, not my computer, as Hauppauge may suggest. I have three PCs and experienced the same troubles on all of them. One PC is a Core i7-975 Extreme Edition, 12GB RAM, nVIDIA GTX 1GB memory,3ea onboard Intel Series 320 600GB SSDs, Win7 Ultimate x64 -- so I doubt it is the PC causing the stutter/freeze problems; and the TV signal strength is strong.  I was hoping for favorable results by choosing a well known brand name and the most expensive USB model. But this product was a major disappointment. Hauppauge is releasing these products long before they are ready for the consumer market; so if you like beta-testing, buy this product.As worst yet, the tech support is virtually non-existent. If you doubt this fact, try calling Hauppauge tech support numerous times while keeping track of how many times you tried and how long it took to get through, in the event someone would bother the answer the call. Poor product, poor service, poor tech support. What more could be said? A Hauppauge software update (v2.4F)is scheduled in near future; I'm hoping this update will fix most of the current issues, or I will be returning my two models.I spent hours with screen captures and video captures of the repeated malfunctions and emailed them to Hauppauge, but they never responded. Either they are drastically short of support  personnel or they refuse to reply because they don't have answers or fixes to solve the several problems inherent in this product. I would NOT recommend this HVR-1950 to anyone wanting trouble-free viewing and recording of TV programming. AverMedia might be a better alternative and at a better price. To lend some credibility to this appraisal, I have many years of electrical, RF signals, IT background, and computer systems building experience. And ordinarily I an enthusiastic about touting a good product; but my experience with two of these HVR-1950s was extremely disappointing.UPDATE ADDENDUM 6-10-12:Several software updates have been made by Hauppauge; their latest version: 2.5d is no better than ver. 2.4, in fact they have fixed a few of the nine (9) problems I submitted to them, but the latest ver 2.5d has more new problems. I contract their tech support supervisor as well as several people in Sales Dept. They initally seem to be willing to help, but then is absolutely no follow up later. I sent a very detailed list of problems to the Tect Supp Supervisor along with links to videos I provided to demonstrate the problems. He never even viewed my email and video links until 3 months later when I mentioned this fact to their Sales Dept.Summary:  There still nine problems with this unit which I have documented to forwarded to Hauppauge. Version 2.5d still has these 8 problem areas. Regarding the several review rating of 5-star or 4-star here on Amazon, I suspect these people haven't had an occasion to use all the functions of this HVR-1950 with the faulty software in order to detect the many problems. Also notice the Amazon reviews chart for this product: the 1-star review ratings are nearly as high as the 5-star rates. There are alot of issues with the Hauppauge Software that drivers all their TV tuner products. And they don't seem to be able to correct them.
$SUMMARY.: Disappointed with HVR-1950

$REVIEW.: This is without a doubt the best compact digital camera I've owned. My last two cameras were a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 and a Canon Powershot SD900.I bought the panasonic about a year ago, but it kept having problems opening and closing its lens, especially if I went to a beach or anywhere there was dust: dust would get into the mechanics and gum them up for days.This camera is ruggedized: it says it's good to 16 ft underwater, and also that it's dust proof. Best of all, it's SMALL. It's smaller than our Panasonic was, and I think perhaps about the same size as the Powershot was.The best thing about this camera is the image quality. It's a 16 megapixel camera, so I expected to be able to take 5 MP pictures without degredation. I just got back from Disneyland where we took 600 pictures and a couple hours of video using the camera. The video is amazingly good quality for a compact camera, and I believe it's close in quality to my dedicated canon camcorder. The still shots are also amazing. While not quite as good as a digital SLR, they blow away any of the pictures from my previous compact digital cameras in terms of quality. I took some 16 megapixel shots of the Storybook land ride in disney during the day, and I was shocked at how good the detail was. Even blowing the images up, they looked crystal clear with relatively little in the way of artifacts. Otherwise I shoot at 5 MP resolution and am very pleased with the results.The movies range from I believe 720p up to 1020i or 1020p. I used it in the lowest resolution and was stunned by the frame rate and quality.Caveats I've seen in other reviews hold true: it takes a few seconds for movies to start recording once you press the 'record' button, and a few seconds for them to finish recording (though actual data stops when you press 'record' to stop recording. It does pretty well at night, though like most camera's it'll do a much better job with subjects that stay still than those that move.Reviews I read were mixed on the touch screen. For my part, I like it. Now that I'm learning my way around the menu's, the touch screen is convenient, and quick to change options.It has an auto-panorama option which was a lot of fun. I turned left, then click the shutter once in auto-panorama mode and slowly turn until i'm facing right. The camera combines all the information it gathered and makes a panorama, then shows it to you right on the camera. Awesome!Overall I am extremely satisfied with this camera, and looking forward to using it at the beach and near / in pools without worrying about it breaking!I've had the camera for 2 weeks, and used it perhaps 8 hours. A week at Disney will do that. My favorite camera ever!

$review_text.: This is one of the best Garmin I seen


 All the previous Garmin's owned by me were all so typical and looked pretty much the same and this one has lot of new features in the way it behaves and display.---Great Display---Faster boot time when initiated---smart phone link to transfer Google POI---Faster traffic updates---Faster route calculations---Real voice guidance---Lane displayI have been now using this for at least one month and did not see any issues with it
 I did purchase the paid applications for weather and photo cams, which are quite useful


 was not able to use photo cam feature much, but weather application is great which displays any warnings right on the top of the screen
 This GPS sure is expensive but is really good


 I have a Nuvi 2555 and this, while the Nuvi 2555 also has the older lane guidance and lifetime updates,  I surely prefer this due to its display


 The display is great,  however sometimes if the sun is overhead and I am using a Polorized Sunglasses, the screen is difficult to be seen except at an angle


 I guess this is due to the fact that this is a TFP based screen as compared to other GPS


 I was able to import all my custom POI's in this GPS and also plot custom routes using Garmin applications like BaseCamp and Mapsource successfully
 Overall the unit routes fast and reroutes even faster when a wrong turn is taken


 As noted by previous reviews the unit no longer says that it is rerouting but does it in the background in a second
 Garmin sure took its time to adopt and bring these new features like Smart APP and other features,  which I had seen probably two years back on a Motorolla GPS, which served me good but had to discontinue due its inability to update the maps
 This GPS is quite similiar in features to Motorolla GPS which I had like the display quality, the way the side screen pops and you can make it disappear,  google POI's,  weather,  gas prices etc

 Overall i would recommend this GPS

$SUMMARY.: Great GPS

$REVIEW.: My dad finally bought an hd tv, but doesn't subscribe to hd service, have a blu ray player or Internet. I figured the best way to share my digital files with him was to find a compact media player box. The Incredesonic fits the bill perfectly.I have only expedienced two minor issues.1) it's finicky about hdmi cords.  When I ordered it, I bought a pack of hdmi cables as well, upon plugging cable into my hdmi splitter, I go no signal response, from any of my channels. I unplugged the new cable and used the one from my xbox instead and it worked.  I tried the new cable on the xbox and it worked there so that tells me that the incredesonic didnt like that cable.2) some times it won't read my usb drives. I have found that the socket is a hair too deep. If you plug the drive in too firmly it won't read it. But backing it out ever so slightly you can watch the usb icon light up on the screen and it works perfectly from there on.

It's as fast as their Seagate's previous USB 3.0 drives. Unfortunately the new line has been re-engineered. The cases are designed to lay the drive flat. The bottom is uneven to allow air flow to the fan vents which are on the bottom of the drive. There are also vents on the side.The is a power LED but no activity LED. The Power LED is placed on the top surface near to the power and USB plugs . It is unclear if the drives will remain cool enough if you lay them flat and stack them on top of each other. The new model also has sharp edges all the way around, perhaps slightly better for laying on edge. You you do stand it on edge with the cables out the top, it's kinda like the old configuration. It's not Ideal, but its all we got. 1 Star off for bad design.

$review_text.: A friend of mine let me use his Mark III for the weekend for a studio shoot.  I have used Canon gear years ago and think that they are a great company and makes great gear.  I was considering getting the Mark III over the D800 but wanted the chance to use the camera before buying.The body of the Mark III is well built however it did feel too much like plastic for my taste.  The buttons were well placed and easy to use.  Image quality was amazing and I was not disapointed!One thing I will point out is that I did notice the LCD light leak problem!  I have also heard that Canon is considering recalling this camera due to this huge issue.  To me, spending $3500 on a camera and having this kind of issue that has to be sent back to Canon to fix is a problem!  This is the reason for 2 stars.  I don't think it would be so bad if it could be fixed by firmware update, however this is a hardware problem.  Other than this, it's a great camera and I may still get one once Canon fixes their light leak problem.  I just think it's something people should be aware of.

$REVIEW.: I bought the HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset to wear under my gear while I commute to work on my motorcycle. The earbuds do a great job of staying in my ears in spite of the worst possible conditions - heat or cold, sweat or contact with the inside of my helmet. They've been exposed to some crummy conditions but seem to be holding up just fine. Sound quality is about average, but the headset volume is high enough to be heard over the roar of the exhaust and the wind noise.Call quality appears to be just fine; I've heard no complaints from folks talking to me on the unit. It should be noted that I am NOT talking about using the headset for calling while riding, because the microphone is on the front of the unit which is under my jacket. Connections are perfect every time, and I've not had a call with any echos or delays.I also like the long battery life. This unit has some LEGS!Cons? I can't really think of any. Since the headset wasn't engineered for the purposes I put it to, I am doubly impressed by its durability and functionality.

$REVIEW.: When I had my Charter internet service installed the installer saw my modem and told me this is one of the best.  Good to know.  Has been rock solid since installation.  Managed to get this locally using a price match .  I would have gotten it from Amazon, but even with Prime shipping I needed it sooner for a Saturday install.Does what it is supposed to and needs no tweaking.  Nice when things just work right out of the box!

$review_text.: I bought this hand strap for my Pentax K-x.It is decent product, pretty comfortable and well made for the price,but there some small issues at least for the Pentax camera.1. When you want to use it without standard neck strap it is fine, but if you want to keep both it is pain in the rear.When hand-strap is on, there is no place to keep neck strap in it's original position ( on right top side of the camera), you have to move it to the loophole on the left side of the hand-strap which is on the left bottom corner of the camera.So now you have camera hanging lopsided by neck strap connected to the left side of the camera. Looks weird and feels uncomfortable.2. It is pretty difficult to re-adjust hand-strap if need to.3. It covers battery section, so to change the battery you need to release the screw at least partially.Despite that, it is very comfortable to wear :)
$Helpful?.: [4, 5] $SUMMARY.: camera hand strap - good but not perfect.

$review_text.: I have been very happy with my 60Ds in the past, and wanted to get a back up camera for my wedding photography. Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 4123! This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 4122 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 4122 photos "on" the shutter. In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card. It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera. If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them). Do not pay full price for a used camera! If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one. If you have any questions, please let me know.
$review_summary.: Great camera...extremely disappointed with Amazon for selling used products as new

$REVIEW.: OK, so the panel isn't perfect. At less than $1,500, it's not supposed to be. But it is a great value. Reference material shines on this thing. DVD's and Blu-Rays look phenomenol. Xfinity HD cable also looks great.I've had this panel for over 4 months now and it has performed flawlessly. I had some really loud buzzing but it was just a loose screw in the A-board, and I popped the back panel off and tighened it. Now I can only hear a faint buzzing sound with my ear up to the back of the panel.Colors are great. Brightness is definitely improved vs. the 42" ST30 that's in the bedroom. Black levels are also noticeably deeper.3D is fantastic. The wife loves it too and we watched Avatar in 3D using the xpand 103s and it was quite an immersive experience.Network features work perfectly.  No issues at all streaming Netflix these days (of course, an entire overhaul of my network to gigabit everything had something to do with it, I'm sure).

$review_text.: This is actually my second digital camera
My first was an Olympus C-3020 zoom

I was very excited when i recieved that camera as a gift but as i began to use it i became very unhappy with it

 It is very bulky and doenst have audio capabilities like the S400
It also used 4 AA batteries which didnt last very long and added alot of weight to the already heavy camera

Needless to say i was very happy when it was stolen because i got the money from my insurance company which allowed me to purchase the Canon PowerShot S400.I was immediatley satisfied with the PowerShot S400


I love the audio & video capabilities and the camera is very easy to use
Also, there is no comparison in the size of the S400 to that of the Olympus
I am able to take this camera everywhere because it is so small

Also the Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery is great and lasts very long, even when you use the LCD screen for playback very often

I did a lot of research before i purchased a new digital camera after my first one was stolen, and i couldnt find a smaller camera with all the options that were included in the S400.I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this camera.

$REVIEW.: I've lived in my house for 8.5 years and for all that time, getting decent broadband speed to the room we use as a home office has been a challenge. It's a signal trap. Even messes with our cordless phones that have bases elsewhere in the house. I've ended up having to resort to using BPL (Broadband over Power Line - uses the house wiring as a network extender). I could get 1-2 megabit speeds in the office via wireless and 5 megabit speeds via BPL while we had wireless speeds over 30 megabits downstairs.I set this up this evening. Speedtest.net up in the office is consistently delivering between 13-15 megabits. Sure, it's not the 30+ megabits I get downstairs, but it's fast enough to run any data-hungry applications I want and 2-3x faster than anything else has delivered up here.And set-up was pretty easy. Took about 3 minutes to set up the web interface and change the admin password, then another 5 minutes to connect my laptop, smartphone, and Roku.I've tried a number of solutions over the years, spent hundreds of dollars on things that promised improvements but never delivered. This worked for me.

$REVIEW.: Well, I saw a lot of positive reviews for this product, so I ordered one, since I'm having trouble getting reasonable wireless coverage to some parts of my house.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.  I followed the simple instructions, but my network was not extended at all.  I wondered if I had set something up incorrectly, so I tried to get access to the set-up screen again.  But no matter what I tried, I couldn't get back to it.  I figured surely resetting the unit to factory specs (by inserting a paperclip in the hole next to the Ethernet jack) would take me back to the setup screen, but several tries failed to have any effect.  Among other reviewers who had trouble with this unit, I noticed complaints about poor support, so I didn't even try.  I've returned the unit for a refund.I've ordered this unit instead:Netgear Universal WN3000RP Wi-Fi Range Extender.  There have certainly been some problems with this unit too, but it looks like this vendor is making quite an effort to provide support.  I'll update this after I try the new unit.1/12/12 update: Just installed the Netgear range extender.  What a different experience!  Extremely simple and quick installation, at least if your router has WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup).  No CD or access to a webpage needed.  It was as simple as pushing the WPS button on the router, pushing the WPS button on the range extender, and bingo, it's up and running.  The new network has the same name as the original one, with "_EXT" at the end.I'm now getting excellent signal strength in the room where it was marginal before.  Seems like the small adjustable antennas are a good idea, and the white color blends in well with our decor.  Couldn't be more pleased with this product - nice job, Netgear!

$review_text.: Unless you drive a 1980s vehicle that has a windshield that is almost vertical this device will probably not work for you with a modern car with a slanted front windshield  and you'll have to mount the camera upside down. I managed to mount the camera at 90% and was able to rotate the lens (Contour HD) but I'm sure most people will not be able to mount a camera on a modern car's windshield without having problems.Pity cos the item appears to be well made and quite nice for the price but as someone pointed out, all the photos have the camera with an extension arm. Odd. Will probably send it back.WHERE IS THE EXTENSION ARM PANAVISE ???!!!! Sure it's only a couple more cents to make the plastic arm longer but this is a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW SO BE ADVISED!!

$REVIEW.: This little unit is the cat's meow for time lapse photography


I have other, far more expensive intervalometers, including CamRanger , but the beauty of this thing is its simplicity


Hook it up, set the interval, and let it run


Leave the number of shots set on zero, and it'll keep going for 3 years I guess, since that is the estimated battery life.Regarding battery life, if the low battery indicator shows up, take the battery out, wipe it on both sides with your T-shirt or lens cloth, and put it back in
Problem solved, and this is even mentioned in the accompanying manual.Right, the light isn't very bright, but out in the dark, you need a small headlamp or something for other camera settings.It may feel cheap, but it's durable


Just don't slam the cable end in the car door like I did with my first one--so now I've purchased 3, need 2 kinds for 2 different camera bodies since it comes with a non-interchangeable cable attached.

I bought this for my wife who makes many trips to some pretty awesome places.  Although the D200 is an fantastic camera, it appears that neither of us are fantastic camera smart.  Since she is on the verge of making a trip to the Holy Land I finally made up my mind and ordered her a Nikon D3200 with all the accessories.  Part of the accessories were two spare batteries and this charger.  With this new equipment, she should be free to shoot, shoot and even more shooting and never have any worries.I certainly do appreciate the rapidity with which you got this order to me.Oh, when this shows up it will be from "Deanna".  That is not true.  We have one Amazon account and even though I do most of the ordering, the account is in her name, and on my debit card.Thanking you, I amHoward Hilliard

$REVIEW.: I've had very good luck with Pioneer products in the past, so when this was recently introduced; I purchased it for my car. I subscribe to SiriusXM, so I added that option as well. This is a phenomenal looking, as well as an exceptionally well performing receiver. It definitely adds some excitement to your driving experience and is far and away a major upgrade to the receiver found in most new cars. It comes with an intuitive app control, as well as an easy to understand touchscreen interface. The DVD screen resolution is superb. Here are some of its features:General features:DVD/CD receiver with internal amp ~ 14 watts RMS CEA-2006/50 peak x 4 channels7" motorized touchscreen with multiple angle adjustmentsBluetooth for hands-free calling and audio streamingBuilt-in HD Radio tunerMIXTRAXPandora Internet radio controlAppRadio Mode for smartphone integrationFive customizable display colors and 112 key panel illumination choicesFits double-DIN dash openingsRemote controlAudio/video features:Plays audio/video content from CDs, DVDs, and USB memory devices8-band graphic equalizer with 7 preset EQ curvesHigh and low-pass filtersAdvanced Sound RetrieverAuto-EQ equalizes for your car interior automatically (optional mic required)Expandability:Built-in audio iPod control ~ Pioneer's optional adapter required for viewing video content, Pandora control, and AppRadio modePlayback and control of Android media filesCompatible with SiriusXM satellite radio tuner ~ Highly recommendedInputs: rear A/V and USB inputs, rear-view camera inputOutputs: video output, 6-channel preamp outputs (4-volt front, rear, sub-woofer)In AppRadio Mode; you can launch and control compatible iPhone apps from the face of the receiver, enabling you to receive a variety of music, navigation, social media, and other apps at your command. Pioneer's CD-201S cable is required.Built-in Bluetooth: Hands-free calling with your compatible phone, plus the ability to wirelessly stream and control music from your phone or other Bluetooth devices.Built-in HD Radio tuner: CD quality FM broadcasts and exceptional AM reception. You can tune into multiple channels on the same frequency, for more entertainment choices.Optional Sirius/XM satellite radioAdvanced touchscreen controls: Touch Slide technology offers greater control of receiver functions.The AVH-X5500BHS works perfectly with your smartphoneYou can connect your iPod or iPhone to Pioneer's USB input and access your playlists with the receiver's controls, aided by tools like Alphabet Search and Link Search. Many Android phones support the Pioneer Connect app, which lets this receiver access music files when your device is plugged in via USB.You can manage your Pandora account from the touchscreen by connecting your iPhone to the receiver with Pioneer's CD-201S cable. Android users can enjoy the same functionality through a Bluetooth connection. In addition; you can also play all your CDs, DVDs, discs full of MP3 or WMA music, and USB storage devices loaded with files.The Pioneer MIXTRAX feature creates a DJ-like experience with content from your iPod, iPhone, or Android. Between songs it provides variable-color lighting pulses timed with the beat of the music.The receiver's appearance can be changed to match your dash by choosing from five display colors and 112 key panel illumination options.The receiver's 7" WVGA screen incorporates higher-resolution imaging capabilities than most mobile A/V receivers, so it plays DVDs and other video content with bright, clear detail when you're parked. You can keep your passengers entertained during long road trips by sending video from the receiver to a rear-seat screen. You'll be able to view video content from your iPod or iPhone (video playback not available with iPhone 5) with the addition of Pioneer's CD-IU201S cable. For safety, you can plug a rear-view camera into the receiver and it will show you what's behind you when you shift into reverse. Definitely a nice feature.The receiver comes with an 8-band equalizer. It also comes with three pairs of 4-volt preamp outputs making it easier to connect external amplifiers.In most vehicles, you can use an adapter to connect your vehicle's steering wheel controls to this Pioneer stereo. Connect a few wires, then program the adapter for your particular car and the Pioneer, and you'll retain the convenience of your steering wheel controls.You also have the ability to add the Pioneer AVIC-U220 GPS navigation system to the receiver, however at $399; it's a costly option.I would not recommend doing the installation yourself, unless you're experienced at this. I attempted to install my last receiver and ended up causing damage to both the receiver and the dashboard.The clarity of the sound, the crispness of the screen and the multiple features of this unit are phenomenal. There are more expensive units for sale, but in my opinion; this one provides all of the features that you could possibly want in a high-end receiver.

$REVIEW.: It was very easy to mount and it seems they put a lot of thought into mounting.  It is just plastic, though, and while it looks good on the wall, it feels a little cheap, when examining up close.  Considering it's just a piece of plastic, I'd say the price is a little high.  If these were around $10, I'd probably buy a few more.I set this up for my iPad 3.  However, I was rather disappointed, when I tried to put an iPad 1 in there and it didn't fit.  I think if you fit this to be snug for an iPad 1, it will also fit an iPad 2 or 3, but I haven't gotten around to changing it yet.  Changing it will most likely require me to buy more 3M adhesive tape.

$review_text.: I have had this running for a few months now and I am very happy. All it took was a skinny nephew to get in the attic and drill a couple of holes to run the wires. Connection is plug and play and all menus are mouse-driven. It operates independently from your PC.  It is NOT the best picture quality out there but for the price it will do. You can configure it so that you can access the cameras from your smart phone but I am not smart enough to figure it out (guess I need the computer nerd nephew for that). What is most important is not what I see but what any potential thief will see--cameras staring unblinkingly at them. They will go elsewhere. And that is what it is all about.

$review_text.: I use the mouse alot, and have been having increasing pain in my right hand, so I purchased this mouse hoping it would ease all the pain.  I used this about 30 minutes, and it hasn't helped the pain at all, in fact, my hand usually doesn't get this fatigued until 3-4 hours, but with this one, just using it 30 minutes has put me in great pain and hand fatigue.  The issue is in the grip I believe.  Also, you have to move your whole hand, not your wrist, which means that even if your hand didn't hurt, your shoulder and upper arm will get sore from using it alot. One good thing though is that you will probably build muscles and you will burn more calories just sitting at your desk.  :-)

$REVIEW.: This is a fairly simple converter which works exactly as you think it might.  I have confirmed that for my Droid 2, it will both charge the phone as well as allow data transfers.  I was able to tether it with my laptop w/o any problem.I bought this because I have several miniUSB cables already, and rather than buy even more cables, I would just re-purpose those with this converter.
$review_summary.: Simple and it works

$review_text.: I don't know why they decided to pack such a short cable with the original tablet, regardless - this gets the job done and seems well built

Prior to purchasing this I was using USB 3.0 extension cables which can be a bit frustrating overall
I'm glad that this exists.

$REVIEW.: This battery was a life saver for me cause my white macbook was already 3 years old, and the battery life was terrible


This battery basically more than doubled my existing battery life

The rubber base wasn't rubber but moulded plastic, other than that it's been working fine for more than a year now! Apple charges around 3-4times the price of this for a battery, this was surely worth the money.

$review_summary.: Perfect for old white macbooks with batteries which are almost dead.

$REVIEW.: I ran across this 32-inch 1080p TV while shopping for a good HD computer monitor and I love it

The sound is a lot better/deeper than the 720p LCD it replaces


In general, I think the sound is really good


The inputs are limited to 3 HDMI&#8217;s but it suits my purpose

My only criticism, albeit a small one, is that I&#8217;d like for it to be a few more inches off the stand


As is, it sits about 1.5 inches off the surface of my desk

That by no means was a deal breaker for me, as there are other ways I could raise it if I decide too.



$SUMMARY.: I love this TV for my computer monitor

$REVIEW.: One of the reasons I was pleased to receive this Wi-Fi Range Extender was the simple fact that I don't care to have limitations when I want to work on a word document or surf the net. When the weather is good, I like to be outside or at least be able to access the Internet on one of our outbuildings on our property. Now if I feel like it, I can sit outside and browse through the Kindle store and order something rather than try to stay within the somewhat limited Wi-Fi range I now have.Set up was quick and easy and I was good to go within five minutes after taking the unit out of the box. For those unfamiliar with WPS - WiFi Protected Setup I'll toss out a little hint here. Check out your router. There will either be a button labeled WPS or have two arrows, one up, one down, that appear to be moving counter-clockwise. When you press the WPS button on your Wi-Fi extender hold it for a couple of seconds and then the one on your router within a minute or so.If you don't have a WPS button on your router, there are options for connection. You will need to set up your extender manually. You can either set it up to your computer using an ethernet cable (included) or to network name wdrangeextender (not a secure network). All of the information you'll need is in the user manual that can be accessed online.If you don't have that WPS button on your router, you can either pass on this unit or get a bit of additional help from someone a bit more experienced with Wi-Fi setup. Seriously, this is a marvelous unit, but if you aren't particularly computer savvy and don't have a WPS button, don't blame the unit. Note that you do have free 30-day support from the time you first call the company. If you need help, call `em up!WHAT'S IN THE BOX:* My Net Wi-Fi Range Extender* AC Power Cable Adapter* Ethernet Cable* Quick Start Up GuideFEATURES (from the manual):* Intelligence-Automatically transfers Wi-Fi devices to the range extender when your router is out of range.* Flexibility-Choose the 2.4 or 5 GHz band with a flip of the switch on the side of the range extender. No PC required.* Simple to position-Find the optimal location in your home with the Wi-Fi signal strength LEDs.* Fast streaming-Use with WD's My Net(tm) HD Dual-Band Routers for optimal HD entertainment streaming.* Wireless-N-High Speed 802.11n supports multiple HD streams.* Bridge capability-Supports one wired client while in wireless extender mode.This is an awesome little unit, especially for those who aren't computer savvy. The only thing that I would have liked to see would have been an actually physical manual. Granted, green is in, but for some people it is much easier to have a paper manual to thumb through. The online one is excellent, but not as user-friendly. There is a lot of tech support available and I'd recommend using it if necessary. This is an easy-to-use range extender that is seriously awesome. The unit itself is sleek, attractive, and small. It's definitely something I'm enjoying and would recommend that you at least give it a try.

$review_text.: A few months ago I purchased a D250 and kept it for a week or two.  It was nice and all, but the 3-cell battery just didn't cut it for me and I wasn't too pleased with the performance.  Well since my old laptop died, I figured I'd give Acer's D150 a shot since it was offered with the 6-cell battery for the same price as the D250.Build - The build quality of this lil thing is quite nice.  Everything feels very solid.  Nothing rattles, nothing bends or flexes.  The keyboard has a nice feel to it, and is quite easy to type on considering how large my hands are.  Really my only complaint is with the mouse button.  It's a bit difficult to press, and mine tends to move a little making clicky sounds before the button's actually pressed.  Nothing major though.Video - The screen is nice and bright, but lacks contrast.  I'm thinking I read somewhere this screen was tested and was around 200:1.  Regardless, the screen's easy to read under most any lighting conditions.  The dimmest setting still isn't too dim, but not too bright for very dark rooms.  Resolution is fair.  Anything higher would yield tiny letters, but items can seem a bit cramped.  Oh yes, and the little webcam.  All in all it's plenty for video chats.  I can tell a difference between it and my old 1.3MP in my Dell, but nothing major.  Heck most of the quality is lost anyway from compression and such.Audio - Speaker placement is the problem here.  Honestly the speakers don't sound bad and can be quite loud.  The problem is they are under the front.  Using the netbook on a table, the sound's pretty good.  However, using it on your lap or anything that may cover the speakers and you lose almost all the sound...  I've not tried a micrphone connected to it, but I will say I'm a little disappointed with the built-in mic.  With the volume maxed out, I could still hardly be heard.  Hopefully, it was user error...Ports - Nice array of ports.  3 USB, VGA, network, card reader, headphone and mic.  HDMI would have been nice, but not expected in this price range.  Card reader is nice, but I find it very difficult to insert cards.  They sit flush with the side (nice if you don't plan on removing it) and the spring is very stiff.  Also, because it's a multi card reader, some cards get hung on parts inside and must be jiggled around to slide in correctly.  Maybe things will wear down over time...Performance - My particular netbook came with a N280 running at 1.66GHz.  I have also installed 2GB of RAM in it and reloaded it with Ubuntu 9.04 and Windows XP Pro.  All in all the system's rather peppy.  For basic typing and web surfing, it's wonderful.  It's real downfall is with flash videos and such.  HD videos on youtube simply kill this thing.  But don't think it can't handle other HD videos, just ones playing through flash-based players are too much.  Something such as a divx encoded video is fine.Heat - With small size comes less heat distribution.  Even under light usage, the fan is on pretty much constantly.  It's not that bad, but I do wish it were silent.  As for heat, again, normal usage it's not bad at all.  The left side can get a little warm, but it's primarilly the bottom.  The keyboard and tiny palm rest stays pretty cool.  Though start playing too many flash video and you got yourself quite the hand warmer.Battery - With the extended battery, I can get over 4 hours without a problem.  I've not done any offical tests, but I'd expect it could do 5 hours on a full charge, keeping away from videos and such.All in all, it's a fun little laptop to have.  My only real concern I suppose is, again, with flash based items.  These little Atom processors simply can't keep up with what websites are displaying now-of-days.  And I don't just mean video sites.  Check most any car manufacturer's site and it's one big flash file. And of course banners and such (though adblock helps with those).  But aside from being future proof, it's fun to have around and type on.-- EDIT on 09/26/09 --The laptop's been running wonderfully.  My only real complaints are it's difficulties running some higher resolution videos, but that was pretty much expected.  HOWEVER, I have run into a minor problem.  Today I noticed my right shift key was jammed.  If feels as if something's under it, but I have checked and it's clean.  Being so new I'd rather not pop the key off and risk damaging it more, so I contacted Amazon and arranged an exchange/replacement.  I hope it's just a little fluke because I have been very meticulous about this machine...

$REVIEW.: The produc was diferent from advertize, and do not fit the aplication. I have purchased other items from Amazon vendors before without any problems. I purchase this power supply from OutletPC the Amazon advertisement descrived exacly the part I was looking for and claimed to fit my computer. I even clamed to be By Jbrothers which is the original manufacturer of my old part. I was going to pay more to purchase from Jbrothers which is one of the vendors choices in Amazon but they do not deliver to Puerto Rico. I chose the vendor based on my deliveris needs. I have choosen wrong, OutletPC send me a part that was completely diferent from advertize. The pins on the power supply have diferent amount of pins and there was no provided adapter, and even if an adapter was provided it will not fit inside of the computer. I have rate this transaction with one star becase the system do not alowed any lower rating but for me this was like a scam or false adverticement, somthing I would never expected from an Amazon vendor. I have send the part back but the trancsaction is no over, I am still wating for the vendor to process the item. My advice &#34;DO NO BUY FROM OutletPC&#34;!, you will get a produc diferent than advertized.

$REVIEW.: Okay, it cost more to have it shipped to me than what I paid for it. In fact, these things were so cheap, I ordered a half a dozen of them, and gave them to friends.If you keep in mind how cheap they are, you can over look how flimsy they're made. Then, once you get it assembled (on the provided stand, which I like) and plugged in, with all your usb gadgets attached, you will appreciate that it works just as well as any unit costing ten times as much. I have one in my personal computer bag, one on my home computer, and one in my business computer bag.Only issue, don't try to boot up your computer with this attached (and a lot of gadgets plugged in). Most laptops will not be able to handle seeing so many usb devices simultaneously, and not finish booting. I found that if I boot up my computer first, then plug it in (even with all 7 ports working) it works flawlessly.Very satisfied.

Had some initial problems with the Echo's standard firmware retrieving recorded TV but was able to correct with installing the current BETA version. Work great now. Response time is nearly identical to video off my MCE server. Video quality is excellent. Small remote control is not the best. I have replaced it with an HP MCE remote controller purchased off the internet for $10.99 that has the same functionality, plus some. You only need the remote controller. You do not need an IR receiver, just the remote controller. The Ceton tech support, thru a online ticket process was able to assist me getting everything working as advertised. Responses to tickets were within 24 hrs. Would recommend this product to someone with some Microsoft skills and understanding of Windows Media Center.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item to replace an ADS unit that would not work for Windows 7. Based on other helpful reviews, I was fully aware that you should get the most recent drivers before trying to install on Windows 7 (always a good suggestion for any device on any operating system.  Having done this, I was able to quickly install and use the device.  The software that comes with it to make the digital copy is ok, but if you have another video editing software package, you can get better quality. I was able to use video director 9, which I purchased for video editing and was able to select this as a capture device once it was installed. Video is very good considering it is coming from old tapes.The unit tends to heat up, so keep it in a well ventilated place if you are copying multiple tapes.  I did 4 hours in one stretch and it did just fine.Great product for the price to digitize your memories before the tapes degrade.

I got it so I can play my iRiver 8gb iRiver clix2 without headphones!  This thing hasn't disappointed me one bit.  The sound is deep and resonant.  The highs are crisp and clear.  The volume gets very loud and its very portable!  I can use my clix2 when I'm building a deck or playing frisbee with my dog.  I connect it to my laptop, which is where i have all my mp3's and my main computer is free for interstellar piracy while I play Eve online.

$REVIEW.: I'm a recent convert to higher-quality headphones, and these are my second pair. I got them to replace a set of Shure SE-110s which, unfortunately, the family puppy got hold of over the holiday break. I'd had some concerns rise during my use of the Shures, and thought I should look around before replacing them.I chose these Bose buds because the sound was so rich and vibrant. The Shures had needed some boosting in the EQ settings to please my ears, but these Bose earphones are sensational without any tinkering. I was also happy to once again have earphones that are quick and easy to get in and out, but I was concerned about outside noise, as the primary perk of the Shures was their ability to block outside noise. While these Bose buds do allow more outside noise to trickle in, I was perfectly happy listening to my iPod amidst the crowd in a busy mall, and I forsee few problems with this in the future.These have an excellent quality of sound and are whole-heartedly recommended.2011 UPDATE: Being a bit better versed in audio equipment, I must say that while I enjoyed these for as long as I had them, their sound signature is a bit muddy and is overly thick with bass. They're a definite improvement on stock buds, but at the Tri-Ports current price point, you'd be better off going with theKlipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphoneswhich, while still somewhat heavy on the low-end, offers much greater clarity.

$REVIEW.: Creative Nomad Zen Xtra appears to be the most consumer-budget-friendly hard disk based mp3 player on the market. Creative built this player using a standard, 2.5" wide and 9.5 mm thick hard disk used in laptop computers. These hard drives are bigger and heavier than the whole iPod; however, since they made in huge quantities, they are rather inexpensive. This allowed Creative to offer a 40 GB player at a price close to half of that of iPod and iRiver with the same disk size. Additional built-in savings feature (which apparently added another millimeter or two to Zen's thickness) is user-replaceable lithium-ion battery. One can find a spare battery from twenty dollars, keep a charged spare at hand when going on a long trip, and replace it faster than it takes to change AA batteries in a portable CD player. All other comparable mp3 players must be disassembled to replace the battery (which usually loses its capacity after 250-400 charging cycles), which costs roughly twenty-thirty dollars for the battery and approximately fifty to seventy dollars for a five minute installation job.Yes, Zen Xtra is bulky - it is 0.3'' taller, 0.6" wider, and 0.3" thicker than iPod, and 2.3 oz heavier. This seem to be not a lot on the paper, but when you hold an iPod in one hand and Zen Xtra in the other, it does seem BIG. It does not look that bulky after you get used to it (or have no iPods nearby), but it is still feels heavy if you put it into your shirt pocket on in your fanny pack.Out of the box, it comes with a partially charged battery and about 60 pre-loaded pieces of popular classical music (not a stellar performance, but good melodies). The earbuds are comfortable and have surprisingly clear distortion-free sound. However, thier bass is not very strong, and trembles could be somewhat more transparent. The sound quality of the player is very good (&lt;0.1% harmonic distortions, 98 dB signal-to-noise ratio), it support mp3 up to 320 kbps as well as WAV and WMA. In fact, the general opinion seems to be that its sound quality is the best of all mp3 players in its class.The unit comes with a 12-month warranty. The information on Creative's web site (as at the end of February 2005) was contradictory, but I got confirmation from their customer support that their new policy is 12 month and no longer 90 days.Zen Xtra supports USB 2 and USB 1.1 (although does not support charging through the USB port) but does not work with firewire. Its software (required to copy sound tracks and data files back and forth between the player and your PC) can be installed on any version of Windows, including 98. Mac is not supported. The first application uses Windows Explorer interface; the second one is more elaborate, provides more sophisticated user interface, and supports ripping of music into mp3 format.I read many negative reports on Creative Media Source, but I personally find this piece of software very convenient and efficient. It indeed takes some time to figure how it works and why it works this way, but once you figured it out, it works great.All tracks are saved in the root folder on the player's hard drive (data files can be saved with folders), and looking through an endless list of files in Nomad Explorer could be very intimidating. This is where the Media Source comes into play - its multi-window structure allows you very quickly display tracks which match certain standard selection criteria, such as genre, artist, or album. This is in a way similar to instant arrangement of tracks into folders, as one would do it on a computer.The player comes with a decent quality leather case, a charger, and a USB cable.To summarize, Zen Xtra is not as cute and tiny as the iPod, and does not have the iRiver's endless set of capabilities. But if offers you 40 GB for $150+ less, and saves you another $50+ each time you need a new battery. It is bulky, but it plays very well, has long battery life, solid feel, and a quite convenient user interface. It is the player to buy if its size and weight are not major factors, but the price is. Six stars for the value, four stars for the size and weight, five in average.
$SUMMARY.: Good value - lower cost per gigabyte traded for larger size

$review_text.: This is our second unit.  The first one still works, but it's my wife's, and I wanted a charging dock for my own iPod.  Could have tried a different brand, but why take a chance when I knew this one's a winner.PROS:reliable (the first one is almost 2 years old and we've never had a problem with it)decent sound quality (good enough for us, probably not good enough for audiophiles)small (a big plus: this fits on a shelf in the night-table next to the bed)works with iPod Touch 2G and 4G (recharges, plays music)includes snap-in adapters for various models of iPodsthree buttons on top: volume++, power on/off, volume--iPod screen and buttons, including the "Home" button, are easily reachable while iPod is in dock.runs on 120v or 4-AA batterieson/off switch on back to save AA batteries when not plugged inCON:a little tricky to properly seat the iPod onto the dock's connector.  In fairness, this could be because our iPods are in protective silicone cases, so the snap-in adapter for the iPod Touch is just a bit too small, and we have to use the "universal" adapter, which is just a bit too big.UPDATE: tried two other silicone cases.  One was pretty flimsy (Black Silicone Soft Skin Cover Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation Protector Case), but let the iPod connect to this dock with the same "universal" adapter.  The other is very good (iLuv iCC613BLK Silicone Case with 3D Pattern for iPod touch 4G (Black)) but so thick that I had to cut a little of it off to make it possible for the iPod to connect to this dock.
$SUMMARY.: Nice, small unit, good price, decent sound

$review_text.: This battery worked fine but right about 11 months old it started to decline. Almost like clockwork right at the 12 month warranty period deadline my computer said the battery was bad and needed replaced. I contacted the seller and they said the warranty had ended however I emailed them 2 weeks before the 12 months was up. In the end the battery worked fine for almost a year, keep that in mind when thinking of what battery you want to order. If the price is low enough it may be worth it, or it may be worth it to pay a little more for a longer lasting battery.

$REVIEW.: Nice..have 3, but Win7 drivers update Ctr + E problem and FixI really liked this docking station for the price and portability*...from system to system that is. I have had cheaper ones that would somehow turn off the internal fans of our laptops (fried 2 centrino's this way).I like the button on the top to undock or the system tray icon context menu (right click) undock and sleep for when I go home, but when the new software came out for windows 7 all of the sudden control + E undocks the station. I have a few programs that I use control + E in so this was a serious problem.Control + E undock fix: I found that mixing and matching the software that came with the dynadock with the windows 7 updated drivers let me use the control + e shortcut with no problems.Forgot exactly what versions of each I used. My Dynadock utility is version 2.1.1.0 and I think all of the rest of the drivers are updated as 3.x.Still like the unit as I am buying 3 more right now.*Portability: I have to baby sit about 120 comps, 20 of which are laptops. After buying that specific laptop docking station a few times and having the model names change every 3 months so finding a dock for a 6 month old laptop was an issue (LENOVO and ACER :).

$REVIEW.: Nice, neat little sticky notes. Sticky notes alone are precious and helpful, even in the digital age.But when you blend them with a Livescribe pen, Livescribe Connect, and (perhaps)Evernote?It just does not get any better. By writing on one of these, the writing is stored in my pen, then it is uploaded on to my computer. I can then email the sticky note, sync into Evernote, or just store it in my computer. Evernote syncs between the different computers I use, so I now have a copy of the sticky note on every computer. Plus, I leave the note where it needs to be. As a student, that's often inside a book for a research project.Here's how that works for me: while reading a book or journal for research, I jot notes on these stickies with my Livescribe pen. I put the sticky notes in the text. Then, I sync the pen. Now, if I have taken good enough notes, I can do the bulk of my writing without having to keep a stack of books with me the whole time. I can write at home or at Starbucks or at the office or at the student center---you get the idea. But, I've left the note in the book in case I need further reference.I can jot down a to-do list that then syncs into my computer. I use these for short grocery lists (email the note to my Blackberry or store in Evernote). It helps me generate a note that's available in two places (at least) at the same time. This is a great thing.

While they work quite well, I had some issues, mostly during configuration, where the SSID would drop or the system would return to defaults, or some other problem. I wasn't able to successfully nail down what the issue was, but it seemed that as long as I wasn't messing with it too much things behaved quite well.Reception is good, although its not the best. If you are buying this as a single router I would suggest you step up to the more powerful EA3500, which has a full 3x3 antenna with support for MIMO devices that will enabled higher throughput and greater reception.

$review_text.: I have been the proud owner of a nuvi 660 for several years now

 It succeeded my earlier more primitive Garmin GPS
 I love everything about my nuvi except its former habit of falling off my windshield
 The suction mount it came with would let go at will -- because it didn't like the way I had secured it, because it was hot outside, because it was cold outside, maybe because it got tired

 And my nice nuvi would crash to the floor of my car


 And it got very old cleaning the windshield for suction cup, looking at the little circle the suction cup left when the GPS wasn't mounted, and worrying some thief would spot the telltale ring and break into the car.Well, all that is over now, because this friction mount is the best thing since sliced bread
 It works ANYWHERE -- in my Town Car, in my Subaru, in my husband's truck, and any other place with a flat dashboard, which is virtually every car made
 It does not move at all
 It perfectly positions the GPS for viewing and easy reaching of its touch screen
 The design is simple and straightforward

 The ball mount that comes with the flat part of the dashboard mount simply slides into place, and a small lever to the right of the slide locks it
 (Removal of the ball mount for the GPS is equally easy:  unlock and release)  Then add your GPS and you are good to go.I rarely write reviews but this product is simply wonderful and anyone with a nuvi should get it

 In fact this should be Garmin's standard mount, not its irksome windshield suction cup.


$review_summary.: Definitely the BEST way to mount a Garmin nuvi!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this computer with the intention to immediately wipe the HDD and start fresh with Ubuntu 64-bit

Free of bloatware and the limitations of Win7 Starter, this computer is lightning fast! Running kernel 2.6.38, the touch screen works perfectly and everything is as smooth and natural as you'd expect it to be
Great for checking your mail or listening to music, but videos greater than 720p on youtube will slow to crawl (not that you need 1080p on a screen with such low resolution!)The small keyboard is surprisingly usable, it doesn't feel particularly difficult to type, and this is coming from a guy with fairly large hands

Multi-touch on the trackpad is a nice feature, and you'll quickly get used to two-finger scrolling.It works great for what it's meant to do, but I would definitely recommend upgrading to a capable version of Windows or investigating your options with Linux
(Fedora and Ubuntu being the best choices, IMO)I might note that the viewing angle isn't the best, and that while you can change the orientation of the display, no way but right-side-up will ever look quite right


Low screen resolution holds this computer back a little, but it's not a deal breaker, and you can't really expect much higher resolution on a screen of this size.Lots of fun to use, I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: I bought this 2 GB SD card from Kingston for my Archos 405 Portable Media Player but the player does not read it. It doesn't even detect it and when I get in the file manager it freezes. I also bought two 1 GB microSD cards from Kingston with SD adapters and none of them work with the Archos 405. At first I thought it was the media player but I tried it with my old 128Mb SD card I have and it works fine. I'm not blaming the cards either, they all work fine with my Kodak camera and the microSD cards work fine with my cell phones. I think it's just a compatibility problem between Archos and Kingston. If you have an Archos media player, try another brand. By the way, Archos media players can use SD HC up to 16 GB.I use it now in my camera and I can store up to 1500 photos at 5 Mpixels. That's great but it is a bit slow. There are faster SD cards in the market if you are willing to pay more.

This IMac computer is all in one in a smaller package and having control of the UNIX internals has a lot to desire. After power it up, the display is not good enough for reading text for an extended period. I also notice color smears on low quality JPEG file. While I have no complaint about their higher quality display for the MacBook Pro or even the IPAD 3, the quality of this 21.5'' display is not up to the reputation of Apple product with its poor quality LED for someone who use computer for reading text at this price point.LEDs should never bleed to adjacent ones to preserve the sharpness, Imac LEDs bleeds all over the screen. It also explains poor picture quality. I notice it in sample display at BB, but the condition is more noticeable at home alone.I also don't like the keyboard, too flimsy and total lack of tactile feel and too small for many, I can't type with confidence w/o looking at my fingers. Apply products are always stylist, but they must satisfy the functionality first. To put some good quality LED like Amazon Kindle for reading is not that difficult.

$REVIEW.: I just got this package and I am quite pleased.  Firstly, the case is an improvement over the one that the Kindle comes with.  It has a slimmer profile and a cutout in the back, for the switches. (The original case does not, and I found it was starting to bend, from reaching under it,to turn the device on or off.)  It holds the Kindle very securely and I like the snap closure. I am confident that it will stay closed. Also,I am among those who like the fact that this case can stand up, freeing your hands.Secondly, the light is nice. It takes AAA batteries, which you can get anywhere, cheaply. (Button batteries are more expensive, less available and often harder to put in.)  The light can stand on its own or clip to the case. I clip it to the top.  If positioned well, it gives off light that is adequately bright, without causing any glare.  And, since it has an LED, you will not have to replace a bulb.I highly recommend this package.

I own headphones from Klipsch, Sony, AKG, Sennheiser, Able Planet, Audio Technica, Loudicras by Soul and Unisone. I am running a $1000 Denon SACD player with coax into a $500 AKG headphone amp. The sound I am getting from these headphones is nothing short of fantastic!. You would have to spend $400+ to get anything that sounds better and even then it would be marginal. Bass is low and tight, drum heads thump and pound realistically and cymbals shimmer. Instrument localization is unreal. When was the last time you heard the hum from an electric guitar amp on a CD during a quit passage? They are also very comfortable. My only complaint is that the EQ when on is sometime sensitive to its' input (it will turn off after a few second of no signal input and you have to slide the on/off switch to turn it back on). If you only make one headphone purchase, this should be it.

$REVIEW.: I am a mobile dj and purchased these couplers for my speakers because I didn't want to have to buy all new cables. I was a little concerned at first but I was very presently surprised by it. It was packaged well and has a very durable shell. I would reccomend this for all applications. The only downfall is that it is big which is something that is consistent to all 1/4 inch couplers. I would recommend this, especially at the price.

$REVIEW.: This backpack is HUGE! The main pocket is just massive. Unfortunately, I have an Asus G73SW laptop and it does not fit into the inner laptop pocket. The laptop fits in the general area of the main pocket, which is fine with me. That laptop is a massive thing, so I knew it would be a long shot to get a pocket to fit it. There's also a tablet pocket for extra protection and some envelope style velcro pockets on these protective pockets. At the bottom of the main pocket is a shock absorbing pad, so I feel comfortable using it to store my electronics.As far as other pocket sizes, it seems pretty good. The side water bottle mesh is huge and fits my soft-shell Brita bottle with ease. The mesh comes up to the screw off lid. The zipper pockets on the sides are also really huge and can hold more bottles, snacks, or any other item in those general shapes. The two smaller front pockets are really nice. The smallest one on the front has a soft lining in it for delicate objects. I put my glasses in there and it can hold a lot more. The larger of the two front pockets has spots to hold writing utensils, business cards, and other items. Even though it's a smaller pocket, it's still massive.Overall, this backpack is huge. Being a college student, this thing is going to be great to haul all of my books in for classes. It's all black so I think it looks great. The only issue I have is the handle on the back of it rests in a down position, so you have to move it out of the way after you put the backpack on. Other than that, this is the best backpack I've ever owned.

This unit replaced my Sony home theater unit, which was also superb. I thought until the Onkyo TX-SR506 took over and proved what superb really means. For the price of the Onkyo TX-SR506 it surpasses a lot of the more expensive name brands, which I found out in my research for new Home Theater Receiver. Of course this unitOnkyo TX-SR506 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)won't be breaking any windows with it's wattage, but then again it's pleasant to the ears of an old Classic Rock fan.

$REVIEW.: Works but there is a trick to it. So I purchase a Lenovo Yoga 10 tablet and installed the card and it told me the card was damaged, I put the card in my PC and it worked fine, I even reformatted it in the PC, still no luck. Called Lenovo and they walked me through formatting it again in the PC and still didn't work BUT there was an option in the Android software that is a status screen (pull down from the top of the screen) and that gave me a choice to let me format it in the tablet and after it completed it I was good to go, it mounted and I downloaded my 318 songs on it and it is working like a charm. Only thing I can think of is that Android doesn't like the way SanDisk formats their cards. I think if everyone knew about this there would be a lot less returns.

$REVIEW.: But with some caution in reference to stills shooters, whilst this is a step up from the 60d in a good number of ways, I think it's really most appealing to people who have a fairly serious interest in video.I'm by no means a pro level video shooter, but was quite impressed with how Canon have implemented the much talked about phase detect AF off the &#34;sensor&#34;


I've used the 7d and 60d bodies on and off for a few years, and the 70d is one of the better Canon offerings for some time.My pros and cons listPros:+ Happy with the build quality, no it's not magnesium alloy, but good quality plastics and a strong solid feel+ On sensor phase detect works really well, it's not &#34;as fast&#34; as using the optical finder but it's heaps faster than the very slow off sensor contrast AF on previous Canon DSLR's

It's quite capable of tracking movements well+ Buffer is quite decent for this class of camera
I got about 14-15 shots in raw with a SanDisk Extreme Pro 95MB/s card
Jpeg buffer is really decent too I counted over 35 shots if not a bit more with no signs of slowing+ Touch screen works well and swivel LCD is handy for stills and video+ Smooth autofocus with the touch screen (touch to target AF) on video this is a big step forward for serious video shooters+ 7fps is really quite fast for action shooting and more than enough for most, not quite 8fps Canon 7d but a good improvement on the 5.3fps of the 60d+ The 70d now has the 7d's 19 point all cross type AF system another nice jump up over the 60d+ AF adjustments! Finally Canon came to their senses and restored this function sorely missed on the 60d+ AF performance is very good, speed is fast (easily faster than the D7100 and older 60d) and accuracy is similar to the 7d+ Now has wifi which allows you to control the camera remotely via iphone/android phone etc+ Quite happy with the metering Canon's 63 zone system it's mostly on target and consistent+ Very good battery life around 900 shots with optical finder+ Mode dial, minor point but they put the scene modes into one area (SCN) position which is much better than before on the 60d with scene modes taking half the dial space+ Stereo mic v Mono mic on 60d+ I like the new AF expansion mode button just behind the shutter release, good placement+ Really well specified camera in most ways excellent customisation, good higher spec 1/8000 sec shutter, 1/250 sec flash sync, crackingly good crisp/ clear swivel rear LCD
You really want for very little on this body it's not quite fully loaded but not far off.Cons:- Viewfinder is a bit larger than the 60d's (very slightly) but still not 100% or quite as big/bright as the 7d's- In terms of pure image quality you get a few extra megapixels but I don't feel there is much improvement in either high ISO performance or dynamic range v the 18mp CMOS sensor from Canon- Still only one card slot

I've never had problems with lost images but I have to admit dual cards can be very useful- Level gauge is good, but just single axis not pitch (front/back angle)- Live view/video drains battery much quicker than normal finder, not a shock here but if you are doing video/live view a lot carry extra batteries (2 or 3)- Rear dial is even smaller than the 60d when I'd prefer it to be a bit bigger- On-board microphone whilst it's now stereo is still pretty poor like most built in mics it has poor tonal range and frequency response
Get an external mic for serious video work- I did notice some moire on a few video clips- Strangely there is no white balance button on the camera


Auto WB performance isn't bad, but it's not amazing either (esp lower light or mixed light sources)- No dedicated AF assist lamp, I think it's time Canon started offering this on some models- Yet another battery grip: BG-E14 would have been useful if the 60d's grip fitted this but it won't- No headphone socket, might annoy video usersI'll split this into 2 camps having spent a good week or so shooting with the camera.Stills shooters with a strong interest in Video (or primary video shooters):Get it, the new phase detect off the sensor is very good and will change how you make videos

Touch to focus screen is also very smooth and accurate making filmic scenes for video much easier

This wasn't really possible before, and with the 18-135mm STM focus is quick and effectively silent (lens is quite sharp overall too) Yes it is a revolution for video shooters and a huge upgrade over any previous DSLR's out there for AF.Stills shooters who don't shoot much video:If you've a Canon 60d it might be worth a look with some nice upgrades such as faster fps, touch screen, AF micro adjustments, but I'd be tempted to wait for the price to drop.7d users will like the 70d's performance, but the buffer whilst good isn't as big as the 7d's, nor is the build as meaty due to plastics v mag alloy on the 7d the 70d just isn't as pro like build wise


I can't see many 7d users replacing that body with this (good as a second body though)If you are thinking about a mid range DSLR then it's this v the D7100


Tricky choice as the Nikon has lots of AF points, dual cards, and better build and a few more features

On the other hand the really small buffer on the D7100 is a real disappointment (way smaller than the 70d's), so I'd recommend the 70d over that model for action/wildlife shooters.Overall I really like the camera, some niggles as there always is
But it depends a lot on what you do.Video people, this is it, essential purchaseStills shooters, well it's a very solid camera and a decent update over previous models, but you gain very little if anything in terms of pure image quality over older models, it's a great buy if you need the new &#34;improved&#34; bits, but don't buy this expecting a revolution in image quality

You might be better to sit it out for a while for a better price


Or pick up a 60d or 7d for a bargain price...or possibly move up to the 6d if full frame appeals.Update 12/04/14:I've been using the 70d frequently for a good few months now
To date I have no major concerns at all
I did read some an online review comparing the normal phase detect AF to the sensor phase detect showing a big difference in AF accuracy (far more than I would expect to see on any camera, possibly a bad body)
I have tested and used quite a few lenses with my 70d and have found that very few require any AF fine tuning, and those that do only very small adjustments


Even faster primes such as the 50mm f1.4, 85mm f1.8 seem spot on for autofocus most of the time.Like any DSLR no AF system is perfect, but to date it's hard to tell any real world differences between the 70d and the 7d (they use the same AF system)Minor niggles, I do like the 7d joystick - but it's not a huge downer to not have it
I would prefer a slightly bigger firmer rear dial, but again I'm splitting hairs a bit.It's still in my view the most rounded Canon DSLR to date, esp for video use (and I've been experimenting more with video as the sensor AF is very good) But also for stills live view where the previous Canon's were pretty slow (really not ideal for anything bar static subjects), the fast phase detect AF is a real and valuable step forward for the EOS system.Lens choices are huge with Canon, I would suggest as a general purpose lens the 18-135mm STM is a very good offering (and not a bad price) the STM motor is silent for video use a very worthwhile lens

The 15-85mm is a good lens offering a true wide angle on the 1.6x crop sensor (24-136 mm equivalent) it's much better than the 17-85mm it replaced, other lenses worth a look 50mm f1.8 or f1.5, the 85mm's are great for portrait work
Budget glass both Tamron and Sigma have some good offerings too.Still very pleased, I will update the review further if any issues/concerns/thoughts come to light

 Moreover, the sound quality was disappointing&#8212;noise isolation is much worse than I've experienced with other sets of noise-isolating headphones

 Tried all three sizes of buds, nothing worked, and the size difference was so dramatic between all three, the &#34;middle&#34; option was the only one that seems could be feasible for most ears.Bottom-line:  If you want a safe & high-quality item, look elsewhere.

$REVIEW.: I got the +1 +2 +4 set for my Canon 15-85mm lens on my 60D. I like it and I'm satisfied with its performance only considering the cheap price. In absolute terms, the genuine Canon 500D (+2 diopter) with its double-element achromatic design is much better, and, even better than that are dedicated macro lenses. Of course, prices increase dramatically as you upgrade. This single-element non-coated Vivitar set? Well...its OK (maybe even subpar)..but I like it and think its a great way to see if you like to spend the time doing close-up shots. I have some pics uploaded to show its capabilities.Remember, its not true macro (1:1 magnification). How close up you can get depends on the lens you use. I use an online calculator if you google "cambridge close up lens" to show what you can achieve. For my lens at 85mm I get .55x magnification. Pretty good.Image quality does degrade a lot the more you go up in diopter power. +4 is probably the most I would use. I did stack them up beyond +4 and the blurry borders were just too ugly for me. +2 is better than +4, and +1 is better than +2. At +4, there is pronounced purple fringing and the corners get soft, however, the center performance is awesome despite the small decrease in contrast. Post-processing can fix the purple fringing and contrast, but not the soft corners. Although....by knowing this limitation, one can still take great photos by keeping your focused subject near the center. The blurry borders will then just mix with the bokeh (unfocused planes).I think what matters here at this price point is that you get to try out close-up photography. You experiment with what it takes to get up close and personal, using tripods, flashes, and what not. This little cheapo set opened my eyes to the potential of close-up photography and I like it! If I practice and make good pics with this, then using a macro lens should be even better. I recommend it to those on a tight budget and unsure if close-up photography is their thing.
$SUMMARY.: I like it. Inexpensive way to try close-up photography.

$REVIEW.: Really handy charger to have since it doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet.  What I really like about it is that it charges really fast.  Out of the box, I used it to charge my nearly dead smartphone and it was fully charged in less than an hour.  It's also nice that the charger has a light indicator to show how much charge is left.  Although it charges phones quickly, the charger itself takes a couple of hours to get recharged since it has to be plugged to a computer. This charger has magnetic clips to keep the wire neat when not in use, a nice feature if you're going to use it on the go.  It's a bit pricey at more than $50 and I wonder what its lifespan is. But it is a very good product from Energizer.

$REVIEW.: I ordered two of these mounts, one for a backup because it seemed like a good way to mount the detector.  This summer, after only a few months of using it, the suction cup separated from the unit.  It looked like it just tore away from the mount. Others claim it is heat or cold.  I'm not so sure it isn't just a poor design.  I installed the second mount yesterday.  I'll see how long it lasts. Two stars are given instead of one because I'm an optimist and hopeful the second mount holds up.*** UPDATE ***Okay, the second one failed July 23rd just as the first one did.  It seemed to fail slowly over time.  At first it fit snug against the windshield.  It slowly developed a gap that required me to adjust the detector back to level again. Yesterday it almost completely separated from the suction cup and became unusable. It appears the weight of the detector pulls the center out of the suction cup over time.  This mount is exactly what I wanted but I wouldn't recommend it because of it's short life span.

I like modular power supplies as I only install the cables I need to reduce clutter and to improve the air flow throughout the computer case.  The construction just looks more professional and it does make a difference in the cooling of the system.This power supply runs extremely cool and quiet and it has a 135 mm fan to help keep your system cool.  The unit also comes with a vibration dampening gasket included.  This power supply was designed to power multiple GPU cards and has cables to power either SLI or CrossFire X installations.  The PSU is rated at 80+ percent efficiency and therefore it reduces power as it is not wasted as heat.This computer build is fully loaded and the power supply safely handles all the components without any problems.

After 18 months four has stopped charging, I called Amazon there is no fix, you have to pay have the device replaced. Not all was bought in the same year so I'm waiting to see how long the remainder 5 will last. Maybe I was expecting too much from Amazon.

$review_text.: I've been using this stand with my iPad 2, and it has been working well so far. When the iPad is stood up in portate mode, the stand feels a little wobbly, but since I mainly use it in landscape with the stand, it performs quite well. Construction feels sturdy, and it is not made of super cheap plastic. Also, the stand folds up so it would be great for people who use their tablets on the go. Overall, I would recommend this stand for the price.

$REVIEW.: Before I bought my Shuffle, I read every review here, and was disappointed that nobody had compared it with other flash players.  So, I ended up doing some comparisons, and thought I'd post the info for others in their mp3 player search.Let me first say, that if I were to buy a hard drive-based mp3 player, it would absolutely be an iPod; they're just the best.  However, when it comes to the flash-based players, the Shuffle has a good deal of competition out there.  The players I looked at were the Shuffle, the iAudio U2, the iRiver iFP 799T , and the Creative MuVo TX FM, all 1GB models.  The first choice I made was whether or not I wanted an internal battery or a AA or AAA battery.  There are pro's and con's to both, which I think are pretty intuitive.  I ended up wanting an internal battery because I wanted the lightest player possible.  However, the iRiver was a real contender for the simple fact that you can get a waterproof case and headphones, so you can actually use it while swimming!  After looking at the iRiver, I didn't like how the player was designed.  The buttons were hard to operate (I wear size 10 gloves-XL) and it appeared that it would be awkward to use while running.  I didn't like the Creative because it felt low-quality and the design of it coming apart wasn't appealing.  Thus, I was left with the Shuffle and the iAudio U2, both of which I bought and used, with the intention of keeping the one I liked more.Accessories:Shuffle - came with decent headphones, and a heavy string-like lanyard.  Not included were a case $26, or an armband $30.iAudio U2 - came with a sport case, decent headphones, a very nice lanyard (looks like a silver chain), firewire/USB adapter, firewire/USB corded adapter, and depending on where you buy it, a free armband ($7 retail).Sound Quality:I should start off by stating that I am an audiophile, so I used a pair of high-end Shure E3c earbuds ($180) in my evaluation.  I also used the stock earbuds for both players briefly.  Both work fine but just aren't up to the level of what I desire.  Also, it should go without saying that the quality of the mp3's that you put on your player have the biggest impact on the quality of the sound.Shuffle - Not bad, but could be better.  It would have been nice to have been able to adjust the highs and lows.  Due to the design of the Shuffle, you can not adjust the bass or treble.iAudio U2 - Wow, to say it was good would be an understatement.  It was very rich and deep, with excellent high and deep lows.  Because the U2 has a display, you can go into the menu's and make an incredible number of adjustments to the sound.  If you have an ear that can tell differences in sound quality, then take a hard look at this player.Design/Features:Shuffle - I like the shuffle design a lot, and I think their case is the bomb.  We all know it doesn't have a display or a radio, so enough of that already...  If you want a display or a radio, then get something else instead of venting on this forum.  One feature that I do LOVE on the shuffle is the built-in USB port.  It is VERY nice to be able to take the end cap off and see a USB port on the end.  Also, because the Shuffle is thin, it's easy to plug into a laptop USB port without it blocking the other port.  On desktops, you might need a cable since the configuration/design of desktop USB ports is hit and miss.  Of particular disappointment is the on/off switch.  If you use the shuffle in the gym, and you get sweaty in any way, you're not going to be able to work the on/off switch very well.  It's very slick.  Why does this matter?  Well, if you're on random mode and you want to put it in continuous mode (perhaps you want to hear more songs from the current artist playing) then you inevitably turn it off.  Of course, once you turn it off then you've lost being able to listen to that artist.  I do like the control pad on the shuffle as it's attractive and easy to use.  Whenever you shut the Shuffle off, the volume goes down to 0.  Every time you turn it on, you have to push the volume up button about 15-20 times (not an exaggeration).  Because of this, you don't know if it's playing or not, and it can take a few moments until you know if you're going to be hearing music.  I'm sure with more use this would be less of an issue, but I used it for a month and it still bothered me.  In this case, a display would be nice (okay, I said it.)  Also, because I have over 500 cd's, it is nice to be able to look at the display when I forget the name of the artist/song.  This would probably be much less of an issue for someone with a small audio collection.iAudio - Very sleek and impressive.  It has a FM Radio; recording from mic, radio, or line in; a graphic equalizer, many pre-set eq settings, date and time clock, fun visualizations, left/right speaker display, volume display, name of song display, and is backlit.  The display crams a great deal of information in the small space, but because it's razor sharp, it's useful.  The backlight is nice and very bright (it's not always on).  The radio works fine, and the recording capability works well too.  The menu's are many and go deep.  The case is made to be more durable, and as a result is a neoprene-type material with rubber, but it has cutouts for the controls.  With the case on, it makes the control stick a little more challenging to use, but it's not by any means difficult.  It does not sheild moisture as good as the Shuffle case would.  The U2 case is better suited to being dropped and looks as though it'd absorb shock better.  The way you recharge the U2 is to use it's firewire port.  It comes with a rather fat firewire/USB adapter, so you may have to unplug your other USB accessories for it to fit.  However, that's if you use the small adapter, if you use the adapter that is corded (both are included), then this is not a problem.  The U2 uses a control stick in addition to a few buttons.  Most tasks are accomplished using the stick, which is very easy to operate.  I was expecting it to be sensitive and difficult to use, but it is not, and I have fairly large hands.Battery Life:Both are internal and seem to get about the same 10-12 hours of play, however, the Shuffle can take an optional battery pack or an external adapter for plugging/charging it in a wall outlet.  Both of those features totally rock.  However, the iAudio can have the battery replaced for $40 as opposed to the Shuffle's $99.Software:Shuffle - It's iTunes or it's nothing.  And not just iTunes, but iTunes format which is NOT mp3, it's aac.  If you have all your audio files in mp3, then iTunes will convert them to aac, but you lose audio quality that way (not an option for me).  If you want to reburn all your cd's into aac format, then you can retain the audio quality.  If your files are already in aac, then the shuffle is the player you probably want.  Also, when you burn a CD in iTunes, it burns it as aac.  In order to get it to mp3, you have to burn it to CD, and then copy it back to the hard drive.  AGHH!!!  The madness!!!  Why does Apple have to be so difficult?!  The only positive I see with using iTunes is that its interface is nice, and it runs fast.  If the Shuffle would play mp3's, it'd be MUCH more of a contender in my book.iAudio U2 - The U2 shows up as a hard drive and you can drag and drop files into it (any kind of files), without having to install any software.  However, if you have a huge audio library, then that just doesn't work as it's too cumbersome.  The U2 comes with audio management software that will find your music files and you can manage it that way.  It's fast, and works well, but it isn't as nice as the iTunes interface.  Musicmatch is my mp3 software of choice, and it is very slow when compared to iTunes, but it's much more versatile for my use and is compatible with the U2.Overall Assessment:The Shuffle IS very cool looking, and if we are buying the latest and greatest flash player, then we DO want it to be cool, right?  However, even though I think the look of the Shuffle is awesome, especially with the cool case you can get for it, I still have to side with the U2.  I really wanted to like the Shuffle, I really did, but when I took it into work to listen to some music, I couldn't because of the aac format of the files.  And when I discovered what you had to do to change those files into mp3's, I was frustrated; it's just not versatile enough for my use.  Also, because the audio quality of the U2 is a step above the Shuffle, that's what ultimately swayed me, so I kept the U2 and returned the Shuffle.  The Shuffle's audio quality isn't bad by any means, it's just that the U2's is really, really good.  If you have any doubts about my ravings over the audio quality of the U2, just search the web and look at other reviews.  Also, because of all the accessories that came with the U2, it was also the better value.

$REVIEW.: I thought that Sony would produce a good product, even though some reviews indicated that this wasn't so any longer.  Well, I found out the hard way that those terrible reviews were right on the mark.This unit played well for two days, and I have to admit that the picture quality was excellent, even when streaming over the Internet.  But this all ended on day three, when the unit could no longer access Internet content.  I tried everything, including many attempts to redo the networking and a long chat session with one of the Sony tech support people.  I use wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, and all the other devices on the LAN worked perfectly, except for Sony's piece of junk.  I could see that the unit got through the router and saw the WAN, but I could also see that it couldn't get service from the provider, which may have been a third-party server that it connects to.  It saw the WAN IP address and the address assigned to the router by the gateway modem.  Nothing could be done to correct it.  It couldn't even get a software update via the USB port.The problem actually gave a first indication on day two, when the unit had to go through a short process to reestablish Internet service, but then it worked well.  On day three that hint of a problem became permanent.  So I returned the unit to Amazon.  The one good thing is how well  Amazon takes care of its customers, especially the Amazon Prime customers.Message to Sony:  Clean up your act or you'll go out of business.  If you moved manufacturing to China, I suggest that you bring it back to Japan, where &#34;total quality management&#34; was invented and hopefully still exists.Message to other consumers:  Avoid this like the plague.

The Accell UltraAV B142C-010B DisplayPort to DisplayPort 1.2 Cable with Latches (10 Feet / 3m) is my selection.

I first used an HDMI cable with the monitor as I had misplaced the DP cable, but have now installed it and the picture is really sharp and providing the full performance that this new display and high quality graphics card can generate.

$REVIEW.: I replaced an old NUVI 265W with this unit
I absolutely refused to pay the ridiculous price Garmin wanted to update the map data on my old device.This GPS is definitely much better than the old


It SHOULD be for the $299 price tag I paid (Now $199..

nice)

However, it is still not painless to use.The traffic information is virtually useless


The coverage is pathetic and the ads that make it "free" are terribly annoying.The ECO Route is nothing remarkable

Basically, as long as you don't speed and avoid roads that are stop-and-go, you are going to do fine.The large screen is nice and clear
But, the touch screen functionality is fair at best compared to other modern devices

If you use an iPhone, iPad, etc

it is painful to use by comparison (slow and lacking sensitivity).The menu structure is too complex and takes a LOT of navigation to get to the more refined search options and settings
The fact that you cannot return to the map at any point with one selection is unforgivable.Finally, as with every other NUVI I have used, searching for Points of Interest by NAME is absolutely awful
Seriously, it takes FOREVER
If I type in the name of a State Park or Recreation Area, it should come up with little or no delay

Unfortunately, that is not the case


So, it is best to always look up actual addresses online before entering locations into the GPS.I still think Garmin makes the best GPS units on the market

I just don't feel that they have kept pace with the improvements in user interface technology for mobile electronics.I'm also sour about paying $100 more for the unit less than 6 months ago.

$review_text.: I bought this battery to replace my gateway notebook battery that had been out for about a year. I had put off buying one because I had purchased an after-market one for another laptop and it didn't work. After reading the reviews I decided to try again and thought it would be an okay battery with about an hour of battery life. I must say I was pleasantly surprised after I charged and recharged it and had about 2 1/2 hours of battery life. I think that those people who did had dismal battery life probably did not follow the charging directions, which were pretty clear, or they just received a faulty one. I have had mine for over a month and I still get  at least 2 hours between each charge. That is pretty awesome for a $20 battery.

$REVIEW.: This item is great if you are on the go and need to charge multiple things. I usually get 7 full charges off of it charging just smartphones(iphone). I like that you don't need a switch to turn it on but rather just shaking it to activate it. I have had no issues with this charger and it looks great and it's too heavy. It is very convenient to have 3 USB outputs.The only down side is that it does take a while to charge back up but its 12000mAh so that is a give in. Also the provide mini USB cable to charge the unit is not long at all maybe 5 inches or so.

Over the past couple of years I have been replacing all batteries used in the household with them, and I find I pretty much never have to buy batteries anymore, while always having an ample supply at the ready. They DO hold a charge for years on end, I have tested that myself.

$REVIEW.: Wow, this is awesome. You really cannot beat this price. I've only use the black and white backdrops so far for my portraits, but both are in great shape and look very nice as a starter set. The only thing that set me back just a bit was having to steam out all the fold lines, but that's no big deal. The manufacturer, though, upgraded my order to include air compressed, thicker light stands than what comes here, so I can't say what the original item's durability/quality is like.I also had to buy more clamps as it only comes with 2.Overall: I got a lot better quality than expected, especially for the price.Pros: The quality of the entire productCons: Only 2 clamps. Crease lines. While on standby for the night, lower the light stands if you have a crazy ass cat that shoots across the room at night like I do. He gets close to knocking them over at full length.

$REVIEW.: I saw mostly good reviews and ordered it, hoping that poor reviews involved operator error. I followed the directions for installing the drivers on two machines - an ASUS notebook running Windows 7 (64 bit) and an HP notebook running Vista. I also went to the IOGEAR website and updated the drivers (from V1.0 to V1.1). The auto-switching worked perfectly, just as advertised. I had one glitch, which involved the notebook running Windows 7. Although the device would switch to this computer, the printer sent a printing error and wouldn't print from that machine. I went through the IOGEAR troubleshooting checklist to make sure I had done everything correctly (including making sure that the printer drivers were installed on both machines and the printer operated with a direct connection on both machines). When I still got the printing error message, I used the IOGEAR support website and wrote an email, sharing complete info on the hardware involved and the problem. Within two hours (or less) I got an response saying: "On the Windows 7 computer go to Devices and Printers, right click on the printer icon and Printer Properties (not just Properties) then go to the Ports tab. Under the list of all the printers look for a check box labeled Enable Bi-Directional Support, if that box can be uncheck do so then apply the change to see if that helps." That instantly fixed the problem. Now it switches automatically AND prints off both notebooks. LOVE IT!UPDATE: April 9thI've just changed my rating to four stars. Everything I said before is true, BUT...my scanner on my HPL7590 All-in-one has errors and won't work. I tried just uninstalling the GUB211, but unfortunately that didn't fix the problem. I had to completely uninstall my printer too, and reinstall. I want scanner capability more than I need the ability to switch between PCs, so I'll just do it the old fashioned way and swap the USB cable between PC's instead of using a switch.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this headset/mic for dictation with Dragon Naturally Speaking speech recognition software. For most of the past two years using this software I had Logitech headset with microphone. That headset was giving me considerable trouble for the past three months: it stopped working and required me to "restart" it by going into my control panel and selecting the device, etc. It is too early to tell whether the Plantronics is more accurate...I am still working through the "training" exercises in Dragon. But the sound quality through the ear pieces is very, very good in my ears anyway. These headphones were recommended on Dragon Naturally Speaking website. At this point, I am very pleased with them and the price was not prohibitive.

$review_text.: This is an amazing device.  I really like it.  Anker makes these in several different sizes (power ratings), so be sure to get the one that best suits your needs.  I have a &#34;basic&#34; cell phone and an iPod.  I can charge each one 2 times with this battery on a single charge.  I use it when I am camping for a weekend to make sure I have adequate cell charge out in the woods (roaming, etc drains the cellphone battery pretty fast).  It's also really nice for longer trips where I can charge the battery during the day and plug in my device(s) during the night.There is a USB port on the bottom and you can use any cord to plug in your device to USB on one end and the device on the other.  It also comes with a &#34;universal&#34; adapter cord which is USB on one end, and allows you to plug in 4 different adapters on the other end including iPod (not lightening, the older one), micro and mini usb and a round plug like a laptop would use.This one is a great combination of size and power.  Portable, not too heavy and charges what I need charged.
$SUMMARY.: Brilliant little device.

$REVIEW.: I've had 4 subwoofers before owning this one: Polk, Velodyne and Yamaha amongst them.I can write volumes on them - what I liked / didn't like / how long they lasted or didn't.The Klipsch Synergy Woofer Sub-12 is by far the very best.You really can NOT tell where the sound is coming from - but you feel and you KNOW is there/everywhere.I use this with Klipsch F-3 Synergy front speakers as part of a 10 speaker dedicated home theater setup and the combo is truly outstanding.Only knock on it is that it is HUGE - taller and bigger than most.And the design is different from others - but I didn't buy it to look at it, I bought it to hear it.Make sure you check out the dimensions.What I love about is that you forget it exists - it does NOT interfere when it shouldn't as the sound is extremely clear.You experience it rather than say "ahh there goes the subwoofer" -- it just blends in as needed seamlessly.Your chest feels it when an explosion goes off or a crash takes place but even then the sounds just seems to come from all around you instead of from the box in the room.With all the other subs I could always locate the sound.Easy to use too: I have set mine on auto on/off. After the initial experimentation / fooling around with different settings during the first week or so, I have NEVER touched it since.I've had it since June 2009.Couldn't be happier.

Unfortunately, my fully loaded case would not fit under the seat so I'd have to either put it on my lap or dreadfully check it.This 16" Solo case holds the same amount of stuff (tightly) and fits under the seat with ease.  It doesn't have wheels, but the case itself is light so carrying it via strap is not a problem.It looks great and is quite versatile.  Looks just fine dressed up in a suit and tie, or dressed down in flip-flops and cargo shorts.They also stock them in Staples if you wanted to go someplace and see it before you buy it online.

$REVIEW.: Speed of drive plugged into the Hub are the same as if plugged directly into the USB connector on my computer - so the Hub does not slow down the data transfer!!I got 70MB/sec consistent speed when transferring a 7GB iso file with a 5400rpm external HDD and a cheapo USB3 PCI-E card


That's about x3 speed increase from me using a USB 2 port for the same file.When I first got the Hub, I had some problems with it - Windows 7 x64 Ultimate was trying to install a driver for it every time the computer restarted


Some times the driver install would fail and the device would be unusable until the next restart.I guess AdvanCED saw my problem in my initial review and contacted me
Turned out the problem was very simple - the HUB itself is plug-and-play - it has no drivers

What was causing my problem was that the drivers for the USB3 add-on card I was using were not he latest ones


Once I installed the latest version, my problem disappeared
Windows plays well with the Hub at last.Thanks for sending me that email AdvanCED! :)

This is designed to be an adapter for devices that sit in a hot shoe or a 1/4 screw for cameras, flashes, tripod mounts etc.  It goes both ways as you can screw it on one end or hot shoe it on the other.Just be mindful that you are not attempting to place something in the hot shoe that requires a connection to your device as this is just a piece of metal / plastic and it won't transmit your device &#8230; obviously I hope by looking at it you would not try this&#8230; I was disappointed as photographer I let borrow one of these did exactly that&#8230;Anyways, Good Price decent quality as with any thing low price / cheap don't over tighten and be mindful of it and it will perform fine.

I  purchased a retail version of  Pinnacle Studio 17 ultimate on December the 4th 2013 rather than an upgrade from my Studio 16 Ultimate. I built a new computer and need to transfer the software to it and insure them that it was removed from the original computer. No way provided unless I pay them $19.95 for a one time support ticket. Most reliable companies allow at least 90 days support. This is your support for this product, for 14 days you have one support option after your purchase. You then can pay them $19.95 for a one time support ticket, or give them $29.95 for a one year support that allows you 3 support tickets. If you are a first time purchaser of video editing software, I would strongly suggest other software unless you can spend more for support than what the software cost.

$review_text.: This camera produces sharp photos with good contrast and color rendition


The photos are very detailed and exhibit near DSLR quality in good conditions
It's great and will blow cheaper point and shoots away


 The flash is surprisingly POWERFUL and is still very bright when tilted up to bounce off a ceiling


Autofocus is very fast


However, a DSLR is still easily better
Subject isolation (aka bokeh or blurred background) is poor with this 1 inch sensor and lens


 If you are taking a photo of a subject, poor subject isolation means the background cannot be very well isolated from your subject, giving your photos the 'point and shoot' look of small cameras
 Beautiful bokeh is the trademark of larger sensored cameras that no smaller sensored camera like the RX100 can match

 The effect is even more pronounced with a cheap prime lens on a DSLR


Shooting in RAW format, this sensor also gives you about 1/2 to 1 stop of dynamic range
This is ok for minor shadow or highlight recovery, but a DSLR like the Nikon D5100 gives you about 2 stops of dynamic range

The Nikon will easily recover seemingly unrecoverable blown highlights and shadow detail
This ability can make a big difference to your photos in subpar lighting conditions


If you are serious about producing truly beautiful photos, this is not really what you would use
Let's just say the RX100 produces awesome 'point and shoot'-like photos.If you don't like carrying around a heavy DSLR, then a m43 camera from Panasonic or Olympus is a good compromise
The SONY NEX line is a good alternative as well

The only small point and shoot that can match DSLR quality is the Panasonic GM1 with it's larger m43 sensor
However, that is an interchangeable lens system and not truly pocketable.

Play with the buttons while using your iPod - most functions are undocumented.  The "6" button is Pause/Play; a few other numbered buttons skip Playlists backwards/forwards (the Playlist, not the songs in the Playlist); use the seek forward/backward buttons to skip forward/back tracks in the current playlist; hold down the seek buttons for fast-forward/rewind the current track.

$REVIEW.: Ordered the Logitech G51 Surround Sound Speakers from Amazon (could NOT find a cheaper price on the web)for my son.  These speakers (designed for a PC, but can be used to hookup a gaming system - be sure to buy an adapter from Amazon) are simply outstanding for the price.  They sound great and the bass is simply awesome - you will not be able to fully crank up the bass without pissing off your neigbors upstairs.  As other people mentioned in their reviews the length of speaker wires are OK for the typical hookup for a PC, however, if you want to expand the "surround" sound experience beyond around 4 ft to the front and 6 feet to the rear speakers be prepared to purchase some speaker wire extension with RCA plugs ( I believe other people purchased them here from Amazon - which should be a whole lot cheaper than running down to your local Radio Shack).Bottom Line:  Check these out - the Logitech G51 is definitely worth consideration.  Great Bang for the Buck speakers that will work with PC's, Gaming System and portable MP3 Players.Additional things to buy:  Extension speaker wires (with RCA plugs); an Adapter which allows a gaming system to be connected.

$REVIEW.: This is what I originally had written:I bought this lens after taking the time to compare - and use at home - the Tamron 11-18mm f/4.5-5.6 lens for my Nikon. Very noticable difference between the two. I also compared it with the Tokina 12-24mm.  Again, the Sigma was more compelling to me. It's got a sturdier feel to it and it performs better. Most impressive? The "HSM" or "Hyper-sonic Motor." It's incredibly fast and quiet. You don't hear the a motor grinding its way into focus as you do with other lenses (you know who you are!).  Absolutely quiet.  And take a peak at the glass.  It's beautiful.  I haven't had a problem with ghosting at all.  And, I've taken some breathtakingly sharp shots with this lens.  Distortion?  Yes, at the extremes.  But, it's almost to be expected from a lens just a step away from being a fisheye lens.  I consider distortion from this lens as a non-issue. I'd gladly take that in exchange for everything else this lens brings to the table. My expectations have gone up after using this lens. In fact, I was impressed enough to purchase another Sigma: the 30mm F1.4 EX DC HSM.  Another great lens!Here's my update:This lens developed focusing issues a while back.  I'd describe the issues as an inability to lock in on an object and stay locked in.  The auto-focus mechanism, which has always been very quiet, quick and accurate, now seems to bounce around from near to far searching for a focus point before actually finding one.  This causes a delay in getting the shot - and the delay can range from a second to entirely preventing the shot from being taken (during that particular attempted shutter actuation). Even when the lens is directed towards a specific object - with sharp lines - it's as if the lens is being used at night and there is nothing to focus on.  Under those circumstances, the internal focus ring will quickly swing back and forth and then, having found nothing, will stop (as if to prompt the use to try another target.  The warranty has expired (not a 5 year warranty like Nikon) so if I want to fix it, I'll have to foot the bill myself.(I ended up buying the Tokina 16-24mm - very, very nice lens).I'm even more disturbed by this "quirk" because I've got two other Sigma lens which have had their own issues as well!  Am I incredibly unlucky?I've got a Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 DG HSM II Macro Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.  Out of nowhere, the auto-focus on the lens completely failed - on my D300 as well as my D90. Couldn't have happened at a worse time for me.  But, fortunately, the lens was still under warranty and I got it fixed.  I haven't had any issues with it since (it's an otherwise very solid piece of equipment - and $1,000 less than the Nikon VR equivalentNext, I've got a Sigma EX Lens - 30 mm F/1.4 for Nikon DSLRs.  This aperture mechanism on lens has malfunctioned.  If I try to stop the lens all the way down to f22, the pictures end up being blown out - the complete opposite of what one would expect.  There's no function whatsoever for all f-stops between f11 and f22.  Of course, I bought the lens for it's use wide open - and it still works fine at 1.4.  But, the warranty has expired and, again, I'll have to foot the bill if I want it fixed.(I bought a Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens to replace it.  Not as fast but it's got a 5 year warranty!)

$REVIEW.: Okay, here is the real review after I dunned Adorama for sending me a glass bottle in a plastic bag. The replacement came from Mel Pierce Camera in Los Angeles and was properly packed in a box.This cleaner is a combination of isopropyl alcohol and modern dry cleaning fluid. You definitely need ventilation to work with it and keep it off your skin! I throw away the used cleaning pads in another room to keep the fumes down. But I still feel a bit lightheaded after cleaning a 50-foot reel.It works fine to remove ordinary grime. It also takes off the yellow processing residue sometimes found on Kodachrome. (At least I hope it's residue, as someone once claimed, and not dye!) But it won't remove really nasty gunk, like 60-year-old splicing glue. For that you need expert conservation.

$REVIEW.: I initially thought that the incessant flickering on my screen with Win7 was due to a failing Nvidia 512mb graphic card. So I bought this card to replace my Nvidia card. Installation was quite easy and was accomplished without any hitches.Card works like a charm although I did note that my Win Aero performance index fell by about 0.5 points all due to what it perceives is a less competent card. Since almost all of my work involves only business graphics and some photo editing high speed graphics is of almost no importance. I am very pleased with the purchase especially given the price.Turns out my graphics problem was not due to graphics card failure since even after installation of the Radeon card the flickering still persisted. Some serious research on the Internet revealed that a utility I was using to clean my registry and improve computer performance set some video parameters way to much on the high side and fouled up my video operation. Used a suggested fix to my registry and the problem disappeared.There are literally  hundreds of forum articles dealing with the flickering problems and I bet many of them are due to well intentioned but poorly executed registry fixes by these so called  performance utilities. Be forewarned.Bottom line is the Radeon card works as promised and is a great price for a 1 Gig video card.

$REVIEW.: I am very happy with this CPU on an ASUS P9x79 Pro, like Michael. I also have 32 GB Kingston Quad channel memory, a Gigabyte GTX 670-OC-2GB VRAM video card, all SSD drives, and I do not overclock...actually run the BIOS on the power saving mode, and it does all the 3D work and complex filter renderings in Photoshop and its plug-ins with ease at that setting, so I have not even gone to the "Normal" setting.  Fans run  slowly and virtually silently at this setting and with a Coolermaster TPC 812 heatsink, the temperature of the 3930 runs between 33 and 36 degrees celtsius. This installation in a Corsair 550D, constructed by the manufacturer with quiet first and foremost in mind, is almost inaudible, and surely does not disappoint in that regard!To my surprise though, and this has also been reported by others in forums on line, the Windows 7/64 loading time is actually a few seconds LONGER(from the "loading windows" logo to Log-on) than with two other quality computers I have (a x58(1366) with a 960 processor, and a LG 1155 with a 2600 CPU); this, with reasonably comparable hardware,Startup menu settings in MSCONFIG and software. Just out of interest, I removed the NVIDIA driver, and it had no effect on boot time.  From discussions on other forums, this is felt to be a property of the x79 motherboards and the way that format governs various driver loadings, but I don't have a definitive explanation.  People were saying that it is not related to the ASUS line per se, but I have not used the Intel x79 MB to see if there be a difference.  I would be interested to know what other people contributing on this thread might have to say about this, if they have roughly comparable systems on which to comment, in this regard.Really though, this is unequivocally inconsequential, merely academic, and most certainly does not reflect on the alacrity and efficiency with which this processor functions, once the system is booted, and this applies to my entire installation, as a whole, which is truly exemplary.Being a non-gamer, I'm afraid my review, by definition, has to be viewed as somewhat limited for what certain prospective customers may want to know, particularly with a CPU of these specifications and potentials. I elected this CPU over my original choice, the 3820, because, in consultation with Adobe technicians, Photoshop CS6 can now take advantage of hexcore in 3D and complex filtration algorithms. That was not the case in CS5 when they advised me not to buy the 990X, in the Bloomfield series, when I bought my previous computer which was prebuilt and is really not outdated, even today, in terms of performance. In view of this CPU's superb function in stock configuration, I see absolutely no reason to overclock and overstress my components for little or no practical benefit, as I am in no way interested in bragging rights over pushing the limits with respect to benchmark data.BOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: My last CDRW Burner lasted over six years before it died out. As such, when I saw that Lite-On apparently still manufactures CDRWs yet alone DVD burners, this purchase was a no brainer.  The name itself spells quality at a bargain price.  Turns to find out that when my burning software identified the drive manufacturer, turns out that it was a blessing in disguise.  Lite-On may have been the brand name, but the software identified the manufacturer as Phillips.  No need to explain who they are.  If you have been building computers as long as I have, you know that Phillips is the original developer of the CD.  Talk about getting quality.  I have never liked the included software, Nero 9 that comes with the bundle since I have had serious install issues.  For my purposes of just creating DVDs from camcorders, digital cameras etc. I found that two freebies, DVD Flick and Imgburn are two of the best I have come across in my long search. These are basically small programs which get the job done with little or no overhead from bloated software.  Otherwise, exceptional quality in a DVD burner.  I am tempted to order two more units to replace my aging and outdated CDRW's.

$review_text.: I upgraded to this camera last year as I wanted to start recording everything I could in HD.  This was a great value for all of the features that one could enjoy.  One of my biggest concerns was low light performance.  Once I understood how the Iris control worked I was highly impressed with how well the HDC-TM700 operated since I shoot a lot of indoor stuff.  I also love the time lapse feature.  This provides a lot of great fun for everyday events that you have the opportunity to shoot a lot of footage on.  I do use the camera feature and love the fact that you can shoot a picture while taking a video and the video is uninterrupted. The problem with this is that the quality is hit or miss.  Most of the time I have this camera on a mono-pod or tripod and use an SLR for my images.  I do recommend getting an extra battery. The battery it comes with does not give you much time.

$review_text.: This deck is an amazing value: Great sound, great looks, relatively easy operation, and Bluetooth built in (with microphone and Bluetooth receiver), and a remote. Installation is easy and instructions are very good, but you do need to allow for a lot of wires in back, due to the rear USB port and the microphone plug. The choice of a zillion colors in the display is kinda cool; you can match to your car's interior. Preset equalizer settings are good, and you can design your own with a high degree of specificity. Radio reception is excellent. Overall, this is a very, very, VERY impressive receiver, very solid; the bang-for-the-buck is unbeatable at a purchase price under $90. I'm 100% delighted.However, for those people who are looking for nit-picky negatives, here are a couple: 1) This deck does not have a removable faceplate. For me, that's a *plus*, because it's installed in a soft-top Jeep, and I prefer the more permanent installation. 2) It does not play CDs. Again, for me that's a *plus*, especially in a Jeep; fewer moving parts and openings on the front panel is a good thing. (Besides, I haven't used CDs for years.) 3) There's a square, animated graphic in the upper-right corner of the display that is meaningless; as far as I can figure, some JVC designer thought it would look cool. I think it's dumb, and just clutters up an otherwise clean, easy-to-read display.

$REVIEW.: This device on first glance looked too good to be true, a small almost keychain-sized gadget enabling easy transfer from VHS to computer harddrive in DVD format for burning to DVD. But it works, and it's real easy.The only comparable thing I'm aware of is the ION VHS-DVD machine, which requires also a CD installed and computer connection to the VHS machine they provide, so that this here is certainly a much cheaper alternative than the ION machine.However, it is not so straightforward to operate.  I needed help.The information booklet contains 12 pages, that basically guide you step by step on how to INSTALL the softward from the provided CD, but NOTHING MORE!!I should think, that if one's computer skills are so limited that one requires a step by step instruction in order just to install the CD, that one would also require further step by step guides in order to actually achieve the process of VHS to DVD transfer in the computer. But oh no, nothing as useful as that is provided in the accompanying booklet, which is a serious flaw.However, to the rescue is a Helpline.  A potential problem for just about everyone else, is that this is not a 1-800 number, but an 818 area code number---which just happens to be in my neighborhood!! What luck!  But for everyone else, this could add up to some serious long distance telephone charges.I had to wait about 25 minutes, but the very helpful man guided me through the simple procedure, which essentially entailed my uninstalling the CD and reinstalling it, and then using the EZ Grabber in order to view and then record the VHS tape onto the computer.There is no way to directly record from the VHS to burn a DVD; you have to store it in a file on the hard drive and then burn it from there using your own DVD burning software.So overall a nifty gadget.  If only the information provided was more useful in helping one operate the apparatus.

$REVIEW.: I LOVE THIS PROJECTOR (review below but first my BULB experience) AN UPDATE AFTER 2 YRS 8 MONTHS NOW:The projector has had zero problems - it's now 2 yrs 8 months. But I am very disappointed about my bulb experience:  It states 4000 hours.  Don't believe it - I've scoured the globe trying to find anyone who has had one last even 2000 hours and so far I cannot. OK I do run it almost all the time on DYNAMIC picture mode and NORMAL (not ECOnomy) which nearly DOUBLES the brightness but that's how I like it, and the MANUAL says you still get 4000 hours at the high output mode.  The 4000 hours might be what you get if you turn on the projector and let it run continuously (Epson lab test results are probably accurate) without ever turning it off, letting it cool down, and turning it back on 24 hours later.  I bought this projector new Jan 2010.  Just 9 months later Sept 2010 I had only 730 hrs and the bulb blew out. I was down a week, even though ready to spend $300 for the OEM bulb, even Epson direct was temporarily out of them.  A week later I placed the order from Epson for my second bulb for the projector (1st replacement) and I got it in 2 days.  Of course the bulb blew during a final season football game so later, when Epson sent me an email for 10% off, I bought a genuine spare bulb at $270 direct from Epson in Jan 2011 (one year from purchasing the projector).  So I bought the projector ($1599 from Best Buy Jan 2010), first replacement bulb 9 months later for $300, then a spare bulb for $270 on the 1 year anniversary of the projector purchase.  I hoped I would get at least 2000 hours (half) of the bulb life and would still have my spare, so I wondered if (maybe) I would be ready to upgrade my projector in 3-4 years and still have a bulb left?  Last week, the second bulb (first replacement) died.  Of course this one died AS WE WERE WATCHING THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE LONDON OLYMPICS!!! It didn't appear the bulb blew; the projector just suddenly shut off - never did that before.  The next day I turned the projector on, it came right on and was fine and bright, but 2 mins later it shut off again.  Now I figured I had some problem with the projector itself.  I figured it must be overheating, so took out the high density dust filter, and even though it was very clean ( I could still see through the filter holding it up to the light), blew it out with my garage compressor air hose anyway, confirmed all looked OK, put it back together.  Now when turning on the projector, it would make a funny buzzing noise for 5 seconds, then shut back off without ever lighting up.  I was about to call tech support when I remembered I had my spare bulb.  I put it in, and immediately all was fine now.  I put back the old bulb to confirm - same symptom, and the "lamp" light was blinking orange as it would keep shutting off and never coming up, so that confirmed the bulb was no good and that was the problem of it not staying running.  First, good thing I had the spare bulb, because I might have sent it back for service, even though it's now 2 yrs 8 months and no longer in warrantee.  If I didn't have a spare, I would have called tech support, and I am sure they would NOT have been able to confirm whether I needed to PAY to send it in for service or just try to buy a new $300 bulb, so I am very glad I had the spare.  I am GLAD that it was "only" the bulb - It appears the bulb blew in such a way that is shorted out the filament, and now draws too much power to stay running, so that's how this bulb blew - closed the circuit instead of blew open.  OK so I put my replacement bulb back in and all is good now, but I checked the HOURS - I installed that one Sept 2010, and the projector had only 510 hours on this second bulb!!!Let me RECAP - because I think this is typical, not the exception:- - ALL ORIGINAL OEM bulbs direct from EPSON- - Jan 2010 $1599 for the unit new retail in box.  Bulb that came with unit lasted 9 months - 730 hours.- - Sept 2010 when the bulb blew 9 months after purchase, I was down 2 weeks, paid $300 for a new OEM bulb from Epson direct. It lasted 1 yr 11 months, but I only racked up 510 hours on this bulb.- - (bought a spare bulb for $270 direct from Epson during a sale so I would have one extra - better to buy have a spare purchased on sale then to be down for weeks and pay full price when it dies)- - July 2012 put in my $270 second replacement (the projector's 3rd bulb and the second I bought). We'll see how long this one lasts.- - TOTAL HOURS GOTTEN OUT OF FIRST 2 BULBS: 1241 HOURS!  Just installed the 3rd bulbSo now I am shopping for spare bulbs.  Money is differnet for everyone.  For me forking over $300 is very tough, but $100 is possible proactively.  I am SERIOUSLY considering buying either just the bulb itself (no housing) or a discount (plenty of aftermarket bulbs for under $100).  At this point if I can get 500-750 hours out of a bulb that seems to be the norm.  The MORE hours you run your projector per day/use period before shutting if OFF, the longer the bulb will last.  I understand this as FACT now.  The first bulb lasted 730 hours and ran through those 730 hours in 9 months.  Then we only turned the projector on when renting a movie, figured we might get MORE hours out of it, we got almost 2 years (1 yr ll months) but only racked up 510 hours.  Please keep this in mind about bulbs in general, at least from Epson and several sites I have researched about Epson bulb life reflecting similar numbers.  Just be prepared that you don't buy this projector and forget it.  Be prepared to buy bulbs when you least expect it (football playoffs, Olympics), as part of your projector experience, and you'll be more sane and better off for being ready for your moments of darkness!- - - NOW FOR MY REVIEW I WROTE AFTER HAVING THE PROJECTOR 6 MONTHS - WHICH I STILL LOVE TODAY AND AM NOT THINKING OF UPGRADING FOR YEARS TO COME - - -I bought the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 8100 after visiting a friend of a friend, who had an older Epson HD projector set up, and it blew me away.  I had thought of getting a projector in years past, but never did due to what I thought was very expensive to own (lamp $$ and replacments), initial purchase, and screen purchase.  I found that the bulb is rated at 4000 hours, that's like 3 years at 4 hours of watching the projector every nite! I bought the projector, and was BLOWN AWAY to see the picture in HD on my regular painted light brown wall with no screen yet.  The picture was so bright, so clear, I was not going to pay $750 for a 120 inch permanent screen like my friend of a friend did.  I did a test to hold a sheet on the wall and project half on the sheet and half on the wall - to my surprise, the colors (skin tones too) were perfect whether on the brown wall or white sheet, and perfectly acceptable to my surprise.  I later found a Da-Lite screen for $99 (72INX96IN Model B Manual Pull Down Screen Matte White by Da-Lite) on Amazon free shipping no tax to my door, which adds about 20% brightness and a little more contrast to finish off the purchase.  I use the projector with HDMI HD cable box out for TV, HDMI blu ray player, Component for HD xbox 360 (yes xbox is HD 1080 even using component cables), and use the VGA input with a PC and a 50 foot VGA cable to a VGA repeater, so my home PC in the other room can show on the projector if I want it to.  Projector is awesome and I recommend it highly.  Aside from no one being disappointed with this picture quality, the next biggest feature is the "throw" of the lens.  Meaning, most people can't put the projector in the middle of the room on a stand in the way of your furniture.  They usually ceiling mount it.  If you have high ceilings like I do (8 feet) and want the projector as much out of the way as I do (almost touching the ceiling) rather than have to aim the projector on an angle towards the middle of your wall, the lens has an adjustment to drop the entire rectangular image DOWN very low and sizable left or right of the projectors face.  This means it will install in more places than many other projectors.  I just hope the lamp life will live up to expectations, and not die out or considerably dim to half at half life, etc.  I can't find anyone who has yet changed their bulb once or twice to comment if it stays relatively bright until it dies or dims a little every 1000 hours, we'll see - but you CANNOT be dissapointed by this projector AT THIS PRICE.  If you have another grand, that's different, but for around $1500 this one is the one.  Couple that with 90 day advance replacement warranty from Epson, and 2 years parts and labor from Epson direct (projector comes with your own PIN for fast tech support) you will love this one!

$REVIEW.: Impressive little device, especially after the latest firmware upgrade. The user interface is quite nice, the unit is responsive and runs the majority of Android apps flawlessly.The Good:- Smooth, HD video playback from usb, YouTube and Netflix (you need the 1.8.1 version just google netflix 1.8.1 apk)- Responsive, flash capable browser with tabs- Emulators run great for playing old Nintendo games up to N64- Comes rooted- Supports Google PlayThe Bad:- Flimsy plastic housing, reset button doesn't line up with the button on the pcb (had to open the case to flash update)- No screen saver or timeout- No power button- Only 720p (unit can output upconverted 1080p, but the desktop and video playback are always 1280x720). This may be fixed with a firmware upgradeThe Advice:- Upgrade your firmware- Google extsd fix- Download Hidebar.apk from GithubRefardless of the minor issues with this device, at less than $50 it is a steal and turns my TV in the smartest TV so far.Little update: The wifi in this thing sucks and seems to be a major heat contributor. I switched to a usb ethernet adapter and the device now happily streams 1080p h264 content from my file storage. Netflix still works fine (1.8.1 version), but appears limited to 480p. Also, XBMC is probably never gonna support the Allwinner A10, so if you're looking at XBMC better get an amlogic-m3 device.
$SUMMARY.: My TV is smarter than yours

$REVIEW.: Since putting this to use in August, I have played about 25 rounds on my home courses (one club with two courses in separate towns). What I have found remarkable is that I now integrate distance readings seamlessly into my routine setup, just glancing at my "watch" without the device causing any distraction. My prior GPS was a good handheld but innately awkward because I had to take it out of my pocket etc. etc.  I now play faster and more confidently. On this low-end Garmin, I find I don't miss any of the intermediate distance features of my prior golf GPS. Why? Partly because I'm playing familiar courses and don't flirt with sand traps or water. For layups, I just subtract 100 yards from the distance to the front, center, or back of the green. In this specific device, I have found that "less is more." Golf is complicated, and quickly measuring distance gives me more time to think--the real key to better golf. I am absolutely enchanted with this "watch." In team golf, by the way, it's extreme convenience makes supplying distance requests from team mates effortless and, therefore, less distracting.
$SUMMARY.: I have associates who bought it first, and I bought on their verbal evaluations.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't expecting much from this iLive Horizontal Bluetooth Sound Bar, so when I unboxed it and set it up via traditional audio cables (red and white - included with the speaker) to my Mom'sTCL LE24FHDD20 24-Inch 1080p LED HDTV (2011 Model)I was floored by how much of a positive difference it made in the volume and quality of the audio output on this TV.  NOTE: I have aLG Electronics LAP340 SoundPlate Slim 4.1 Surround Sound Speaker System with Built-In Sub Woofer and Bluetoothwhich is what I am used to hearing.  While the iLive lacks the depth provided by a subwoofer and additional speaker surround sound, for the price you pay (about an eighth of what the LG costs), you get a great product which adds enjoyment and functionality to your system.Once the sound bar was installed and turned on, sports events and music videos came alive!  Speech as in TV dramas, was easier to filter out from background noises on shows too. I would expect it would also sound great when used with gaming systems, but the lack of heavy bass provided by a subwoofer would be lacking.I had expected to use an audio optical connection, but learned that the TV didn't have one, so I had to use the older connection.  I thought it would have a negative affect on the sound quality, but I didn't notice a thing.The sound bar ships with mounting screws and directions for mounting it to the wall.  I placed the one I purchased in front of the HDTV and elevated the TV about 4", which was perfect.  The sound bar is very lightweight and has both a remote (very small) and manual input buttons (facing the speaker they are on the right side on the edge).  A light on the upper right front of the speaker indicates what mode it's in.  Those lights are explained in the included directions.A Quick Start Guide and directions are included.  The set-up is easy once you figure out how you'll be establishing a connection.  The included audio cord is only about 2.5' long, and no optical cord is included.  An AC power source attaches to the sound bar, as does the audio cable.  Power it up via the remote or manually on the side of the unit.This sound bar will also play audio via Bluetooth when it's in Bluetooth mode.  Pair it with your iPad, iPhone, Kindle or similar device and enjoy music from your device in any room where the sound bar is powered up and in Bluetooth mode.I purchased this locally for under forty, and at that price, I'm thrilled with it!  I think if it was priced around fifty, it's still a great deal.Perfect for small rooms like an office, bedroom or dorm room, this iLive Horizontal Bluetooth Sound Bar offers great sound quality.  It's not complicated to set-up and use, it's lightweight and fairly compact, and its price will not break your budget.  The perk of being able to stream music from various devices via Bluetooth to play through the speakers is just the icing on the cake.I highly recommend it!

$REVIEW.: I purchased this lens to satisify my need for a macro lens
 I was on the cusp of buying the Sony 30mm macro, but jumped on this one the moment I found it

 It's a fantastic lens and hasn't been off my camera in a week

 The images I captured are amazing


 Great light, great DOF, very sharp.I own several Sigma lenses that I use with my Sony Alpha 300; I haven't been disappointed in any of them


 The cost is always $100 less than the Sony equivalent, which is always a good thing.The only negative is that AF is impossible with this lens, but I prefer the control of MF so it's not that big of a deal.Enjoy!

She also loves fidgeting with dials, buttons and pull up attachments (i.e. the antenna). Therefore the primary objective was to find something she could use, enjoy and if it got mishandled and broken wouldn't be any great loss.So far it has handled these minimal requirements perfectly.Just remember it has a single speaker (mono) output so it won't match a stereo "boombox" for sound quality....but it sounds good for what it is. We've had no problem with radio reception.

$REVIEW.: For the past 4 years I've been using a Logitech G7 wireless rechargeable mouse. Before that I always used a Logitech or Microsoft mouse. The G7 is seemingly discontinued, and let me say that this is a major catastrophe. Why? Because I can't seem to find a model that even remotely duplicates its quality, functionality and comfort. I've scoured the net hoping to find a wireless rechargeable mouse that has a nice smooth scrolling wheel, that has decent programmable button features, and all I came up with was the G700 - which is way too complex for my needs, and the Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac.The MX turned out to be such a disappointment. First of all, this thing feels super cheap and light as a feather. I'm willing to adapt to something new, but this mouse feels very fragile.The scrolling wheel was defective as it wobbled back and forth creating a terrible, inconsistent, squeaking click. Even if it was assembled properly it doesn't even compare to the G7.I'm concerned about the battery life on this thing, as I'm sure with my usage it will only provide a mere 30%-40% battery life of which Logitech claims is possible. Although the G7 was a pain with the constant battery swap, I wish there was a similar updated model available. The G700 is just overkill for my needs, but I may end up checking it out.So how is it that 4 years later they haven't really advanced the battery technology with wireless mice?I would think that there's some room for competition in the wireless mouse business.

I really like the small, compact, size of this device

 Even with the small size, this pack still charges my iPhone 5 well over two times - that's the main purpose, so you can't complain


 It's the most portable New Trent device that I own
 The on/off power button seems to stick a bit when you try to power the device on

 It will usually turn on the second attempt

 Would it be possible to improve this switch to allow it to slide back and forth?  I would rate this device a 4.5 out of 5, and the only complain being the power button
 This provides an excellent amount of power for $40.

$review_text.: I have tried two of these and both of them have the same issue: the left click button intermittently doesn't work. The mouse instantly cured my wrist/forearm pain so for that I would give it 5 stars. But the left click seems to be a manufacturing defect because I experienced it in both of them that I ordered. I'm been putting up with it for a few weeks now, but I'm started to get annoyed at it. Unfortunately when I contact the manufacturer, my emails go unanswered. I sure hope they fix this problem and give me a replacement. Otherwise I'm afraid the annoyance is getting to be too much and I'll need to find a different brand.

$review_text.: Yes, it's got Bluetooth phone and streaming.  Yes, it's got HD radio. Yes, it's got USB front input.  And, yes, it's got everything else a head unit should.  The problem(s) lie in the execution of it all.  The Bluetooth has horrible fidelity and doesn't respond well to the commands given. Re-pairing takes a long time.  The HD radio is without a doubt the slowest signal capture I have EVER seen; maybe 5 to 10 seconds on every capture. So, if you lose signal strength for a millisecond, the unit has to recapture the signal and may take up to 10 seconds to respond.  The USB doesn't always respond to the device inserted.  I tried a USB cable to a device and a USB-SDMicro adapter and both would fail to read 8 times out of ten.  Reinserting the cable/device multiple times would finally cause the unit to read.  Then it took 20-40 seconds to read a 4GB device and 3-10 MINUTES to read a 16GB device.  Absolutely untenable.DUAL makes the unit to sell and it does. The price point makes it worth a look compared to other devices with the same functionality that cost $300+.  But when the device functions so poorly, where's the value?So, back it went and I got a JVC JVC KD-AHD79 CD Receiver with no Bluetooth for $169.  3 seconds to read the 16GB device. 1-2 seconds to capture HD radio.  That's what I'm talkin' about!Beware.

$review_text.: I bought this to be able to use my older iPod Nano and iPod Classic with a Logitech UE Mobile Boombox. I was happy to open the box and find that the dimensions are actually 1.65 x 1.25 by .33 inches, not the 5.1 x 4.4 x 0.9 inches in the product description and that it appeared to be a solid, well-made product. Sadly, it does not use the standard micro-USB port for charging, but rather a 2mm round charging port requiring that you carry the included charging wire when you travel.It paired pretty easily. I don't know if my particular product is defective, but after a few seconds to a minute, the sound starts breaking up. I have tried it with a few different sound sources and the result is always the same.Also, sometimes it pairs immediately, sometimes you have to try a few times. It says in the poorly-written manual that it will pair automatically to the same device next time which it never does.

$REVIEW.: My main e-reader is my Kindle 2.  I bought the Sony Pocket Reader because the two libraries I belong to have a wonderful selection of Adobe Digital Edition ePUB and PDF books available to borrow and I can't access them with my Kindle. Once the reader is registered with your Adobe ID, it's a cinch to load borrowed e-books from the library and there's a little tag next to the book title to remind you of how many remaining days you have to read the book. The Sony Reader Library Mac/PC application even lets me return books early, so I usually check books out for the maximum period, just in case, and then I return them early.The PRS300's screen contrast is much superior to my Kindle 2**, and even a little better than my Kindle 1, which is still in use.  Because the contrast is so crisp, I can comfortably read on the Sony with a smaller font than I use on the Kindle, which is good, since the screen is smaller.Finding a good PDF reflow font size is iffy (ePUB is perfectly fine). There are three sizes of text - Small, Medium, and Large. With PDF, S is the original text size and usually isn't readable on 5" screen. M and L reflow the text, but font sizes differ between horizontal and vertical rotation. So, really there are 5 text sizes. When reading a PDF, the font choices are often:1. Too darn small2. Almost big enough3. A bit too large4. Huge5. Bigger than the "E" at the top of the eye-chartHorizontal is a more comfortable holding position (and the only way I can operate the reader one-handed with my small hands/short thumbs), but the font size isn't always good, so I have to go back to vertical.  Also, in horizontal mode, PDFs will often have repeating lines between pages (bottom of one page, top of the next). This always breaks my reading rhythm, and why I always try to get an ePUB version instead of PDF, if it's available.This reader is very basic; it has no whizz-bang features. You can read, you can bookmark, you can change orientation and font size, you can jump to a specific page number, you can delete a book or just its bookmarks.  That's pretty much it.Though it doesn't come with a wall charger, it does come with a decent foam-padded slip case, which was a nice surprise. In fact, I wouldn't have ordered a case, if I'd seen the included one first (with minor modifications to stiffen the front for screen protection and prevent the reader from sliding out of the top, the slip case would be perfect).Overall, I like the Sony Pocket Edition, despite its limitations.  I wish it had search, dictionary look-up, and highlighting, but I can live without them in my secondary reader.  It's has the feel of high-quality construction, and the screen clarity is amazing.**Update: My Kindle 2 had a little glitch and customer service sent me new one.  The replacement Kindle's screen is MUCH more clear than the Kindle I was using at the time of this review.  Now, I'd say the contrast between the two devices is nearly equal.

$REVIEW.: - Great Speed and Usability Improvements.- Missing Features and many new Compatibility Issues.- Touch screen often does not respond (seems to be humidity related)The tablet itself is speedy and the capacitive multi-touch screen worked wonderfully at first.  Picture viewing has improved by orders of magnitude, and all the basic apps packaged with the tablet have significant feature upgrades.  My biggest complaint is that many of the file management features seem to have been eliminated or replaced with more automated processes. (e.g. the media player automatically scans your SD memory card and finds all media files)  This seems at first to be an advancement, but it takes away the users ability to navigate to specific folders.  The collection of all media is lumped together, making the process of viewing specific files more tedious, especially when a significant number of files are present.My biggest complaint about the physical product is the plastic edge feels cheap, it is wide with a sharp edge that rests on your hand while holding the tablet.  It is so sharp that it will cut your skin if you stroke your hand along it.  Perhaps it was a quality control issue, since the hard edge can easily be filed down.Android 4.0 is a welcome upgrade.  Loads of new features and significant usability improvements.  Too bad the system crashes so often.  Media that played on the prior Kyros tablets just won't play on the MID7042.  Some will launch, but almost all inadvertently stall at some point.  Many formats will not play at all.  Plugging the same SD card in the previous versions of the Kyros didn't exhibit the same problems.  All launched and played flawlessly.  The same goes for Android applications purchased through the Amazon Appstore for Android.  Many apps will no longer launch or if they run they run poorly.  Undoubtedly most of these issues can be attributed to the the new Android operating system, but it isn't clear what problems could be attributed to the new Coby platform.  Thankfully the OS on this tablet is upgradable, so hopefully the performance issues will be solved in future upgrades.  Also, app developers are due to release new versions of their software that should solve compatibility issues with Android 4.0.  I look forward to seeing these software improvements.New Problems: (reduced rating to 2 stars)-----------------------------------------Tablet crashes constantly if too many apps are open, downloading large files or after installing several apps in a row.The size of the tablet is a bit odd and none of the 7' tablet cases work with this model.  I basically had to buy one and cut it in order to get my tablet to fit. I still doesn't look quite right.I found that in humid environments the touch screen does not work properly, it becomes less touch sensitive and just a chore to use since it is constantly interpreting a touch for a double tap and when I drag across the screen it stops the dragging motion in mid path, making some applications unusable.  I wish I purchased a different brand.  It just isn't worth the cost savings.

$REVIEW.: The Nexus 7 is a tablet with a lot of things going for it on the surface


It is so thin and lightweight that it feels like it came out of a science fiction film


The screen is gorgeous and very clear

The navigation is easy and smart

I tried an Android HTC smartphone before, so I knew the available apps and possibilities would be fantastic

There's one problem


This is a very shoddy product destined to break


This tablet will break and disappoint you


I cannot recommend AVOIDING this tablet enough
It is a shame that Google and ASUS could put out such a terrible product.Why is this a tablet to avoid? It has several significant, widespread flaws that make this tablet very frustrating to use and useless when it comes to viewing media (your e-books, videos, music, podcasts, etc.)


First off, this device will not be recognized by your computer
If it is, your computer will shortly be unable to as that is what happened to me
On the second time I attempted to import data to my tablet, this stupid device failed


It could not do the simplest of task needed in a tablet/smartphone/MP3 player
This was extremely important to me as the main appeal of a tablet to myself was the ability to watch videos on a screen larger than the iPod classic


This piece of trash did not last a day! The Nexus 7 is one step above the piece of cardboard with a picture of an iPad plastered across it.For the other users who want the advertised bells and whistles of the tablet, you're in for disappointment as well

The GPS will not work in any practical situations
Take it outside and it will freeze or slow down


I do not drive, so I only tried it once during a walk and it did not work

This device has a cheap, oddly shaped microplug at the bottom

This type of cheap, inefficient manufacturing is typical of ASUS, which earns its reputation for the worst manufacturer in the business


I did not have a problems with this but it has been a bane for other users and I was just very lucky not to have experience mine breaking

These are not isolated incidents


There is a very strong possibility that your device will stop being able to charge and after the battery goes out, it will not function ever again.In short, ignore the positive reviews in magazines and blogs and avoid the Nexus 7 (nice steal from PKD, btw)

This device is perfect if you just want to pick it up for a few minutes to play around with the apps


If you are interested in a tablet that you can own and use over time, then forget this mess


I would expect this from ASUS, which is universally known for shoveling cheap junk, but Google is very disappointing here


They are known as the brains of Silicon Valley but they obviously took no pride in this product.Over $350 was spent on this 2013 Nexus 7-LTE and then $60 for additional protection from Best Buy and they still tried to refuse to take any responsibility for a product that stopped working within 24 hours
If you read the fine print, ASUS will do nothing, which is slightly less than they did during production of the Nexus 7


I cannot say how Amazon will respond but skip the hassle and just never buy this product in the first place.

$review_text.: Excellent quality case, but generic, not specific to MacBook Air 11.6, which fits inside a bit loosely (case is about 1.5 inches taller than the MacBook.)  Neoprene and bubble padding inside will definitely protect your MacBook from damage, and the outside "kangaroo" pocket is exactly what you need for loose papers, etc
 I like being able to tuck them inside, separate from the MacBook itself
 I sort of like the faint rubbery smell, which reminds me of visits to a tire store
 But that's just me

 As long as you realize this isn't an exact fit for the MacBook Air 11.6, it's a good value

 Overnight delivery on a Saturday was outstanding.

$REVIEW.: I purchased an Onkyo TX-SR608 last year (along with various DT and Polk speakers) under the idea that I would make upgrades to my system each year.  The Onkyo has been having increasing issues where it cuts out briefly (like a reboot) and comes back on.  The speakers are doing their job so I decided I would replace the Onkyo with this years upgrade fund.  This Marantz receiver has been on my shopping list for sometime.  After reading several reviews and seeing the $799 special price at Amazon I purchased the SR6006.  It was quite easy to swap out and setup.  The most time consuming piece of the project was reprogramming my Harmony One.  The sound difference is hard to describe, it's 'cleaner' and voice are more defined, they don't seem to fade into the background/music.  The real difference is in the HD picture.  It seems noticeably clearer and more 'crisp' on HD channels and DVD's.  The sound through my back speakers (running 5.1) is VERY nice and noticeably louder.  I'm using Definitive ProMonitors in the back, Pro Center 2000 in the center, and Polk TSi 400's bi-amp'd and Polk PSW505 for a sub.  I'm really enjoying this new receiver, though I'm not sure I appreciate it enough to pay full retail for it.  Next up, some DT BP8040's.On a sidenote, I got my Marantz SR6006 from Amazon seller Onecall.  We had some issues with the shipping that were incredibly frustrating to me.  So much so I told Fedex to return the package to the vendor.  Paige with Onecall went so far above and beyond on the customer service side that she not only calmed me down, she got Fedex to make a 2nd delivery attempt on a Saturday.  Not sure how she did what she did but it was pure magic and well beyond the means of most customer support personnel.  The price from Onecall is good, really good, BUT the customer support is extremely top notch.  This review should and would have gone way different had it not been for some extremely good customer service by Mrs. Paige.  I would definitely buy from Onecall again and I would recommend them to anyone!  They truly work to make their customers happy.

$review_text.: I needed to replace a 10 year old JVC A/V receiver with one that had HDMI switching

I have a DVD player and a Scientific Atlanta 8300HDC HD cable box from Time Warner


Both components send their video directly to my LCD TV and their audio goes to the receiver, which my speakers are connected to

I wanted to replace the DVD player with a BlueRay player but that would mean running another HDMI cable through the wall to the TV (the TV hangs on the wall and its cables are hidden in the wall, and the DVD player is currently connected using composite video and I wanted to use HDMI on the Blueray player)

Also, in the near future I intend to connect a Windows Media Center PC and a Zune docking station for my Zune HD
That would mean more HDMI cables through the wall and more audio cables to the receiver
An HDMI switching receiver would keep things a lot cleaner.I did a bunch of research and read the reviews, and the Yamaha RX-V465 had the features I needed within my price range so I pulled the trigger and bought one locally.Setup was super simple
I removed my DVD player and old JVC receiver from my entertainment center and put the Yamaha 465 and new Insignia blueray player on the shelves
There was an existing HDMI cable going from my cable box out to my TV in; I unplugged this cable from the cable box and plugged it into the Yamaha's HDMI out

Then I connected a new HDMI cable from the cable box out to the Yamaha HDMI 1 input, and another HDMI cable from the Blueray player to the Yamaha HDMI 2 input

Finally, plugged the speaker wires into the Yamaha
Powered everything on, pressed the HDMI 1 button the Yamaha remote and I had full audio and video from my cable box; pressed the HDMI 2 button on the remote and I had full audio and video from the Blueray player
Couldn't possibly be easier.The manual explains how to map inputs to the Scenes buttons on the remote, so I mapped the HDMI 1 input to the "TV" scene, and the HDMI 2 input to the "BD/DVD" scene
So now I can switch sources - both audio and video - by simply pressing either the TV button or the BD/DVD button
This is exactly the capability I set out to acheive
I now have single button source switching whereas I previously had to use 2 remotes to accomplish the same task
And I have 2 more HDMI inputs for my Windows Media Center PC and Zune HD dock.A previous review mentioned a several second lag when switching between standard def and high def video on the Scientific Atlanta 8300HDC cable box
I am experiencing this as well


HOWEVER - I have always experienced this lag, even when the cable box was hooked directly to my TV

So I don't think the Yamaha has anything to do with it.I only have one complaint, and it's relatively minor


I wish you could change the text on the display to match the source input
For example, when HDMI 1 is selected, the display says HDMI 1


I'd like to change it to "TV".Overall, this product is working exactly as advertised and setup is super simple.

$REVIEW.: It's absolutely amazing how tiny video cameras have gotten in recent years.  This one actually has higher resolution than full 1920 x 1080 Hi-Def, with over twice as many pixels.  It's fixed focus and the cable is pretty short, but for the cost, resolution and ease of use with the RPi, buying it was a no-brainer for me.  There are longer flat cables available for it, I think from Adafruit, but possibly from others as well.  I think a foot or so was the max on the longer flat cables, so if you need a greater distance than that, you'd probably want a USB webcam, but check the RPi compatibility website before buying one.

$review_text.: Yup


 This is a great little laptop, but minor niggles and annoying design choices keep it from being the perfect notebook/thin-and-light computer.The pros, as so many others have written it down before me: light-weight, powerful-enough for most purposes (I haven't tried running my Igor Pro codes on this yet), Win7 is pretty cool (I skipped Vista; Win7 = Vista cleaned up?), pretty nice speakers*, long battery life (though I get only 5-6 hours, but w/o battery saving mode or with, but running an external webcam**.)  Small power adapter


 Smart-login (using the included webcam) works on-and-off, depending on the lighting conditions (d-uh!) and on the security settings you employ (I have it on the factory-default.)  Large hard-drive.The cons and niggles, or what in my view prevents this little nugget from being a true contender:1) *Speakers face downwards! So when it's on my lap, I have to be careful not to cover the speakers, otherwise the neat sound gets muffled.UPDATE: From the ASUS website, "The angle of the speakers also allows audio to be `bounced' upwards from any surface to provide better amplification, delivering a wider frequency range, which in turn produces lower pitches that allow users to hear every reverberation of the drums, as well as every note in pitch perfect quality." Ummm..
sure.2) The battery was initially tight in it's slot, but has started jiggling (yes, I have locked it properly.)  Duct tape? :-)3) The price of being a sub-4lb notebook: no optical drive
 I just purchased an eMedia guitar learning software pack - which comes as a CD - and had to dig out my old external DVD-writer

 I am hoping that most of my not-on-TV-movie-watching and software will be downloads


[Thankfully, the eMedia upgrade from v4, which I have, to v5 is a download.]4) Dirt and finger-print magnet.5) I tried removing the plastic from the touch-pad, but it started behaving erratically (glue remnants from the sticker?), so I put the plastic back on

 I use an external mouse (trackball) when possible.6) **Webcam is just 0.3 MP, which is barely OK for video-chats

 I use an external, higher-resolution webcam to record my dog when I am away (she's getting over separation anxiety issues.)7) UPDATE: Just remembered: No Bluetooth (available on the Vt series.)  As Sheldon said: "Everything's better with Bluetooth!" :-)


$SUMMARY.: I coulda been somebody, I coulda been a contender!

$REVIEW.: I've owned quite a few pair of moderately-priced earbuds over the years in an attempt to protect my hearing on public transportation. Rather than turning my Beats to 11 so the entire bus can hear, I typically attempt to isolate the outside noise so as to be able to listen at reasonable levels.These headphones do little to isolate when one gets a good seal. They're very bass-heavy, which is fun when listening to electronic music, but they lack the accuracy and articulateness required for critical listening. My prior headphones, which were the Klipsch S4's, lacked build quality (I've had two pairs go out on me, the second being the newest version) but had good sound quality and an excellent seal. When comparing prices, this set of headphones are a good value, though I'd recommend spending a bit more money to get both better sound quality and isolation if one cares about either.

$REVIEW.: This camera is multipule years old at this point, so I've had plenty of time to use it.  That being said, it was already my THIRD Exilim camera.  I would not buy a different brand, every one I've had has been wonderful.My favorite thing about this camera (and all Exilim's that I've owned) is the rechargeable battery.  I fail to understand why cameras are still sold that require standard AA battery's.  You could end up saving yourself hundreds of dollars just on battery's over the life of this camera.Also, the cradle comes with the camera, unlike some that make you purchase it separately.The camera is very rugged, and will withstand your "oops" moments--mine has hit the concrete multiple times and still works great.The size is also very nice.  You can put it in your pocket, and forget it's even there.I realize that at the time I am writing this review there are newer cameras with more megapixel's, but take my word for it--this product still has plenty of camera!

$review_text.: I have spent  a lot of time trying to get this device to work


It seems well built and Buffalo has a good rep, but this is just a brick for my purposes

I can connect using A, N and G but the max speed I can connect at is 54 MPS (100% signal)

For my purpose (streaming HD) I need a faster connection

The device's web management screen does not even show any information on the 5 MHZ connection so it is worthless for troubleshooting


 I contacted Buffalo support via their webpage and have not heard back from them
Today I bought a WD My Net AC Bridge at Office Depot and it works great with 800MPB transfer speeds
Not sure what is wrong with Buffalo, but I am not impressed with this particular product.

$REVIEW.: This is a little more classic pattern than some of the other Kindle covers that are available, while protecting and disguising your Kindle to look like a diary (maybe).  This isn't just a little padding, it's a cover that fits like a glove, without preventing access to any ports or buttons.  The bonus is that it converts to a stand that's great for providing hands free reading.  The polka dot motif has some fun style to it, and will snugly fit the most Kindle models although NOT the Kindle Fire.  Well worth the cost.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this headset from a store in 2007, and have been using it regularly for the past three years.The headset is adequate in all ways - it is not expensive, the sound quality is sufficient (though not amazing), and the headset is relatively rugged. The microphone is actually quite good: it is noise-cancelling and my collaborators have no problems hearing me when I use this headset.When I purchased this headset, I was surprised at the number of features that it had. Most notable is that the headset comes with a USB soundcard. While USB soundcards are not exactly uncommon, this one is detachable from the headset itself, meaning that if you purchase a headset later in the future, you can reuse the sound card with your next headset. The headphones also come with a carrying case, which is handy; it helps protect the headset from damage and allows you to toss it into your carrying bag without worry.I bought this headset to replace a Logitech USB 350 headset. The previous headset lasted only about 1 year before it started to give out. I am happy to report that this headset still works for me after three years. While nothing about it is durable (various parts of mine have been falling off of it for two years) it's easily put back together and it still keeps ticking. The foam earpads have worn off, the plastic bits on the inside have fallen out, but the headset simply refuses to stop working. For that, I am amazed, as many other people I've talked to have had poor experiences with Logitech headsets. The build quality isn't exactly amazing (it's made of plastic and has a few twistable parts) but I am of the belief that the headset won't suddenly break on you - no magic cord breaks or anything.There are some drawbacks to this headset, however. First, the comfort level is not amazing. It is a behind-the-head, on-ear style, and it's not as comfortable as headsets that rest on-head, in my opinion. If you wear glasses, this headset might or might not work for you, depending on how your glasses hang on your ears. If you like to lean back on a large chair, you might end up hitting the back of the headset on your chair. I personally am not heavily bothered by the headset, but I am consciously aware that it could be much more comfortable. In addition, the cord is relatively short compared to many other headsets. However, as a travel headset, a short cord is a benefit because it does not use a lot of space. The headset also folds up nicely. It has a mute switch and a volume control. Nothing amazing, but it's functional for Skype calls.Overall, this headset was a good purchase. It is not cheap at approximately $50, but you get a carrying case and a detachable USB sound card, as well as a bit of reliability. While I would not use it for anything other than voice communications (Skype, Google Voice, Ventrilo, etc), I think that it excels at what it is designed for and is one of the few Logitech headsets that I am happy with. Even though I intend to decommission this headset and replace it with a nice gaming headset, I will continue to use these when I travel, and at work. They've lasted 3 years, they'll probably last another 3.

$REVIEW.: This hard drive works perfectly. I use Windows 7 and the drive was immediately recognized and the driver installed in no time. The drive comes with a USB 3.0 cable and it's a little short (about 18 inches) but I plugged it into a USB hub so the cable length wasn't a problem. The drive itself is only 1/4 inch thick with a nice black matte finish. It's very portable and will travel with my laptop. I don't have measurement software so I checked the speed by copying a large file (appox. 15mb) from my desktop to the drive. I copied the file to an older USB 2.0 external drive I have and the new drive. The Seagate Slim was appox. 8 times faster than the older drive. Not terribly scientific but realistic I think. If you're looking for a solid, fast external drive that's very portable you'll be happy with this. As a side note, I purchased a Case Logic hard drive case to store the drive in. The case doesn't have a model number but the size of the case lists at 3.5x1.2x5.3 inches. The Slim fits in there like a glove. The cable fits in the pocket of the case and it zippers closed easily. Just an FYI.
$SUMMARY.: Convenient, attractive, and fast

You can bend and twist it, but it is very tough, which is what I wanted.Please note that the body is spring loaded to adjust to the size of the tablet and hold it snuggly in place!I totally missed this at first (see comment below).This is great because I can keep the tablet in its case while using the mount.

The size of this screen is EXACT as original. There are no gaps (1-2 mm as they mention) between frame and the screen.The thickness is enough to have the same feeling as original one. I mention that because users said that when you touch the screen it goes down.

$REVIEW.: Well made case but if you have the canon A630 camera or one of comparable size don't buy this case

 It is frankly too small for the camera
 If you stretch the flap it will close over the camera and attach to the velcro but just barely

 Not sure I would trust carrying it by the belt loop either given the strain on the flap

 There is no room for accessories such as extra cards without placing pressure on them due to tightness of case


 This is so low priced not worth hassle of returning to Amazon but will buy an aftermarket case for my camera and consider this a lessoned learned
 Canon should not sell this as fitting my camera.

$review_text.: I never thought I could get by with just one focal length, but this lens hasn't left my D60 for more than a few hours since I got it quite some time ago.This (relatively) cheap little lens is a great performer. I'm not quite ready to shell out the big bucks for the pro f/2.8 zooms, and this lens is a great way to match their performance without breaking the bank. [...] recently posted their review, and the numbers are even better than I would've guessed. I've noticed a marked improvement in the sharpness of my photos compared to the kit lens, and the reviews make it clear why. The kit lens is great stopped down a bit, but a lot of times there just isn't enough light to do that. With this lens stopped down just to f/2.8, it's incredibly sharp and you've still got plenty of light to work with.On normal primes in general: they say everyone should have one, and now I see why. It eliminates two temptations that the kit lens offers: zoom and VR. Of course, both of those things are great tools, but it's tempting to use them as crutches. With this lens, you've really got to pay more attention to your composition and exposure. You can't just zoom to fit the subject into the frame--you've got to move, and once you're moving, you start coming up with compositions that you might not have thought of before. And all the while, you've got to keep an eye on your exposure--too often with the kit lens, I found I just left it wide open. Now, in dim light, you've actually got a bit of room, so you've got to think about whether you want the shot at f/1.8 or f/4.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I purchased a large display to use w my Retina Macbook Pro, and needed to free up some desk space. Using the rMBP in clamshell mode was the answer, with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. The Rain Design Tower was the answer. Yet upon reading many of the reviews here, I was a bit discouraged to find that I could not use this stand w a hard shell (in my case, a Speck). Being the handy guy I am, I figured I could make it work somehow, so I ordered it anyway.The case is well-packaged and beautiful, a very nice complement to my rMBP and Apple display. The stand comes with a series of cushioned inserts of varying thicknesses, labeled for whichever Apple laptop you have. Simply peel off the inserts and place them in the stand where shown. Using all 4 inserts labeled &#34;Retina Macbook Pro&#34; would have required the removal of the case. Solution? Use 2 rMBP inserts, and 2 thinner ones (in my case, I think I used the ones labeled Macbook Air, but don't quote me on that). The rMBP is held completely stable and it looks great. Granted, when I remove it from the stand, I have to hold the stand with one and and give the laptop a gentle tug to release it, but that's a minor irritation I'm happily trading for all this extra desk space. The right-side USB, HDMI, and smart card ports are now much easier to access as well.Overall, this is absolutely one of the best purchases I've made. Well-made, looks great, stable as Gibraltar, and allows me to reclaim my precious desk space. Highly recommended.

I would have easily spent a few hundred dollars more and had to assembled it, not to mention installing all the software. So you save not only money but a lot of time as well. I wasn't looking forward to windows 8, originally I wanted win7 but got this one anyway. It's really not that bad but not as user friendly as XP or win7.

$review_text.: I have a Polaroid PMID4311 - an Android 4.0.4 device with a 4.3" display, a perfect fit for what I like to describe as a "cheaptab" - an inexpensive small tablet.  I wasn't taking it anywhere because it was kind of bulky and plastic-y (goes with the cheap, right?) and I was afraid that something might happen to its display in a pocket.  I looked for something to put it in but was only seeing the generic neoprene zipper bags, which I didn't feel would provide much protection for the display...And then I realized, a 4.3" Android tablet and a 4.3" display GPS have a lot in common, including a need to protect the screen.  I searched for GPS cases, found this at a very reasonable price (barely higher than the neoprene bags, really) and gave it a shot - and the tablet fits perfectly!  Couple this with some inexpensive screen protectors (also designed for a 4.3" GPS) and it's ready to roll.If you have one of these tiny tablets, this is the perfect case for you!
$SUMMARY.: Fits other 4.3" devices really well too!

$REVIEW.: I used it actually on my 40" LCD TV. I wasn't expecting much even with the well known brand name. I was truly impressed on the result. WE all know any microfiber cloth can remove stain pretty well. So I will have to assume it is the liquid. After you wiped the surface, I see one major difference. It does not leave any residue of any sort. It may be the polymer compound that deters any dust or other material from sticking. It looks as if it is brand new surface that just came off the factory production line. This set has 2 bottles of iClean that states it is for computer screen but yet on the blister pack it says it is for plasma and LCD TV. If they include a pouch to store it, I give it perfect rating. I still did, based on the result alone. I don't see how special is the microfiber cloth. IT does seem to be thicker cloth material. I got it for cheaper at a local store but I would pay for the Amazon price if I knew the result is that good! I will have to see how long before the screen starts attracting dust. I may report on this issue after my finding.UPDATE:After 2-3 weeks, the LCD panel attracted minimal dust. Of course fingerprints will still be visible.

$REVIEW.: I bought a camera previously for $150 which only lasted 3 months so I purchased this one based on customer reviews. I'm sure glad I did - this camera is high quality, durable, well made, easy to set up, with fast efficient customer support. I cannot find any flaws with this camera. Visitors are stunned by the high resolution video and so am I. I have it configured to record continuously on my PC so its easy to play back recorded video. Excellent product A+. A point to note is that to enhance night vision I installed a separate red spot light (objects appear white at night).

$REVIEW.: By now most people know the D90 is one of the best cameras you can buy.Anyway, I wouldn't have written a review at all if not for the fact that i see no other review that mentions something I would have found extremely useful prior to my purchase.My first D90, ordered in November, arrived with a weird blemish on the sensor.  I didn't notice it on the LCD screen because i hadn't zoomed in enough to see it on my photos in camera.  But once I viewed my NEF files from the camera on my computer, I noticed a white spot in the exact same location on every photo I took.  So I contacted Amazon for a return.  Amazon's service was amazing!  They had shipped me the replacement D90 the next day, and the camera arrived the day after that!So I take the second D90 with me to work, charge the battery, put a lens on, and I went to a dark room and took about 10-15 underexposed shots.  I zoomed in on the LCD screen and scanned across the first image, viewing the whole thing, and I found a single red dot on the image.  I moved to the next image, while still zoomed in, and every image had that red pixel in the exact same spot.  (This red pixel on the second D90 was in a different location than the white blur on the first D90 that I returned.  I presume the white blur was some other defect.)I was pretty mad at this point, but I took a breath and did some searching online because this didn't seem to make sense with my previous experience with Nikon.***It turns out that these red, blue, or green "hot pixels" or "dead pixels" are a common occurrence in DSLR sensors, and are in fact inevitable.  You WILL eventually have some at one point or another, even if you don't notice them.  It is so common that Sony even programs their DSLR's to automatically re-map the camera's sensor once a month (this tells the camera to turn off those pixels so they don't bother you).  Apparently Nikon doesn't use an in-camera fix like that because when you save the NEF RAW file down to jpg, the dead pixel's red dot is automatically removed at that point.So, I just wanted to let other buyers know that if you notice one of these "dead pixels" in your image, DO NOT FREAK OUT like I did.  I almost returned the second D90 for no reason.  These dead pixels are unavoidable, no matter which camera you buy.  Please search online to learn more about them and how others deal with them.With this in mind, I still give the D90 5 stars because it is just a natural occurrence.PS - another thing, if you shoot in NEF RAW format, and use Lightroom or Photoshop for editting (and you don't use any of nikon's software), then the "Picture Control" settings in camera will not be useful.  The information for those settings are not read by software other than Nikon's software, but the LCD preview will reflect those settings.  What this means is your preview on the back of the camera in the field will not match the camera's actual output that you see in LR or PS.  Set all the Picture Control settings to 0.Hope this helps and I hope I save people from getting upset and returning a perfectly good camera.

$REVIEW.: I bought this battery to have as a backup for the identical one that came with my Canon Powershot G5. The battery is fabulous. I've always been very displeased with the shooting capacity of digital cameras in general - they would run out of battery in a very short time. This battery was one of the deciding factors for me buying a Canon Powershot G5. According to a test on dpreview, it's the best performing battery (when used in the G3) out there for any digital camera (at the time of testing).I've taken a few thousand pictures with it so far, and I'm very pleased. When using the LCD display for a mix of movies and pictures (on my G5), I get around 600 pictures out of one fully charged battery. I've never completely &quot;emptied&quot; the battery with the LCD screen off (preview only), but based on my experience so far, I would think that you'll get somewhere between 600-1000 pictures out of one fully charged battery - maybe more - when the LCD is not on all the time. If you take a lot of pictures (I can easily take 500 on a weekend trip), I would still recommend buying an extra battery though. I'm panicked about ever running out of battery (or memory) while I'm shooting.Should you buy a cheaper non-Canon brand equivalent battery? I've not tried an equivalent for the BP-511, but I've got a DigiPower equivalent for my Canon Powershot S200 (Elph II), and it's crap. I would never buy and equivalent for my G5 camera, because in my experience, it's quite apparent that you get what you pay for.Pros:* Extremely good capacity - 500-1000 pictures on one charge with normal use.* Charges relatively quick in my G5 - about 90 minutesCons:* Very heavy. It'll weigh down your camera, but for the capacity it provides, I personally think it's worth it.Conclusion: It's a very good battery - capacity is fabulous. I've had no problems with it - it doesn't overheat, it doesn't stop working, and so far after about 6 months of operation, I've noticed no drop in capacity. I give it an unconditional 5 stars!!!

$review_text.: When Amazon had a sale on this unit ($90 with free shipping) I figured it was finally time to get a GPS unit.  I like the large size of the screen.  The routing seems generally good and the screen is clear.  The unit locks on to satellites quickly.  Trip planning could be easier, as the TomTom must have specific information in exactly a certain order, but that's only a small issue.  There are plenty of free voices to download online, including Cartman from SouthPark and the Cylon voice from Battlestar Galactica, so there's some fun to have as well.  The unit does NOT have "text to speech," so it does not read street names.My main issue with this unit is on the highway.  Every time you approach an exit, it will tell you "keep left" several times, even if you have no intention to exit.  This gets annoying, especially in the city where exits are frequent.  If you've entered the highway and have a long way to travel, why should you be told to keep left every time you pass an exit?  These are unnecessary interruptions and, frankly, a poor programming/design choice by TomTom.  All things considered, I would not have purchased this unit if I had known about this in advance.  I'll have to shut off the voice every time I get on the highway and turn it back on in the city, which means fiddling with screen options while driving.  I would recommend looking into another brand, as it's likely that all TomTom models perform the same way.

Upon opening it you realize that although not overly thick, the padding is substantial and will do a good job of protecting your laptop. Zipper runs from top of one side to bottom of the other side; that protects your laptop from falling out when the cover is unzipped. What's not to like, it has a good look, something you would be proud to use anywhere, the right fit, plenty of padding, and a price that is pretty good. I think it makes a good general use case evan if you don't have a MacBook Air. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I've purchased 3 Garmin Nuvi products, so I've clearly had a good experience with them.  However, after my most recent purchase, I can no longer recommend them for the following reasons:* Mobile phone devices can generally do just as good of a job with navigation as a Nuvi product can - and they're much more portable (since you're already traveling with them).* Nuvi charges for updating their maps. Phone-based mapping applications do not charge for updates.* Worse yet, if you purchase the lifetime package of map updates, it is only for the life of your current Nuvi product. Technology gets replaced quickly - so the lifetime update is not a good deal at all.  Nuvi would be better off including a certificate for the first update for free in the packaging, or selling a "5 years of updates on all devices" package.* Their update software is difficult to use. A lot of the people who get products like this need it to be easy to use, but I think most would find that they need the help of someone else to go through the update process.So my recommendation is to use your mobile phone for navigation rather than one of these devices. Even if you need to purchase a GPS app for your phone, they typically cost only about $50 (which is the cost of a single update to the maps from Garmin). The only exception might be the person who travels a lot and needs to use their phone in addition to their navigation device - but for that purpose you can buy a mount for your mobile phone because virtually all of them will allow you to use the GPS application while talking on the phone.  Going that route will save you a lot of money and leave you with fewer devices to carry around.Once my current Nuvi is out-of-date, I won't be purchasing another one (and I am a very heavy traveler).

$REVIEW.: After reading some of the reviews and seeing the sheer number of people who bought this stereo I decided to take a chance on it


My requirements are very basic, I just wanted a car stereo that can play from SD Card and USB


I decided on this one because I figured a high-res screen would make it easier to browse through all the folders of MP3s on the SD card


A lot of similarly inexpensive units have the basic 8-character display which I know from past experience is just not cutting it when you want to see the name of the song playing or the folder it's in, let alone being able to browse through folders effectively.What I found after a week of using this product is that even with my basic expectations it just has too many fatal and disappointing flaws

One or two annoyances I could live with but after a week I was ready to return it, even given the hassle and expense

Unfortunately amazon has a 50% restocking fee for opened items on top of paying for return shipping
I would have maybe gotten $30 or $40 back which is pointless, I'm sure I could get more just selling it used
I am writing this review in the hopes that it will save other buyers the hassle, cost and disappointment that comes with this stereo.Here are the main flaws that make what should have been a great stereo into a tragic waste of time and money:* The display is next to useless

It has an incredible resolution for its size and price but all of those pixels are wasted because of poor software design

The text is white on light blue in an extremely tiny font, it can't be read at all unless you get your face right down to within a few inches of it

It is 100% impossible to read anything on the display while driving, I've even tried leaning down (very dangerously) and still wasn't able to read it.* Even if you could see the text, all file and folder names are truncated to 6 characters so if you're listening to, for example, a song called "06 - All That We Perceive.mp3" in a folder called "Thievery Corporation - The Richest Man in Babylon", what you will see on screen is that your song is called "06 - A~1" and the folder is called "THIEVE~1"

Not that it really matters because the text is impossible to read while driving anyway.* The display is blindingly bright at night


Not a little bit bright, REALLY REALLY BRIGHT


Bright enough that just trying to ignore it is not even an option

There is no way to turn it down
Your only option is to flip open the detachable face, which means that you can no longer adjust volume, skip a song, or use any other controls


I had no idea how often I tend to make little volume adjustments and skip songs until faced with this inconvenience.* Just to make it that much worse, if you do try to flip the faceplate back into place to adjust the volume or hit skip, it takes a few seconds for the controls to become active


A few seconds may not sound like a long time but in this context it seems like an eternity

Forget ever being able to drive around and enjoy your music without having this thing testing your patience


Turning it on also takes a long time.* As other reviews mentioned this stereo makes loud clicking noises in your speakers for no particular reason

I saw that other reviewers mentioned this and figured they must have installed it incorrectly and were getting alternator interference


Nope, this stereo just sends clicks down the wire and there is nothing you can do to stop it.* The buttons do not respond unless pushed very hard
You pretty much have to be pushing the entire faceplate into the deck before a button responds

Again it sounds like a minor thing but its hugely annoying.* I thought it was weird that other reviewers said the Random feature wasn't really random but after using it I see exactly what they mean


It tends to favor certain songs over others

I've had it play the same song twice with only 1 other song in between, and it's played that same song a disproportionately large number of times over the last week.* As another viewer mentioned the "Aux" port (the small hole where you would typically plug in your iPod, cell phone or other device to play music through) only works if you are using an audio-video plug

It looks similar to the iPod plug but is different and thus you will only get music playing out of the left speaker if you try to connect an audio device through it.UPDATEI ended up selling off the the Boss stereo on craiglist, and instead buying this one:B0091UZCPII don't even miss the LCD screen and this one looks a million times better in my car, especially at night


It's clear that Pioneer knows how to design a great stereo that is functional and fun to use, whereas Boss is basically producing chinese-designed garbage with terrible usability
Brands aside, I think that even though high res full color lcd screens are now cheap and common, the lcd and touchscreen car stereos are just not a mature technology and because of this your user experience is going to be wonky

Meanwhile I'm enjoying my retro bliss on a fully matured, though somewhat dated set of technology.

$REVIEW.: I've spent a good week and a half with this case and I've notice some very good things about it. The faux leather look is very professional and actually fits very flush with the tablet despite it being a third-party case. The magnets embedded in the rim of the case work as advertised, putting the tablet to sleep, a neat feature reminiscent of the smartcover for the iPad. When the tablet is reclined and resting in one of the three slots in the cover (yet another GREAT design decision), typing is breeze and works better than I could have ever expected.Now for the negatives, however minor. It becomes obvious that this is a third-party case when first putting the tablet into the six claws located on the back of the product. The process is somewhat awkward and i felt like I was going to either break the case or scratch my tablet. The biggest problem has to be the fit of the cover. To close and secure the cover you must use a felt plastic knob that hugs the top edge of the N10. Not only is this not very secure, I know that eventually one of the two is going to happen: either my tablet will have scratches on the top from using the felt knob 10x a day or the knob will lose its traction and completely not work. I hope it's the latter since there's a thoughtful band that secures the cover to the tablet even if the knob gives way so the product won't ever be useless.Right now, I don't see any better cover on the market. Though it's not perfect, it's the best us early adopters have got so go ahead and buy it. You won't regret your purchase!

Kodak used to ship cameras with a rechargable, but not on my new DX4330.After some hunting around, I decided to buy the dock, mostly because it includes a rechargable battery. Amazon/UPS delivered the dock in record time - less time than advertised.The dock seems like a foolproof device. I plugged it into the power, into my PC, changed the batteries in my camera and I was away. No more worries about suddenly flat batteries.It works as advertised to upload and share photos, but I mainly brought it as a convenient battery charger.I think the item is expensive for what you get. Acessories is where Kodak must be making their profits.

$review_text.: I had been quietly despairing for some time about occasional service dropouts with Cox's Premier service tier. I've generally been happy with them for the past 10 years, even though they oversubscribe the heck out of my SoCal neighborhood. But, for the last 8 months my home's internet connection would "go away" between 10:30AM and 1:30PM for no obvious reason. Digital TV and VoIP service were not impacted. I figured it was a maintenance reset at the head end or some such thing. Then it started happening more frequently at any and all hours, and even though I'd sometimes call in a trouble ticket to Cox, the problem would clear itself after 15-30 minutes with no trouble found.Finally I decided to swap out the old Ambit DOCSIS 2.0 modem for a new modem, even though I wasn't upgrading my service. This was the first time I had to buy a cable modem as all previous units were provided at no charge by Cox. So I griped a bit when I went into the Cox retail store and they told me that a) my problems would likely go away by upgrading to a DOCSIS 3.0 modem, and b) they'd be happy to sell me a DPC3010 for $79. A quick check online showed that Cox's price was decent, and that it would be immediately provisioned and ready to plug in by the time I drove home.And indeed it was painless, plugging and playing without my having to call Cox service to register or authenticate the device. Not only is the DPC3010 providing 100% uptime, the upgrade to DOCSIS 3.0 hardware gives me a 3MB-5MB improvement in download speeds when compared with the old Ambit modem. And, the GigE interface to my Apple TimeCapsule router also seems to provide improved network speeds on both wired Ethernet and 802.11n wireless connections throughout my home. With 4+ months of use, I'm glad I made the purchase.

With Time Warner you do need a tuning adapter and to be honest, I am quite impressed with the Windows Media Center experience. Paired with the Simplifi 5075 sound amplifier (which is rather large but works very well and was able to eliminate the stereo receiver), I have a nice HTPC system. The remote also works well with the Media Center.

$REVIEW.: This is a simple but very good gigabit switch, perfect for extending your wired ethernet network. Setting it up and using it is dead simple, the feature set is very good, and the price is quite reasonable. I haven't timed file transfers yet to see how much faster it is than a more common 100Mbps &#34;Fast ethernet&#34; switch. I think the power-saving features are a good idea. I'd be surprised if they made a huge difference in power consumption, but there's nothing wrong in saving even a little energy use._IF_ your network wiring meets all the requirements for &#34;gigabit&#34; transfers then this can be a useful part of your network. If your cabling is not up to standards, then this switch won't make it go any faster than the 100Mbps switch you may already have.
$SUMMARY.: very good and relatively inexpensive gigabit switch

$REVIEW.: It's a nice case, seems well-constructed, comes with its own strap, has a convenient, quick magnetic latch, which is why I bought it

If I hadn't installed the strap that came with my Lumix ZS20 camera, it would fit perfectly -- too perfectly


The case won't close with the strap on the camera
A quarter inch more space, and it would be just right

Maybe a different, really thin strap
I also have a Lumix ZS8, which is a little larger than the ZS20, and will not go into the case without forcing
In case anyone has a Casio EX-H10, it fits nicely, and with the strap.

$REVIEW.: First of all I will state that this charger does not work as advertised. And by that I mean... it doesn't work.The charger overheats and shuts down after a few minutes of use. I think it is important to note that this particular seller does not offer replacements, just refunds your money causing you to find another one. I guess a refund fulfills the obligation of a full one year warrantee, but I was expecting to have it replaced.Regardless, I suspect (not know) that this is a counterfeit item. I am not 100% positive, so buyer beware.

$review_text.: Pros: This item fits on the Kindle very nicely, it is very light weight, does a great job of illuminating the entire screen on my Kindle 2 and it is rechargeable.Cons: My complaint is that it is very cheaply made! Any pressure to the front of the base causes the light to cut on or off
You don't even have to push the power button, just push anywhere on the front


This causes it to lose its charge in my kindle case if anything touches it
It is so sensitive that when I am moving..

the light is flickering, which gets very annoying when I am trying to play a word game and typing in letters
It also gives no warning when the charge is getting low


It will just cut off while you are reading and you are left scrambling in the dark for another light

When charging it, you are supposed to get a red light and when the charge is complete it is supposed to turn green

Well the light on mine changes from red to red and green just moving the device around

Like I said...It is a very poor quality it is very cheaply made.It also does not fit on the Kindle when I have it in the protective case

I have to remove my Kindle from its case to use this light.

The remote app is also nice though basic. I wish it had more feature.My two complaints with the product are:- It's made to be simple stupid, so finding the more advance features (like changing the main login name & password) are a bit buried.- The USB connectivity.  The USB 3.0 port has been intermittent.  Sometimes it recognizes the drive, sometimes it doesn't.  (Likely local to this unit and not the product.)  The other USB port seems to work MOST of the time, though I've had to re-initiate the connection several times through the router UI.

$review_text.: I purchased this cable, expecting to use it to connect a new Blu-Ray player to an old, CRT-style TV

 The cost was very reasonable; less than $10!  Plus, it arrived well within the time frame promised by the seller, which was in like 8 or 9 days

 But, the cable did not work at all

 I was under the impression that all that was needed in order to connect the Blu-Ray player and an old TV was just a cable


 Well, it turns out that you need a converter box

 The box will convert the digital signal of the Blu-Ray player into an analog signal that the old TV can recognize and display in the form of picture and sound


The box is the only way to make the conversion happen

 So, this cable was a total waste of money for me
 Save your money and get a converter box instead

 They only run about $20, and you can get them right here on Amazon.

$REVIEW.: Hi Folks,Let me start by saying this, as for any Google Tablet goes, you can forget them, the Microsoft Tablet Operating System is "far" superior to anything even thought of by Google! If you are leaning toward a Google Tablet, save your money, buy the Kindle Fire HD, Root it and use it until it dies. If you do not have the money to buy a tablet with the new Microsoft OS, save and buy one. The big problem facing Microsoft is the price point of the tablets that offer you nothing! For the money of a Microsoft Tablet, you can buy a laptop with a CD-Rom, more memory, a larger HD and more for the same price or less. As for Cloud Computing goes, if anyone in the World buys the Cloud Computing Scam, you deserve to get what you paid for! What is that you may ask, I will tell you. While you are sleeping at night, you can be assured with everything negative happening in the world as we see it today, nothing and no one will stop the Federal Government from going in and browsing around your files, pictures and whatever other personal information you may keep on the cloud. I do not care if you use the cloud for just pictures, the fact that you are giving the Federal Government access to your data 24/7 places you at high risk of data manipulation by the Federal Government without you even knowing it is happening. One day you may wake-up and see black trucks outside your home with people in black fatigues carrying the same automatics that they are trying to ban now. Cloud Computing = The Federal Government watching you around the clock, like it or not! If and when you land yourself in court over a photo or document that you thought was nothing, it will then be your word against the Federal Government, guess who wins unless you have millions of dollars to spend for a brilliant attorney or law firm! Trust me when I tell you, it is happening from right under your nose. For this reason I refuse to buy any Apple products. Apple refuses to add an SD Slot to any iPad or iPhone. Why? I will tell you, Apple wants to control what you do on what they sell and how you do it. Apple wants to force you into using the Apple Cloud! Folks, Cloud Computing will turn the United States and the entire World into a Communist Government Worldwide while your eyes are closed! So, as for buying a new tablet with the new Microsoft OS, forget about it! If and when Microsoft places Office pre-packaged on the tablets so you can save your pictures and documents to an external storage device, not the cloud, then the time might be right to purchase the new tablet but until then, buy the Kindle Fire HD and use it for what it is! Stay away from Cloud Computing, it is the Governments Secret Internet Weapon and it will beat you every time!

$REVIEW.: Although it doesn't officially support the iPhone 3g, I was able to charge and play audio from my phone on this unit
 On first plug, my phone gave a message that the device wasn't supported and if I wanted to go into 'plane' mode to reduce interference


 I touched the 'no' button and it worked fine

 Bonus, I was able to play music from the AOL Radio app through the unit's speakers


 I think the reason they don't officially support the iPhone is that it would require more programming to control the phones user interface

 But that's OK - I really just wanted to be able to charge my phone next to my bed and it's a complete extra that I can play music from it

 Also, you can amplify sound from a movie clip.Otherwise, it's a nice looking clock


 Smaller, in a good way, than the picture makes it look

 The reflective front is nice looking


 The digits are a yellow color that is easy to read and see at night without being overly bright like other clocks


 The styling on the digits is a little odd in that the middle 'line' (like the middle line that makes a number 3) is just a tad higher than the usual digit-type display
 That can make a 5 look like a 6 if it's up against another number

 It looks cool, but not sure it's worth the 'styling' since it skews the look of the numbers


- not a deal breaker.There's a 'quick guide' to get you up and running quickly - nice detail is that they include a little sticker with instructions on how to set the clock's time and alarm that you can apply to the back of the clock (or wherever) if you'd like


 There are buttons on two sides and on the back, so I do think you'll need the little sticker
 The buttons being on all sides is actually good so that you get used to where certain functions are and can then work the clock in the dark.Everything else works as it should; alarms, music, buzzer 






clock science is pretty set at this point.

$REVIEW.: For a long time, MultiMediaCards (MMCs) were a tough sell against other formats such as CompactFlash &amp; SmartMedia (and lately vs Sony Memory Sticks too), largely because they were offered in smaller memory capacities and always had a higher cost-per-meg than those formats. Now the SimpleTech SD card (interchangeable with MMC cards), a format which has some distinct advantages over the other formats in terms of physical size, power use, write speed and memory protection, comes out at *less than* fifty cents per meg here in a giant size. This is long overdue and most welcome. SimpleTech cards have been very reliable despite their modestly discounted price.

 I found that they worked great and when I needed an outdoor camera I opted for this model
 I placed this one in our garage


 We live in Florida and it can get very hot so an outdoor rated camera was required
 This model works very well, once I got it on the home network I just mounted it to the wall and plugged it into a nearby outlet


 The infrared works well and image quality and sound are good.There have been a couple of times I needed to reboot the camera because it wasn't feeding to the network very well (lag)
 Rebooting (via computer interface) solved the issue each time

 Overall I am pleased with this purchase.

After a few minutes with the stylus, I was hooked
So much more fun than using your finger in this app - and much more precision


I was able to make images I don't think I'd pull off with pen and paper and it's very relaxing to use


The grip is perfect and the stylus is perfectly responsive.After an hour of doodling, I made the in-app purchase in Paper to buy the whole package

The default free fountain pen tool is still my favorite, though.I'm able to use this to sign my name, save it to my iPad as a PDF and use it in documents


Love that


I can't sign my name that pretty with an actual pen!It charges easily via USB and frankly - I just love this Stylus and Paper
Love, love, love, love!I get totally immersed with Paper using this stylus - I can literally paint/draw/doodle for hours

The very easy 'rewind' feature in the app lets you go several steps back if you realize you need a do-over

$REVIEW.: I needed to reduce glare from back lighting.  SHAME on the manufacturers for making shiny reflective screens!It fit my HP pavilion 15.6&#34; screen exactly.Well, it was a lot of work chasing the little flecks of dust. I shined a bright flashlight across the surface of the screen (from the side) and could see the little buggers dancing onto the screen continually.  No clean room here - so I finally got most of them off for a moment and applied the screen protector. Missed the aim the first time and peeled it up and moved it slightly - successfully.  Only have a couple of dust bubbles on one edge.  Unfortunately the optics of a thin piece of plastic are not as good as the glass of the older non-glare monitors I have. It makes the picture duller and bothers my eyes some to look at.  Not sure if I will keep using it.  Hate to waste this much money.

$review_text.: Either our copy is defective (not so bad from 1x - 5x zoom, then progressively worse) or we view the camera differently than many here.  We tested the SX40 and it is a good camera if a bit big and pricy for a P&S; superzoom (35x).  The ZS15 came down to a very low $179 and seemed to offer much for the price.  Out of the box and away we went on a test.  Photos in sunlight were good.  16x pictures were not as good as the others as we had to step back to get it to focus (as much as 6.6 feet per the camera!) and, more importantly, a few pictures had blur (more than with the SX40 at 25x --- probably because we used the viewfinder).But the biggest problem --- low light photography/video.  Pics were primarily dark.  And blur at 16x in low light a real issue even for those with steady hands.  Slow shutter = blurry pics and fast shutter = dark pics.  Surprising and unless there is a magic button (yes, the IS is on and digital zoom off), this will probably go back.  The Panny seems to like yellow and red colors, too.Video is nothing special on this Panny, especially at night.  Maybe on the FZ150 or ZS20 with their 60p; this has 30p or so.  Insult to injury --- the battery lost power quickly and we had to recharge it in camera (Not so with the SX40 or cheap Canons such as the Elph 300).Not all is bad is this possibly bad copy.  As mentioned the low price.  The shutter speed is exceptional.  Much faster than the SX40.  Perhaps even faster than our G12.  10x continuous at full resolution.  Very impressive.  iAuto not bad but often defaults to a noisy 3200 ISO (change the setting to max at 800).  White balance is not great.  HDR good concept but may need tripod (or very steady hands).We're bummed as we could have saved almost $200.  I don't think we'll try another small superzoom (maybe the SX260 but that seems overpriced for what it is) and Panasonic confuses things with it's more expensive ZS20.Try the SX40 before buying just to get an idea of the differences --- including 35x optical zoom vs. 16x.If it were cheaper we would probably own the Panasonic FX150.  We want good pictures (IQ), not small size or daylight only use.  $179 is a great price but we'd rather spend another $50 and get good pics most of the time and be able to take good pics at night.UPDATE:  To be fair, I tested this camera at 5x zoom vs. a Canon Elph at 5x zoom (its max).  The Elph is smaller, cheaper, more elegant (I think), and has a charger.  Image quality --- I took indoor pics of the same things.  The Elph's pics were sharper/less blurry (e.g., reading the contents on a vitamin bottle) and had nicer colors (less dark, more vibrant pics).  Also, more noise in the ZS15 pics (e.g., iAuto was at ISO 3200 often vs. Elph's typical indoor ISO 400).  I was disappointed.  I want to like this camera.  I suppose it's a good buy for 16x with its limitations but it's not for us.  We'll do without a superzoom (cropping works well as a substitute) or get a good, more expensive superzoom.  In the interim, I would recommend the Elph 310 --- it has 8x zoom --- and does everything well enough --- including  low light pics/video.  (About the same price.)Good luck!Update:  Update of a sort.  The ZS8 which is at least somewhat similar to this camera (looks, same body?), 16x lens, same price for a day at least, probably a different sensor has sold well and has many one-star reviews --- many mention broken cameras (OK, that happens) and, worse, Panasonic refusing to fix when under warranty.  The latter floored me.  I've never had a defect on a Panasonic product.  read the one star reviews (and some of the rest) and then make up your mind.

$review_text.: I started testing this in my garage and was quite encouraged

 Was able to locate a couple of 4 channel wide dead spots in the dial and it sounded great
 Then I hit the road and reality set in
 As I drove from my home, the formerly dead channels started receiving signals that interfered with the unit

 Plus the noise in my car (a relatively quiet Hyundai Sonata) was still enough to make it hard for others to hear me, given how far away the mic in this is
 (YMMV- depends on where your lighter plug is located)  If you want this primarily for music, have a rod antenna up front and live in an area with an uncrowded FM band, (i.e

drive an older car with limited media options) this may be great for you

 The Bluetooth function worked well and it charged my dumb phone without issue
 But I ended up not using it.


$SUMMARY.: Could work well in certain circumstances.

$review_text.: I bought this Toshiba Thrive tablet about 2 months ago, and could not be more pleased with it. I also purchased a case with built-in USB keyboard. With it's full-sized ports it's now like a mini laptop. I also have a EePC netbook, but the Thrive, with it's Android operating system, great display and better WiFi connectivity has relegated that to the shelf.
$SUMMARY.: Thrive is a great "tablet-laptop substitute"!

$REVIEW.: I had originally bought one about a year ago and my wife wanted one. The original one is great, does its job and has not given me any problems. Alarm is loud and you can set it to play a song from your playlist. I also like the small compact design as my nightstand already has too much crap on it. It simple to use and would probably order another for my daughter.We also use the lightning adapter as we all have iphone 5's and they work just as good.

$REVIEW.: I bought it for my Canon PowerShot A95 camera and it perfectly fits it! By that I mean that it is neither too big nor too small, looks like it was made exclusively for my Canon A95.- Price is very affordable and cheaper than those ugly, black, bulky camera cases which are widely available for sale at Wal-Mart, BestBuy and other stores.- Regardless its low price it is well made and quality is quite high. I'm confident that it will last for years and not gonna fall apart.- Flip down cover is reclosable by velcro, which I think is better than zipper it terms of saving time when you need to take camera out of the bag quickly. Also, flip down cover with velcro won't leave on your camera scratch. For example, people can be concerned about zippers which may leave marks or scratches.- Has belt loop, which doesn't open though.- It looks quite attractive at least much more attractive than those ugly, black, bulky camera cases which are widely available for sale at Walmart.- It has a little front pocket where you can put EITHER your extra Compact Flash memory card OR extra 4 AA batteries. I'd rather keep in that front pocket extra CF memory card because keeping there batteries makes the case look a bit bulkier but it works for batteries too.- Perfect for Kodak EasyShare Z760 digital camera too! I tested myself looks like Kodak EasyShare Z760 has very identical body shape as Canon PowerShot A95. So if you have Kodak EasyShare Z760 I strongly recommend buying this case, which I already did for our 2nd digital camera Kodak EasyShare Z760. It that case you can use its front pocket for keeping your Kodak's extra Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery!I'm glad that I bought two camera cases, one for my Canon PowerShot A95 and second for our Kodak EasyShare Z760.Great price and great quality! What can be said more? :)------------------------------------------------------------------------FOLLOW-UP:I purchased one more on May 16, 2007 for my newly bought Canon PowerShot A620. This case fits my camera like a glove. So, I will recommend it again, now for Canon A620.Looks like Canon changed its packaging. Packaging has carton back now and specifies camera models this case is made for. According to packaging this case fits PowerShot A95, A85, A80, A75, A70, A60, A40, A20, A10, A620, A610, A520, A510. And also any camera within 4.13" (104.8 mm) x 2.6" (66.0 mm) x 1.93" (49.1 mm).Also small metal emblem in front of the case reads just "Canon" now. Older versions of this case had "Canon Powershot" logo.Case quality is still the same as previous version and it is still made in China.Thanks.
$review_summary.: GREAT PRICE+QUALITY!!! Perfect for Canon PowerShot A95 and Kodak EasyShare Z760 + Canon Powershot A620

$review_text.: Would I recommend this frame to a friend? Yes. But one have to be aware of limitations! Good things first, though:- The frame is BIG. But it still fits nicely on a bookshelf. At 14-15" range there's not much competition.- 4:3 aspect ratio. 4:3 and 3:2 are standard aspect ratios on digital cameras. 16:9 is a more of a marketing thing, allowing manufacturers to specify larger diagonal, with equivalent 4:3 diagonal would be 22% smaller (thats almost 1/4)! With 16:9 you will always have black bars either on top/bottom or left/right for both portraits and landscapes.- Adequate 1024x768 resolution. You can't see any grain on the image and menu looks crisp. Less would be awkward, more - nice, but not really needed.- The frame reads H.264 videos - nice feature but see in consOK things:- standard variety of connectors+USB- mp3 playback during slideshow- reasonable menu system, very simplified but adaquate- gloss finish - better black, but prone to glare - keep away from windows.- price on amazon is good, but don't expect wifi connectivity at this priceNow the real things:- Viewing angles are UGLY. Especially vertical ones. Have to be eye-level and 30 degrees of at horizontal to see anything - this is generic for digital frames though...- Video playback is very limited! Don't count on viewing HD clips on this frame. 720x480 (NTSC SD) plays back too slow, anything larger does not play at all, and I need to add letterboxing to avoid my HD videos being stretched vertically. Quicktime Pro is your friend!- No shuffle mode - WTF?? And not info whether new firmware will ever be available.- No combined video/picture slideshow. Have to go to menu and play either-or.- Technical support treats every customer as an idiot who forgot to reset settings to default, which would apparently resolve all the issues. They still cannot tell me what video formats/sizes are supported!- Included 2G SD card is cr@p. No-brand piece of plastic, sticker peeling off, don't ever trust your digital memories such a thing!I was able to get around certain things: transcoding and downscaling video, randomly renaming pictures, putting frame in shady areas. Nothing can be done about the viewing angles though, but this is common among cheap LCD panels, such as used in all frames (AFAIK).  C'mon, bring us some MVA/IPS panels at reasonable prices!
$SUMMARY.: Limited competition makes me keep this frame

$review_text.: This TV has been unreal, the colors are bright and the blacks are black. The picture quality overall is beautiful and with all the connections set in the side of the TV it's a breeze to hook things up to it. Being a projection DLP TV the viewing angles are surprisingly bright although it looks best when you sit level to the screen. I wouldn't recommend it in a bright sunlit room, the picture will be bright but you will get glare. I bought it for several hundred less than what the retail stores wanted for it. Delivery was fast and everything was in great condition. I have it hooked up to surround sound so the poor built in sound isn't an issue and actually I listened to the built in speakers and they seemed to sound ok, just a little muffled.

$review_text.: I'm using two of these (different setup, not in a row) and I need to use a booster for the source (before the split) on one of my setups.  The other one is fine.It depends on your source and your receiver.  You won't know if you need to boost it until you try it.  Booster is another $20 or so, but still a great way to go instead of using a switch (which also may need a booster, if it's not a powered switch)

I got them for listening to audio books so they will do that job just fine but in my opinion they are not loud enough for music.  I used them for about 4 hours the other day and by the end my ears were starting to hurt from the pressure, the main reason I don't like on ear headphones.

$review_text.: Can a headset be like a Swiss army knife... in other words, can it be a multipurpose audio device?  That was my first reaction when I saw thisPlantronics GameCom 380 Stereo PC Gaming Headset, so I had to find out. Please do note that these are labeled in the product description as a "PC Gaming Headset" and with no mention of being able to be used with a Mac, but more on this further on.But first the general likes and dislikes, for those who need to know...Pros:+ Excellent sound; rich bass and high, clear trebles+ Easily accessible volume and mute control on the left ear cup+ Adjustable microphone is well-designed; good noise cancellation+ Comfortable, can be worn for hours+ More lightweight than expected+ Sound chambers are quite good+ Long, well-designed sturdy cord+ Excellent price; a true bargainCons:- No USB connector (but see the note on Mac usage below).Gaming Applications:Must admit that I'm not a dedicated game player, but am fortunate to know someone who is, an individual who owns a few different headsets.  Adding to that, he had recently bought thePlantronics GameCom 780 Surround Sound Stereo PC Gaming Headset, Dolby surround sound and all, which he rates as a 5-star set.  He offered to try my new Plantronics GameCom 380 on a comparative basis, so I agreed. He ran a range of games, including "Star Wars: The Old Republic" and spent some time with them. He then switched headsets with me so I could experience the differences. Our mutual conclusion was that the GameCom 780's stereo surround sound with Dolby really enhanced the gaming experience. So where I might have initially given this GameCom 380 a 4-star rating or higher, for true gamers this might be 3-stars unless you're a casual game player.Skype Usage:This is where this headset really surprised me. Not only was the sound quality excellent, but one can hear far more range and depth of sounds than I had noticed with other sets that I've used.  The parties on the other end noted that my voice sounded "much clearer" than on previous conversations, and this was without prompting them that I had a new headset. The volume control on the left ear cup made adjustments quite easy, as was the mute switch when I had to take a quick but necessary break due to extra coffee that evening. Also worth noting is that ear cushions are quite comfortable, even after a couple of hours of conversation.  So if Skype usage is important to you, then I can offer a 5-star recommendation, especially if you plan to be on the phone for extended periods.Audio Listening:I tested this headset on my Windows 7 notebook PC with customization and equalization as needed, then on the MacBook Pro (see note below), running them "flat" as a comparison.  My musical tastes are quite eclectic, and within a few hours, I had played a wide range of tracks, selections from Adele, Leonard Cohen, Whitney Houston, Tom Waits, Regina Spektor, Paolo Conte, Five for Fighting, Al Jarreau, Buckwheat Zydeco, Carl Orff's O Fortuna (Carmina Burana), Amy Winehouse, The B52s, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Enya, Quynh Anh, Pachelbel's Canon in D and more.The sounds were clear and accurate, and the 'transparency' throughout the frequency range resulted in good delineating of instruments and voices.  It was easy to hear the fingers sliding on acoustic guitar strings, the light whoosh of a flute, the brassy notes of a trombone, the distant tinkle of a softy struck triangle at the back of the stage, the rich boom of kettle drums, and the glisten and afterglow of a brushed cymbal. Bass sounds are important to most of us listeners, as it's the rhythmic underpinning of much music, and in this headset did not disappoint. Fading tails of sound decaying away in all ranges are easily distinguishable and followed to its silence.  Spatial clues and sound reflections are accurate, such as naturally recorded hall ambiance and fingers going down a keyboard.But I had to test this a bit higher, using an album that I've used over the years to test larger home speakers and sub-woofers, an album that to many audiophiles is the gold standard for testing the capabilities of speakers, a pure digital (DDD) CD that's been around since the '70s. The album isTime Warpbut I strongly suggest that if you get it, read the reviews first and follow the advice of those who say to be conservative and turn your volume very low.  This one has been known to make your tweeters turn to a dying squawk, and to deteriorate the foam surround on your bass speakers and subs, and I'm not joking.This headset Plantronics GameCom 380 held up under my tests with that, even with the low sub-30Hz sounds of the first twenty seconds of the digitally-recordedIntroduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, known to many as the "Theme from 2001, A Space Odyssey."  In that there was only a slight amount of rumbling on the very lowest notes, but that was to be expected. As noted before, use this one with the volume way down to start.  Again, the comfort of the ear cushions was quite good for a few hours of listening, and they were pleasing to wear. For audio listening, they are not perfect, but easily worthy of a solid 4-star rating.A Note on Mac Usage:I have a device similar to this inexpensiveSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Stereo Audio Adapter, and I was curious (Swiss army knife adaptability as noted earlier), so I decided to try the Plantronics GameCom 380 on my MacBook Pro. Without getting too repetitious, it worked equally well on the Mac as it did on my Windows 7 PC, so this little device solved a problem that could be a show-stopper for Mac users.Summary:All things considered, this Plantronics GameCom 380 exceeded my expectations as a multipurpose audio device. If you're a truly dedicated game aficionado, then the Plantronics GameCom 780 with its Dolby surround sound would probably be a far better selection. But if your gaming interest is just casual, and your needs are similar to mine in a headset, then this headset is a solid 4-star choice, especially considering the price, and is highly recommended.4/11/2012

$review_text.: Having used PCs for years, I couldn't get comfortable with Apple's extended keyboard.  The Macally has a much better feel for me, and also has tabs in the back to give it an angle, instead of laying flat like the Apple.  So for it's main function, typing, it earns 5 stars.  Also highly rated was the Bluetooth setup, which was easy and direct.It does have some quirks that overall cause me to down rate it to 3 stars.  It is white, and thus matches older Macs, not the new aluminum clad models.  The keys are labeled with decals, not silk screened on like Apple's appear to be, so they may not be very durable.  The keys are not 100% compatible with the Apple keyboard with keypad.  The function keys (F1 - F15) are purely function keys, so there is no brightness control (F1/F2), Play/Back/Forward (F8 - F10) etc.  But the Macally does have dedicated keys for Mute, Volume Up, Volume Down and Eject above the numeric keypad.  There is no Function key -- it is labeled Help where Fn would be on the extended keyboard.  When pressed, it changes the cursor to a question mark, but beyond that, I'm not sure of its purpose.  And on the keypad, the Clear key is also labeled Num Lock, which seems more appropriate to a PC keyboard.  The Caps Lock light is on the top right, not part of the key as in Apple's case.  The Command key is not labeled command, but just has the symbol.  And unlike Apple's mouse which shows the battery condition in the Bluetooth menulet, the Macally has a battery low light near the Caps Lock light.  Finally, the on/off switch is on the bottom -- a position along the side or back of the case would be more convenient.In summary, the typing feel, while subjective, is for me much better that the Apple keyboard, but the other features leave room for improvement.

$review_text.: I installed this onto a new, 120 GB SSD, in a Dell Inspiron 530, quad-core tower that was previously running WinXP. I kept the original HD around to use as secondary storage. The installation was pretty easy overall. The key code is printed in smaller-than-normal type, but it's not really *that* difficult to read :-)  The only thing I was not prepared for was having the drivers for my older Linksys WUSB11 54Mb  wifi adapter not being compatible with Win7. So, I just had to get a new one ... now I have 130Mb wifi connectivity, so no problems there!It took a few hours for the 151 windows updates to be applied, with downloading, rebooting, and such, but in the end, it's a fully-functional 64-bit Win7 machine. Just had to add an AV, anti-malware, MS Office, and it's good to go .... until Win7 stops receiving support!
$SUMMARY.: Worked exactly as expected - no problems

$review_text.: These headphones felt great, and looked like they were very nicely built. However, like a few other reviewers, they did not work with my Sony HDTV. Silence is the best way to describe what I heard with them! The transmitter light would not illuminate. Too bad the ad for this item didn't state that they would not work with (some or all?) HDTVs.I am reluctant to give a negative review on something that didn't work at all. Consider this review to be netural.  Was it defective, or would it simply not work with a HDTV?  The important thing here is that a refund was promptly provided. That's what I like about Amazon.com - the no-hassle refunds for items that either don't work or are not as advertised.Based on my experienc, I can't recommend them for use on a HDTV.  They may work perfectly well on older analog TVs.
$SUMMARY.: Nice Headphones, but they didn't work on my Sony HDTV!

$REVIEW.: This set has me hooked on HDTV.  The picture is so vivid on HDTV channels, I will sit and watch even bad programming just because it looks so incredible.  I just wish my satellite service offered more HDTV channels to watch.Set is extremely heavy, as with any tube sets.  Only problem -- the "On" switch on the front of the set broke after 3 months, and labor warranty is for only 90 days.  The cost of replacing the "On" switch -- $300! -- and moving this heavy monster, made me just stick with using the remote to turn it off and on.

$REVIEW.: We purchased one of these for our 8 year old grandson for Christmas last year.  He had major iPhone envy as everyone in his family owned an iPhone.  We purchased this for him and it contains all of the features of an iPhone except the phone of course.  We could also share our apps with him if they were appropriate for his age.One of the major features that Apple has included is that as an adult you can restrict access to many of the functions that children should not be able to use.  By going to the Restrictions settings under General you can set a passcode and turn off:* Web browsing* Access to You Tube* The ability to install apps* The ability to delete apps* The ability to make in app purchases* The ability to add friends and play multiplayer games in Game Center* you have the ability to set age restrictions for movies, TV shows, apps* And even more.These features allow you to create a game playing system that the content is shared with the family and utilize parental control as to what you want your child to do and see while using their iPod Touch.  This is a professionally thought out security system that all children's digital devices should have.Another great feature is the Find iPhone function which lets you find the iPod as long as it is connected to a WIFI by using your iPhone or computer.  Using this function you can see where the iPod is within about 10 to 15 feet.  This is a good tool to have for a device that can be lost or stolen.  The App will let you drill down to the street and even to the satellite view to see the location.This iPod Touch is a great toy for children.  He listens to music, reads books, listens to audio books, watches movies and plays games.  It is his favorite toy.
$SUMMARY.: An outstanding product that has good security features!

$review_text.: I purchased this camera as a gift for mom to replace her aging 3 MP Easyshare camera
I figured that I would be safe buying the same brand, and the fact that it is 12 MP and optical zoom would just be a bonus..


how wrong I was.After using the camera for several days, we discovered the pictures were very fuzzy and just didn't come out clear


We were using the recommended automatic settings, but then tried some other settings found in the instruction manual to see if there could be any improvement
It seems the camera's exposure time was just too long, and you had to make sure the camera was as still as possible during the picture - even then you aren't guaranteed a clear photo


Any movement from the subject would ensure that picture would be ruined.Overall not impressed with this offering from Kodak, we will be looking to obtain an alternate model for our point-and-shoot needs.

$SUMMARY.: After using this camera for several days, I was forced to return it because of the picture quality

$review_text.: But for two issues this would be an easy 5 star rating.  The control buttons are located on the front of the tablet which means that you frequently inadvertently hit one and you go back or to the home page.  This happens most when using it as an ereader or while playing games.  Once you have done this a bunvh of times you do become careful how to hold the tablet.  The power and volume controls are inbedded in the side and I eventually will remember where they are and not keep turning the tablet over and around.The second issue is that it is not compatible with the adope flash reader so you cannot watch Amazon video content.  There are numerous companies that you can get movies from but I was considering Amazon prime.Tablets now are like vhs and beta back in the old days, eventually there will be dome consistency amoung the manufacturers.The picture is fabulous, it is easy to use and the keyboard is the best of any tablet I tried.  I like the 10.1 inch size even though it is bulky to carry, the benefits far outweigh the detriment.Added note:  If you need more storage it is far easier to add a micro sd card when you can catch them deeply discounted (many were 70-80 percent off for Black Friday, etc.)  For $23.00, I added 32gb of storage.  Had I purchased the model with the additional storage it was around 100.00 more.  The trick is to find the sale on the micro card.  Staples will price match Amazon, and I always check Amazon's prices before I shop as they are usually unbeatable.
$SUMMARY.: fabulous tablet, great pictur quality, intuitive to use makes it a home run for those new to tablets

$review_text.: I am overall very pleased with the case. I would have liked the carry strap to be more substantial. I would also like the frame to be more substantial. By that I mean that many of the soft sided camera cases rely on the interior Velcro secured dividers to help hold the outside walls of the case's shape. I am utilizing the length of the case as a primary feature. As a result I have to remove most of the dividers and the outside of the case loses some of its integrity. I don't rate this case lower since this approach seems to be the standard for most cases, even by other vendors, so I don't think that would be fair. However it is something that I would like to see improved on. I really don't have a desire to move to the hard cases, but there could be a strengthening of the soft sided cases that would be a significant improvement to my way of use of the case. The handle is comfortable, the case has more room than most camera cases and also includes exterior storage areas on the front and both ends. These &#34;pockets&#34; are lightly padded so be careful what you put there and all pockets have zipper closures as does the top.
$SUMMARY.: Larger case, extra pockets, complete with many Velcro secured panels inside for personal customization

$REVIEW.: If you've only worked with zoom lenses, you may be pleasantly surprised by the sharpness of a prime lens like this one. I only dabble in macro photography but also wanted a good outdoor portrait lens and this fits the bill perfectly! It's fast, has lovely bokeh and is sharp all the way to the corners. The 100mm length gives you a bit more distance when shooting insects which is a good plus, but be aware that this is a fairly heavy lens and not easily handheld (and does not have IS as many of the zooms these day do.) Use of a tripod is certainly recommended when possible as for good macro shots you do often need to stop down and may have to sacrifice a bit on shutter speed as a result. This may not be marked as an L lens, but it certainly is that level of quality. My only real gripe is that Canon does not include the accessories (hood, case) with the lens, as is typical for lenses in this price range. Otherwise, an excellent lens for anyone wanting to try their hand at true 1:1 macro photography.

$REVIEW.: We use the Q-See camera at the family motel business and it works well, especially compared to the many-years-old camera that it replaced.Installation was easy as long as you can run the 100' of cable safely. In our case, that was not an issue. I would recommend covering the clear portion of the camera's case when installing to protect it from scuffs. The cover is not especially fragile or scratch prone but you will want to keep it clear and clean for the best possible picture.Speaking of picture, the Q-See does not disappoint. It's not 1080p hidef but the images are loads better than our previous camera. If anything bad ever does happen we feel safer knowing that the surveillance video will be clear. That is all for daylight. For nighttime, I think the 65' range is maybe a bit exaggerated. It's not that the Q-See won't see at night to 65' it's just that you can't make out any usable details at that range. Maybe 50' is more realistic.If you are considering this purchase for a commercial installation and already have a DVR or monitor then I don't think you'll find any big surprises. Be aware that if you are purchasing this for home use then the connectors are the type used for mostly commercial devices and your TV may not be able to connect. We installed this ourselves and had everything up and running within an hour. I suggest you perform a test run in your office before running the cable and mounting outside or in a hard to reach place.The sweep patterns are nice and work as expected, allowing you to monitor large areas automatically. I love the remote control. Not having to use a wired controller is something that I didn't think would be a big deal until I got the remote. Using it from any location in the office has been surprisingly helpful.Final Verdict:An excellent product for the price. Night vision could be better but for the price is very acceptable. Easy installation, strong metal case.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent camera


Be careful if installing yourself.

$review_text.: I went from a film SLR to a few of the early point-and-shoot digitals to a 10D and now a 5D Mark II.  In the early days I wasn't willing to buy high-end digitals due to the ridiculously fast pace of the technology progression.  The 5D II finally sold me.Generally speaking I am quite happy with the camera.  It took some fiddling to get the picture quality I wanted.  My 100-400mm F4 L works incredibly well and has no AF issues.  My 28-105 (stock) F4 L was consistently soft on the AF but the fine focus adjustment CF fixed the issue.  It was surprisingly easy to calibrate, just switch between live-mode focusing (which is very slow but perfect) and standard AF and adjust the fine focus until they match.  I had go all the way to +12 on my 28-105.  On a pixel-by-pixel basis there is still some slight softness looking at the raws, but it looks unavoidable considering how the RGB matrix works on a sensor, plus noise reduction (depending on the ISO one is shooting at), and it is unnoticeable on prints or reductions.  Still, I can only give Canon 3 stars on the AF because while it is always perfect on zooms sometimes it is just too wonky at wider angles, and the camera's automatic AF point selection is a roll of the dice.  Fortunately the AF point can be easily selected.  Finally, I also noticed that the AF sometimes got in the way of shooting with the zoom or tele, where I would hit the shutter button on a fast-moving subject that was never-the-less still in focus, and the camera would decide not to take the picture.  Possibly it was just the AF mode I was in, but it seemed a bit inconsistent.The only way to go is to take full RAW photos and clean them up in post-production.  Canon isn't known for good auto-white-balance but it's a minor inconvenience in post. The 14-bit ADC has wonderful dynamic range.  I had no problem cleaning up wedding photos taken in horrid lighting conditions (beige walls, mix of fluorescents, flash).I also purchased the wireless file transmitter (WFT-E4A).  The WFT is incredibly convenient.  No cables, no fuss... even if I'm not shooting in an area with internet access it's amazing how convenient it is to get it into the computer back home when I do get into range of a base station, or even once I get home.Battery life is excellent compared to earlier models.  I have no complaints on that front.  Both lens are excellent. I upgraded my flash as well.  The 580ExII flash is excellent, far better then the 4xx series I had on my 10D.  Big CF cards with UDMA are expensive but mandatory.  This is not a cheap camera even if you don't count the lens.  The RAWs hit 30MB and you will be unhappy if you aren't using 16G UDMA CF cards.  The camera has no problem taking 500+ full blown shots on one set.Finally I am very impressed with the video capabilities.  It took some messing around to get it figured out but I finally hit upon the '+' button to zoom the live-view, making manual focusing while shooting possible.  Being able to adjust the exposure w/ the new camera firmware is wonderful, too!  The quality is insane, I'll have to buy a faster computer to process it.  It is not a camcorder so don't expect it to behave like one.  It definitely works best when the subject is at a fixed focal point.  Taking video with 100-400mm in stabilization mode 2 just blew me away.One thing I would love to have on this camera is the ability to set a specific auto-ISO range (e.g. 100-800, 400-1200, 800-3200, etc) and then be able to fix both Av and Tv and have the camera only adjust the ISO and flash exposure.  I'm a bit miffed that Canon hasn't done something like that yet. The current auto-ISO does not work very well in any mode other then Av.  So that lack plus the AF issues cause me to drop the review to 4 stars even though I think the camera's only competition is the high-end Nikon (and Nikon has its own issues).-Matt

$REVIEW.: I've used this product for years and it does just what I expected it to do.  I've been using flash for many years and have used several "bare-bulb" units in the past.  These are flashes whose flashtube is not back by a reflector.  The resulting light is spread to 360 degrees instead of a tight, focused beam.  They are great for using inside of softboxes as the light hits all of the sides of the box, bounces around and gives a wonderful, indirect glow to the front cover.I use anALZO Flip Flash Bracket Softbox Kitpretty often and use the Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce to give me something close to a bare-bulb effect, and it does just that.  I also use it for fill flash while inclining my flash's head to about 90 degrees.  I am currently using it on myCanon Speedlite 580EX IIand have no problem fitting it on correctly.  This is one of those things that you get more more value out of than it costs.  It's compactness is a hugh plus, but I do lose them occasionally.  I also have theStofen Gold Color Omni Bounceand love it as well.  Great little products!

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera to monitor the driveway of a house that I bought that would be vacant for several months.  What I needed was the following--- Reliable, it needed to be able to do what it was supposed to do w/o having someone to reboot it or fiddle- Reasonable Quality, it needed to be able to capture a license plate from 25' during the day- Wireless, it wasn't going to be close enough to plug into the router- Email Notification, if something happened I needed an email w/ picturesMy take on these points from my experience over the past 6 months:- Reliable?  Yes.  Once I got it setup it did exactly what it was setup to do, it would come back functional after power failures and operated in a dusty and generally crappy environment- Reasonably Quality?  Eh.  I set the camera up to email me 10 images when motion would occur, the images were sufficient quality to be able to read large lettering on commercial trucks, and I could /sometimes/ make out a license plate if the vehicle were parked close.  In general I have to say though that I am disappointed in the image quality considering the outstanding quality that can be had in even the cheapest point and shoot cameras these days- Wireless?  Eh.  Once it's setup it works fine... but what a pain to get it setup.  I found myself having to constantly play back/forth between hard-wire and attempting to get wi-fi until I was hitting the correct settings.  Maybe the process would be easier if I used the CD, but I didn't, I chose to setup it manually through the camera's web interface.  It supports WEP, WPA and WPA2.  I believe it only supports TKIP, so you have to be sure that your router is set for TKIP or TKIP+AES- Email Notification?  Yes!  This was probably the best feature.  I created an email account just for this camera, that setup piece was very easy (on the camera) and after defining my motion detection area (IE only, Firefox, Safari, etc do not work!) it was emailing me photos based on motion events.  Be careful w/ the motion area otherwise you may find yourself with hundreds of emails from passing cars, etc.  You might also want to define motion detection times to exclude after dark if you have no exterior lighting--my setup would get a motion trigger from every car that would drive by because their headlights would reflect on the window glass.Overall this is a decent camera, but it's really the quality that I would have expected in 2001, not 2011.  The price is good at just over $100, but the quality really needs to be bumped up for this to be good.Out of all the ~$100 priced cameras, Linksys is definitely my #1 choice however.
$SUMMARY.: For specific situations it can be OK, once setup it is hands off

$review_text.: I am new to these hand-held type of GPS devices, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I will include what I like and don't like about the unit.Likes:1. Seems to be built pretty solid and would stand up to being dropped without major damage.2. GPS finds the satellite quickly, even under roofs, treetops, etc...3. The maps are built in so nothing to download for my area.Dislikes:1. Screen is not easy to read in direct sunlight. I found you had to move it to a shady area to see it correctly.2. Boot time - it takes a while (one a half minutes) to boot up - maybe they are all like this I don't know.3. Compass is hard to get set correctly. I think I will stick with my old fashion compass - it works every time :-)For what it does, it seems pretty good to me. I will update this review after further use to see if it stands up to wear and tear, although it looks pretty tough to me.

$review_text.: This cover is great. It does fit the tab like a glove fitting it and conforming to its curves. It has great padding to protect the front and back, but the only concern I have is that the sides are completely exposed when case is closed. If dropped on one of these sides especially the corner on a hard surface I am afraid it will receive some damage. Also like the previous reviewer stated, when not on a flat surface the cover tends to buckle such as on your lap or stomach.I'm still tossing which cover to keep. The Portfolio Roocase which covers the tab completely, but is thicker, or this one that has to one of the thinnest leather covers out there but has some exposure.

And by the way, someone should build one of these contraptions with an analog to digital signal converter so it could be plugged into a modern TV.  We found that the two possible Samsung 23 and 26 inch sets for the application we wished to use this had no analog inputs for the VCR output, so we had to use a 10 year old analog capable TV receiver which we wanted to retire.

$REVIEW.: these netgear wireless-n 300 adapters work quite well, although they do tend to drop connection from time to time. This one is replacing an old D-Link adapter that will not work on anything past Vista. I have been using the N-300 on another computor for 4 years now and you can not let windows update the driver otherwise it will end up transmitting @54 megabits instead of up to 300. Another thing is that you do not get soft ware with the adapter so you have to down load it ahead of time. The one that works best with this adapter is  Netgear WNA3100_v1.1.2.16 setup exe. Download this to your computor or to a flash drive before you install your adapter, install the soft ware first  then the adapter.

$REVIEW.: I work as tech support on a database product so I am on the phone ALL DAY. After 2 years of holding the phone to my ear while I write - I decided to look into headsets. My work place dumped $150 on a headset that didn't work and since then haven't bought another.This is an awesome headset - if you can figure out how to set it up. It took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to get this working. Like most tech people I threw away the manual and just plugged everything in hoping that it would work. Well, the volume was super low - the listen/speak buttons didn't do anything - after a few other configuration settings I finally went back to the trash can to pick up the manual.Set it up EXACTLY as the manual tells you to - Plug your phone's handset into the handset on the plantronics device - plug your plantronics headset into the south end of the plantronics device and then plug the plantronics telephone cord into your telephone's handset cord.If you do that then the listen/speak volume will work - the mute button and headset/handset button will work allowing you to use your phone normally.Once configured correctly callers told me they heard me VERY clearly - especially if I turned the Tx Level to hi. I have my listen volume ALL THE WAY DOWN and it is blasting my ear out.If you do not set it up exactly as the manual tells you to - you will not be able to use your phone's headset, your phone's speakerphone, and your Plantronic's headset at your wish.Read the manual - it is a must this time :) - this HEADSET ROCKS.

$review_text.: Let me start off by saying, this is the first case I have ever purchased where I put the whole PC together myself


 Since this was my first PC I did, it took me several hours, but it was several hours of fun

 I really enjoyed the experience
 (I'll add pics later.)The cable management on this case is first in its class


 That is the main thing that attracted me to this case was the cable management

 It's awesome
 Cables are out of the way and look great
 The airflow design is awesome


 So far, the CPU is 33c and the MB is running at about 29c

 I am also using a self contained liquid cooling, which also really helps with the cooling of the system.There are so many more great features


 One, the HDD Bays are by far the easiest thing to install
One reviewer said the screws do not attach well, or hard to screw in
 Wrong on all counts
 It was easy, fast and holds the HDD and SSD's in place very well


 Installing the front bay DVD/Blu-ray drives was a breeze

 The tool less install for those drives, makes this a great case.Only CON for me, is that the screws could have been labeled better and the they could have included a power cable for the MB that was an extension for the PSU, but that could just be an issue because of the PSU I have, but that will soon be replaced with a better one.Final thought:  Well worth the price, it's a future proof case

 Again for someone who just fully built his first PC, this was the case I wanted and it was a near perfect install

 Only issue I had was forgetting to plug in drives power
 Opps.It's worth the money
 Hey, if you are looking for a good case


 GET THIS ONE!!

$REVIEW.: Hi there,I won this lens a while back from a photo competition. I was lucky to be chosen as the amateur winner in my category. I was excited to receive this lens and boy oh boy it didn't disappoint! The images with this lens are crisp and clean, sharper than ever. This lens carries a weight similar to the Canon EF 70-300mm F4-5.6 IS lens which was my first telephoto lens that I bought. Unfortunately this lens doesn't have IS but not a problem, I practiced with my normal telephoto lens by switching off the IS. It took a little getting used to but I love the shots I get and now I don't use IS at all. The bokeh will knock your socks off on this lens. This lens really shines at Aperture F7-9.  I only really ever use F4 if I need the light however images at F4 to me seem a bit soft. I am by no means a pro yet. Just my personal observation.Auto Focus is very fast however it can be  problem at times. I will try to focus on a subject and the auto focus will focus on something else in the picture. Sometimes a readjustment of the position your holding it in will correct this or you can manually focus it.I prefer to manually focus my shots but at times it is hard to gauge whether you have your subject in focus or not. SO swap between AF and MF. You will notice that the focusing ring on this ens will continue to turn in either direction even after it's reached it's focusing points. At first I thought this was a fault however I now believe that this is how many of the high end quality lenses are. Guess it's better to protect from damaging of constant focusing.From reading reviews I believe this is the best 70-200mm Canon lens in it's line up. Even though their is a F2.8 version which means better light in darker scenes I have read that the F4's quality of pictures is the best.Find me on Flickr~Go to Flickr~Then type in a "/" then "photos" then "/" and last type in "suipeter"And that should take you there.

$REVIEW.: The basic unit itself easily met or exceeded my expectations.  The bluetooth works extremely well, the software is reasonably intuitive.  I like the GPS functionality (though it takes a bit too long to locate satellites in the city).My only real complaint is that, within a few weeks of very light use, one of the two silver studs on the wrist band broke in half.  I tried to navigate the moto website to request a replacement, but failed to find an easy way to do so.  The strap is on sale presently, but I don't want to spend $15 (w/ shipping) to buy a replacement that might fail again immediately.  I'm really hoping Moto reads this posts and sends me a more durable replacement, as one of the other reviewers has described.  Unless that happens, I have to say this review is a fair assessment based on reliability.

$review_text.: I bought this unit to be able to add some SATA devices to an older computer for a client and it does work well with decent transfer speeds. Not sure that the IDE connection is worth anything anymore since pretty much everything has gone SATA, but if you need it it's there. My issue with this device is that the internatl SATA connectors are not exactly the strongest things in the world. When I installed the device, two SATA devices were connected to their slots and I had no problems. The issue happened when one of the connected devices failed and needed to be removed from the system. When I attempted to remove the SATA cable from the PCI card, it took the entire SATA connector off of the card rendering the port worthless. I know it's not the cables fault because I immediately removed the 2nd cable from the port, put the 1st cable on the remaining port and it did not pull the connector off. Maybe I just got a faulty port, but the card still works with one connector left. Buyer beware.

Install sonocaddie drivers from sonocaddie website.Turn off your firewall(s), software and router firewalls if you have both active.Make [...] a trusted site in IE, and make temporary IE settings adjustments as shown in the sonocaddie XV2 quick start guide instructions.This takes about 2 minutes


Download courses.Change settings back and reactivate firewall(s).It's really very fast and simple.These GPS's are being phased out for new models and can be had for great prices.I only paid $110.00 from Rockbottom Golf through ebay and it works great, provides essencially the same or more information as much higher costing products and allows you to add new or modify existing points where many others will not.You can even map out and save an entire golf course yourself selecting hazards, bunkers, traps etc
for each hole.Adding additional points is fast and simple.

$REVIEW.: I have old (like 1976) midland CBs in other things so I know they don't f**** around when they build them. I only wanted this for the PA function because when you sing Karaoke through a PA while traveling at night you will never hit a deer, works great at walmart to tell people to get out of the way in the parking lot, or at stoplights to tell people in the cross walk they are crossing against the light. So anyway it is a quality CB like I have come to expect from them.

$review_text.: Bought an off brand card, knowing that I didn't really need much for my old pc but not certain it would even work to the low expectations I had
 Didn't want to spend a lot as my old pc is now not worth much more than the card, but my two little girls love to play on Friv.com so I got this hoping it would work


Boy did it work.Pros1


So cheap I was certain it would not work but it worked great.2
The antenna is really long, a great plus3


Well made card, you can tell by handling it, nothing cheap about it but the price.4
3 weeks and no lost connectivity and I get 4 bars all day long (out of 5)5


Installation was super easyCons1


No purple antenna2


Is only 150 mps, though it works perfect for the old pc its on.3


No suction cup or other means to attatch it to the wall or window

$REVIEW.: I thought I would buy this item to save on the custom case from Garmin. Although the case is well made and the quality is rather good for the price, it is just too big for the unit.  Perhaps they though that you can stuff the unit, the power cable, the mount, and suction cup in this case, but I just could not do it without disassembling everything and risk damage to the GPS unit, one would still need a case that is tailor made for the GPS unit to enable easy transportation between car, home, office, or whenever one takes the GPS unit out of the car.

$REVIEW.: It is very sturdy and sufficiently leather-like to be appealing.  The function is excellent.  The only reason that I am not giving it a full 5 stars is that the very useful hand pouch is a bit on the small side which seems to be a necessary evil given the smaller scale of the iPad mini.  Even so, it works very well -- but I find I need to take my hand out periodically.

$REVIEW.: After reading glowing reviews from numerous different sources, I decided to purchase the Nexus 7.  I really wanted a little larger screen to go with my Nexus 10, but after reading the reviews I settled on the Nexus 7.  I was extremely disappointed.  The Nexus 7 has a beautiful screen, but the touchscreen was not at all responsive.  I love to take photos with my tablet, but the camera on the Nexus is barely adequate.  The 7 inch screen was just too small also.  For a little more money I was able to buy a Samsung Galaxy Pro 8.4...the screen is better than the Nexus, the screen is larger and more responsive, and the 8MP camera takes beautiful photos!  I couldn't be happier .

$review_text.: I was looking for a camera that could produce both excellent quality photos and video, and for the most part, this camera does both of those things. The image quality that this camera produces is good, but not great. I don't find that the pictures are very sharp, but they do have good color. Maybe I could mess with the settings some more, but I have found that if I do some post editing with the photos program that comes with Windows 8.1, I can get really good results. I like to set the camera to &#34;vivid&#34; mode which makes the colors pop. I find that my previous camera, the Olympus E-PM1, produced much sharper images that seemed to be better quality, especially with the detachable flash it came with. But I find that I normally print photos at 4x6, and at that size, the pictures look comparable; its only when you view the image at actual size can you notice the sharpness difference. The Panasonic G5 does produce much less noise than the E-PM1, so that is definitely a plus. Overall, I'm pleased with the image quality as I can edit them and tweak them to my liking.When it comes to video, that camera is definitely something special. I use the 14-42mm version 1 kit lens, and the autofocus on the camera is silent and focuses very fast. The video quality that this camera produces, even in low light, absolutely makes my dedicated camcorder look amateurish. I find that the noise is very little up to ISO 3200, but I can normally shoot in a low light room at ISO 1600 and get good results. If your looking for a camcorder or camera that takes the best quality video footage, you won't find a better deal than this; the footage is so sharp and is truly amazing.I would definitely recommend this camera, especially for someone looking to take photos and videos of the family. You really cannot find a better price for the value that you receive. I'm still so impressed with the video quality that this thing produces. In fact, my sister-in-law's wedding was two weeks, and I brought the camera to the wedding. I adjusted the flash to +2 or +3 and after editing, the pictures I was able to create looked very professional. I also filmed the entire wedding, and there was also a professional camera man there. I would be willing to bet that the difference in video quality between my footage and his footage is minimal. This camera is definitely a keeper. I plan to either get the 14-42mm version 2 lens, or even the older 14-45mm lens, as I find that the older 14-42mm lens does not produce a nice and smooth zoom when filming video.My settings for video: I normally shoot in &#34;vivid&#34; mode and set the noise reductions down to negative 2 a long with the sharpness. I always like to shoot in &#34;A&#34; mode, which is aperture priority, as I can control the aperture just by using the zoom lens. When I zoom in, the aperture usually goes up to 5.6, but when I'm all the way zoomed out, it stays at 3.5, which means the maximum amount of light that the lens can allow is reaching the sensor; this is ideal for me when I record. I try to never set the ISO over 1600, unless the situation is really low light. If I'm filming outside, I normally use ISO 200-400, and if filming inside with decent lighting, I can usually get by with ISO 400-800.

found as lot of crash reports for the WD 2TB and 3TB drives


so, i decided to go for this WD 1TB HDD from

its heavy, silent and fast

looks cool and sits gorgeously on my computer table

the rubber pad helps it stay where it is on the glass top of my table
i am using this just for my daily data backup and that is very low in volume
so, i really can't tell you about the technical sides

it has been a month since i got it and still performs the same as new


i hope it stays the same in future.July 2012 update: Still running like a porsche


Great hard drive for this price

$review_text.: I selected this subwoofer after doing on line research and reading owners reviews.  Frankly, the relative low power from the amp concerned me.  I am using it in a 14x 21 ft room and on movies with low frequencies can literally rattle the windows and is not anywehrfe near max power.  So, as others have said, it provides plenty of power.  The sound is very clean and doesn't have the &#34;muddiness&#34; i hear in many home theater sound systems (including my old one).  I bought this unit to replace an aging subwoofer and if I had known the difference it would make in my sound system I would have done it years ago.  the only con is the size and it is large but since there is no woman of he house I am fine with the size.  This puppy really kicks.

$review_text.: I won't go into details about the camera - other than to say everybody else is right.  It really is a fantastic compact camera!Once I decided on this camera, I did a little price shopping and found that it's priced pretty much the same everywhere.  The only difference is that there are a couple of bundles available that sell for the same price as the bare camera - which makes this a no-brainer.For me, this particular bundle is almost perfect.  If I could make one change, I would keep these items: spare battery, 32GB SD card, SD reader, and possibly the case.  The other accessories are throw-away items as far as I'm concerned, so I would swap them for aplug-in charger like this one.That missing wall charger has got to be the biggest oversight with the DSC-RX100 camera, and I would highly recommend picking one up along with this bundle.Overall, I think this is the best compact camera on the market and I would highly recommend it!  I would also recommend picking it up as part of this bundle along with a wall plug charger.

$review_text.: I purchased this item over one month back and returned it

Just because it's not worth to use with bad video and audio output
And I changed my mind not use any more this kind of compact desktops.Pors: It is very slim and nice look


It is good to keep it as file server and small works to keep always on for home use with less power consumption.Cons: Over priced for these features


Display is not good in any resolution (low to high) you see window edges are blured and shade of window little bit


So Aero effect is not good for this graphics card

You hear audio out with noise even on HD720 resolution, it's worest in HD1080
rest of the things are good
but it's not worth with out video and audio quality to make it as internet TV and file server.I hope this review will helps to decide to go with this or not.

$review_text.: I bought one of these for two reasons... Getting line-out audio from my iPhone 3Gs to my car stereo, and charging via a standard USB cable. For both of these things, the PocketDock mini USB is the smallest, and simplest solution that I was able to find (that claimed to work with the iPhone).Pros:* The iPhone syncs and charges with a standard USB cable, one less cable in my computer bag (works perfectly with my G1 iPod nano too). To charge it in my car, I already had one of those Griffin USB car chargers, and plenty of USB cables.* Line-out sounds much cleaner, and louder, than the headphone jack. I use it with my home stereo, car stereo, boombox...* Installation in the car is cleaner; wires only coming out of one end of the device.* Does not transmit cellphone noises to my amp. The other two line out products that I tried did, and it drove me crazy.* It's small, fits in my change pocket!* I can use it without having to remove my iPhone's case!* I like the rubbery texture and the black color* Simple!Cons (why I knocked one star off of an otherwise solid product):* It's expensive for what it is, but there really aren't any other options.* Still get the "Accessory not made to work with iPhone" message, although it works perfectly. Minor annoyances, I know, but annoyances just the same.Other notes:It also comes with two cables; a stereo mini-plug to stereo-mini-plug cable, and a stereo mini-plug to RCA cable. Each cable has a nice Velcro cable tie on it, too.All-in-all, it's my favorite iPhone accessory, and I use it constantly. If I lost it, I'd probably get another.

$review_text.: I have just recently completed a home theater in my basement, and added this subwoofer as a finishing touch. The difference betweening having this sub/ not having was amazing. I had not realized how much i was missing. When the sub is turned on, even to low levels, it shakes the upper levels of the house; the subwoofer is located in a basement on a cement floor with cinderblock walls so most of the "tactical" base goes to upper levels, however with that said, it still shakes the concrete floor, and concrete is hard to move. Do not let other reviews fool you, the auto on/ off feature works great, it is sensitive enough for me, and will work fine unless you are using it at very low volumes, which i do not recomend because you will not get the earth shacking bass from it.Pros: amazing bass, many adjustments, clean apearance, power indicator on frontCons: size; larger that appears in picture, auto on/off (only noticable at LOW levels)Used with Sony STR-DH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver, 945 WattsI would recomend this product to a friend

$REVIEW.: In my car, I play my music through my iPhone 3GS.  I have a dash-mounted holder for the iPhone so that I can control my music without having to look down.  Problem was, I had 1 cable (USB charger) connected to the bottom of the iPhone, while another cable (3.5mm audio) connected to the top of the device for music.  Both cables would terminate in the middle console (underneath the arm rest).  Needless to say, the cables were in the way and did not look clean.  That's when I started researching other options and came across this Neewer Apple Dock Connector.On one end, this cable connects to the bottom of my iPhone which is held in the dash-mounted holder.  On the opposite end, the USB tip terminates into a Griffin Powerjolt Dual Universal USB Charger, while the 3.5mm audio tip connects to my car's auxiliary port, both located in the center console underneath the arm rest.Positive Reviews* I am pleased to report that this cable works very well with my setup.  The length and color of the cable is perfect.  When I start the car and plug the cable to my iPhone, the audio works perfectly every time.* As a bonus, the quality and clarity of the music has actually improved since I began using this cable.  Reason being, which I learned from other users here, when you play music through the iPhone's audio port, the music passes through the device's equalizer.  Add my vehicle's own equalizer to the mix and you can see how the music might not be 100%.  In comparison, when the music is played through the device's charging port, the music is not affected by the device's equalizer, hence the improved quality.Negative Reviews* My iPhone does not always recognize the cable as a phone charger.  When I start the car, the audio works every time, but the phone does not always switch to Charge Mode.  I have to unplug and plug the cable back in a few times for the Charge Mode to take effect.  I have tried two different USB chargers with the same results.  iPhone has not experienced this issue with other cables, and it has the latest OS. This is definitely not a deal closer for me, but more of an minor inconvenience.  But given the cleaner look of using only 1 cable, and the bonus of improved music quality, this is something I'm willing to live with.* The other minor issue is the quality of the cable.  While having to unplug and replug the USB-end of the cable a few times, the cable's protective layer started coming out of the USB-tip.  Again, this is only a minor issue as it was purely cosmetic.  Given the price, I ended up ordering a 2nd cable as a backup.  If you do order this cable, just be aware that it needs to be handled lightly.Vehicle Description:2007 BMW 335iYes - Aux AudioNo - iDriveNo - USBConnected Device:Iphone 3GS (Deactivated but used as iPod listening device)

I bought 2 iPad 4's... one for me, one for my wife.  I was successful in getting 2 of the cables to work, though it is so-so... it will work if and when it wants to.  When I went to bed, my iPad was at 55% charge.  After charging for 5 hours, my iPad wasn't at full charge.  I took one of the cables to work, plugged it in to my new docking station and the cable wasn't charging the iPad.  I tried to remove the connector from the docking station, and couldn't!!!  The wire broke free from the connector, and a pair of pliers will be required to remove the connector from the USB port.  BEYOND A WASTE OF MONEY!!!

$REVIEW.: I gave this item four stars because for some reason the USB dongle seems to prefer one port on my 13&#34; MacBook Air over the other


When plugged into one, it doesn't find the tablet for some time, or not at all


Use the other port, it pops right up

Odd

Also, the battery never shows 100% and the charge indicator light has turned green only once since I've had it on the charger


I feel like the battery doesn't have its full potential
I am inclined to buy another battery for comparison sake
Other than those two points, the device works well for me

It makes perfect sense to use this device in my workflow, especially when I am traveling.

$REVIEW.: My out of the box complaint is "Where's the WiFi?", for a device that costs this much they should add the chip in, it couldn't possibly add more than $5 to the cost of the device. Fortunately, I found a great, compatible, inexpensive and very small usb wifi adapter for under $20. TheAirLink101 AWLL6075 Wireless N Mini USB Adapterworked like a charm for me and I highly recommend it.Next I tried using the DNLA connection to browse photos and videos from my computer. Since it doesn't read my camera's RAW files, I was limited to exported photos only... that's expected but disappointing. What wasn't expected was how bad playback of AVCHD videos were over WiFi. I know this device is relatively unique in that it does play them on the fly, but it didn't buffer right, dropped lots of frames and the audio was horrible. The saving grace however, is that this has a 1 TB hard drive, so if you copy the videos over first, they actually play pretty well. I'm not crazy about having to drill up and down folders with a basic remote control, but it's workable.The services are a mixed bag, some are good (YouTube), some are okay but better on other systems (Netflix), some I will never use (blockbuster), some are too awkward to really use in anything other than desperation (Facebook). But with all these services (which may change from time to time based on firmware updates)... Where is the Amazon on Demand service? It's the one missing service that would possibly make my usage go from every now and then to look at old family videos to several times a week. It would also make me more likely to try other services and generally use the box more.Finally, it's a bit of an ugly duckling... It has all the parts to be a beautiful swan (open standards, hard drive, etc.), but between the rudimentary remote (they should have built a good dedicated smart phone app to control it) and the traditional file system that's awkward to use without a keyboard and mouse... it still very rough around the edges.

$review_text.: This is a great little system  --a big sound from a small package.  The bar is low profile  and the sub-woofer sits nice to the side. No clutter of multiple cables and speakers spread out all over the room. (see my set up in customer image photo I posted above ) This is  just a very nice, simple upgrade from your TV's speakers.This is easy to set up (be sure to useAmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging), easy to use, and sounds great.I use this 80% of the time for TV viewing, 10% movie viewing & 10% gaming. This system has  pre-set sound modes for each.  I like the preset levels  --no having to set up the sound fields & make a lot of speaker adjustments,  just plug and play.I've read many negative reviews here that do not seem to be fair.  THIS IS NOT A $800.00  7.1 CHANNEL HOME THEATER SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM.  This IS a very nice Sound-bar system - not a 6 speaker surround system.  If you want a true theater experience sound you will probably be disappointed too.  This is what it is, a TV speaker upgrade.PROS*easy to setup*easy to use*small size -a real space saver*nice full sound & good bassCONS*a little pricey______________________________PS: Don't get ripped off buying $50+ HDMI cables.  Amazon Basics (see the above link) work fine.
$SUMMARY.: A great little, simple system.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mini panda potable speaker for my ipod touch. I thought it would be fun to take my little speaker to the beach or the park. The great thing about this speaker  it is light weight and easy to carry around in my  purse. The speaker play great  sound and the bass is out of this world. The volume is average, not to loud and to low. The only bad thing about this speaker,is  it eats batteries like crazy, You will get 3 hours of play and then your have get new batteries. It uses 3 triple A batteries, give it a try you might like it. The speaker is cute and I think little kids and teenagers will love this.

$REVIEW.: I was very pleased to receive this laptop case for review. It has a sleeker, more streamlined design than many of the chunky, bulky cases I've seen. It offers plenty of space not only for the computer but for cords, flash drives and wireless cards, and other accessories, with space for pens, notebooks, and other items such as books or snacks, yet without adding needless bulk. On a business trip or attending a conference or training, one could conceivably skip the purse and get by with just this.

$REVIEW.: Just got my OPPO BDP-93 this week. I wish I had a more in-depth rewiew to give but I'll tell you what I think in the short time that I've had it. I have a 73" Mitsubishi HD tv that needed more than what your average store bought Blu ray players could offer. I've had Samsung, Toshiba, and Sony players hooked up to it and none of them could do any justice for such a large screen and I knew that a higher-end Blu ray player with a real video processor built in is what I needed. I had been holding off for OPPO to release a new player that had Netflix streaming so I jumped on this player as soon as Amazon offered it. I couldn't be happier. Fast load times for Blu ray discs, excellent streaming quality, sweet picture and sound. What a difference in picture quality with Blu ray and DVD's. My wife popped in Toy Story DVD and I thought it was our Toy Story 3 Blu ray at first because the picture looked so awesome. Even lower quality DVD's such as the seasons of E.R. on DVD (which are fairly low quality and beat up from Netflix) looked muuuucccchhhh better, and I must add that audio quality sounds improved also. This thing is built like a tank and I couldn't believe how heavy it was, even the  back-lit remote has a ton of beef to it! Packaging is top-notch and OPPO also included a beast of a HDMI cable as a nice added touch. Bottom line... you get what you pay for and I am not disappointed in my $499 investment. If you have a huge TV like me and you want to make the most of your home theater experience then I think you will be very pleased with this player. I'm also jazzed about the DVD Audio and SACD capability and I can't wait to score some discs to try out. I hope this review helps you.

$review_text.: When we bought our HP DesignJet, the adapter was very pricey, so we went with the included USB port and hooked it up to a random PC that happened to be nearby.  Sometimes that PC is not on for one reason or another, or somebody has &#34;upgraded&#34; it and forgotten to set the printer drivers up - not a big deal, but annoying when all you want to do is print.Putting the printer directly on the network eliminated the issues of having to be right next to the server computer and makes the printer readily available to everyone in the office.Setup is a little awkward - there is no way from the front panel of the printer to set the IP address - you have to find out what it came up with from DHCP then go to the built-in web page to change it.  Other than having to figure that out setup was simple.

$REVIEW.: Product packaging allowed the protectors to be damaged in shipping, renderings all 3 of them useless
 But that is a separate issue from the actual protector itself
 I have used many screen protectors and several from Tech Armor which I was thoroughly impressed with, but I would have to rate this one as &#34;OK&#34;


 It's not bad, but it's not great either.Keep in mind, we're literally talking about a product where .5-1mm of difference makes all the difference so do don't think this won't fit on your phone and look perfectly acceptable to the average user looking for a screen protector, because it will
 My sole issue with the performance of the product itself (and this is a big one for me) is that the tolerances are too loose on the outer edges of the protector and the size of the cutouts.The overall size of the protector is a little small in my opinion, leaving a bit too much of a bezel around the protector


 This is obviously necessary to keep people from getting bubbles around the edge and corner of the protector and I'm sure the manufacturer had to make a judgement call here since lets face it there are not a whole lot of people patient enough to really try for that exact fit.The same is true with the cutouts


 Because they gave you more &#34;wiggle room&#34; on the edges, the cutouts had to therefore be just a bit larger than they needed to be so it was for forgiving if you didn't hit the dead center when applying it

 This allows the less accurate applicant to &#34;walk&#34; the protector left, right, up or down from true center and not have the protector partially covering their speaker grill, light sensor or front facing camera.My personal opinion, and this goes back to the &#34;average user&#34; comment above, is that those individuals that are purchasing a Nexus device are probably a little more fastidious about these sorts of things so while it would definitely do the job it is advertising, I think there are probably higher-quality, better fitting protectors out there that an Android enthusiast would probably be more interested in taking the time to apply versus this one.I hope this helps.



$SUMMARY.: Good protector for the average user, perfectionists may take issue however...

$review_text.: Purchased to replace my old Harmony One. Three stars because this is by far the most confusing, difficult, setup process imaginable. And I am a long term Harmony user and fan. Startup guide is inaccurate and completely useless, online instructions and FAQ meaningless or don't even address setting up the hum with your wifi, etc. Tells you to connect the remote to you PC and that isn't even possible. In this package, the Hub is actually the &#34;remote&#34; you connect and set up; you do nothing with the remote control itself. How could they miss that &#34;minor&#34; point. Absolutely unacceptable for a company that has made these devices for so long. Took one hour to set up and, as I said, I am an existing Harmony remote user.Having said that, after finally figuring most of it our by myself, the remote, Hub and app work as advertised. I find the android app to be in need of a better interface, but the devices actually respond a bit quicker than when using the remote. The remote has a nice feel in the hand and although very basic, has all you really need. Would be nice if it were backlit, but otherwise no complaints. The Hub and one IR blaster (included) controls 4 devices that I have on 3 different shelves stacked above each other. That's impressive. Improve the app interface and I would easily give it a 4. backlight and clear instructions would make it a 5.

$review_text.: These protectors are the nice, thick material, anti-glare style, and cut quite nicely


 They go on smoothly, and as long as you're in a dust-free area, the bubbles are easily smoothed out.Those of you looking for something for your ATIV PCs, I can recommend these as a solution (although this item is NOT "designed for" that line)


 I bought these for my ATIV 500T, since I couldn't find anything closer in stock, and reasoned that the S7T is "close"

 The ATIV 500T screen is slightly larger than these protectors, but the cutouts are still perfect
 So I've got one on my 500T, and there is about a 3mm border around the physical glass edge where these protectors don't cover, of course, but the entire visible portion of the screen is very well-covered, and the screen looks very beautiful through this film
 And the 3mm border very nicely leaves the speakers uncovered as well


 So this turns out to be a pretty good fit for the 500T even though, again, it is NOT designed for that line!All in all, excellent product, excellent seller, and will be buying again for my upcoming ATIV Pro 700T as well!


$SUMMARY.: Very nice.  Not bad on the ATIV line either!

$review_text.: When I first hooked up this TV the picture was not to my liking
 I then went through the menu and discovered I could really adjust the picture to my liking with the many options available

 I watched the new avatar 3d Blu-ray DVD in both 3d and 2d and I was astounded at the clarity and verve of the 3d presentation (I used one of the four 3d passive glasses included in the box)

 The smart apps worked well and since I am an amazon prime member I started watching some of the free videos on this set
 I like the two-sided remote  and the fact that both my 3d player (also vizio) and the TV work in unison
 All in all it was great bang for the buck!

$review_text.: Typing on it is great.  Very quick response - usually.  I have found it begins to lag (like the RAM is bogging down?) so I found if I unplug and reconnect the tab it returns to normal (kind of ridiculous to have to do that periodically - and so far that's only been in QuickOffice Word).  The Mail key annoyingly only opens the Corporate Mail app and cannot be programmed to open Gmail.  How odd on a Google device.  My only other complaint as with other reviewers, the shape including the area that holds the tab in place makes it somewhat big and difficult to pack in a bag.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and love all the convenient keys that operate other parts of the tab.  I love how the keyboard docks the tab and doesn't require a special stand to use the tab with it.  Just really wish I could get the Mail key to open Gmail.  An HDMI port associated would also be nice...

$review_text.: This is my third Nexus 7 tablet


I bought two of the original Nexus 7 2012 tablets for my wife and myself
My wife loves hers and constantly has to charge it because she uses it so much more than her laptop


She currently is still using it and has no complaints.I reset mine to factory defaults and gave it to my friend's son as a gift, so I bought the newest 2013 version as a replacement
Just as before when I bought my 2012 Nexus, I considered the Ipad mini first


The 32GB mini is more than $200 more expensive, but for me, that isn't the reason I chose the Nexus 7 over the Ipad mini for the second time
The main reason is that I'm just tired of Apple's dumbed down devices
I own an iPhone 4 and I have tried out a a few iPads that belonged to my friends and each time, I still find them boring, impractical and restricting
I won't even go into the mess that is iTunes, which is possibly the worst program I have ever had the displeasure of using.As of right now, there are 3,270 reviews of this product, so I'm not going to add much more here, as it may never be read anyway
I have access to my entire movie library from my home pc via the Plex app and I have all all of my music installed on the Nexus, by syncing my music on my pc, uploading to Amazon's MP3 cloud player app, and then downloading to my Nexus.I can also use it for anything I need to work with using Chrome mobile,Google Drive, Gmail, Chrome Remote Desktop, Terminal Emulator,Connect Bot and Hip Chat apps

Given the specs of this tablet and the free range of being able to do anything I want with it, for me the choice was simple.

$REVIEW.: I had been a little behind the times as far as getting a flat screen TV even though I had (and didn't realize it) an Onyko HDMI 7.1 amplifier.  My 36" Panasonic TV went out and I was hesitant about purchasing a flat screen because of the cost.  I ended getting a great deal on a 50" Panasonic 1080 plasma.  I have cable and initially just had the TV hooked to the HD cable box through the coax cable connection.  Then a friend told me that I needed to get the HDMI cables if I really wanted to get the most out of the TV.  He had an extra one he brought over that I used to test by hooking up the cable box and my Panasonic blu-ray player to the TV (I was using the RCA cables before); the picture was outstanding; amazing!That's when I realized I could hook all my components through the receiver with HDMI cables.  I immediately went to Wal-Mart and found the HDMI cable prices to be outrageous!  My friend suggested another place and I told him if I got one at a cheaper price, he would reimburse me (lol).  Well, after all that I came home, got on amazon.com and discovered Mediabridge products.  Not only were they about 75% less, after reading and comparing specs, I found they were much better!  I initially ordered what I thought were two 6 ft cables (I thought the two ends in the picture meant two cables, lol), but it was only one; in total I've now ordered nine 6 ft cables and one 25 ft  cable to hook my laptop to my TV.  As the title states, Mediabridge has the best HDMI cables on the market, bar none!  And on top of all that, the shipping time is excellent!  Each time I've ordered, instead of the products coming 5-8 business days as stated, I've received them in 3 business days!  Excellent product, excellent customer service!

$review_text.: OK, I realize that as soon as you buy into the Sony NEX system, everything gets pretty expensive... but... sheesh!... this is essentially a thicker/stiffer version of a cell phone screen protector that you can get on eBay for all of a couple of bucks.  That's really my only complaint: The price is much higher than I'd expect, even given the Sony NEX branding.Now, as to the performance... while I haven't tried the other screen protectors as the other reviewer has, it does work just fine: It looks sharp, goes on easily, adheres quite well (but not so well you can't remove it if you need to reposition it), and looks as though it really will protect the LCD from anything up to about 25 grit sandpaper.While the instructions suggest lining up the upper left edge of the protector with the edge of the LCD, I found that leaves the protector a bit to the left of center -- I suggest using the left and right borders of the LCD (which is ever-so-slightly narrower than the screen protector's transparent portion) and equalizing their widths to establish the true center.I didn't see this product on Sony's web site, but I think it's a better idea that the one they show that's a thicker plastic that snaps around the edges of the LCD: That one doesn't appear to form an air-tight seal to the screen, so small particles such as sand might still manage to sneak underneath and scratch the LCD, plus I don't think it looks as nice, adding a bit to the camera body's thickness.  (With this protector the tallest part on the back of the camera is still the ridges on the jog dial -- although by no more than a millimeter, I think!)
$SUMMARY.: Works fine, but the price..
wow!

$review_text.: When I purchased an alarm clock/radio with an iPod dock, I found out my iPhone 4 with the Otter Box Defender case would not fit in the dock.  If this happens to you, you have a couple of options.  One would be to find a different case (probably a slim, silicone only case).  This defeats the purpose of purchasing a highly protective case (and expensive case) in the first place.  A second option would be to remove the phone from the case each time you would to dock it.  This would be just a pain to disassemble and reassemble each time you dock and remove the phone.Fortunately my research led me to the docXtender!  In my eyes the docXtender Extension Cable was the third and best option; though I had my doubts about how well it would work from reading some of the other reviews.  I've not had my docXtender for over a month and it is working great.Why should you consider docXtender Premium Extension cable?  Unlike some of the other cables sold on Amazon:1) the docXtender Extension cable works fits the iPhone 4 with the Otter Box Defender case without any need to modify the cable connector.2) the docXtender Extension cable charges the iPhone 4 as well as passes audio from the phone to your docking station.3) the docXtender Extension cable allows your audio device to pass controls (play/pause/skip forward/skip back) back to the iPhone allowing you the convenience of controlling the ipod function on your phone via remoteThe only problem I have encountered is a periodic message about the device not being optimized for the iPhone.  Since I get this messages maybe once every 10 times I dock, I believe it is related to how well the extension cable is connected to the clock/radio.  After reseating the cable to the dock, the message goes away for some time.If you are in the market for an extension cable for you iPod or iPhone, I truly believe this cable is worth the few extra dollars.

$review_text.: I'm giving away my Chromecast because of this product.  I've now bought three of these, and all three of my HDTVs will have one.  Two of these TVs are Smart TVs, but the choice of apps are limited (One is Vizio -- good, and one is Samsung -- better).  It's a little bit frustrating to realize that I could have saved a lot of money by buying streaming sticks instead of paying extra for Smart TVs, but that's the way the bytes crumble, I guess.  There are a number of channels that Roku has that I love to watch, where I was only using Netflix before.  Warner Archive and Acorn TV are my two favorite channels, and well worth the small subscription fees.The only slight negative is that the streaming stick is a tiny bit slow to start up, but that's minor.

$review_text.: I purchased this unit and replaced the internal 16GB M.2 SSD with a 128GB model.  This laptop works quite nicely for those of us who like to get our hands dirty.  It comes with Google Chrome but there are google-able instructions on how to adjust it to boot a non-chrome OS.  Ubuntu linux should work pretty much out of the box.I purchased the unit to get BSD running on it.  I'm hacking DragonFlyBSD into shape and solved the boot loader and keyboard issues and am working on the mouse pad.  X runs fine in VESA mode (so great for 2D), sans the mouse pad which I am still working on.  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and so forth will not current boot due to numerous fixable issues but I assume that since I got them fixed in DragonFly, that the other BSD's will be able to get them fixed too.For developers I suggest loading a couple of 16G usb sticks.  Load one with the Chrome recovery image (google-able to get it), one with your favorite OS, and consider purchasing an internal M.2 form-factor SSD to upgrade the 16G internals.  The case is *trivial* to take apart... just a lot of screws and simple snap-tight after that (be sure to break the warranty seal can unscrew the screw under it).  With the recovery image in-hand you can feel free to blow away the internal SSD... if you mess up and get stuck you can always reload it from the recovery image.The only downside when running non-chrome OSs is that the laptop boots up with a BIOS warning screen that you have to hit ctrl-L to get past.  There's no way to get rid of it short of mod'ing the HW which I do not suggest.  However, I am not going to dock it a star for that one issue.  Also note that there are only 2 USB ports and *no* hard ethernet... you have to use the built-in wireless adapter (it's an Atheros AR9460).This laptop has a pretty nice display for its small size.  With DragonFly it pulls 7.1 watts idle with the lid closed and ~8W with it open (and DragonFly isn't power-savings-optimized).  That's with the wifi turned on... so not bad at all.  The laptop has a Celeron(R) 2955U @ 1.40GHz (haswell) class cpu in it... considerably faster than the atom-based netbooks of old!  For comparison, this cpu is about 5x slower on a per-core basis than a 3.4GHz desktop I7, and has 2 cores (so about 15x slower than a 4-core/8-thread 3.4GHz I7).  Which is not bad at all considering that the whole laptop only pulls 8 watts from the wall.The unit has 2G of ram.  The OS is able to use ~1.7GB of it.  Keep in mind that with a bigger SSD inside you can set up a SSD swap partition on it, and at 300MB/sec+ and no random seek overhead, the 2G of ram is not a big deal.-Matt
$SUMMARY.: Can be used to load other OS's

$REVIEW.: I too was skeptical of this item.  I have an electronic device that has an Ethernet port, but no wireless connection (A Slingbox) and I wanted to run it in my basement so that I could connect my cable box up to it and get digital channels.  I bought the Netgear adapters, plugged things in, and it just worked.  I even plugged the receiving end into a powerstrip (which isn't recommended), but it still works just fine.  The connection is much faster than my Internet connection, so I can surf the web at the same speed that I'm used to.I highly recommend this item for hard-to-wire locations or for devices that don't have a wireless option.

$REVIEW.: A few days ago my Samsung 55 inch HDTV simply stop working, the lower led's were damage and the tv just turn off by itself. Well, I have no other option to buy a new TV set. After some research between the few models that are right now on the market and watching a couple of store units in full 4K glory I decided to get the XBR55X850. By the way, I got  this TV in a Sony promotion that include a Sony Xperia Z Tablet and (4) mastered 4K BD movies. Anyway I went home and started hooking my TV with the HT, Oppo and PS4, then I did some picture calibration that took me almost 2 hours. One more hint, if you're gonna use this set with a Oppo player I really suggest to set the output mode on the Oppo to "source direct" that will feed the signal directly to the tv and let the 55X850 handle the upscaling process. To my surprise, the Sony X850 it much better doing this process of upscaling.The results? Well, this is a great UHD TV but picture quality is a bit better than watching any normal 1080P so don't spect any UltraHD miracle to happen even with HD channels, some will look better than others. I'm sure results will be the same or similar on any other 4K TV set, keep in mind that this is Sony second generation 4K technology, eventually it will improve over the time. In my opinion the problems is the lack of 4k native content that the technology needs to show it's colors. Hey, is like having a Ferrari without the key to drive it, this is the price you pay for been an early adopter and I'm sure every owner of a 4K TV is hungry for new content.Back to this TV set,1080P BluRay movies will really benefit from the screen higher resolution, even the 4k mastered films will look much better but remember they are 1080P movies coming from a 4K mastered source, but is not 4K native. Remember those Super-Bit discs back in the DVD era, you get the idea. For those of you who like Sony Motionflow refresh rate I have to say this is the best tv set I have seen so far, eliminating the famous "halo effect" or any other artifact making the picture look smooth & slick as butter. Now, watching some 4K Native clips on YouTube by using the tv internal app was another experience, image was freaking sharp with excellent display of jaw dropping colors. Speaking of colors the Triluminos display does really makes the colors pop, is like a bag of Skittles that looks vivid and natural but not over saturated. Also the X850 is really good handling black levels not as good as a Plasma but almost as good as the famous XBR-HX950, just pop in a copy of The Dark Knight and go the scene where Batman is at the top of a skyscraper in Shanghai, you will love the deep blacks and high contrast. On the gaming side, all my PS4 games looked amazing and Forza 5 on the Xbox One is simply awesome. So far I have seen no lag on screen just make sure you select Game (Scene). The audio on this unit is very good but not great, it also has an equalizer and HDMI output level which will let you tweak the audio at your desire. The XBR850A also has HDMI 2.0 support, also the new firmware download is now available, now it supports 4K at 60hz/50hz. So far I have not any clouding or LED bleeding issue, I guess I'm lucky. In my opinion 4K is intended for bigger screens but overall the XBR55X850 is an excellent 4K TV I will enjoy for few more yearsHere are my TV settings (with the Oppo BDP-103)Picture Mode: Cinema 1Backlight: 9Picture: 95Brightness: 51Color: 52Hue: G1Color Temperature: NeutralSharpness: 51Noise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffDot Noise Reduction: AutoReality Creation: ManualMastered 4K: OnVideo Area Detection: OnResolution: 66Noise Filtering: 3 (or your preference if you like a more softer picture)Smooth Gradation: LowMotionflow: Smooth (or your preference)CineMotion: AutoAdvanced Settings:Black Corrector: LowAdv.

It came in two days (prime member) as promised by Amazon

I had no idea how the pictures and video would come out

It far exceeded my wildest dreams
The video is easy to use; has so many settings on it, that it worked great outside, inside and underwater
I am not that technology gifted, and I could use it easily


It is totally waterproof

Believe me, I had my doubts, and sure enough, it took fantastic underwater pictures


My friends couldn't believe that they were real


I took beautiful pictures of scenery and pictures of my friends and this camera is truly amazing


The zoom is wonderful, and the pictures are clear.I upgraded my memory card to a 32GB and had no problem with taking over 200 pictures and many videos

I also bought the Wasabi battery charger with extra batteries


I would recommend that if you are going on a trip.It is a little heavier than your quick aim and shoot cameras, but then again, it takes amazing pictures and is waterproof

I used the underwater setting, which uses the flash and my pics are perfect


In clear water and bright sunshine, you probably don't need the flash, but it was recommended by our captain on our snorkeling cruise.I bought the Chum float so I wouldn't lose my camera if I accidentally dropped it under the water in the ocean

It supported my camera fine

I also bought a strap to attach it to my float, and had no problem swimming anywhere with the current

I did not use the strap that came with it


Wish it would have had a normal camera strap and case.Pentax had them on back order, and didn't know when they could ship one
Amazon had them in stock for a great price.I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!

It is a accelerated charger, but at less than half the price.The product arrived quickly, was boxed well, and seems to be well constructed.  The cord is thick and strong, and long enough for me to put the device on my table and plug it into a wall plug near the floor.The charger works absolutely as well as the charger you have to purchase for your kindle devices.  It charged mine within 4 hours.  Normally a 8 hour process.  It has a light on it to show that it is plugged in correctly, and it seems to run less hot than the amazon charger.We have also used this to charge cell phones and other devices and it has worked perfectly.I highly recommend this product, I have no qualms about it.  I have been using my first one for months and just bought another one because we have several devices now that need to be charged.A good alternative accelerated charger.  All one piece, so you do not have to look for the parts to connect them and to charge the device.I love the selection of electronics on Amazon, my favorite company to do business with.  You can find so many great chargers and accessories that are hard to locate elsewhere.  Totally satisfied

$REVIEW.: Arctic Silver 5 is the best thermal compound on the market


There are other types that might be better for specific purposes (Arctic C&eacute;ramique for example), but for cooling a CPU, this is the best

I've used it extensively for quite a few computer builds as well as a few 'special projects' like replacing the thermal compound on an Asus Formula X48 motherboard's Northbridge and Southbridge heatsinks.The results are always a 4-10c drop in CPU temperatures under load
You will not notice a huge difference at idle


The real gains in heat dissipation come when the CPU is being pushed

Also, don't trust the board maker's proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like RealTemp 2.41 or Everest for free (use google to find them)
Either will give you more accurate numbers than Asus PC Probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.There are some saying Arctic Silver 5 didn't lower their temperatures


That is almost certainly because they're using it incorrectly, which I can understand since the instructions provided are minimally useful


So for those of you who are not familiar with applying thermal paste, here is the process:1
Remove the old thermal compound

This is accomplished by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste
I recommend purchasing anArctiClean kit
For minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer


Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds


You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with
Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.2

Apply a surface cleaner


You can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit


Make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.3


Apply Arctic Silver 5


DO NOT USE TOO MUCH! If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the CPU locking mechanism, your hands, etc..
It makes a real mess


Start with a small amount and add more if necessary

The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface

A toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around
You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done
Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.4

Install your heat sink and fan assembly
I recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by Intel are notoriously poor
Zalman makes some great ones

Do NOT buy one that uses push pins to lock in place
You want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your CPU

This is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.If you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps


Just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf

The compound simply allows for a much better transfer of heat from chip-->heatsink


I swear by Arctic Silver, and I promise you it works if you use it correctly.

$SUMMARY.: Perfect for cooling any CPU

$REVIEW.: This camera is amazing for its size and price. 10X optical zoom in a thin body! Full HD videos, super fast, light weight... I am very pleased. I have been looking for a nice small camera for a while but they were either too pricey (at least the ones with the features I wanted, such as at least 10X optical zoom) or a bit heavy... I am glad I waited for this one. Great pictures in low light as well. Good job, Sony!!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome little camera!

$review_text.: After reading the reviews of the Tailgater I admit that I had concerns. I was looking for something for my travel trailer and already had a Dish Network account so I decided to give it a try. However, I called Dish Network and talked with them about the pros and cons of the system. The basics were: it would cost 7 dollars per month to keep it on all the time or turn it on and off as needed and only pay a fraction of the 7.00. Also, if you let them know where you are, they will beam you the local channels. I ordered oneWhen I received the system, I went straight to the travel trailer and set it up. I had not yet called to turn on the receiver but it found the sats within 3 minutes and immediately downloaded updated firmware (mind you I have not yet activated the receiver). I then called Dish and they authorized the receiver and Viola! Simple enough. Called several days later and asked them to turn it off....they did. All very simple.The ONLY thing I do not like about the system is the loops to lock the dish down for security. They are thin plastic. I fixed this by looping a cable through the opening of the base and handle. I also wish the receiver were smaller, but that is just a preference.The bottom line is that you can't go wrong with this system. I don't know what others are doing to cause problems noted on their reviews, but it couldn't be easier to set up and operate. It's about as worry free as you can get. Buy one!

I don't have to have lens caps with the Cannon name stamped on for twice the price of Fotodiox Lens Caps.Theses caps work as they should, and I am very pleased with my purchase, and so far I have replaced all of my lens caps with Fotodiox and will be back for more!

$review_text.: I bought this to play Torchlight (diabloesque) and Dragon Age (RPG) while lounging on my couch and it works great.  I'm givin' it 5 stars because its 90% awesome and one of my  two complaints is fixable w/a little hardware hacking :)PROS:-Mapping buttons to keys is easy to do and the included software is intuitive, it detected a couple games on my machine but I don't have any RTS or MMORPG (anymore) on my machine which are probably the main uses for this guy.-I can comfortably rest my wrist on it with my thumb in joystick position and have three fingers (not pinky) on the 2nd row from the top of keys which is pretty good ergonomics, my pinky winds up on the far left third row.-Speaking of ergonomics the keys press down with not too much force, I wouldn't say effortlessly (which i would prefer) but they're ok, the real win is the joystick which requires very little force to move around with your thumbCON:-The key layout could use some work.  The problem here is all 4 rows are laid out as lines, this works fine on a keyboard where you wrist 'floats' but on this device where your wrist is ment to rest in one spot it sucks to have to move your hand to hit many of the buttons.  The buttons should be laid out in 4 arcs around your fingers, in the current layout about 1/3 of the buttons require you to move your wrist.-The other problem is there is no physical indication of where your fingers are on the device, all the keys feel the same and there are no nubs or bumps to help you orient your fingers, there is one key in the middle which has a very slight depression on it but its unnoticeable.  My solution was to take some sticky-backed velcro (the soft half) and cut little 1cm squares out and stick them down a row of 4 buttons where my middle finger rests so I can orient my hand on all 4 rows.OTHER THOUGHTS:-I tried a similar device from Belkin out at the store.  I put them side by side and fiddled with them a bit, the Belkin had better feeling keypresses but the joystick was so _so_ stiff by comparison.
$review_summary.: Great product especially for gaming from the couch!  RSI friendly too.

 However, after 2 weeks, I noticed that the screen had little keyboard marks from closing the computer when the light caught the screen just right and that bugged me more than just making sure I didn't eat and use my laptop at the same time.

$REVIEW.: Can't really find any CONS for this, other than the price...  but when you consider how much Samsung charges for their proprietary Tectiles...  well the price of these little babies becomes a PRO.  Also the included sticker labels was surprising nice, would've preferred to have writable blank ones.Btw, I use these using the Samsung Tectile app on both a Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2 as well as on a HTC Amaze...  YES it works with the HTC Amaze using the Samsung Tectile app, I am glad Samsung decided not to lock their app to their devices only.  If you want to use another 3rd party NFC Launcher, try AnyTAG NFC Launcher by XtraSEC.  If ever Samsung locks down their NFC app to only samsung devices, AnyTAG will be able to handle everything and then some.So far I've only used 3 tags each of which does the followingHome - Wifi on | BT off | Audio on FullCar - Wifi off | BT on | Dailyroads Manager appWork - Wifi on | BT on | Brightness low | Vibrate

I have trouble imagining a different VGA cable (or an HDMI) improving the picture noticeably beyond what this cable gives you.My only problem is I can't get the screws to retract completely

My laptop has no spot for the screws to be inserted into, and without the ability to completely retract them the screws push against the side of the laptop and make the VGA connection even more tenuous than it would have been otherwise.Still, the picture looks great, and as long as I keep the laptop completely stationary the connection works good enough

I'd recommend this cable for the price.

First one must log into the Sony web site and create an account and then register your unit with a special number you must find..

where is it? Then you must go to the Net Flix site and log in and register the magic number from the DVD player..


where is that number to be found..
then you must update the DVD player's operating system..
if your lucky it will work but then again...Mine would work on Net Flix about once in 15 tries then it could crash.Returned it after a week of trying to get it to work..

Luckily working with Amazon is painless so it was a quick and easy swap.The second unit booted right up and has been smooth ever since. I'm using a single 3TB Seagate drive right now (I'll add a second one in a few months) with no issues.Polkast works wonderfully for remote access to content and the DLNA server works well too. We had 2 1080p streams going while I was still copying over media from my computer last night without any hiccups or issues. I'm not loving TWONKY so I'll be installing Plex tonight. A link to Plex instructions for the NSA 325 are here [...]I know there are lots of bad reviews and I think Zyxel has some quality control issues, but if you stick it out to find one that works, it's phenomenal for the money.Update: I'm a few week in with it and this is a great little NAS. All functions are working well including Plex. I've been able to run 3 HD streams at a time (I would try more but that's all the TV's/Tablets I have). Very stable and easy to use.

So this Belkin USB hub was perfect
It's small, cheap, and simple.If I could have one gripe, it's that the cord attached to the hub is too short
I'd say it's around 4 inches long

But it's not a big deal.Right now I have my wireless USB mouse, a portable speaker, a USB flash drive, and my smartphone all hooked up to it and working seamlessly.There's a small red light on it to indicate power.That's about all there is to it


You plug it in to a USB port, then plug up to 4 things into the hub
