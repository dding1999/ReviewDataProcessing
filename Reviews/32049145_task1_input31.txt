$REVIEW.: These stories are fantastic for many reasons, they are a steampunk lover's dream with interesting and never before seen gadgets, and plenty of them, plus airships and pirates not to mention a kick ass but reluctant heroine, and shady but handsome hero all in a setting that is so far away from stuffy Victorian London that it lends a totally new and refreshing feel to the steampunk genre. I can not wait to read the rest of these exciting adventures!

$REVIEW.: Rating: 4.5 starsJake Undone is the kind of book that simultaneously puts a goofy smile on your face while making you contemplate violence because of how messed up the situation becomes. Penelope Ward has completely outdone herself with her second novel. Not only does she make you completely fall in love with Jake Green, tattooed, pierced, nerdy engineer, but  she keeps you on your toes by throwing one thing after another at you that you had no idea to expect. This book is exactly what I want from a New Adult book. It is the perfect blend of angst, sexual tension and romance.Let&#8217;s start with some back story. This is a companion novel to GEMINI, Penelope&#8217;s first book. However, you absolutely in no way need to read that book to read this one. The stories are completely separate from one another. The only connection being that Jake is Allison&#8217;s half-brother. However, if you have read Gemini, it is a nice treat to get to see where Allison and Cedric are in the future, since this book takes place a good eight years after the end of Gemini.So Nina is a young twenty-two year old attempting to step out of her comfort zone and live her life, despite some of her&#8230;phobias. She moves to Brooklyn to live with her brother&#8217;s best friend and his two other roommates. Little does she know that one of those roommates is Jake Green. A guy that completely captivates her and who she is instantly attracted to. A guy who on the surface looks total bad boy, but underneath it all is extremely smart, caring and loyal to a fault.Pretty much the first half of the book is Jake and Nina getting to know one another and it is totally entirely from Nina&#8217;s POV. All the angst and tension that I love about New Adult books is plentiful in this book. I fell hard for Jake, probably at the same rate as Nina. Besides being hot, he was just completely unexpected. He was perfect. He wasn&#8217;t a guy who slept around and had different women coming in and out of the apartment. He wasn&#8217;t a guy who went out to party every night.He was a guy who made Nina origami bats with corny poems (which were probably my favorite parts of the book). He was the guy who loved everything related to bananas and probably was part monkey. He was the guy who made Nina feel things that she never felt before. He was what she wanted.There was just one minor problem. Jake had a secret. Every weekend he would take the train up to Boston. Every single weekend. And no one knew where he went or why he went there. But that was Nina&#8217;s life &#8211; during the week she hung out with Jake and on the weekends, she waited for Jake to come home. Sure they were just friends, but she couldn&#8217;t help that she didn&#8217;t feel the way she felt with Jake when she went out with other guys.The angst in this book had my stomach doing somersaults. I knew Jake wanted Nina. Nina eventually knew Jake wanted her. But something always held him back. And then when you are a little bit more than halfway through the book, everything changes. And the story picks up from Jake&#8217;s POV.While the first half had angst because there was this whole will they-won&#8217;t they get together dance, the second half had angst because there was a whole can they possibly be together struggle. My heart felt for Jake. He became even more perfect. Stupid loyal tattooed hot guy. If I were Nina, then that is what I would be muttering every time I thought of him. Yes, you guess right &#8211; this is where you find out why he goes to Boston. You want to hate him. You want to tell him he is wrong and a horrible person. But, you can&#8217;t. And it sucks. Sigh.I absolutely loved this book because it got me so caught up in what was going on, I just could not put it down. I loved the characters, I loved the story and I loved the twist that Penelope threw at me. Also, the steam factor in this book is so freaking high &#8211; I needed a fan to cool off at times. She really upped the ante with this one. This book was freaking amazing.However, I did have two small issues with this book, with one being bigger than the other. The first 90% of the book was pure New Adult perfection; I almost think the story could&#8217;ve ended there. But, when we get to about 90% of the book we skip some time and I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of what happened in between the book&#8217;s present time and the future where it picks up again. I really can&#8217;t say more without giving anything away, but I just wish certain things didn&#8217;t happen and were different. This isn&#8217;t to say that I hated the ending. I did ultimately like where the story ended - I just had some issues on how the characters got there. This is why I gave this book 4.5 stars and not 5 stars.All in all, I highly recommend this book. I love Penelope&#8217;s writing and cannot wait to read her next project, which will be a spin off of a character you meet in this book.This review was originally posted on Book Reader Chronicles blog.

$review_text.: I heard such great things about this book that I decided to give it a shot. Though, I waited a while before reading it. Now, I must say that it&#8217;s a complete miss for me. I rarely feel so disappointed.I can&#8217;t deny the fact that there&#8217;s potential for this book. The premise is interesting, but did the characters have to fall in love almost right away? Playing the lust card in books is really great and fun, but stating that the girl is afraid of commitment and of love and the guy is a bachelor for life and player&#8230; Then how come they can fall in love after a couple of days? Because, basically it&#8217;s what happened in this book. Sure they wait a little before confessing their love, but no more than a few days.I find it weird, unbelievable &#8212; it&#8217;s a fiction, but still &#8212; and quite a turn off for me as a reader. I don&#8217;t like stories with characters that fall in love at first sight. I can never really get in the story. It&#8217;s a matter of personal taste, of course.Also, the beginning got me very confused. There are so many characters thrust into the story at once that I couldn&#8217;t have even the time to warm up to the story, build up my interest and understand who was who. I was really confused for a couple of chapters and it&#8217;s an issue.The plot itself could have been interesting, but in the end the timeline seems a bit off and many things are left unsaid. You have several POVs at once which I hate &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m harsh, but I&#8217;m trying to explain how I truly feel. I enjoy it when a story is told from more than one POV, but it needs to be done in an orderly manner and not to the point that you don&#8217;t even know which POV it is. Why put Caleb&#8217;s POV, a few of Molly&#8217;s and Ryan&#8217;s or even Layla&#8217;s when the main story is about Mark and Sophie? I still don&#8217;t really understand right now because it doesn&#8217;t bring anything to the story.Sometimes, I couldn&#8217;t really picture the real difference in the characterization of the male characters. They blended at some point and it&#8217;s sad because the group dynamic was interesting.So, I&#8217;m going to stop here because this review isn&#8217;t very enthusiastic and it&#8217;s useless to go into more details. This book wasn&#8217;t for me and I know many other people don&#8217;t feel the same. I tried to explain why this book is a miss for me and it&#8217;s not because of the plot. The characterizations and the POVs are my main issues and it explains why I really didn&#8217;t enjoy reading this book. I hope you won&#8217;t keep it against me if you loved it! :)I almost rated it 1 star because that&#8217;s how I truly feel about this book, but at the same time I can only imagine how difficult it is to write about so many characters and build a story from there. And I finished the book after all.

$review_text.: When founders of this country wrote constitution, they did not expect even in their wildest dreams that the long arms of the law could be stretched so far to prosecute the President of the United Sates who is trying to protect this nation under threat by Islamic terrorists
There are many liberals in the media, academics and politics who have a made a career by campaigning for prosecuting President Bush who was making very difficult decisions to deal with a new breed of enemies who use terrorism to fight a war, all in the name of their religious duties and responsibility
The author forgets the tragic events of 9/11 and the killings of thousands innocent civilians


Scores of terrorist actions have been attempted since 9/11, in this country and elsewhere against U.S citizens


What would the President do to stop this? This is not a traditional war between two responsible countries
No president has ever fought a war like this, and no president has dealt with an enemy who profess holy war, jihad, revenge, retaliation and intolerance to other faiths, beliefs and cultures to achieve his goals.Many prisoners taken in Afghanistan and Pakistan are enemy combatants and they should be treated as such
They must be tried according to military justice


No foreign national who has set foot in this country is given access to U.S

courts, but an Islamic terrorist who tries to kill an American soldier on a foreign soil will get a shot at this

This is a twisted logic and wrong application of the law as Justice Scalia correctly observed that the constitution does not permit an enemy combatant, from a foreign soil, to access civil and criminal justice of this country
The author is more concerned about Miranda rights not being read or no proper legal representation existed when these enemies were questioned

In the case of American Taliban John Walker Lindh the author describes the efforts of department of justice (DOJ) attorney Jesselyn Radack to correct the errors in Lindh's interrogation by FBI
Both of them express a great deal of concern about his rights being violated but neither of them investigated or discussed the case of another American Al Qaeda terrorist, Jose Padilla, the so called "dirty bomber." The author claims that the government made deals with Lindh to protect FBI and DOJ

Actually he got a slap on the wrist for his actions


Any American citizen fighting with Islamic terrorists on a foreign soil against American forces is an enemy combatant and he must be tried in a military court

Mayor Giuliani suggested that he be tried by military and seek death penalty, in fact that is what Lindh deserved.Constitutional rights is being misinterpreted and misunderstood by both conservatives and liberals


The writers of the constitution did not imagine that the laws will hold the president of this country criminally liable for his actions during a war


President Bush performed brilliantly under a great deal of pressure during a very difficult period

It is an outrage to suggest that he be held responsible for alleged legal violations.1.Islam and Terrorism: What the Quran Really Teaches About Christianity, Violence and the Goals of the Islamic Jihad

$REVIEW.: I am living and LOVING the life of a true digital entrepreneur and every second is a new beautiful adventure. If I had still been in corporate and heard someone else say this, I'd not believe them. But it's true, and yet it's a challenge to keep everything moving in the right direction WHILE having a fun time doing it .... so naturally I was hungry to read this book to learn about another fellow entrepreneur's opinion about productivity. Making the best use of our time is the BEST friend and ally of an entrepreneur and overall, I was extremely pleased with Scott's book on this topic.I have followed Steve Scott's blog before and his insights and opinions are never just surface level. He takes you deep below the surface and breaks it down for you and shows you how. I really appreciated this aspect of the book.If you have been at the internet business for a while, a lot of what he says will be familiar to you but he adds those subtle nuances that make big differences. The techniques he shares, especially the one on the Pomodoro technique of time management, is one I am going to start using and experimenting with. I love LOVE the emphasis of guarding your time and singular focus versus multi-tasking.There were some grammar and punctuation errors in the book that I am sure another revision will clean up. Just mentioning if the author glances at these reviews. No biggie but I do like a polished clean book so I wanted to mention it.Overall, it's a book I enjoyed reading - it's a very very quick read - and one that I will be recommending to my peeps.

$review_text.: Jake and Olivia have been crazy about each other since they were kids but never really said or did anything about that. He's @ 3 years older than her and that type of age different matters when you're 13 & 16...not so much at 19 & 22. Jake joins the Army after HS. He's looking to find himself and make his own mark on the world without relying on the family's wealth. He has no interest in taking over any portion of the family's businesses. I cannot begin to tell you how much respect I have for a man like that - even if he's a fictional character here. Liv is 15 when he leaves, but they share a special moment then and her first kiss the night before he leaves. The book starts at his welcome home party, and he's not the same person he was when he left. He's been to war and has carried home a lot of baggage with no one to help carry the load. Jake is so happy when he sees Liv, but he's having so many issues dealing with everything that he's experienced. They fight and make up. They fight again, she goes back to school and he vanishes. Of course he turns up and they talk and become the couple in life that they always were in their hearts. However, we've barely begun the book here. Let me tell you - what you will read after that is emotional, will tear you up, make you question a lot of things and make you believe that HEA's are always possible in life. There are several war scenes described. They are not full of gore to make you cringe, but they are written in a way that makes your heart bleed for every soldier involved. It's a glimpse into their day to day lives that is never discussed and would never be in the mainstream media. I admire the way the story was told and how the scenes were writtten. I have friends and family that have served in all branches at varying levels from Vietnam to Afghanistan.

$REVIEW.: As a post-college graduate, my education was completely insufficient in regards to our most important document : the US Constitution.  So I bought this book, and what an education I am getting!  This book will give the reader a foundational knowledge on the constitution.  It is by no means a thesis on the constitution, but if the reader desires a working knowledge on our constitution, this is a very good place to start. All the articles of how our government is set up and run are discussed in some detail, then each amendment has its own chapter, explaining the historical background and subsequent challenges to the amendment.  If used as a study manual, this book will definitely prepare the student for classes in further study, especially on constitutional law.The Constitution is THE most important document in our history, and sadly, most of us know so little about it.  This book remedies that problem.  Highly recommended for study.  (This book can be read casually as well, but the reader definitely gains a better education with careful study, and not just a cursory reading.kone

$review_text.: I picked this up for my 8 year old as she loves everything animals, especially kittens as she recently got her own.  As the title implied &#34;The Ultimate Guide-To-All Things Kitten&#34;, I really thought this would be either a care guide for kids, perhaps a book learning more about kittens, etc., Instead, this book is all about fostering cats, particularly, the author's experience with fostering and adopting her own cat's, along with 'inspiring' readers to foster and adopt cats as well.  While this is all fine and dandy, it most definitely is NOT what I thought it was going to be.  The pages were filled with words all about this topic, which I did read and, well, I've heard such fostering stories before.  The small words combined with taking over half the pages were simply too much for my daughter, even when I tried to read it to her.  She enjoyed the pictures of all the cats and kittens, of course, as did I, but she really was hoping for something she herself could read, and, in her words, tricks she could teach Mr. Bojangles (our kitten). Even the included craft, which I thought would be fun for us to do together, was simply too much and over her head, and she loves arts and crafts and often does things a couple years over her recommended age limit.All this being said, it was a cute book overall with a personal story.  The pictures are cute.  My biggest issue was the &#34;marketing Misdirection&#34;, and it says 'Guide' and is covered with adorable little kittens, I expected an actual 'Guide', and being that the kittens have quotation bubbles above their heads, it sure seems directed at a younger crowd than it is actually intended for.This is definitely a book for 12-13 year olds and up, although it seems at first glance one for under 10.  This book would be perfect for first time fostering/adopting cat/kitten owners.  In my personal opinion, The top line about it being a Guide should be removed.  These things are what caused me to drop it to three stars.

$review_text.: My hat's off to Susan Fox for Finding Isadora. I'm a huge fan of stories that take me along with the heroine on a voyage of discovery, and Susan has pulled it off beautifully. The heroine, Isadora, is smart, compassionate, and on the cusp of making a decision that will alter the rest of her life. Secondary characters are well-drawn and unique, and the two main protagonists are absolutely fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The romance is powerful and believable, and the four-and three-legged characters in Finding Isadora only add to the wonderful charm of this beautifully written story. I have to admit, I really love a book that, when I finish the final paragraph, has me sitting back with a smile on my face. I'm still smiling. :-)

$review_text.: I was pressed for time to find a book to borrow today, I wanted motivation for my running and had a couple of hours to read.  I may have expected more, but this is not a bad pamphlet for the true beginner.  I have done a C25K that I found on the web with a downloadable chart and basically this is what this book is.  A program to start from the beginning with information on clothing, warm up, the run, and cool down. Very basic.  It was short and I had read it in about 30 minutes.  The only thing that bothered me was the talk about foot position while running, the heel strike.  There has been a lot of opinions floating around about when foot meets pavement, and I can't get comfortable with the heel strike.  Ouch.  Yes, I have read Born to Run, and found it very fascinating, with details about the perfect design of our feet because they're going to have to carry us around for hopefully a very long time.  There were feet before shoes, you know.  Back to the book, not a bad beginning read.

$review_text.: I won't go into the story, other reviewers have already done that in detail
My main criticism is that everything about this story felt rushed and superficial
There was no true emotion from Skyla and, sadly there was no romance in her relationship with Logan, her love interest
 I  didn't feel the love, or anger or even the jealousy she supposedly experienced
And I certainly didn't feel her attraction to Logan or her response to his touch or his kisses
The reason was the rushed pace of the writing.For example, the first time Logan the guy Skyla's crazy about kisses her it's described as, " His tongue darts around my mouth, glides across my teeth, happy to be there."  Later another kiss is described as, "He pushes his tongue into the back of my throat deeper and deeper, 



."  Where is that glorious feeling of first love? Where is the excitement, the heat, the giddiness? It isn't there, and it should be, worse, it could be


 The bottom line is that I found all the characters superficial.There are other problems with the writing and in all fairness there are some positive things to be said about the book, but if I don't care about the characters nothing else matters.

I do not care what the parents expect, if you have feelings for someone, then you should explore that and not go to another. The brother of the hero should have told his brother how he felt instead of sleeping with that girl.

$REVIEW.: Virgin Heat is one of the books that don't involve the core characters of Shames' Key West books, though it's the same mafiosos and everything seems to tie in Bert the Shirt sooner or later.It's the same scene, though, and the same kind of people--but of course with Shames there is very little that's samey about his characters.Angelina is another of those young women pining to get out of her entanglements and find real love,  the kind of person he does so well, with a razor balance between tenderness, humor, and understanding.And as always, the men are a little flawed, but tend to work out.  And as always, don't let the concept of "funny side of the mafia" fool you.  This isn't a sitcom with cardboard wise guys: when the threat comes out, Shames doesn't lay it off: it's real danger and you feel it, as well as the exposure of much of the mean-spirited, small-minded brutality that underpins the fictional ideas of who the Mob really are.If you aren't familiar with Shames work, you should be.  And this is a good place to start.  But it would be even tastier if you were more situated in his version of Key West, had the whole picture on Bert and his friends.So get 'em all.  The reader-friendly pricing of these new ebooks offers the opportunity to dive into a world of stories as delightful as anything on the market.  They should sell them in six packs.

$review_text.: I really found myself drawn into the story quickly and before I knew it I had read most of it in one sitting.It was the voice of Lily, the main protagonist, that captivated me, and the countless issues she had to deal with at such a young age. From the get go, we are plunged into her world of depression and heartache, and her constant questioning of her existence and God. You see, Lily died, along with her two closest friends whom perished. But, what is remarkable, is the fact that she awakened after being pronounced dead. Grief stricken and not knowing how to cope, she leaves her small home town and her mother, to move to the big city to be with her father and his new family. The possibility of starting over where no one knows her or her back story is more tempting then anything else. Lily soon settles in school quite nicely, gets a spot on the newspaper and begins working on assignments. One particular assignment would forever change her life, and lead her to the quiet and protective Luc, and the enigmatic Mo, and their group of friends. Lily couldn't believe how comfortable she begins to feel around them and finds herself happy for the first time since the accident. But, it doesn't take long for her to feel remorse and learn that running away from her own despair was going to be difficult. Even though she moved away from the tragedy, she could not out-run her sorrow. This new group of friends huddle around her and try to support her through this pain, which she finds a little odd, yet is grateful to be able to finally free her soul for the first time. Then peculiar things begin to happen. Unexplained incidents and behaviours set off alarms in Lily, concerning Luc, Mo and the rest of the group. Things that she could not turn a blind eye too and before she knows it, she is smack in the middle of something divine and supernatural. Never in her wildest dreams could she imagine being caught in the fight between good and evil, but that's where she ended up being. Everything happens for a reason, and to Lily, she was beginning to think this true.Speak of the Devil is a fast and easy read that deals with some heavy issues of depression, grief, tragedy, religion and the meaning of it all, but in such a light way that it isn't over-the-top. It's a great young adult read and I really enjoyed it. Thank you to the author, Shawna Romkey for providing me with a copy for review and I look forward to the next instalment. The epilogue has set it up nicely.

$review_text.: This was a typical teen romance, which I love to read, but it had a unique twist that I have never seen before in a story! Once you read the story through Charli's eyes, you are suppose to flip the book over and then read the story through Blake's perspective. How cool is that?! I especially loved how the story could relate to any high school students life and therefore makes it great read for the younger crowd. The relationship between Charli and Blake is a typical case and they deal with issues and drama that all teenage couples go through. Another big thing I admired about this story was that Stephanie, the author who focuses on writing Christian novels, wrote about the hard decisions a teenager who has certain strong beliefs has to experience. Teenagers receive a lot pressure from friends and family when they follow a certain lifestyle and this story really puts into perspective.

$REVIEW.: 'Guardian Dragons' is an unusual fantasy tale with several unique characters.  It's the first in a series and this one felt very much like it was setting the stage for the bigger story to come.For me this felt like a collection of gradually interlinking fairy tales featuring changelings, huphins, dragons, and a few other fantasy character types.  I found the princess huphin part of the story the most engaging, though I did also very much enjoy the fiery changeling princess Heather also.It's an easy, enjoyable read and I got through it in a couple of hours.  It is definitely an unusual book in the fantasy genre; the world Vickers has created felt separated by the different characters and their perspectives within it, almost as if there were many worlds inside one and all of them getting ready for collision!  It did very much feel like a set up book, with a few incidents by the end but the main story felt like it was only just beginning in the last chapters.Overall I'd say this was an intriguing start to what looks to be a very imaginative series.  I will definitely pick up the next part when it's out.

$REVIEW.: The Hitchens brothers, though theoretically ideological polar opposites, are in fact a perfect illustration of what's wrong with Britain. They are both public school Oxbridge types who, whether they accept it or not, are essentially of the same group in the same way that Tony Blair and David Cameron, George Osborne and Peter Mandelson, are of the same group. They are all members of what can broadly be described as 'the ruling class', a class willing to set aside relatively minor ideological differences to sustain what is essentially a conspiracy against the masses.The reason that British education has made little headway over the last fifty years is that the ruling class - Tory or New Labour - doesn't want it to. After all, British state schools are for the education of the 'oiks' - a class of people who need to be kept down if the corrupt incompetence of the status quo is to survive. So long as the public school system and all its attendant injustices can be maintained, then the state system can safely be left to rot on the vine as far as these people are concerned.Christopher Hitchens, supposedly a 'compassionate' left-winger, dismisses housing estate products as 'oafs' in his latest book while his brother Peter has in the past espoused the supposed glories of the secondary modern schools, a system of education designed for the specific purpose of keeping working class people in their place. Neither brother can be said to have a real insight into grassroots British life because they attended schools whose entire ethos is based on keeping them apart from the unwashed hordes.I suspect the differences between these two, specifically in the areas of politics and faith, are more of an exercise in cerebral jousting than anything truly heartfelt. The truth is that both are beneficiaries of a grotesquely unjust society in which the ruling class is committed to keeping the masses dumb and dependent. It is, as intelligent observers have been saying for years, a formula for failure, which is precisely what Britain is. There is not a single area of British life in which the incompetent ruling class has achieved anything remotely worthwhile, except perhaps the creation of the National Health Service, which remains the UK's only really laudable institution, in spite of its deficiencies.Peter Hitchens cries out for a past that never was. Britain has never been an aspirational society - it is a savagely divided society orchestrated for the enrichment of the ruling class, of which the Hitchens brothers are part by virtue of their education. In fact, Christopher writes in his memoirs that his mother was determined he should not be part of the common people and that he was truly grateful that he would never have to be, thanks to his schooling. Some socialist!A current TV programme is tracking what is known as The American Dream. Ask yourself: has there ever been anything resembling a British Dream? Never - and people like the Hitchens brothers are part of the elitist conspiracy that renders dreaming in Britain an exercise in futility.

$REVIEW.: Here is a colletion of travelers tales many of which will at least force a grin on your face
 Most of the stories are short thereby offering you an opportunity to get a quick read while on a fifteen minute break at work
 While there won't be any great revelations made, people who regularly travel ought to be able to relate.The book is comprised of republished stories of known authors (e.g
P.J


O'Rourke, Art Buchwald, Dave Barry)
 Therefore if you are a fan of a particular author you won't see anything new here


 Barry's work, for example, comes form Dave Barry does Japan

 That is not to say it is less funny, it just isn't new if you've read his other works.Granted there are a some boring ones in here


O'Rourke's tale and the Duck of Peace, however, make up for those few which cause you to wonder why you are reading this

 If you do find yourself wondering why you are reading the book though, take heart in the words from the hilarious introduction

 &quot;In short, if there's a story in here you don't find particularly funny, rest assured that our careful, mind-numbing research found that several people nearly wet themselves while reading it.&quot;

 Tarantino?  No
 Spike Lee?  Spielberg?  Anyone?  I think the closest I could find is probably Christopher Nolan who made "Memento" in 2000 or Alfonso Cuaron who made "The Little Princess" in 1995
 Is there ANY name that springs to mind?  Anyone that is doing amazingly good and innovative work?  Ah, found one:  Zack Snyder who directed "Dawn of the Dead" in 2004 and has helmed the most recent Superman re-boot "Man of Steel."  Sadly, though, directors have seemingly become footnotes to film - unless you're a name...and no director has a name that looms larger than Alfred Hitchcock
 His work from the silent era, his classic films from the 50's, his ground-breaking work from the 60's, his dabbling in television and finally his last films in the 70's no one director has been more influential to Hollywood (and beyond) than Alfred Hitchcock.As great as Hitchcock was, though, he sadly is linked to "suspense" or "horror" films
 Romantic comedies were not his forte - though his films could be filled with humor


 When I tell the wife we're going to watch a Hitchcock film she'll sigh and wander off to do something else


 But Hitchcock was far more than a "suspense" film director or a "horror" film director

 Sure "Psycho" and "The Birds" pop to mind and are synonymous with Hitchcock, and rightfully so, but to just say that he did shock horror films does a disservice to everything he has made (even his not-so-great films).And that's the rub of this book:  "Alfred Hitchcock's Movie Making Master Class" by Mr


Moral
 I fear that people will walk on by assuming that the book is all about suspense films or horror films or creepy subject matter or planes chasing people down

 No, no and, uh, no


 Like Hitchcock, this book is far more than that.Broken down in a logical format, Mr

Moral's book explores all the aspects of film-making (writing, casting, working with actors, lighting, editing, even promotion) and how both Hitchcock approached them, dealt with them, hired the right people to accomplish what he wanted - or took it upon himself to do it


 This is, truly, a Master class of ALL aspects of film-making.What sets the book apart, beyond that, are Hitchcock's own words
 Filled throughout the book are quotes by Hitchcock on all these various parts of the film-making process

 It truly is as if you're sitting down with the master himself


 Sprinkled, too, are many quotes from the various directors working today and how they have been influenced by Hitchcock and his approach to film-making and storytelling.I truly fear that wanna-be film-makers will walk by this book thinking that it has nothing to say to them and that it's a biography or something on Hitchcock and they will surely be missing out.There are storytellers, there are movie directors and then there's Alfred Hitchcock who made a career out of re-telling stories and redefining film-making


 Tony Lee Moral's book explores everything you need to know about Hitchcock and his methodologies...and then some.


$review_summary.: Great book about all aspects of film-making, not just about Hitchcock

$review_text.: What a fun book!! Though I may be slightly older than the characters in this book, and may betoo old to be totally fangirling over a boyband story, I have to say I completely adored this book to pieces

I devoured it


I loved every second..


and then some

What a fantastic story!At first glance I wasn't sure about this synopsis

But the cover really had me interested (I'm such a sucker for a fabulous cover!) so I had to see what this story was all about
And yay, it was just as fantastic as the cover!This story surrounds three sisters: Chloe, Aralie and Emery, whose father is in the Secret Service


After gunshots are fired at a boyband, Spaceships Around Saturn, while they are on stage, this dad decides the band will go into lockdown until they've figured out who the culprit is..

and the lockdown will be in his house
This forces the Branson family to also be on lockdown of sorts so there isn't a chance one of the sisters will slip and disclose their secret
Emery, the youngest daughter at just 5 years old, is completely in love with one of the members of the band, and can't contain her excitement when she learns of the situation


Chloe and Aralie, however, who are teenagers and less than eager to be stuck with these guys, are nowhere near happy about this


They have to cancel their plans for the summer and lie to their friends, all so these guys will be safe.The characters in this story were spectacular!! Emery was so adorable I just wanted to squeeze her cheeks through my Kindle


Aralie had a major attitude full of snarkiness galore, but I absolutely loved that spunky girl
Chloe was more even-tempered, though insecure at times, and was outright hilarious!"God, Chloe

Lame much? They don't care about sleep
They run on caffeine, adrenaline, Oreos, and magic boyband juice from Saturn."And, of course, we can't forget about the band..

such a silly group of guys! For famous boys who are used to girls screaming and drooling all over them, these boys were surprisingly down to earth and normal, with a bit of a "star quality" mixed in for good measure

 ;)"Emery has enlightened me on all things Spaceships Around Saturn
1) Noah is a jerkface - Emery's words - until he has his strawberry milk each day, but then he's fun


That's what Benji told her anyway


2) Tate laughs at everything
3) Milo is way too serious and acts like a grownup

Emery says he's really boring

4) Benji sings in the shower


5) Jules smells like crushed ladybugs, but I'm pretty sure it's his cigarettes that Emery smells on him."The romance in the story was my kind of romance, in that it wasn't all sappy and lovey-dovey

It was more fun than anything
Sneaking around for Oreo dates, visits in a tree house, and late-night swims
So perfect!I was wholeheartedly invested in these characters and their lives


This story was so fun, I didn't want it to end
I may have shed a happy tear or two upon reaching the ending


If this band was real, I would have no trouble admitting to being a Saturite

I enjoy reading it because it's a really nice story about mommy's loving their kids, even when they don't listen or make mistakes.If you like this, we have been reading another book that is also about a bear family and a boy and his mom called "snow bear" that is kind of a similar type of story about a bear who wanders off from his mom and needs help to find her again.

$REVIEW.: I am an avid Rochelle Alers fan, however, in comparison to her other works this book just does not compare at all. The pace of the book is too slow and for it just was not attention grabbing enough. I started to skim through the pages to get to the juicy stuff, but the juicy stuff never appeared. In my opinion, this was not one of her best, but I truly expected it to be. After reading the majority of the Hideaway saga, this book does not hold a candle to the flames of those story lines.

$REVIEW.: I highly recommend that you read both The Future of Our Past and Don't Forget to Remember Me before reading A Love Like This.I wasn't sure where this book could go.  It seemed like Ryan and Julia had made it through so many different tests to their relationship that they would be rock solid.  They were so connected that Julia had immediately trusted Ryan without her memory intact.  I wondered if an epilogue or a few chapters advancing a few years ahead might have been a good way to end the story of Ryan and Julia.  Instead I found that even a couple so in love and connected and had a strong foundation of trust and friendship could be torn apart under the right circumstances.I absolutely loved this book.  This book was a wonderful way to showcase Ryan and Julia's relationship and a fabulous ending for the Remembrance Trilogy.  For me, each subsequent book was an improvement over the one that came before it.Ryan and Julia are married and finally living together in New York, but they quickly find that they have barely any time to spend together.  Both are in demanding careers with long hours.  The time they do spend together has them connecting by making love.  Their chemistry is a tangible thing.  I felt that connection, that need to be with the other person constantly.  But because they spent their time making love, the basis of their relationship suffered.  I saw them losing touch and not talking to each other.  They were almost no longer each others' best friend.The event that seems to change everything is when Ryan and a co-worker are involved in an incident in the ER.  The co-worker steps in and saves Ryan's life while being seriously injured in the process.  Out of guilt and gratitude, Ryan feels the need to help her through the after effects and heal.  But the closer he gets to his co-worker, the more Julia feels shutout.  While Ryan is typically so sensitive to Julia, her needs, and her feelings, he feels torn in two.  He expects Julia to be more understanding and show her gratitude.  I understood Ryan's motivations, but I just wanted to smack him for being blind to how he was being manipulated and letting the situation escalate.  I just knew that a few of those decisions would come back to haunt him when Julia found out.There are times when they seem able to put the conflict behind them and concentrate on reconnecting.  When Julia is finally pushed past the breaking point, she makes a crucial decision about her job and establishes a physical distance between them.  At this point my heart broke for both Ryan and Julia, but in the end I think it was the right decision.  Both needed time and space to really consider what they wanted and put their priorities into perspective.  They really couldn't continue as they were going.  Ryan needed to handle the situation and Julia needed to know if she could live with this woman in Ryan's life.I loved the ending!  The ending resolved the conflicts between Ryan and Julia while showing a plausible future for them both.**I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: A book about an evolutionary biologist who is challenged by a student who wants to do a thesis on intelligent design is not a book I would ordinarily choose to read.There.  I said it.However, I recently heard author Lauren Grodstein speak about, and read from, this novel during a recent event and found her concept to be more intriguing than it would seem on the surface.  There was so much potential for this book to take a preachy turn ... and it did no such thing.When student Melissa comes to widowed Professor Andy Waite to propose her thesis project, it's essentially because she's been dared to do so by fellow evangelistic Christian Lionel Shell.  Andy reluctantly decides to accept her project, as she maintains that she can use scientific method to demonstrate intelligent design.  He also agrees to read the books she is using as her texts, so that he can adequately evaluate her project.Part of the challenge to Andy's atheist beliefs has nothing to do with the project, and everything to do with his late wife haunting the house where he and his two daughters live.  A subplot involving the man who killed Louisa, and how it relates to Andy's research project at the fictional Exton Reed College also twists through the tale.Everyone in this book finds their core beliefs challenged at some point or another (with the possible exception of Andy's research mice).  It was an entertaining piece of literary fiction, and I would have truly missed out had I not picked up this book.

 The book is much better than many of the critical reviews state
 I have the feeling that many of the reviews are by retired school teachers that never had a creative thought and could not write anything but a boring test paper.The book 'The Pattern Ship' does have errors and stronger editing would be helpful, but it is original, creative and just plain fun to read
 It has been awhile since a book provide this much interest and made me think about things in general


I would have given this book 4.5, -.5 for the poor editing, but over all the content is a 5.

$REVIEW.: So very few novels deal with domestic violence, and I was glad to see Chicki Brown explore this subject in this novel.I found the book a very good, easy read, and the suspense of what unfolds as Marcia decides to cut ties with her current station and situation and effectively run for her life - literally, as Brown demonstrates - had kept me glued to the Kindle screen. Dani, as Marcia is later known, and Taylor Villanova explore their various quirks, from their backgrounds to their pasts, and Dani has to, eventually, confront her abuser, but before that, she has to build up a good bit of strength. Her journey from victim to survivor is engrossing, to say the least.One thing to note, though: while it is fascinating to see Dani come into her own after enduring what she had, it feels as though the bulk of that is done in the first two-thirds of the book. However, as an overall, it doesn't take away from the story.I love that the characters and the situations are true-to-life. You can go to a bar in Atlantic City, look at the cocktail waitresses there, and easily imagine that one of them had run to AC to sever ties with a traumatic past. If you look at a bouncer in a club, you may wonder if he, like Taylor Villanova, has something under the tough-guy veneer. Or, alternately, you can look at a Santa Barbara house and wonder exactly what happens behind closed doors. Chicki Brown does a great job in painting the picture.

$REVIEW.: Well this story starts with a bang and doesn&#8217;t let up until the last word


We meet Brooklyn and she seems to have it all together

She is the daughter of the owner of a very successful record label and a former model

She owns her own thriving business in LA that provides custom made microphones to the music industry and her father wants her to work for the family business because she has an uncanny ear for musical talent

Seems like a nice little life right&#8230; It&#8217;s very easy to judge a book by its cover, but oh you never quite know what someone has or is living through.So Brooklyn begrudgingly uproots her life, leaving her business mainly in the hands of her BFF and business partner Allie, and heads to NYC to work with her brother Hendrix
She moves into Hendrix condo and with the help of her outlandish cousin Nina she starts settling into the New York party scene much to Hendrix concern


Why? Looks like our girl may have battled a few personal demons in her past
She conquered them but everyone who has ever loved someone through things of that nature is always waiting with bated breath for the day they slide back down that slippery slope

It&#8217;s hard not only for the one falling but also for the ones who love them and watch feeling helpless
No one wants to see Brooklyn back in that dark place.Enter Nick Wilde
Oh Nick, Nick, Nick Wilde


He is a record producer that goes by the name Shadow and is so freaking hot


Brooklyn is instantly attracted to him but she doesn&#8217;t really want to be
She has gone down the road of dating within the music industry, one artist in particular, and she knows that &#8220;relationships&#8221; really aren&#8217;t their thing

Plus our girl is a tad insecure about herself, her body, her worth


Nick however is not deterred in the least


He wants her and he wants her to be only his
He is so alpha which I really love in a MC
Brooklyn needs that strong male in her life

Then there is that little kink that is Shea Roberts
Shea is a star that Brooklyn championed and is an ex-boyfriend, turned friend with benefits when he couldn&#8217;t keep it in his pants when on the road, turned best guy friend and the only constant left in her life


Their relationship is messy and complicated and unresolved&#8230; and Nick doesn&#8217;t like to share


Couple that with some secrets Nick holds and things get derailed before they really get started

Can she let go of the past and start really living again? Can she let someone in to love her when she has never really felt loved by anyone even her own family? Can she escape the pain and guilt that threatens to pull her into the darkness again?Claire Contreras sure knows how to write a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat
This one is has so many different facets


Everything is tested: friendship, love, sanity

Your heart will be tied up in knots and then soaring and just when you think everything is going to be okay she throws you a gut wrenching curveball that literally stops your heart

Wow, just wow

I highly recommend this book


It was worth every single laugh and every single tear.Favorite Quote:&#34;I don't know what it is about him that makes me want to grab his face in place so that he'll never look at anything but me

I'm not sure what bothers me more: the realization or the fact I can't remember feeling this way about anyone before him.&#34;

In addition, it was just a poorly written, boring book. There was no character development for the hero and heroine.  There was no chemistry between the hero and heroine.  I can only assume that those readers that gave this book great reviews had to be related to the author because this book was completely lackluster...mediocre at best.

The what would you do if this happened to you, concept. Also, with the woman being a writer I can relate to having a slump. Sometimes you seek inspiration. In this, she gets just that.The writing is well composed and it's a great quick read.(on Amazon their rating stars mean different than Goodreads... -- Why? I don't know. --- But I liked the story-- )

$REVIEW.: I had high hopes for this book and while it didn't disappoint, I'm not sure it lived up to what I was expecting. The authors writing at times, was disjointed. We jumped from scene to scene with little to no warning and sometimes it took a moment to orient who, what, when and where. I also felt the story between the two main characters was dragged out a little longer than was interesting.That being said, this story still sucked me in. I loved the main character Sophia. Not only was she feminine but she wasn't afraid to stand her ground in any situation she found herself in and she could speak multiple languages! Definitely a force to be reckoned with! My heart broke as Will (her love interest) and Sophia battled to helped the Indian people maintain their hold, on the land the knew and love, and then ultimately be forced on to reservations. People can be so cruel sometimes. However there was a resolution and a happy ending.All in all, when I closed the book, there was a smile on my face. :)Happy Reading!I received this book through BookSneeze.com in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: I am not normally a fan of fantasy books, but this read was recommended to me on one of my favorite blogs.  So, I took a chance and I am glad that I did.The story is well-written and well-structured which makes it easy to follow along with.  The characters are highly developed to the point in which you get lost in the book and feel like you are living inside of each scene.  Vanx is a great character who is surrounded by a great cast of others.  The writer does a great job at reaching &#34;character synergy&#34; which means that each and every one brings a certain ingredient to the story.At times in this crazy world it is nice to get a break from reality, That Frigid Fargin Witch is that vacation we are looking for.A must read!

Each area is marked with an icon that clearly marks the theme being covered.The 24 areas are referenced in over 300 articles and use a 4 way method of teaching.~ The material is presented in by topic with the scripture passage~ It is further defined through stories of women in the Bible~ Examples of practical applications are presented for use~ It builds on a foundation of faithI have been using the Everyday Matters Bible for Women for several weeks and find that I am spending more time reading the scriptures that are referenced in the articles or themes.  This has been a great springboard for discussions with my girls on topics for women.  I find the suggested reading will often have me deep into a study that splits off into other topics. I have enjoyed using and adding this to my study materials at home.Disclosure: I received a copy of the Bible as a member of the CWA Review Team

You will hate this book without ever reading it.If you are on the right you will love it.If you are in the middle you just might move to the right.This is a close look at a typical "Do what I say, not what I do, and for goodness sake and dont look at who I am" liberal fantics self destructive life unwinding as she hates everyone and every thing that doesnt agree with her twisted view of america.Regardless of what you think about the Iraq war you just have to shake your head when peer inyo the darkrd cornerd of diseased uber-liberals.Truly a dispicable character who dishonors the memory of her brave son.Juxtapose Cindy's hatred of counrty, self, and anything that smacks of traditional moral thought with the other American family written about here.Cindys family implodes, the traditional families grows stronger. Even Cindy's family has given up on this nut job.A real page turner.

It's beautifully written and therefore draws you in so much that it freaked me out a bit when the main character gets to the cabin (shudder).  In fact it scared me so much I had to stop reading and put it away for a day before I was brave enough to come back and see what happened next.  It also had a nice little twist at the end.If you are a fan of horror/thriller then you will love it.

$review_text.: Serena is a female detective on a predominantly male force
Because of that she's used to appearing harder than she is, but when two new visitors show up in town and wreak havoc on her emotions and body she doesn't know what to do or who to trust.After the discovery of a dead body Wes, a supposed tracker, shows up in Serena's office offering up all the details she needs to help solve the case


And of course he's sexy with a persuasiveness about him that makes her want to let him help her catch the bad guy

Not to mention help relieve the little bit of built up tension between them.Brody is the man whose been marked by Wes as the murderer of not only Serena's unknown dead body, but also many before him
But he's also much more
He's the man who swept into town first and the man who fell for Serena before he ever knew she was a cop

Oh yes, that was definitely a nice way to start the book!&#34;Fair thee well my black hair'd diamond&#8230;fair thee well my own Aisling
Thoughts and dreams of you will haunt me&#8230;&#34;I loved the interactions between all three characters as the mystery of 'Who did it?' was uncovered


The ending was also very enjoyable
Most books end when the bad guy is caught, but this one brings you past that to what happens afterwards


You can definitely close this book without feeling jipped at the end.My Favorite Moment: The ending was perfect
A wolf swearing his obedience to the love of his life
Yep&#8230;perfect!My Favorite Quotes: &#34;Based on the tracks&#8230; or prints&#8230; maybe you should be asking if anyone's seen any large, naked, frostbitten men in the Falls

$review_text.: I read this book because I write information and How-to-eBooks - how to publish, how to grow heirloom vegetables, how to start your journey to fitness, etc. I read a lot of these type of eBooks to glean inspiration.My step-father, now deceased, had Fatty Liver Disease and that&#8217;s the reason this book caught my eye.  For the person looking to understand this disease and to get information like the two types of classifications of this disease, is it reversible, what to eat, how to cleanse, then this book provides answers.Often when a person is diagnosed with a debilitating disease, they want answers quick. This book is a quick read and a good starting point.I would have liked to learn more about the background of the author and to hear more of the author&#8217;s story, because often it helps to hear the specific details of what someone like the author has gone through to let others know what to expect.However, I still think the book will provide answers for those who are under the care of a doctor, and still want the disease explained in a non-complicated way.

$review_text.: This book stands out in the current blitz of zombie fiction, distinguishing itself as not yet another apocalyptic use of the monster trope.  Instead, author Howe chooses to take the zombie monster, and turn it on edge, and use it to plumb the depths of the story of a young boy, and how he reacts to the world around him.  It's a story about an underdog, Billy Barton, who is tormented by his pre-teen peers, and as anyone who went through such experiences can tell you, the real monsters in this story isn't the walking dead man.  Funny, fast paced, gruesome and poignant.  A story sure to please both the young audience it is aimed at, and the savvy adult.

I got SOOOO much more. The story has depth, and it takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride from the first paragraph. I'm in love with this series and anyone writer that can make you feel empathy for the bad guy, sometimes want him to win, has incredible skills.There is so much going on in this story: Heaven versus Hell, Love versus Hate... anger... passion, all this thrown right in the middle of motherhood! What would you do to protect your child? How far would you let your soul blacken for your baby?I love the world the story is written around and you get one surprise after the next.  On top of all the meat in the story, you have HEAT! Oh, and it burns so sweet. This has become one of my favorite series!

$review_text.: Who can resist the lone cowboy who avoids all forms of friendship, family, and any sense of belonging? Not me and not Travis Longing the owner of Nowhere Ranch. This was a slowly unfolding story of two men who shared many common elements in life. They both loved ranching, a BDSM lifestyle, and both secretly want to be loved unconditionally by someone else. Travis just realizes it a bit earlier than Roe.The mystery of why Roe was so cut off from those around him comes out in pieces. But each piece is emotonal and very well written. Roe was tormented by the rejection of his family and fearful of their religious messages, even from hundreds of miles away. The affect a harsh and cutting letter had on Roe was deeply moving. When Roe receives a letter from a family member, his first instinct is to run from the ranch. Not to get away from Travis or because he's ashamed of their relationship. But I think it was to go somewhere they couldn't find him. He also was reminded that those who are supposed to love unconditionally, often put the most conditions on their love.I loved both Roe and Travis. I could picture them circling each other and working to build their relationship, while calling it anything but a relationship. Watching Travis push oh so gently to get Roe to acknowledge their relationship was wonderful. It was much like how I imagine he'd have gained the trust of an abused horse. Often one step forward two steps back.I didn't love the character of Haley, but she served her purpose of getting Roe out of his shell in a non-sexual manner. But I found her to be rather rude at times and sometimes felt she used Roe as a project rather than as a friend. But she did redeem herself when confronting Roe's ultra-religious cousin. She stood up for her friends and in the end that's all we can ask.I do also agree with another reviewer, the ending was out of character and more like the epilouge often found in Harlequin Romance novels than what I expected from Travis and Roe. For the first time ever, Rpe has friends, supportive co-workers, and a stable relationship. It was a great ending for a man still getting used to being loved and loving in return. Had it ended there it would be a 5 STAR review, but it's still a strong 4 STAR.

$review_text.: I thought this book was well written, beautifully plotted (with one exception), and had really interesting and believable characters.  I think that this book is one of the few that will improve with each re-read, it is that good.  I have bought the author's other two books.The hero was cold and truly amoral.  I think the book was well named - he really had no warmth, no caring in him.  His housekeeper gave me the creeps for her acceptance of her employer's actions, even while I liked her as a person.  I really liked the heroine both as a child and as an adult (except while she was in Ireland). I think the author has created two fully fleshed out characters who could walk off the pages of the book.If I didn't love everything else so much, I'd subtract one star for everything that happened in Ireland, where the heroine did some remarkably foolish things and behaved out of character several times.  Fortunately, this was a small part of the book and once they are back in the states, she becomes believable again.

$REVIEW.: Such a fabulously written adventure...and, now I must wait for the next one in the series.  I was reminded of the many areas in my life that I've let slip in daily practice.  Visualize, Emotion, Release, Manifestation and deep breathing/yoga.  Thanks so much for the gentle nudge to get back in there and take care of business every day.  RP, I couldn't put the book down.  I read The Fourth Awakening in one sitting, so I tried to take my time with The Gathering Darkness and enjoy and savor each moment like chocolate.  Alas, to no avail, I finished reading it in two evenings.  Great and exciting read!  I just have to say that the ending was one of the best cliffhangers I've come across.  Now on to practice the God Formula until the next release of my favorite characters!For anyone wanting a fantastic adventure...pick up The First Awakening and The Gathering Darkness.  You won't be disappointed!  Then read The God Formula by Jeffrey A. Martin.

Every one of Sophie's daughters is a force to be reckoned with (not unlike their intrepid mom!)

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the grown-up Beth McClellen and watching her bring out the best in shell-shocked Alex Buchanan

Their "marriage of convenience" is a sweet testament to the character of each, and I loved how Mary Connealy brought their love story full circle

Your kit is broken up into two levels and comes in sturdy packaging, so you can take it with you where ever you go.Included in your kit are 6 original storybooks, 2 reading workbooks, 2 DVDs, 2 sets of stickers (to mark progress), 4 sets of letter and picture flashcards, and a bonus DVD 'Fun In Motion'.  The set also comes with a very handy 'Quick Start Guide' for parents who are new to the Hooked on Phonics program and feel overwhelmed by the number of items in the kit.All the items included in the kit are very helpful and kid friendly.  The flashcards are my favorite bit from the kit because they're easy to pull out in periods of quiet time.  The DVD's are colorful and full of quirky songs.  The workbook is nicely put together, though you may want to print out supplementary material from the website, as well.The most important thing I have to stress about this kit is that it will only work if you, the parent, actively takes interest in planning 'Hooked on Phonics' time.  You can put the DVD's on as background noise all you want, but it's essential to use the other supplies given to you in this on a regular basis for super results.  Even just 30 minutes a day will do wonders.I recommend this set for families, especially those who can't afford to send their kids to any sort of 'Pre-K' program.  Make it a game and I'm sure your kids will love learning about the topics this set covers!

$REVIEW.: OverallFurries aren't really my thing (I feel like I've said that before), but I've heard good reviews about this author from other people who didn't really think they'd like a novel centered around furries


(Furries the anthropomorphic animals, not the humans who dress up like animals and have sex, just to clarify.) I was looking at Amazon's free reads and found this and decided to give it a shot.The writing throughout these stories is excellent, which I think is necessary for success, especially for reaching readers who are less comfortable reading about this type of character
Gold not only has a mastery of language, but also does an excellent job of describing and developing characters and plot
Gold is comfortable and familiar with the created world and confidently strides through it, building things along the way to create visually stimulating masterpieces


Definitely worth looking in to, this collection introduces the reader to various series without forcing the purchase of said series in order to understand what is going on
If you're willing to dip your toes into the world of anthropomorphic animals, this is a great place to begin.AquifersA good start to the anthology, we are eased into Gold's world and the sexuality that exists there


For most this will be a good indicator if you really can't stand the thought of two furries being in love and having sex


I fell in love with the characters, who are awkward sometimes, impossibly sweet, and pretty much standard high schoolers trying to find themselves and love

I love the themes of racism, class differences, and acceptance that are the secondary focus of the story outside the main character's exploration and self-acceptance
A good strong piece that is a perfect introduction


Although this story is continued into a novel, this one stands alone, satisfying the reader while creating interest in the rest of the tale.In BetweenThis story has more sex and older characters as we're bumped up to college


Here a fox, playing as a female, seduces a tiger and gets him to thinking beyond his heterosexual desires


Perhaps a little too well, as he comes back, unable to get the fox out of his head


The sex scenes are well done, although the author doesn't let the reader forget that these are animals as things such as claws and tails are taken into consideration


A classic tale of a jock realizing he's not as straight as he thought and struggling to come to terms with it


I found the characters enjoyable and the fox is smart, witty, and a perfect foil to the tiger.SecretsA continuation of "In Between," this story works heavily with flashbacks, doing lots of time skips, which could be confusing, but it was well handled


Most of the events don't rely too heavily on when they take place, so the shifts aren't too discombobulating


Because I read this and the previous story back to back, they flowed easily into one another and I don't remember exactly what happened in each, but the main focus of this story is that the tiger has a secret and as the story progresses, different secrets are revealed until the big one at the end is displayed


I think the time jumps were handled well in this story, and it made me even more curious about where the rest of the tale goes.Don't BlinkThis story was weaker than the previous ones

Revolving around a young superhero trying to prove himself both to the police and the league of superheroes, Blink Coyote wants a nemesis and gets what he wants when his girlfriend gets captured

There were several things I enjoyed in this, including many of the side characters and Blink's general desire to be noticed
Other elements and turn of events fell flat and while they didn't necessarily feel forced, they didn't feel like a natural progression

More like they came from far left field
Still it was an overall enjoyable story for what it was.Jacks to OpenInitially this story's focus is on gambling, which doesn't really interest me, but as everything unfolds, it becomes apparent that there is more there than some playing cards


I really enjoyed this story and the path that it took, although I admittedly wanted more (and the author made no mention of this story continuing)


The characters are shady without being bad, and they can hold their own with one another, which I'm noticing is a theme with this author's relationships
There is an underlying magical-ish world that the reader just gets to dip toes in, something I'd like to see more of, especially with these two characters--although I can see the advantage of the mystery being half the fun.Race to the MoonA cute little story that is styled much like a fable, following a coyote and raven, which has a touch of romance in it
This was enjoyable, and I couldn't guess where it was going completely (aside from obvious things that fables tend to have)


A nicely done effort.DriftingThis was a difficult story for me to read, since it involves a relationship where at least one member of the couple is unhappy with certain aspects


I think everything was well handled, whether I liked the content or not, and I definitely felt for all the different characters


My main niggle with this story was that we never find out what is going on with the other person in the pair, even after he admits that it is "my problem." I would have liked more development there, even if it wasn't the focus of the story.How to Get Through the DayThis story was written as a bonus story as an addition to another work by the author


While this story stands alone fairly well, it's obvious that it's building off of something that already exists and there are a lot of questions that I want answers to, which if this is used to tease the reader into purchasing Gold's works, it's a good thing! I liked the insecurity of both characters, especially the main one, and the construct of the story as a list that the main character goes through as his to-do list of every day


There are plenty of teases in the story, but it's also self-satisfying and good in its own right.The Prisoner's ReleaseA very different story from the others, this one is dark (most of it takes place in a prison cell) and inhabits a more historical and royal-infested world

I felt that the story overall was good, although some parts at the end confused me since it seemed to conflict with what the main character had said at the beginning (though he could have been lying then, as is likely, but I was still confused about who was being loyal to whom, etc)

I liked the two main characters and their dynamic, bouncing between wary trust and tentative emotions


Although not my favorite, it was still enjoyable.

$REVIEW.: New from New Growth Press, publisher for CCEF, is "We're Just Friends" and Other Dating Lies: Practical Wisdom for Healthy Relationships. Here is what the publisher says about it: "As a pastor of a large congregation and former singles pastor, author Chuck Milian has seen firsthand the broken relationships that occur when men and women don't move with proactive care in and through their dating relationships. With pastoral wisdom and insight, Milian educates readers about defining expectations before they start dating, and he outlines a specific five-step dating plan that will help limit relational damage as they look for someone to share their lives with. The author encourages, challenges, and instructs believers in this comprehensive how-to-date handbook. He gives practical advice on wisely forming relationships with the opposite sex while still having fun, avoiding unnecessary hurts, making lifelong friends, and knowing `where they are' each step of the way." This book seems to go beyond what I have seen in most titles about dating to help make sense of the progressive nature of relationships; I think that is a helpful addition to the field.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed The Accidental Bachelor. I found it very true to life...young man, confused about growing up and unable to leave the influence of his life-long friends, behind. Unsure of who he is or who he wants to be in an uncertain time. This is a familiar struggle of many men I know, including myself. I saw in the reviews, that a lot of woman "hated" this book, but guess what...it's not always about you! (That's right, I said it.) I'm always amazed how easy it is for the female of the species to cut ties and to leave friendships behind when they are no longer being served by them. But with Finn, these are the "boys" he grew up with and he has more than memory and secrets with them...he has genuine love. Yes, he knows that some of them will never grow up. He's having the same issues with commitment. Yes, some of them have issues with addictive behavior. He has some of those, too. The boys who succeed as future men are the ones who can move forward with maturation and still keep their friends and Finn is on his path to find the dream job AND get the girl AND remain true to his friends.

$REVIEW.: A Man, A Can, A Microwave is a board book for guys who must fend for themselves in the kitchen either because they are bachelors or their wives have gone off to visit mother for a week. Here are listed "idiot proof" instructions (complete with photos of the ingredients and their order of inclusion) for making fifty quick and easy, palate pleasing, hunger satisfying meals that can be made in the microwave in under 15 minutes. The recipes are divided up into sections dedicated to beef, chicken, pork, fish, turkey, beans, veggies, and even chocolate! From Maximum Microloaf (which combines Carnation Evaporated Milk; extra-lean ground beef; and a can of Manwich Sloppy Joe Sauce) to Toast Under a Tuscan Bean (which combines a can of Goya Cannellini Beans; a box of Melba Toast - Onion Flavor; and a can of Hunts Petite Diced Tomatoes), these are "good eatin', man pleasin'" dishes that are as easy to assemble as they are delicious to devour.

$REVIEW.: I have read a lot of sales and networking books, but this one has to be my favorite.  I like to highlight important sentences or great insight provided by the authors I read, but in this book there is no need for that - because I'd just end up highlighting the whole thing.Gitomer really just cuts to the chase, with his no nonsense approach and the down to earth manner he uses to convey his points.  This little red book has more USEFUL information in it than other big, longwinded sales books, and this book is fluff-free.  (Just because some of his remarks are motivational, it doesn't mean they are not useful tips for success in sales - to be honest, without motivation you will fall flat on your face as a salesperson).I keep The Little Red Book of Selling on my desk at work, not to show the sales manager that I am keeping up with my homework, but because it really is a useful resource.

$review_text.: I found this book interesting, just as I found 'Sarah' an interesting read. I read them before all this came out or before I knew any of the fictional background of the "JT Leory" and I'm glad. Because I read it simply as a story, violent and shocking, but a story.The main thing is this (because I don't want to get drawn into an argument): this is all about people's wounded feelings than the facts, as Laura Albert hasn't given them out.There are novels written about child abuse. We accept them though. It is a part of the real world that an author may write about it, just as they can write about sex, drug addiction, cults, divorce, politics, religion, and death. Is the reason everyone is saying Laura Albert can't write about it is because we KNOW that's fiction when so many people hoped it was autobiography? It is not sick to write about it, when you consider so many other books are not condemned for writing about such topics.  To say what you cannot write about is censorship. I'm not putting it on the same level but 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' was initally banned because it wrote about sex, but it's a normal healthy part of adult life. Now we laugh about the ban. At the end of the day, a writer is a recorder, an observer. It has to be accepted that if things exist then they are part of our consciousness and a writer may write about them.Fiction is about the realms of possibility and being able to write about what has happened, does happen and could happen. That is it. And that is everything.

$review_text.: Although the individual who wrote the marketing promotion on the back of the book is incorrect, the book itself does not disappoint.  I normally do not care much for books like this - you read them and then, well, quite honestly, you forget what they're about once it is finished.  This one, however, was quite good.  Coble does a good job of weaving God and intrigue into a story about an arranged marriage.  Mystery, although this is no Sherlock Holmes novel, is a nice surprise in a book like this and the "whodunit" portion was an interesting surprise, but not totally far-fetched.Anyway, the story is about a greedy landowner who arranges a marriage for his son, and comes back with a gorgeous girl for him.  I can't really spill the beans much more than that because it will ruin the plot if I say much more. Lucy has to care for her 1/2 siblings since the death of her father, and agrees to the marriage for that reason alone.  Although some of the ideas are a bit weak and leave you asking more questions than you have answers, the overall story was quite enjoyable.  And, for once, Thomas Nelson's editing department has help Ms. Coble on her sentence structure - that was a nice relief as well.Yes, it's a bit silly like the majority of novels like this, but less so that some of the others I've read.  It's a quick read too - only 300 short pages so you can finish this one in a short evening. The ending was a good one - Coble does a good job of surprising you in this book.  She also does a very good job of describing the life of a Texas cowboy.Finally, I particularly appreciated how much God was a part of the charaters' lives, how they pointed out to each other where they needed to trust God more with their lives.  Belive it or not, that IS how our forefathers spoke to each other, with Scripture, and on a daily basis.  They admonished and helped each other with their walks with the Lord, not just leaving each of us "to it," as we have a habit of doing today.  Coble did a nice job of showing this portion of our history, something of which I would like to see more.  I do recommend this book - it's a nice gift book for about anyone who loves to read.  Again, nice job, glad I got to read it.  Recommend!

$REVIEW.: This book is set in Hungary, and revolves around the life (especially love life) of an middle aged woman (60's) named Valeria. While it deals with a love triangle it managed to do so in a way that makes us fall in love with the characters (This sounds strange, but it's true). It is a very humorous little book, and because it is written in such a way one almost does not mind the rough language, the implausibility of certain situations/events and the couple of graphic scenes included. I fell in love with this book and am hopeful that the next who books to follow will be just as good.

$review_text.: I've never been into Victorian romances, but I've read all of Maddie Taylor's contemporary romances and LOVED them, so I gave this book a shot.  I'm so very glad that I did because Surrender Your Grace drew me in from the beginning and I could not put it down!  I loved Andrew and Ceci and how they grew to love one another even though they were forced into marriage.  Andrew was everything I love in a hero...stern, dominant and protective, while still being very loving and passionate.  This book also had a lot of humor in it and I enjoyed that as well. I was also very pleasantly surprised that the spanking scenes, some of which employed the use of a birch and a cane, were not overly harsh.  I've always thought of those implements as very severe and border-line cruel, so I was astonished to find that the scenes using those implements in this book were actually very sensual and arousing, even though they were used as punishment.  Let's just say I've changed my opinion of the use of the birch and the cane after reading this book!!!I'm hoping that the author, Maddie Taylor, will decide to write a story for Maggie and Duncan, who are secondary characters in the book.  At any rate, I will definitely continue to put Maddie Taylor at the top of my must buy list!!!

But with Chad knowing her secret he forces her to deceive Mike. If only that was all, she finds that Mike is just that special someone she has waited all her life for. Tore between her family, best friend and the love of her life Anna faces heartbreak alone. She is a positive person and knows that she will make it one way or the other but can she make it without the love of Mike!One of the things I love most about this author is that she writes about events that concern the average person. In Belong to You, she addresses border control, illegal aliens, unfair politic practices and drugs in the community. It's refreshing that both Mike & Anna have positive attitudes throughout the book and do not with hold forgiveness and seek revenge as so many characters do.

$REVIEW.: Another reviewer said it best: while this book takes a laudable stab at demystifying the Perl debugger, the little errors are enough to drive one bats.It goes without saying, or should do, that if your material depends on specific content being at specific lines of code, then the source file(s) you provide need to have that content at those line numbers, and not just "in the ballpark." I have already tried to plow through this book's Chapter 3 twice & have twice wound up wanting to throw the book across the room

$REVIEW.: I must start by saying Nicky Epstein has been my favorite knitting designer.  Her designs have always been imaginative..and even with all the errors I found as I went along (uncorrected by the publisher for the longest time) I still loved the books..and I own every one of them...Imagine my dismay with her last book...and now this latest one..If I want a guidebook on Italy, I will buy one.  I want Nicky's designs printed correctly...The designs (few that there are) are dismally unexciting (and I understand have more errors)...same as the last book...Maybe she is using a ghost designer...I have never heard of that but I cannot otherwise explain why these designs (and in the Knitting On Top Of The World book) are boring and seem like repeats of past designs....so sad...

Definite feel good, charming and funny novel.It really put a smile on my face when I have needed it most caring for my Dad. Even when Waverly made choices I would not have made myself I wanted to follow along and see where they got her. Waverly reminds me at times of myself, my sister, my college friends, my work friends. Also, her boyfriend with my favorite guy's name `Jake' is realistic a great guy.Being a Jersey girl myself and going into the NYC so often the NYC setting was a pure fun and a trip down memory lane.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed both the suspense and romance in this book.  Corrie Grant wanted to know more about her parents, who she never knew so went to her father's family (whom she just learned about).  Everyone thought she was a fraud and gradually began tolerating her as a member of the family.Almost from the get-go, it was clear that somebody didn't want her there.  Though I had my suspicions, the author kept us guessing by throwing us off...oh, and that's all I can say about that!The romance was slow in coming, but sweet and believable.I understood why they fought against their feelings, but felt that a good hero would actually stand up for what he believed and wouldn't let an old man tell him what to do.  Some of the things Lucas did (aka, his job) was done just to appease his great great (?) uncle-in-law which was a bit odd.  The romance scenes were few and a bit forced at times but still sweet.It was a good read, but lighter on the suspense then a lot of the LI Suspense books I've read.

$REVIEW.: I may be the only one who says this, but this is the worst book I have ever had the chance of owning. First of all, it is a gallery of altered art books already made and not a "how to" book. Second of all, many of these projects remind me of things I have made in the third grade. I for one do not believe in recycling everything mostly trashy items like bottle caps, 100 year old buttons and paper scraps. I think there is a time in our lives when stuff just needs to go into the trash and there is a fine line between calling it art. The books themselves are messy and I cannot, just cannot stand anything all over the place and messy. There is one project featuring a scary woman's face and buttons all over her head. What does it mean? What is the artist trying to point out? Why does it always have to be scary women faces from the last century? I can see a concept of recycling unwanted books, which could definitely bring out something nice, but why does it have to be with 100 year old pictures and leftover candy wrappers? Another thing I fail to understand in this and altered art in general is why do the bodies need to be switched out and replaced with children's heads? This book almost brings out things that are creepy and downright grotesque. It is a gallery book of creepy recyclable art, but at least if it is a gallery, by all means show how to make them for the people who are interested.

$REVIEW.: "Why I Am a Buddhist: No-Nonsense Buddhism with Red Meat and Whiskey" by Stephen T. Asma is an entertaining and interesting look at the author's journey into the practice of Buddhism that sheds light on much of what the practice can offer.  It's definitely not like most Buddhism books you'll find on the shelf.  At times, those more familiar with traditional texts will scratch their heads and ponder, "Did he really just say that?"  And that's one of the things I really liked about this book.  It offers a realistic approach, because it is the approach taken by Asma.  It's worked for him, and you may just find that it is okay to practice as you seem fit, not as others tell you, and it can work for you.The book actually contains many traditional lessons and is well researched in that aspect.  For the reader who knows nothing about Buddhism, there is a lot of information here to assist with knowing the differences between types of Buddhism practices and the basic teachings that are taught in these schools.  However, the real meat of the text, which I like that the author says you can practice Buddhism and still eat meat, is the author's personal journey and his reflections on how a person can live as a Buddhist in today's society.For anyone who has wondered about Buddhism as a spiritual practice to discover oneself, or if you just want to know more about Buddhism and don't want to read a classical text full of creeds and dogma, this book is an "enlightening" look at the Buddhist path toward enlightenment.  It's not so much religion, but a practice that has helped the author, and just might help you too.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.

$review_text.: I hadn't heard of of J Frank Norris until I received this book. At first glance, it would seem that the claim on the front cover that this was the murder trial that captivated America has simply been consigned to the dark archives of history - barely remembered.Yet this book is curiously captivating. David Stokes brings back in to the limelight what was certainly America's first mega church pastor - a congregation of over 6000 members, a newspaper and a radio station - J Frank Norris was nationally known, very successful and was equally loved and hated by many. And all this in the 1920's.Stokes does a wonderful job of drawing you into Norris' life. The actual description and meat of the trial does not get going until past page 110. Before this we have a potted biography of Norris' up bringing - a devout mother, a drunken father and a poor life. His way to success, through an apprenticeship in a Church, college and finally into the pastorate is fascinating. A forerunner of the fundamentalist movement and a 'sensationalist' preacher having no fear to preach on politics, or moral crusades, Norris' ministry grew - especially at First Baptist Fort Worth.Norris' character and sensationalist preaching made him enemies, sometimes powerful enemies. His church was burned down (although he was accused of burning it himself), he was shot at and his house was set on fire twice. But Norris was never one to be intimidated. He relished a fight and he always expected to win.However the rising star that was J Frank Norris almost came crashing down in 1926 when he shot a man in his church office, D E Chipps. What happened on that day and why J Frank Norris shot the man was the subject of the intense trial that followed.This is a fun, enjoyable and interesting read. Another great 'summer' book to enjoy on vacation!

$review_text.: Need You Now by Beth Wiseman is an excellent read.  It is a story about family and some real issues that families can face.  This story is about a married couple Brad and Darlene and their 3 growing kids.  They have recently moved from the city to a small town and are living in a house that Darlene grew up in.  Darlene has been a stay at home mom for years.  After their family's move, she begins to question her stay at home mom role.  Her husband has a successful job and is about to make partner.  The kids seem to be adjusting as well as can be expected to their new school.Darlene decides to take a job outside the home at a small school working with special needs children.  Darlene's job has her working one on one with a special needs girl.  She loves the improvements she sees in the girl, and this makes her feel successful and needed in her new job.Meanwhile at home, life is always interesting.  Brad and Darlene's son has a new girlfriend.  Grace, their middle daughter doesn't like to cause problems, but has made a new friend whose choice of clothing is not what Darlene would like their daughter to dress like.  Add to this - their neighbor next door, Layla, is a movie star.  As Darlene and  Layla become friends, Darlene finds opportunities to witness to Layla about God and His love.Darlene's job pulls her away from her family for an evening event.  Layla and Darlene go to the event for the school together and meet up with the father of the special needs girl that Darlene works with.Through the course of the story, Darlene and this girl's father find themselves together at different times.Without giving away some of the surprise turns in this story, I do want to mention that I found it very interesting and certainly planned by God that Layla and Darlene become friends.  Each woman has the opportunity to witness to the other in their time of need.I would highly recommend this book for a great, quick read.Thanks to Thomas Nelson for providing a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

Distrusting POTUS and his advisors especially Edward Bryce, Page ended his relationship with his girlfriend out of concern for her safety and underwent plastic surgery to alter his appearance.  Instead of spying, Page drives racing cars in Europe.However, someone Page trusts, current CIA Director Betty Richards contacts him as his nation and a close mutual friend need him.  While undercover seeking proof that Dirty War General Alfredo Estrada plans a coup d'etat, CIA agent Ted Dunn vanished in Argentina.  Additionally, attracted to Buenos Aires La Naci&oacute;n reporter Gina Galindo, Bryce arranges arms shipments to loyal supporters of Estrada.The latest Craig Page CIA thriller is an action-packed tale; as the hero tries to expose the ugly history of Estrada during the vicious Dirty War so this brute loses support while also preventing the arms reaching him.  Although the exhilarating storyline is much more straightforward than his previous missions (see The Russian Endgame, The Spanish Revenge and The China Gambit), readers will appreciate globetrotting Page's South American escapades.Harriet Klausner

$REVIEW.: I first read this book back in the late 1960s. As a history major at the time, I had been studying the naval war with Japan for many years and much about it just did not make sense. Why did the Japanese keep on making so many mistakes? There were not stupid, notwithstanding our own propaganda to that effect.After Captain Hara published his book, historians all over the world were jumping up and down. At last they had an inside view of how the Japanese military had been structured, how inflexible it had become, how it was strategically commanded not by naval staff, but by the needs of the Army. They also came to understand how in the early battles, the U.S. naval forces had fared so badly. Much of it was because of Captain Hara's torpedo doctrine and the navy's vastly superior long range oxygen driven torpedo. But the army was so focused on its own problems, it did not prepare for the obsolescence of its own equipment and/or the needs of the navy which it relied upon for so much.The Japanese naval high command was also a mess. It did not rely on battle hardened veterans, but rather stuck with its rigid class system and kept on promoting those who never understood the nature of the enemy they faced or the influence technology would have upon its outcome. That Captain Hara was critical of these commanders can only be seen as a very good thing. Many fine Japanese sailors died needlessly because of their errors. Hopefully, today they have eliminated these problems and will not be fighting the last war when the next one is forced upon them.I have recommended this book many times to young people who have shown an interest in the naval war in the Pacific. It is simply the best book to come out of the war, and notwithstanding the many fine military folks who disagree with me, preferring a more patriotic view, it reveals our enemy of the time in fine detail and tells a story of that conflict no one on our side could match. No study of the naval war could  be complete without a thorough understanding of Captain Hara's great adventures. If he made mistakes in his depiction of various battles and/or facts, as some here have claimed, those mistakes have been matched many times over by our own battle observers and writers. That is the nature of war and bias.Gerald Lane Summers.  See my own books.Mobley's Law, A Mobley Meadows Novel

$review_text.: Many others have summarized the plot of Simon Wood's latest novel, NO SHOW, so I'll be brief in that part of my review. Englishman Terry Sheffield arrives in San Francisco to meet his wife, who he hasn't seen in 6 months, pretty much since their elopement in Vegas. She's a no show at the airport, and she's nowhere to be found. The police question the legitimacy of their marriage and question how much Terry really knows his wife, since he actually knows so little about her he can't give them much to go on. While he's trying to piece together the puzzle, a woman turns up dead...and she turns out to be on a list of women his investigative journalist wife, Sarah, has compiled and kept hidden under a floor board. Terry increasingly realizes the danger she's in and is therefore increasingly desperate to find her before it's too late.I know many other reviewers found NO SHOW to be a heart-pounding story, but IMHO, it plodded along for the first half of the book. Wood wastes too many words on unimportant details such as describing how a character who's eating picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth. There were many such instances and they slowed the pace of the book. He also writes in such simplistic prose that when I first began reading, I thought he was a new author. The book wasn't written like the overwhelming majority of the books I've gotten through Vine. After he completed the story, it would have benefited from some serious editing for the first several chapters. He was nearly losing me in the unnecessary details. He eventually got out of the habit and once his writing improved, so did the story.About halfway through, the story really picked up steam and its elements were developed with less extraneous detail. I was fairly bored until then, to be honest. But there were still a lot of improbable aspects to the story, such as Terry not reporting numerous tips he'd uncovered about his wife's disappearance to the police. And he was surprisingly lackadaisical about his own personal safety and security after it was clear someone had broken into his home, a vaguely threatening person was calling him, and he realized his boss was up to something illegal. It was also hard to fathom Terry's love and devotion to the wife he barely knew, since they'd eloped to Vegas after knowing each other for only 18 months but only spending a few actual weeks together. Even as he began to learn the truth about her disappearance, their relationship didn't seem that noteworthy (and without giving something away, a particular development made me question if one of the spouses even had a clue what true love means). Wood didn't take enough time to illustrate the love that led these two people to marry each other without having lived on the same continent together, so their relationship wasn't as believable. I wasn't feeling it.Once things get going, the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, particularly the ending (although the very end is kind of ridiculous). Perhaps because I never felt a true sense of urgency due to Wood's writing style, I didn't feel the final chapters to be as heart-pounding as other readers did. I didn't expect any aspect of the ending, so he got me there.It's a good read, but not a great one. It's not what I would call a true thriller. The second half is great, so if you can slog through the first half, you'll likely enjoy it in the end.

$REVIEW.: This is a beautiful kids' book that is not only pleasant to look at, but also teaches a great lesson. All too often, kids and adults are guilty of basing a person's personality on the way they look. This book brings the value of that lesson back to the forefront of not only children's minds, but also our own. It is done in a beautiful way that makes it fun to learn such a valuable lesson by using fish and sharks, which ever kids loves.

$review_text.: Fast paced is how I'd described this novel. A real, no holds barred old school thriller of the Tom Clancy school. Major world events, nuclear threats, intelligence agencies and special forces work together to stop the world from being destroyed.With events both played out on the world stage and up close, following the efforts of a special ops computer expert and hacker as he goes all out to try and stop the threat against the world. One of those books you read very quickly. I read a large chunk of it on a plane journey, and I finished it off over a few days sat on the beach. Compelling stuff.

$review_text.: From the first book till this one I was really excited to start this story

I love how this story started off
It truly unfolds nicely from the first book till the next


It makes you ready to start the next and to learn each individual character
Ghost is truly magnificent and just love how his character faces his challenges head on as they unravel throughout the story.I felt sadness with Andrea as Nathan left on the mission that you read about in the first novel

You truly can feel what the characters feel about what they go through
P.T

Macias  offers each individual thoughts and she has an unique writing style that I haven't seen in any other books that I have read


She mixes spanish with and what they mean as you read it.Andrea was a great character

She faced and conquered something that you see happen in real life

If you have a chance i highly recommend you read this book and if you haven't already pick up the first book and read it

You will truly enjoy every minute of it.

$REVIEW.: I just finished Parker's Past and I liked it. This one I would say could be read first or second to Saving Chloe. Parker Beaumont is a don't let girls sleep over at any time kinda of guy. You know this in Saving Chloe but this one really shows it. There are reasons that Parker is this way. This is in his point of view and man do you really get to read it. This is a no holding back story but it was well worth the read. Parker is still sexy and hot and you get to see why he is the way he is.This is a very quick yet satisfying read one I'm sure you will like.Story 4Sex 4Overall 4Reviewed by Shay for Crystal's Many Reviewers

$review_text.: The books starts with page after page after page of why the author wrote the book, why it's different, why you might want to work at home, etc. All fluff. Get to the point instead of spending 10% of the book telling me why I'm lucky to have the book.After this long introduction, the book is an alphabetical list of companies that have online links to available jobs, not just work at home jobs.In fact, I clicked on one link and the next page at the company site and I got this: **Candidates MUST BE a U.S. CITIZEN AND HOLD a current TOP SECRET with CI Poly - U.S. Government Security Clearance to be considered for this position.****Must be located in the METRO D.C. area or be willing to relocate to that area**I guess that's the killer job. Sounds like it pays well, but I don't have 6-8 years experience, hold a Top Secret clearance, or live in Washington D.C.If you want a book that has a lot of links to possible work at home jobs, then maybe this is what you need. Don't expect a concise list of jobs that pay x-amount that are Killer Jobs.

It had a good plot that kept me turning the pages. The hero (Ethan) shocked me... I didn't think I would like him right away, but I really did. I totally fell in love with him. Even more shocking was I found myself annoyed with the heroine (Lily) a time or two. She was still likable but I found she was too hard on Ethan.I definitely like the way this author writes a story, it flows so nicely. She captivates right from the beginning and she keeps you interested throughout.I'm excited to start book 3 in the series! I highly recommend both book one and book two so far!

$review_text.: If it were not for Loree Lough I doubt I would have ever picked up a Harlequin book. I had those ideas of what I thought a Harlequin novel contained and it wasn't heartwarming Christian themes. But thanks to Loree I now know how wrong I was. Friends, there are some amazing books published by Harlequin. Don't let the name fool you. You can go to the website and find many novels to choose from that will leave your heart smiling.Raising Connor is part of the Heartwarming Selection at Harlequin. Another new release from Loree is, "Devoted To Drew". This is one I can't wait to read!!Loree is at the top of my favorites list. I have had the pleasure of reading many of her books and I tell you, she just amazes me with the stories she brings. Just as in this one, the characters are real. They are family and friends we can connect to.  We see that every story doesn't end as we had hoped. It's hard to find a perfect ending in an imperfect world. But every once in a while we get that perfect ending. This is what Connor receives.Connor's parents are killed in an accident. He is left with Brooke, his aunt, only this isn't what his parents wished for. They want Connor to be raised by Hunter. Hunter happens to be a police officer who fell asleep on the job, during a robbery, that took the life of Connor's grandmother. Anger, resentment, and bitterness cloud Brooke. She has never been able to forgive. She hasn't understood how Connor's parents could have been such great friends with Hunter. But Hunter has been part of this family. He has loved Connor and wants to raise him. He uncovers the wishes of Connor's parents and now questions himself as to what he should do.This story is delightful. There are moments when I was cheering for Hunter. I would then turn and cheer for Brooke. Most of all, I cheered for Connor. You just wanted the best for these characters who leave an impact. Life is unexpected and so uncertain. It's so sweet to pick up a book and escape into another time and place that leaves us full.This book was a gift from Loree Lough for sharing my review with you.

$REVIEW.: Jasinda Wilder makes you feel what the characters are going through ... from sexy lust to angst to out and out anger. She is a very, very good writer. This book was filled with all lots of lust, sex, angst and many other emotions.Kyrie's life gets very tough after her father is murdered. She is left to take financial responsibility for both her mother and brother. Her mother is hospitilazied long term for mental illnesses and Kyrie has to foot the bill.Her brother moved away to attend college and Kyrie is footing his tuition as well as her own.  To say that she has it tough financially and emotionally is an understatement. So when an eviction notice and being fired from her temp job happens she is ready to break until she receives an envelop in the mail for $10 thousand dollars. She doesnt know who sent it or why and she doesnt want to cash it because she realizes that nothing is for free. Kyrie is a tough, independent girl but she also knows when she is losing the battle. She cashes the check. The first three checks contain a small message that end up say you belong to me. So she knows there is payment due. The checks keep coming every month for 1 year and she keeps cashing them. I guess you'd have to ask yourself, would you do the same thing? If desperate enough most people would. After a year it's payment time. Although she has no idea her life will change forever at this moment.The person behind the checks is Valentine Roth. When he collects Kyrie for payment he tells her that he has a secret that he will reveal when he is ready and he knows that once he does she will leave him. Valentine is wonderful, rich, sensative, handsome and the absolute perfect man. He is seductive and honest in all that he says and does. You will love Valentine Roth. There arrangement progresses until he reveals his secret then everything in Kyrie's world changes.This is a really good book. There was alot of sex throught out and I skimmed thru alot of but I think the foreplay, build up and actual sex scenes were important to the book because it created a connection between Valentine and Kyrie. It wasn't just about the act of sex which you will learn.You'll feel the emotions throughout this book and you wont be dissapointed.Must Read.

I shall leave it to other reviewers to tell you about the storyline. For me personally I felt that the author is not only very talented and a quite gifted writer, who was able to hold my attention throughout the book. I also loved the way she developed her characters with all their highs and lows, bringing impossible thoughts together and making them believable while keeping me guessing as to what was coming next. The  characters were so varied in their makeup, their lives - sometimes outrageously  so - yet it was all brought together to create a very enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: So by the 2nd page I'm hooked by Jessie's "glimpses" when she touches antiques. I love how the author doesn't waste time and just jumps right in. If I like a book right away it's always a good sign. This story line was something different than I'd read before ~ from dreams to time travel~ which is what makes indie books so refreshing to me.So there's a decent amount of "omigods" and falling in love in half a minute, but I needed to remind myself the characters were young but they were not whiny....I could totally live with this. The mall scene was a little silly, but not enough to ruin anything. I felt the chemistry and was rooting for Jessie and Steve straight away. Then it got even better. And soon enough I was rooting for someone else too. At first I could guess what might happen next, but it certainly didn't stop me from turning the pages, then I couldn't guess what would be next and it was even better.At points I felt confused or wondered if there was a mistake in the book. I had to go back several times and reread, but then it all plays out and that is what makes this book so good. They were not mistakes! The romance is sweet, it's intense, it's a slow burn, it's AMAZING. I fell in love and I cried....I need more!

$REVIEW.: Initially, I misunderstood this book's title, incorrectly assuming that Kevin Allen - in the manner of someone who has planned a treasure hunt - would help his reader to locate something of substantial value. In a sense that is true. However, that "something" is essentially worthless unless and until (a) the person who uncovers it understands and appreciates it and (b) knows how to use it to best advantage. Case in point, vandals raiding the ancient library in Alexandria used copies of plays by Greek playwrights such as Aeschylus and Sophocles as fuel for their fires.I selected the title of this review from a longer passage in the Introduction: "Get it? Get what? The `what' is the [begin italics] hidden agenda [end italics], the emotional motivator behind all the statistics, the business jargon, and the other things that surround any key business issue. It is in fact how people make decisions, with their hearts."Allen is a veteran advertising executive and an accomplished "pitch man" but clearly agrees with John Hill, co-founder of Hill & Knowlton, that the best pitch is one that offers "truth well told." He shares everything he has learned about how to prepare and then present such a pitch for the readers whom he characterizes as "you dreamers, strivers, fighters, doers, and itchy-feet people `growth aspirants." Allen is convinced that, for them, their ability to pitch "is the very spearpoint and lifeblood of achieving these ambitions."The reader is provided with an abundance of information, insights, and counsel to help achieve strategic objectives such as these:o  Locating the "hidden agenda"o  Identifying the "conceptual target"o  Connecting with the hidden agendao  Defining one's "core"o  Selecting and articulating one's "credo"o  Defining the characteristics of "real" ambitiono  Formulating one's "win" strategyo  Mastering the power of storytellingAllen is a results-driven pragmatist, determined to understand what works, what doesn't, and why so that he can then share with others what he has learned. Whether or not people realize it, they are making pitches every day and usually draw upon most (if not all) of these resources of rhetoric: exposition to explain with information, description to make vivid with compelling details, narration to tell a story or explain a sequence, and finally, argumentation to convince with logic and/or evidence.  If you want others to "get it" when you communicate with them, then you need to locate "it" and decide how best to present it. Kevin Allen offers practical advice whose value is incalculable.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out the selections in Kevin Allen's "Further Reading" section. Also, these: Robert B. Cialdini's Influence: Science and Practice (4th Edition), Carmine Gallo's The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience, and The Story Factor (2nd Revised Edition) by Annette Simmons and Doug Lipman.

$review_text.: Highly recommended for hard SciFi action adventure, mystery, virtual reality, addicts speculating about the coming AI revolution..This two volume set (Post-Human, Trans-Human  (Books 3 and 4)) is in my opinion the best of the series. From the start it is totally different from the first 2 books, and you think you are reading a different SciFi series. I had to check.The plot moves along fast, like an action adventure mystery, and together with the principal character you try to figure out what is happening. Great story. Good writing.As in the first two books you get an excess of torture that at times seems gratuitous. It seems like the torture in the Game of Thrones; long, pointless and not advancing the story. But at least you discover the reason for the torture in this book. It is an integral part of the plot.The ending is unexpected and surprising and it ties neatly into the previous books of the series. You want to read more. But you already have! Surprise!!.

$review_text.: I am not a photographer but I've used various image editing software for website development including Adobe Photoshop and several other retail packages.  I used GIMP occasionally when I wasn't in a crunch for time but could never quite fully master it until now.  I knew everything I needed was there, but finding and using the various tools just used too much time.Whether you are a photographer or not, you can work your way through this book or use the table of contents to skip to the functionality you need.Using this text you will learn enough about image formats to truly understand what you are doing.  I have finally found a reference which makes GIMP sufficient for all my needs.  It's a masterpiece of just enough theory followed by the nuts and bolts of how to accomplish any image editing task.  What was really a pleasant surprise was that I am able to fix a variety of problems with my own family and vacation photos that I never could fix before; I am truly an amateur at photo touchup. This book is long overdue and DEFINITELY Recommended!

$REVIEW.: THE LIGHTKEEPER'S DAUGHTER by Colleen Coble was a good read, though at times it seemed to drag.Addie Sullivan has spent her life in a northern California lighthouse.  Loved by her father and seemingly tolerated by her mother, she knows no different life.  After her father's passing, an injured stranger happens upon Battery Point Lighthouse, insisting she is the long lost daughter of the wealthy Eaton family.  As Mr. Driscoll tells Addie of the storm that killed her mother and supposedly took the life Julia Eaton (her), she looks to her mother for the truth.  With little more than disdain, her mother tells Addie how it is she came to be her daughter.  Realizing the woman she has never been able to please isn't her mother, Addie decides to go with Mr. Driscoll to Mercy Falls.  Once there, she will become the nanny to her father's grandson while Mr. Driscoll finds more proof of her heritage.  With a whole new world of wealth and prestige available to her, Addie is immediately overwhelmed by her surroundings, and the very handsome Lieutenant North, the man who's son she has been hired to care for.As Mr. Driscoll hires investigators to look into Addie's background, Addie does some investigating of her own.  When she finds her deceased mother's writing desk and a secret compartment that holds a cryptic clue, she wonders if there is anyone at Eaton Manor she can trust, because it is obvious things are not what they appear.  With her affections for Lt. North growing, she takes him into her confidence and together they try to unravel the mystery of who she is, and why it is someone is trying to kill her.I enjoyed THE LIGHTKEEPER'S DAUGHTER, especially the last third of the book.  There were a lot of fact-gathering chapters that at times caused the story to drag, but with as many plots and twists that Ms. Coble included the information proved important in the end (if you could keep track of it all).  The characters were well fleshed out.  I enjoyed Addie's naivet&eacute; and spunk, and of course, Lt. North was the perfect hero.  The setting was romantic and mysterious, and was the perfect dramatic backdrop for the story that unfolded.  Not my favorite Coble novel, but it held my interest enough that I have the sequel, THE LIGHTKEEPER'S BRIDE on order.

$REVIEW.: This is a fun and useful book.  It's helpful for breaking down wardrobe organization and for informing shopping purchases.  For me, it helped me objectively assess what I already own, and to discover that I already have much of what I need!  I did buy it used via Amazon, and as a young professional on a budget, I would not have been quite as happy with the book if I had paid full price.  (Though maybe that's just my own personality -- there aren't may fashion books I would pay more than, say, $10 for and feel  good about it.)  That being said, money spent on this book is a good investment -- the book has helped me organize and objectively assess what I already own.  It's more helpful to me than the InStyle book and others which are similar.

$REVIEW.: This was an ok read. The first book was a little better but the author was creating a new world with some interesting characters. I was intrigued enough the read this sequel. The writing feels very juvenile to me. The sex scenes are boring and the dialog is terrible at times. Again this series had potential and I hope the author will work a little harder on the next to save the series. I felt no connection with Nathan or Rox  and they are the two main characters getting their HEA. Two books in and I'm done with this one.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this boxed set of Grandberry Falls. It allowed me to download it to my Kindle and instead of searching for the next book it was right there next in line. The stories were entertaining and down to earth and I felt I could connect with each character. The last book in this series seemed like it was out of place and more disjointed as if it was written in a hurry but was enjoyable nonetheless. I really wanted the books to somehow reference activities or some of the high points of the previous books to join them together into something a bit more cohesive but I can understand why the author might not so that you could read these books separate and not feel lost.Enjoyable series and a quick read.

$REVIEW.: Barbara Sher has done it again.  She has written a book for people like you and me who want to do it all. Scanners is her word for people who are forging ahead in all directions at once. Those who have several projects going at once.  Fear not we are normal.  We are curious beings who delight in our inquisitive minds and that is who we are and that is all right.  It's okay to have many careers going at once.  It's also okay to pursue many interests one right after the other without seeming to finish any.  Our goal could be to revel in our dreams as many as they may be.  In her book she gives guidelines for catching all of our ideas.  Even though we may or may not follow through on any of them.  We can be our own Da Vinci and create journals for future reference or our historical archives to share with future generations.  Being a scanner is a good thing, give yourself permission Barbara does. She tells you it's okay, in fact it's more than okay to pursue your dreams -- ALL of them.  I can't put this book down.

$review_text.: As a young man I heard a young, Ashkie-revolutionary, attorney friend aver that Ho Chi Minh was merely a "leader of his people who was 'engaged' in a civil war" with a brutal and corrupt regime who were suppressing their people.  When monks self immolated the question of our American presence in this wholly regional matter was constantly propounded.  And why were we aiding a corrupt regime so hated by its own people, one entwined with war mongering, profit-seeking, American corporate interests who were pushing war in tandem with their congressional sponsors? Most of all it was reported that we were running wild, doing drugs, and killing babies and grandmothers for sport.  Why was this was the most misreported war in history?  Because those in our country who favored a socialist system as a bulwark against a possible theocracy were on the side of the Soviets.  And the Soviet communists (aided by Maoist China) were backing the north Vietnam communists to the hilt.  But this was no civil war! It was as if North Korea had decided to invade South Korea. Viet Nam was a battle in the Cold War where Soviet Communism was fomenting communist revolutions in every world hot spot - Korea, the Philipines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, western Europe, The 'Stans, Africa, the middle-east, Cuba, central America, you name it, they were there.  But we were the bad guys? That's a laugh.Jennings does a terrific job of setting the record straight from JFK's 1956 script to the South Vietnamese Colonel's letter, they say it all.  Everyone should read this book if for nothing else than to scrape off the layers of propaganda smeared on our society by people like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Tom Hayden, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan and others too numerous to count.  In retrospect it's just stomach turning what our 1975 congress allowed to happen to the people of south Vietnam after the northern communists illegally invaded them.  Read anything by David Horowitz and Peter Collier, they've got it right.  And again, thank you Phil Jennings.

$REVIEW.: Love the recent riveting revision to The Jilted Bride, however, it does remain true to Ms. Richards' style. For instance, her classic character self-chastising: Great going, Jody! You really scared him off now. He thinks you're propositioning him. Idiot! Explain yourself. Love it! Of course, Shadonna always manages to sneak in some good advice, but it's never preachy. A fave by Mae West opens the book: A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one. As always, a fun, light read that you can devour quickly. Yet you leave the pages feeling satisfied and uplifted!

$REVIEW.: Sometimes in war, fighting men and women are assigned to missions that are not only exceptionally dangerous, but achieving a successful outcome borders on the impossible. Also during combat, details of events can be blurred or misstated--intentionally or unintentionally--resulting in heroes looking like cowards and vice versa.Those elements were present in a British Special Forces operation in Iraq during the Second Gulf War, in March 2003. M Squadron with 60 men, was tasked to travel 1,000 kilometers behind enemy lines to accept the surrender of the 100,000-strong Iraqi Army 5th Corps. However, when M Squadron reached its objective, 5th Corps was far from ready to surrender. Against overwhelming odds in numbers, firepower and supplies, M Squadron fought a tenacious battle for its very survival until it could be extracted. The fight they put up was truly one for the books! But unfortunately, some dubbed M Squadron as the ones who ran away from the enemy.Now, in Zero Six Bravo, author Damien Lewis sets the record straight and details the many acts of valor and heroism performed by the members of M Squadron in the hostile environment of the Iraqi desert. Thank you Mr. Lewis, for doing such a great job in getting the true story of M Squadron out there. The public need to know and the participants deserve it.

$REVIEW.: Read this book in one sitting. It was an enjoyable quick read, excellent for a debut novel. I got it for $0.99, so even better. H and h were likable. They spent a lot of time alone together in the book due to plot. So while the reader did not get to see a great deal of day to day activity in the MC, there were glimpses of the MC life. Good guy anti-hero type, not perfect, a definite bad boy. (To me, this aspect is important as if I don't like the Hero, I generally can't love the book.)***(spoilers - h is forced to be at safe house with H for her protection. Unbeknownst to her Father, they have already met. At very beginning of book, they had a one night stand where the heroine left without leaving information about herself, the Hero was left on the unusual receiving end of being the one left and wanting more.)***This is a standalone, no cheating, happily ever after book.

$REVIEW.: I read this book during the 2008 Republican National Convention, and what a stark contrast between the rhetoric from the podium and the facts (documented in this book and its 55 pages of references).  The title "Web of Deceit" is (if anything) too mild for the tale within, which goes way beyond deceit and is far more pervasive than a simple web.  Perhaps a better title would have been "Fabric of Disaster" or "Imperial Hubris."The book documents 86 years of Mesopotamian history, from the British creation of Iraq in 1921 from unrelated warring factions, to the state of open civil war between those same warring factions in late 2006.  This book was completed sometime after the start of Saddam's trial in August 2006 but before his subsequent execution in December.  Needless to say, conditions in Iraq have not markedly improved, making the book still very timely.Iraqi history is appalling in its greed, avarice, inhumanity and cruelty -- both from within and outside the country of Iraq.  There's no point recounting the sober and well-researched narrative of the book, you can and should read it yourself if you're interested in the truth instead of propaganda.The author makes clear that the absurd calls for "victory in Iraq" will first have to define exactly what that would entail.  From Iraq's sad and blood-soaked history, such a chimera is by no means obvious.

$review_text.: We travel for two months at a time each year.  The last two years were in Turkey -- as will be this year's trip.  Our practice is to travel cheap, moving from place to place in short hops every couple days.  For the next three years, we plan to do the same thing in the Balkans.  I ordered this guide to aid in planning our trips.First, I would like to address comments in two other reviews.  Yes, this is a heavy book.  I don't know if I would actually take it on the trip.  And on my copy the blue tabs are all properly labeled.  My experience has been that the Kindle edition is awkward to use for detailed planning, but is great for traveling.  We often whip out the Kindle in bus stations and on street corners when we need a refresher.Eastern Europe is a big bite to chew up in one book.  Lonely Planet, in my opinion, does an excellent job, within limits.  It would be rediculous to expect the same coverage as a single-country, dedicated guide would provide.  But combined with the Internet it is proving to be an excellent planning tool.We will be traveling to multiple countries.  Until I received this guide, I found it difficult to put everything into perspective well enough to make travel plans.  I would not recommend this guide for someone visiting only one country, but I cannot imagine another single source that would be as helpful to the multi-country traveler.And I particularly appreciate that Lonely Planet includes common phrases for all the languages one might expect to find.If a book like this assists in avoiding even one blunder, it is worth the price.

$REVIEW.: It was the first time reading a book that hadn't been reviewed. I was hesitant.The hero, Ewan's near death experience leads him to want to take a hand fasted bride for a year and a day to obtain an heir. He chooses Cait (who has quite a background). She has been in love with Ewan since they were teens. The entire book focuses on the feelings both characters encounter through this marriage. Ewan realizes he loves Cait, but cannot tell her. Like most romances, misunderstandings and miscommunication plague the couple, tearing them apart before Cait can tell Ewan of her pregnancy.The author did a fine job of defining the characters. Although the situation bringing the characters together may be far fetched, their interactions, reactions and thought processes are very realistic. A Year and a Day was a pleasant, romantic read complete with intrigue, a little mystery and the always welcome, Highland clan defending a castle (warning: a little racy after the marriage vows). I recommend reading this book.

Ms. Densley's story grabs you in the first chapter and holds you till you are long finished and still thinking about the how much you wish you could still be there with your new friends.  My next book will be another of Ms. Densley's and then another.

$REVIEW.: Beginning of a hero is the opening look at the Fantasy world and legends of the land of Windemere. We follow Luke a young Forest Stalker as he attempts to achieve the status of a Hero which would place him at the pinnacle of society. He has trained vigorously and now has the opportunity to take on an assignment to protect the daughter of royalty from formidable and evil forces.  I'll say no more about the plot since it is woven so tightly and with such high expertise, highlighting  some of the little parts may just be the thread to give away some of the story. The story is told in the present tense which adds richness and compels the reader to be involved.  The plot unfolds and the reader feels as if they have helped bring some of the resolution to issues that confront Luke in his quest.As far as the genre is concerned, the author adds enough magic, intrigue, and special characters to make the story a delight while keeping it real enough to be feasible. There is none of the cheating that I have found in other stories. What I mean by this is the characters are forced to work out their problems without relying on some unheard of or really outrageous magic trick used to solve the problem. All the magic and spells have a clear rationale and good explanation as to their limitations. This makes the story so much more enjoyable.The action scenes are well choreographed so the reader has a real sense of what is going on and where the action is taking place. The bravery and the skill of the characters is very believable. There are causalities as one would expect and a great amount of tension around the possible outcomes.This is a sophisticated and delightful read. I recommend this book to lovers of Fantasy or to General Fiction readers. The story is compelling enough to entertain a wide audience.

$REVIEW.: This series is just getting to be too much &#34;same old, same old&#34;


There is far too little character development of  any of the characters.For heavens sake they have had now between them what 11 children and we know so very little about them.

Let see: they still have problems with the Burley boys, they still swim in the river and go to town every so often.and there servant and/or there lovers mess around with the wrong people
 Far to much boring time with Alex and Matthew spent on Alex and Matthews bedroom time and fighting time


Far too little time is spent on the time change factor, Alexis Mother and her paintings


I have a personal policy of never reading more than a trilogy as when I have I am always disappointed and here I am disappointed that I gave this book series one more chance..This is the was the last of  I will read of this so=called time slip saga.I am sorry I wasted my time on the last two books with hopes that it would develop
I am back to my policy of no more than a trilogy

It is sad because so many authors can give so much more to us as readers in a single book but this is not the case with Anna Belfrage.

$SUMMARY.: No more of this series for me as I am done with reading too much of the same thing over and over.

$review_text.: I really don't like books written in first person at all.  I read one book by Megan Hart whom everyone seems to love and I felt it so lacking because it was in first person that I've tried not to read books in first person for that very reason.  THIS BOOK REALLY SURPRISED ME!  Written in first person, I still felt it very well rounded.  I did get feelings and emotions from Ryan even though he was not able to express them through the use of first person, as  Jacqueline was the storyteller in this book.  I became immersed--I found myself being Jacqueline so much so when there were problems and Ryan asked if it was a black/white issue I was shocked to learn "I" was black!  The whole time reading this story I felt as if I was Jacqueline and I'm as white as they get. And yes there is a scene where Ryan is showing Jacqueline herself in the mirror and she sees herself, but I guess I saw only me.  So I have to give such kudos for this as I hadn't even realized Jacqueline could look like anything other than myself.Ryan truly loves her, he gives her all she wants and all she needs.  I loved how he had two separate names for her to separate their relationship at work from at home.  Jax, his mentor, at work; and Jacqueline, the vivacious, beautiful woman he dominated "when she was tired and heading home early".This is the first story I've read by Evangeline Anderson and I will definitely read more--even if it is in 1st person.  For me she made it a believable story, and I felt I got emotion from everyone involved and not just the storyteller as I so often have felt in previous 1st person books I've read.

$REVIEW.: This is a richer novel than its predecessor, the stakes much higher and the consequences more far-reaching. Friendships and loyalties are tested as the War heats up.Blalock is very effective at putting the reader `there,' his descriptions of location and the environment, whether in the physical or cyber world, are vivid and thorough. The action also moves at a fair clip, and desperation permeates every scene.I enjoyed this novel very much. The characters interact convincingly, and you are never sure who to trust and quite what everyone's motives are. Very ambitious in its scope: some of its protagonists have existed over millennia, and the action takes place across many dimensions, this holds your attention and delivers.Blalock clearly knows his history and mixes this with the world of gaming. In the second novel in this series it feels like many of his ideas and plot strands are beginning to pay off.Part thriller, part sci-fi, part fantasy: Traitor Angel combines all of these elements to pleasing effect. It is a nice quick, easy read, and most importantly it entertains. By the time you reach the end you still get the impression that the best is yet to come.

$REVIEW.: Falling for Jack by Joanne HillJack's life is a mess.  His supermodel girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend and he gets a phone call out of the blue from a former girlfriend explaining that for the past eight years she has been raisng his son without informing him he was a father.  With the media hot on his trail and having a child involved,  he asked an old high school aquaintance, Robyn,  a single mother with twins if she would help care for his son, Eric , until he can find a permanent caregiver.Robyn had an incredibly bright future.  She was given a full scholorship and was in pre-med when she suddenly dropped out and never completed her education.  Now she is divorced, trying to raise her twins without much help from their father and run a business.  When she and Jack strike up a conversation it's really just a &#34;Hey, don't I know you?&#34;  sort of thing.  But, they talk awhile and when Jack needs help with Eric,  Robyn seemed like the perfect person.  Robyn agrees to help him but something tells her Jack is going to become a big problem for her.This sweet romance chronicles the massive changes that Jack's life takes in a very short period of time.  Robyn's decision to take the job Jack offered has her more involved in Jack's life than she intended.  She helps him adjust to parenthood,  tries to help him bridge the gap between himself and his family,  helps the young pregnant woman abandoned by Jack's best friend, and deals with her own disappointments and her perceived failures.This is the type of thing real people deal with on a daily basis.  Parenthood is difficult,  job pressures,  relationships with family, and the our own goals, hopes and dreams round out life giving us good times and stressful times and bad times.  I liked how the book felt so down to earth without a lot of immature angst.  These were adult people that while they had their share of pity parties they also behaved like mature people just trying to cope with how things turned out for them.There were some moments when the daily routines got a bit like, well, like a  daily routine.  I do wish we could have had a little more romance between Jack and Robyn.  I can see why Robyn might have drawn the conclusion that Jack was just looking for a woman to help him out rather than someone he actually was in love with.  So, a tiny bit of steam level  would have been nice.  I think the falling in love part for this couple sort of snuck up behind them and tapped them on the shoulder and said,  &#34; Wow! I love this person&#34;.  This too was so natural and right but it was also too low key for romance readers.The setting of New Zealand was nice for a change of pace, but one will have to adjust to the different way of  wording things and certain phrases might not be familiar  if you are from the US.Overall this is was a pleasant enough read and I think this author shows potential.  I have one or two more books by Joanne Hill in my TBR list and I'm looking forward to seeing how those turn out.  This one gets 3 stars.

$REVIEW.: Dalton & Peaches ~ what a phenomenal couple and. What I really loved about this book is that Peaches (Petra) and her reactions, feelings and anxieties are REAL. She is not a supermodel, she has real life problems and fears and meeting Dalton shakes her entire world up and makes her look at herself from a better and more confident perspective. The 2 of them banter and try to figure each other out while working through their own secrets (many that we are still not privy to:( And people, they are HOT as a couple ~ the author's adjectives are perfect and oftentimes made me laugh out loud!Funny, sexy, heartwarming and a fantastic read - I did receive this as an ARC from the author and am so glad to have had the chance to read it before it was officially published. I highly recommend and cannot wait for the 2nd installment!!!

Too bad it's her college sweetheart who left her broken hearted, and with those mesmerizing eyes of his it'll take everything she's got to not fall for his charms again.Max left for what he thought was good reason, coming back has one purpose and one purpose only, he needs his inheritance


The mountain man look he's adopted over the last 7 years though just won't cut it in corporate America, and his sneaky mother has hired an image consultant to get him looking the part


He'll do whatever it takes to get to his money, but he never imagined coming across Victoria again

Now to keep his hands off her
Easier said than done, and as the two spend time together the sparks they shared all those years ago comes back with a vengeance.Victoria has had her share of heartache, but she's stronger because of it and doesn't let anyone get in her way of getting what she wants
Even a stubborn rugged man like Max

Max had his funny moments, but for most of the book he definitely wasn't my favorite guy
In fact I thought him a bit of a chicken shit for running away, but he does manage to redeem himself in the end
They are quite the pair together and it was fun watching the push and pull between them


I do wish we had seen more of their backgrounds, but overall I did enjoy this short story.

$review_text.: Kayla Turner has nothing except the old beat up car her mom gave her and her few belongings in a suitcase, and now her father who she has been estranged from is dead.  The least she can do is go to his funeral.  Darren Ackwood is the town hottie that women can't resist, he has the reputation of being a playboy and a bit of a man-whore, yet he is still the most beautiful man Kayla Turner has ever seen, even if she can't stand him.  When Darren sees Kayla, he is a bit flabbergasted by her beauty, but then he remembers the things she has done, or the things &#34;he thinks&#34; she has done, and feels the same way about her.  Kayla and Darren have a lot more in common than they know or want to admit to, both flat broke, both have been dealt a bad hand in life, and both of them are desperate, which is how end up in their present situation, thanks to the late Mr. Turner's stipulations in his will.  They find themselves stuck with each other, literally, and things really begin to get interesting and then some.Perfect Kind of Trouble is a delightful and funny story that also has it's sexy and serious moments in the mix.  I really enjoyed getting to know both Kayla and Darren's characters.  They both make assumptions about one another that aren't true, and in the process of &#34;the quest&#34; Kayla's father has sent them on, they come to find out who the other really is, both realizing that their feelings for each other are changing.  The banter between these two and the situations they find themselves in will keep you laughing, while the romance has just the right amount of sizzle. Perfect Kind of Trouble can also be read as a standalone.  If you enjoy contemporary romance, then Perfect Kind of Trouble is something you should consider checking out.

Her friends had asked her on how her summer was and if she had met any body special like they had did. Jordan felling pressured and said that she did met somebody special, but thank god the bell rang for classes to begin. From then Jordan tried to avoid all of her friends including Jenifer. At home her mother had gotten a letter from her old friend Mrs. Elliot. She seemed to be upset so I didn't even try to bother her. The next morning Jordan snuck the picture of Ryan and took it to school so that her friends could believe that her pretend boyfriend was real. After school her Mom told her that her friend Mrs.  Elliot had broken up with her husband and that she and her son Ryan was coming to live with them just until Mrs. Elliot could find a place to live on their own... as the time went by Jordan had kept lying about her And Ryan's relationship.....I thought the book was one of the greatest books I ever read, but I was not expecting Ryan's reaction at the end. Otherwise it was a very good book.

 When I read the book, I was floored


 The archetypal imagery caused me to feel it in my whole body; I can certainly understand why it won the award

 I know I would have loved this book as a child, as from a young age I was drawn to the darker aspects of life


 Some children need to explore darkness

 Exploring it helps them to understand how it works in their own lives
 This is an amazing psychological treatment of wounding, betrayal, remorse, and finally redemption.I'm a writer and writing teacher, and I've used this book with adults to teach them the power of archetypes
 This is truly a book for all ages.

$review_text.: Like many other reviewers i have been anxiously awaiting this third book in the central series. it was a relatively quick read, but i would highly recommend you read the other two books before attempting it, there are too many complicated devices to pick up mid way through. There is lots of action and intrigue and the way things progress you get a nice balance of answers to things from previous books as well as new questions for the next book. I can not wait to see what the opening line is for book four...my one complaint is probably there are too many points of view for this book. it made things feel very disjointed as I read through, i would often have to read for a few paragraphs before i could even identify whose POV i was seeing.All in all a great read and a terrific series for any who like urban fantasy, and at the low price of 99c for over 500 pages, you really cant complain.

But when her childlessness threatens what is left of the family fortune, her husband forces her to lie with one of their top gladiators.She wasn't supposed to enjoy it. And she certainly wasn't supposed to go on to further erotic adventures.Marcus and Caius, the top gladiators in the ludum, are brothers-in-arms, and lovers in bed. The sex scenes - between the two of them, between Alba & Marcus, Alba & Caius, and among the three of them, together, are sizzling hot. The historical details, especially about the clothing, felt authentic, though I haven't studied up on that period.Still, I didn't see how there could possibly be a HEA, but Spartacus helped them out, even if he didn't know he was helping.

I don't need to read about Vlad shooting humans and then 10 paragraphs later, still the same chapter, have a character recount the entire story that every character in the room heard 10 paragraphs earlier.  This is just one example but it happens over and over again in both books.  The storyline has promise and I believe could be great if the redundancies were edited out.Update: I'm still reading but I'm about ready to ask for my money back.  Location 669 Rand tells Lucas he skyped with Samantha and they discuss the conversation.  Go forward to location 726 and Lucas says "I didn't know you skyped with Samantha".  Seriously?!?!

This is the story of Elyse who was brought into the McCord home after living a life of crime with her parents and then witnessing her mother's death.  She has become painfully shy because of her past and has found in Andrew a person that she feels comfortable with.  Andrew has a past of his own that he is trying to deal with and the two have to learn to trust each other enough to share their lives fully with each other.  I enjoyed both of the main characters and the struggles they had to overcome.  I also liked the side stories Christine Lynxwiler added in to both wet our apetite for the next book and add a little depth to this one.  I'm looking forward to Kaleigh's story which I assume is next in the series.*I received this book free from the publisher through Netgalley.

$REVIEW.: Each page of this &#34;book&#34; contains a title and one or two sentences, so the 106 pages of &#34;secrets&#34; equates to about a five-page list of statements (many with horrible grammar)

 To anyone who has spent more than ten minutes playing Minecraft, many of the secrets presented will be known or obvious


 Several pages are duplicitous in content


 Some statements identify bugs/glitches in Minecraft that have since been corrected by the game's developer, making them obsolete.This book's title is misleading and its lack of content makes it a borderline rip-off.

$REVIEW.: Awesome short story. Puts you right IN Viet Nam as a fresh grunt, drafted out of normality and thrown into a hell that never should've happened to anyone.A bit choppy in some of the early parts and three typos, but neither of these things slow down the suspense or take away from the experience.People who were in wars write the best war stories. Rubinstein takes you there and makes you feel what it was like; how awful it was - for us and for the Viet Namese.Highly recommended, but not for the weak-hearted. I'm still feeling the rush...

$REVIEW.: This is truly one of the most incredible books I have ever read
I was captivated by Eckhart Tolle's, A New Earth,  and wanted more like that, and then I discovered Richard Moss

His name was given to me by a fellow student of the Tao Te Ching class I was taking

I was thrilled when I read this book


His writing is much clearer than Tolle's

He also explains the ego better than anyone I have read


I am reading it for the second time
I know that I will re read it periodically for the rest of my life


It is a profoundly enlightening book and I am amazed at the clarity of Moss's profound insights


Wow! Don't miss this one

It is truly life-changing!

$REVIEW.: This little book is filled with beautiful illustrations. They looked as if they were painstakingly hand-painted. Just gorgeous!The story was short, but very sweet. Perfect to read several times in a row to little ones on your lap.My oldest and youngest read it with me this time - my older read it over my shoulder, and my younger stared at the pictures in awe as I read to him.The little girl in the story reminded me of all of my boys at one time or another (right now, it's the two youngest who do these things!) and made me smile in a knowing way. My oldest son (who will be 10 this weekend) said at the end, 'Gramma was nice as pie, while the granddaughter wreaked havoc wherever she went. I really don't know why the Grandmother liked her. I guess since Gramma was nice as pie, she still loved her.'Even though this was not a "Christian" book, Grandma reminds me of our Lord. He is kind and loving to us at all times, most especially when we don't deserve to be loved.I would recommend this sweet story to anyone, young or old!

$REVIEW.: Do you believe love, true love, deserves a 2nd chance? Does happily ever after really exist outside of fairy tales? For Michael and Roxann the answers could very well be a resounding yes.Michael Taylor, co-owner of a highly successful security firm, has made some tough choices in life and has had to overcome some of life's `knock downs' to get to where he is today but the biggest mistake he's ever made was walking away from Roxann, the love of his life, without putting up a fight. Then to compound that mistake he married the wrong woman. Michael left the military with a bad case of PTSD. He was working in a dead end job and felt Roxann was too good for him and deserved better. When her dad questions him on his intentions he also lets him run him off with threat of disclosing his past to Roxann.  In the course of running away from the love of his life and himself, he starts a security firm with his friends, becomes a success, then marries the wrong woman...a woman who becomes extremely unfaithful as a way of punishing him because he just couldn't love her like he did Roxann. This punishment ends up getting her killed and Mike becomes the one and only suspect. He turns to Roxann for help and maybe, just maybe the 2nd chance he longs for.Roxann Thorgesson is now the owner of the newspaper her father built up into the second best in town after he dies of a sudden heart attack a few weeks prior to Michael walking back into her life asking for her help in clearing his name. She is still heartbroken from his betrayal 12 years previously. She has learned to live a solitary life, never letting another man get too close to her for fear of a repeat performance. When Michael walks back into her life, it's a vulnerable time for her. She is still grieving the sudden loss of her father, trying to keep a multi-million dollar newspaper running, all the employees employed, and the last thing her emotional state needs is the one man that hurt her beyond words coming back into her life and asking her to do him a favor. Yet because of her fragile state she decides to do just that for several reasons...one: it would be a boon for her newspaper to have the inside track, two: prove to herself that she can run the business and three: maybe she can finally understand what happened 12 years ago that had him running away from her instead of running towards the future she dreamed they would have.Roxann knows Michael is no murderer, at least she is sure that he couldn't murder the woman who he replaced her with, and she'll prove just that, but can her heart endure being broken a second time? Can she survive the true murderer? Will her newspaper outlast the sabotage when she gets too close to finding the real killer? Finally, can love really get a 2nd chance to bloom and is happily ever after more than just something that happens in fairy tales? Take this emotional roller coaster ride with Roxann and Michael to find out if this time around all their dreams come true or turn into nightmares. Adrienne Giordano has created very real, very human characters that everyone can relate to. The situations they find themselves are very plausible and that's what makes this a great series. Romance, mystery, action, hot men...sigh, double sigh, it doesn't get much better than this. 5 star stories written by a 10 star author.Anita (The Kindle Book Review)

The book however is very clear and a wonderful read for those that truly love God and understand how deep His love is for us. If you don't understand, read it anyway. You might gather some insight about His love for you.GENRE: Inspirational fiction.SETTING: Modern day Michigan; SpringCENTRAL MALE CHARACTERS: Collin is an English teacher. His sorrow has caused him to walk away from God. Daveny is a landscape architect with a vibrant personality and love for God.SYNOPSIS: He cannot get over the loss of his brother and naturally blames God. When he drops some material off at the church he used to attend, their eyes meet. Why is he the only one in his family that never attends worship? Why is she so full of life and captivating while drawing him in with the beauty of her personality?SEXUAL EXPLICITNESS: This book is Inspirational and a few gentle kisses are as explicit as it gets. YA wonderful. Adult inspiring.WHAT I LIKED: The reality of romance as a man and a woman grow to love one another. The feeling of real life.WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: Moving forward and leaving behind a love that once was. I felt the characters should have interacted in a deeper way with regards to a past love. It seemed to have been shoved aside.I give this book (5) stars because I cried. You think that you have problems? Me also. Therefore but for the grace of God go WE.

$review_text.: Model portfolio photography tends to be a seductive pursuit that attracts photographers who either lack the necessary experience, or shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Portfolios are properly shot by working fashion or product illustration photographers who understand the challenges.Even so, it's difficult to resist the allure of photographing an attractive subject, and everyone has to start somewhere.  I recommend starting with this book.  It truly is a step-by-step guide that leads you through everything you need to know to help a model create his or her book.If you're a veteran pro, you might find some ideas here, but will hardly need the education.  Beginners can do themselves -- and their subjects -- a service by reading this book thoroughly before attempting their first portfolio.

$review_text.: *NOTE: was given an ARC for an honest review*Need to say up-front, the character Saint deserves a 10-star rating


His inner thoughts and actual dialogue are written so well, so authentic, that I feel like I know the guy
His story, which starts in his childhood, is rough and sadly, believable


As an adult, he acts and speaks exactly how you can imagine an extremely hot, passionate and honorable man would when dealing with all of the conflict that the story dishes out
No drawn out or forced actions on his part or the female lead character, Salem

The sex scenes are unique: both raw and sensual depending on who's doing what with whom *wink* Always excited to read some truly new sexin' up, rather than the same lame moves that have been recycled from various recent bestselling romances
Loved the realism and concise writing in Christa Cervone's first book, &#34;Broken&#34; and love her writing style in this one as well

Cannot wait for the next installment in the series!

I love reading about a strong woman and how the male has to work extra hard to win her love. "From Rags" is no different - it was a fantastic read!

$review_text.: Ok so science fiction is not really my favorite genre and sometimes I even have a hard time following it. `Planet Janitor' however was not the case I actually enjoyed this suspense filled novel. It was an adrenaline filled fast paced adventure.From the moment they arrive on the planet nothing goes right. They are faced with some crazy fierce monsters that they are unprepared to battle.It had a lot of heart and I know the author is going to do big things in the science fiction world if not other genres as well.There were a few unbelievable parts in the book for me, and a few over used alien clich&eacute;s but I guess that is to be expected and I will forgive it because it takes a lot for me to lot a book in this genre and I did like this one.I enjoyed this book and I hope to read more from Chris soon.

$review_text.: This first book in a new series by Sarah Wynde is complete departure from her Tassamara books, but it is no less delightful.  From the first page and its dire situation Ms Wynde leads her new heroine through a life changing adventure that kept me guessing what the next page, never mind the next chapter, would bring. While not resorting to traditional adventure/suspense/mystery cliches, Ms Wynde manages to blend elements of all three plus a dash of romance into a truly wonderful novel.Our new protagonist, Fen, is young, edgy, and has some darkness to her history. For all of that she is still enchanting and appealingly innocent on many levels. When a grand misadventure lands her in troubled waters she exhibits adaptability and resourcefulness beyond her years. Her cohorts in this adventure are charismatic, attractive and a little bit dangerous. By the end of the book Fen will know far more than she ever expected and also that there is so very much more to learn.I can't wait.
$SUMMARY.: Highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: Gale is the leader of a band of mercenaries, a hard-core group earning money by doing dangerous jobs that require their unique expertise. They accept a job to bring back survivors from the colony of Avaric, where a strange plague, which forces its victims to commit vile acts, has devastated the population. In addition to completing the job, Gale must deal with the anger and resentment he feels about the loss of his girlfriend on an earlier mission. The Dead Shall Inherit the Earth is a unique blend of science fiction and horror with a fast-paced style and loads of action. It is a well-written book with characters who are often larger than life. There was more than a couple of times when I shuddered with anticipation, knowing what was in store for the zombie attacks. Gale's flashbacks to a previous mission that had gone terribly wrong are also very powerful. I would recommend this book for any library whether it be personal or public.This review was originally written for MonsterLibrarian.com and can be seen at:[...]

$REVIEW.: Food Presentation Secrets collects lots of kitchen techniques that aren't secret but do add visual interest to your cooking.  Just don't forget that your underlying main recipe has to nourish your guests.Firefly Press lays out this material in an exceptionally clean, and photographically beautiful style similar to what you'd expect of Dorling Kindersley.  If the ingredients aren't clear, sometimes they're inconveniently located in the back of the book.  But the key steps are visual, so the photographic instructions are great.  Hobday and Denbury's steps are shown so cleanly that even beginning cooks should have little trouble.Many of these techniques can be found in other sources, but Hobday and Denbury took the time to organize explanations of decorative items sometimes seen but not explained elsewhere.  Experienced cooks might not find a lot of secrets here, but newer cooks will find this book an easy way to add fun to a meal.

$review_text.: Mind Your Own Mortgage is a tract for the times. It was written in light of the recent financial meltdown, and seeks to get the U.S. economy in better shape by encouraging people to get their home economies in better shape.The book comes in three main sections: Get a Grip on It (your mortgage), Shop for It and Manage It. The first section gives the lay of the land, talking about how the mortgage market works and how so many people have managed to ruin their finances. The second section is all about the mortgage shopping process, and encourages you to select a mortgage using the Mind Your Own Mortgage shopping system which uses forms from an accompanying Web site (be warned: full access to the Web site requires a paid membership). The third section talks about how to pay down a mortgage efficiently and when to refinance.I am relatively young and have never owned a home, so this book was eye-opening for me. It taught me more about the mortgage business than I had ever known before. My head was spinning at points because of all the new information, especially while reading the second section. At the end of the book, I took away a few main principles, which Bernabe mentioned so frequently that I wasn't allowed to forget: get a fixed-rate mortgage, not an adjustable-rate one. Shopping for a mortgage is about price (rate, points and fees), not about monthly payment. Don't give in to the culture of consumption, but prioritize your spending so as to leave room for what's important: relationships.Some of the details discussed in this book may well be out of date in a few years, but it seems to me that the principles Bernabe emphasizes will stand the test of time. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to buy a home, especially if they feel intimidated by the mortgage business or that they are living beyond their means.Note: Thanks to Thomas Nelson for a review copy of this book.  I was not asked to give a positive review.

$REVIEW.: God's Good Design: What The Bible Really Says About Men and Women by Claire Smith is an excellent addition to the study of the roles of Christian men and women.Being a child of the 60's my own feminist views were shaped by the world at that time.  Being a Christ-follower and desiring to live according to ALL of God's design for my life I am interested in what Claire has to say on the subject of this ongoing gender debate.For me, as a lay-person, this book reads somewhat like a study-text and that is good.  It took me longer to read it than I had planned because of the thought-provoking nature of the work. Claire systematically works through the main biblical texts that touch on the role of women: 1st Timothy 2, 1st Corinthians 11, 1st Corinthians 14, Ephesians 5, 1st Peter 3, Genesis 1 - 3, and Proverbs 31.  As she tackles the hard-to-understand scriptures she breaks down the arguments for and against in the simplest of terms. Without offering excuses or apology she carefully outlines what the Bible has to say about men and women.She hits the nail on the head as she says, "One of the fallacies of much feminist ideology is the belief that for two people to be equal, they must do the same thing. There is an assumption that you cannot have differentiation and hierarchy without also having inferiority and superiority of dignity or worth.  But you can, and this is what we find here and elsewhere in God's word."  I will add my own "Amen!"Claire's study divides into two main discussions, that of the roles of men and women within the church, and within the home.  As recent as this last week I joined in a discussion with other women who were questioning what the Bible actually says Christian women should and shouldn't do within the confines of the church and home.  Thanks to reading this book I have a clearer picture of God's plan for my life and I am able to share that more effectively.As I finished the book I realized what an excellent job she did thoroughly tackling this tough subject and yet not writing an "in your face" sort of study.I highly recommend this book for men and women on either side of this debate.Claire Smith trained as a nursing sister and worked in oncology and palliative care, before studying theology at Moore Theological College. She lives in Sydney, Australia, with her husband Rob. They have one adult son. They attend St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral. Claire is a writer and women's Bible teacher, and has a PhD in New Testament Study.My thanks to Cross Focused Reviews for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: The opening chapter was so stunningly beautiful, I almost held my breath while reading it.  I thought the author couldn't possibly live up to its poignancy, its depth of emotion, but, amazingly enough, she did.  Having experienced the loss of a spouse, this story of how grief effects us, resonated with me.  I have little patience for the cheap romanticisation of death and dying which is so popular in American culture today.  This book is different in the tender honesty of the story, the truth of the characters and their personal struggles.  The author tells it all with so much love and compassion,it feels like a privilege to be invited into her world.  This book has stayed with me long after I finished it.

$REVIEW.: I love how all of the portals vividly bring to life some historical period and the objects associated with the period are so immediately recognizable. This is the perfect series for anyone who is a history buff, who likes horror, even if not a juvenile.I would, however, say this book is best for 6th grade and over. The level of violence in the previous books was stomach churning and although this book  had less violence, there was still the threat of multilation, maiming, death, which is alot for some sensitive children to take in without nightmares.Lastly I find it ridiculous that reviewer after reviewer complains that this book does not "stand alone".  Liparulo makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR that the books should be read in chronological order. Remember the infamous "STOP....." notice???  Complaining about being lost because you have not read the previous books is like complaining about the airport noise after you buy a house next to the airport.

$review_text.: If you consider what books should be in every Catholic home library, the list comes to about approximately thirty.  Meditations Before Mass is definitely one to include in the list.  It is a marvelous book that was put together from a collection of sermons on the Mass given by Fr. Guardini.  He realized there was a lot about the Mass his German congregation did not understand, so he decided to teach them in a series of sermons.  Although born in Italy, his father was an Italian diplomat assigned to Germany.  Fr. Guardini grew up in Germany and served his priesthood there.  He was a favorite author of Pope Benedict.

The prose starts out a bit awkward; it feels military, like a flat top hair cut
you'll see what I mean


But then you get pulled in


You get used to the style


And then you're inside the story

With complete suspension of disbelief
Then, you are handed all of humanity on a silver platter


Why does the military fight for us? What is honor? Writing this very well crafted story was an opus of hard work
It is obvious that Thomas Mays has the mettle of a grand master story teller

And this story is chock full of nuggets of originality
When it is over, you will be left hoping for more.

$REVIEW.: Fighting a war from the skies in the type of aircraft available to British and German air forces during WW2 was the very epitome of aerial warfare at its most exciting, most daring and at its most dangerous. Whether the aircraft was the heavy bomber - such as the British Halifax, or the German HE 219 night fighter, each plane demanded a calibre of men the like of which will never be required again - if only because instinct and gut feeling are replaced by long-range radar, satellite navigation, computers and a thorough knowledge of the capabilities of  enemy aircraft.In a book which simply oozes an intimate knowledge of the subject coupled with many years of research, we are treated to a clear and vibrant account of a war waged unseen in the air. The pilots were the Submarine and U Boat commanders of the skies where their role, in whatever aircraft was allocated, demanded they operate unseen until the point of striking at the enemy.Whilst the commanders of underwater vessels went on lengthy journeys which allowed them plenty of time to select targets and firmly carve their names into the pages of history, aircraft flights of the time were of a far shorter duration - although, of course, they often flew daily. In short, great numbers of aircraft were required to get into the air, find and attack a pre-determined target and return home before their fuel ran out. Operations were, therefore, measured in hours as opposed to weeks or months. For this reason, many of the men and aircraft involved have been overlooked by historians and this book does much to redress that imbalance.Author Colin Heaton has studied this subject for over 30 years. As someone who is constantly preaching "research, research and even more research as the key to books such as this," all I can say is - his dedication shows! Even a cursory glance at the 32 black and white photographs which appear together between pages 50 and 51 reveals a selection of the men and aircraft from the time with several not previously published. In addition, some show Heaton engaged with some elderly former combatant and, therefore, demonstrate that man actively engaged in learning more about his subject.A copy of this book is not only recommended, it is an essential addition to the bookshelf of any person interested in RAF and Luftwaffe night operations during WW2 and does much to fill a previous gap where knowledge of night combat was lacking.The only other commodity required from any book is a damned good read and here we have all those exciting, daring dangerous and historic elements combining to provide an altogether job well done.NM

$REVIEW.: Some background will help put this review into context
I'm a former law enforcement officer who took over a decade off from shooting before coming back to it early this year to it in the form of action pistol shooting


 I'm relearning the shooting world in general as well as learning a couple different action pistol games such as USPSA and Steel Challenge.Julie Golob is an asset to the shooting community in that she's not long a very accomplished shooter, but also is an exemplary ambassador for the sport


She's an excellent communicator makes extensive use of social media and has a passion for getting new people into shooting sports with a special emphasis on women's participation.Unsurprisingly, she wrote this excellent book that serves as one of the finest introduction to both shooting and the modern shooting sports that I have found as I have reemerged into the shooting world
 Her writing style is relaxed, but concise


She stays on point with her given topic whether it's explaining firearms technology in a very understandable manner or talking about how to approach shooting an action pistol match.The first part of the book is where Julie covers the basic topics such as safety (and that's the first chapter as you might expect) as well as beginning to impart her love for the sport and why the reader should consider getting involved

She has an entire chapter devoted to women and shooting and also provides an excellent introduction and overview of firearms and their related terminology.The second portion of the book is a welcomed overview of the current state of international shooting sports


The one thing reasons I enjoyed this portion is that it not only filled the many gaps in my knowledge about what disciplines are available, but she explains why personality types might find which sports interesting
So she's not only explaining the games, but she takes the extra effort to explain why a particular shooting sport might appeal to the reader.The third portion of the book is where Julie begins to explain the fundamentals of shooting ranging from basic skills such as grip and stance and into more advanced skills such as executing a proper reload during an action pistol match

 She wraps up with a final chapter named "From Newbie to Champion" where she walks the reader through the process of what it takes to go from just starting out to becoming an accomplished shooter.As an example of how beneficial this book is, the section on how to perform a proper action pistol reload alone is worth price of the book

 Julie explains how to perform a reload and then provides extensive pictures showing each stage in the process


 As much as I enjoy watching videos Jedi Masters like Julie shoot, it can be difficult at times to see how they do things such as performing reloads because they are just so fast at doing it

Being able to watch a video of Julie executing a reload and then reading the section in her book where she explains what she is doing and then provides extensive pictures of the process is absolutely fantastic.There is something for everyone in this book whether you are considering shooting, new to shooting, or have been doing it for quite some time
 I will recommend this book to anyone who is interested in shooting sports as well as anyone who is already participating in action shooting and is looking to learn more


 I hope this book sells so well that the publisher demands that she follow up with "Keep Shooting" book that covers some of the more advanced topics like how she approaches her various action shooting sports in more depth.

$REVIEW.: You never know what you're going to get when you're asked to review a book, and in this case I was definitely not disappointed. I really enjoyed Mr. Mancheski's debut novel. Van Waring is a tough detective with a stubborn streak and a little bit of a softer side, and he's often too smart for his own good. This missing-person mystery had a unique twist that you don't see often... it wasn't just about some psycho taking girls (but I don't want to give away too much).  I liked that the book didn't only focus on the case, but on the relationships between the characters. My only complaint is that I thought the bad guy deconstructed a little too quickly... I would have liked to see a little more cat and mouse once Van Waring got on the right trail. But on the plus side, at the end of the book even the detectives don't know the full story, and I like the possibility that creates. There's a lot of competition in the world of suspense, but I think Mancheski has a good shot at success.  I, for one, look forward to Cale Van Waring's second adventure!

The Catholic Church merely provides a milieu -  religion itself is kept out of the plot.The suspense is satisfactory as it moves right along but creates no anxiety . . .

$REVIEW.: The second book of The Pandemic Sequence is a success. Several questions are answered, and more questions come up that leave me excited for the next read. Our protagonists are now safe back on the "New Cuba" island, rebuilding humanity. A small unit is dispatched with some of our characters from the first book to begin looking for survivors in a destroyed America. You'll see plenty of action, some drama, and treachery in the story. I appreciate a book when I can't discern what is coming next and the author does a good job of that throwing in several twists.I have to say, i was really bored with the first 25-30% of this book. Incredibly bored actually, to the point where I was almost disappointed. I urge you to push through much of that because once you do, the action is non-stop. Towards the end the book it seems a little rushed. My complaint is that the pace of the book goes from painfully slow, to fast, and then extremely rushed. There could have been so much story content put into the begining of the book.Had it not picked up the way it did I would not have been leaving a 5 star review. The story is fantastic, the premise is out of the ordinary, and the authors talent in writing is apparent. The was well worth the 5 bucks. Once I got passed the 30% mark I found it difficult to turn my Kindle off. Looking forward to the next installment.
$SUMMARY.: A great sequel...

$REVIEW.: The Raie'Chaelia is a really fun fantasy book that keeps you interested till the end.It follows the adventure of 17-on-the-verge-of-18 Chalice who has grown up with her grandparents in the city of Cantor


She doesn't know a lot about her parents and her grandparents have always avoided the subject


This has caused Chalice to think that she might have been abandoned, but despite that she has led a fruitful and satisfying life
Her grandfather has insisted that she learns to fight and defend herself and she is also educated, but most importantly she has friends she cares about and care about her too, namely Kirna and Tycho.Despite the life she has going, respecting her grandfather's wishes she embarks on a journey to Branbury
She is a trained warrior and quite the survivor though, so she isn't afraid, but when she reaches Branbury she finds a ghost city

It seems that all people have disappeared mysteriously and she doesn't know what to do, ending up at the house of some family friends


It's there that Jeremiah finds her, coming home after being absent for the day
Since they used to spend time together as children, the cooperate nicely and decide that something must have happened


It's not long till they understand that the villagers have been taken by the men of the Evil King, {the false king as he is the one who robbed Duquaine (the former king)of his throne}, in the hopes of finding the child of the prophecy that said that one child with a specific birthmark was to reinstate the true king to his rightful throne.When the king's men return, Jeremiah and Chalice flee through a secret pathway created by Jeremiah's father and together they try to come up with the plan to save their friends and family

I don't want to spoil the story, but I have to say that it involves several subplots and it's quite complex.The characters from Chalice, who was a really reliable and brave heroine, to the noble and charming Jeremiah, to the cute and resourceful Chinuk, to the graceful and efficient Ben are all strong and memorable

No character is like the other and the uniqueness of them is a nice change

I loved how their personalities were very distinct and the author made sure that we grew to know them and care about them through their words, actions and mannerisms..
I liked how brave Chalice was and how polite and gentle Jeremiah was, but even the chinuk was quirky and stubborn and Tycho provided the much needed comic relief at some points, whereas Kirna was the confidante and the good friend
Throughout the book ,though since there were a lot of subplots we were introduced to other characters as well like the Farahs (which were all amazing - loved their heritage, the way they though, their traditions and how helpful and loyal they were)or even the Quaie'Miren the race living almost exclusively aboard their ships and had created their own personal tradition and ideology.For me the QuaieMiren were among the most imaginative in the book


I fell in love with their life aboard the Morning Dawn, their notion of sea partners, Ardenne and her family...I think what contributed to that was the colorful and elaborate descriptions of the ship, their way of life of trading and generally, I have to admit that the descriptions not only of this but also of the landscapes through which Chalice and her company traveled, the cities and everything were a very powerful aspect of the book
For the most part I think they were just spot on and exactly the amount of "elaborate" you'd need to imagine what was written and paint your own picture vividly and vibrantly.The plot was very good and I loved how much thought the author seemed to have put into this, more so since this will be a three-book series and already there were so many (plausible) subplots that initially make your head spin, but gradually really click and make sense in the story


I like how gradually and mostly through Chalice's contact with the people she met and aided her on her journey she kept discovering more and more truth regarding her past, her heritage and the world she's found in

I liked the notion of Ice Age and how its repercussions has divided humanity into races that followed a different path of evolution thus selecting different traditions, different weapons and skills and ideologies


The whole race segregation was quite original and how it was taboo to mix..


It made sense quite later in the book when we understood most of what happened.I can't say that there was anything about the book that I really absolutely didn't like, but there were some things that felt awkward a bit.Yes, the book was a bit slow to start and some of the descriptions were somewhat unnecessarily lengthy - like descriptions of everyday activities - but for the most part they were believable and were handled well because most of that "dragging" had to do with injuries which had to be healed before continuing on the journey.Some of the dialogues however, felt a bit stiff and with too formal phrasing when there didn't seem a reason to be like that

It didn't detract from the enjoyment of the book, though, it was just a bit awkward to follow.I also felt that it was directed mostly towards younger readers, which is not meant as a bad thing, it was lovely, I just wanted to put it out there.Also, even though the pace of the relationship between Chalice and Jeremiah was quite nice and gradual, I felt like after their first kiss, they both ignored it in a way in the sense that they kept on like nothing had happened and only towards the very end, did Chalice acknowledge that something more than friendship was between them, even though Jeremiah (even more than Chalice) seemed preoccupied with their future together and blushing a lot
I know the emphasis was on the adventure, of course, but other than that they mostly acted like brother and sister, no touching of hands, no overt tenderness..


It would seem to me that through this ordeal which they both knew could cost them their lives, they would really need to seek comfort and support in each other and strive to be close to each other on a regular basis and not just when they were sick

(Of course they tried to save each other's lives so that's the most important stuff, so maybe I'm overly cheesy and romantic today :P)So, all in all it was a pretty original and exciting read, with a masterfully crafted world which I found greatly intriguing and fascinating and of course, I'm looking forward to the next book! XD

$review_text.: I've been a vegetarian all my life, but thought that the concept of veganism is a bit too extreme. I didn't want to try out a vegan diet just because it has gained popularity. However, this book has changed my outlook altogether. Elizabeth has written an information packed book that gives plenty of reasons why one must become a vegan. It clearly states the facts and debunks all the myths, thereby convincing me that a vegan diet has far more health-benefits as compared to a diet with animal products. The book also gives links to a lot of additional resources and blogs. I tried out the easy-to-make chocolate smoothie recipe given in the book and my kids simply loved it!

$review_text.: I have much love for Mellick's new work, Tumor Fruit
One of his longer books, we begin with Peter, a wannabe pirate who is on the trip of a lifetime to a new planet in Earth's orbit, Barack

He has with him his brother's teddy bear, and he soon makes friends with Zana, a prostitute who is covered in `puppy flowers.' Once they reach the planet, the ship crashes into an acidic ocean that melts the flesh off of its victims within minutes, all save eight passengers who barely make it to shore

What might seem like a lucky situation for these survivors soon turns into a nightmare as they find themselves on an island where they are fighting the elements


Just about everything on the island is poisonous and the air is filling their lungs with toxins


Hoping for a swift rescue, these unfortunate people have little time before they reach the same fate as those who perished in the crash, unless they lose their minds first.I cannot be more excited about this book


This work is definitely a sign that Mellick's writing is maturing and evolving
It is filled with everything from action to horror to science fiction to romance (in Mellick's way of course) to some touching moments that are completely unexpected from this seasoned author

I absolutely loved when the babies come out of the ocean...one of the creepiest scenes I've ever read
There are just enough characters to fall in love with or be completely disgusted by


The pacing of the story works well between what is going on with the survivors on the island to flashback sequences where the reader discovers more about where these people came from
There is just enough bizarro elements mixed with a sense of severity and hopelessness (in a good way), which puts the reader in the mindset as if they are on the island gnawing on tumor fruits and trying to find a way to escape.I love everything I have ever read of CM3's, but I have to say that this is one of my favorites


If you don't like this book, there is something wrong with you

Buy it! Read it! Let the acidic waters suck you in!

$REVIEW.: I have to say I am not a big fan of love triangles and the way Katy strung along both boys through the first half of the book was appalling to say the least.  I hate women who can't "decide" who they love more or think that it would be easier or better to pick this one but still string along the other one..ugh!!Katy had known her next door neighbors, Branch and Brooks since the day she was born.  She loved them as brothers until a dare found her kissing them at 12.  The only problem was she had feelings for both of them, but she had a stronger bond with one of them.  Will she make the right choice or will her decision take her down a path in life she never expectedI am not sure where Katy got all of her tears from but she was definitely a pro for turning on the waterworks at the drop of a hat and I'm not talking about a few tears, oh no, she went all out with wailing and sobbing to make her point.  She could have won a grammy, an emmy, and an Academy Award for her performances!  I found it very hard to like her, I do not like wishy washy women and Katy definitely put Keira from Thoughtless to shame!

$REVIEW.: From her looks to her job in retail hell, everything about Mari is average.  Everything about the stunningly handsome, rich, and successful Devon is exactly opposite that.  So why has he invaded her job, her life, and her dreams?  Devon claims he fell for her back in high school and Mari just never saw it.  He's determined to sweep her off her feet.  Mari thinks there's no way this Prince Charming will want happily ever after with her, but she can't resist taking him up on his offer of a two-week trial.  Can Devon prove to Mari that fairytales can happen to ordinary people?A dash of Cinderella charm adds to the allure of the sexy Two-Week Trial.  Missy Jane has delivered a wonderfully erotic tale with a hero that's almost too good to be true and a heroine who is understandably wary of all that Devon wants to lay at her feet.  It's easy to adore Mari and Devon; while they're not perfect, Ms. Jane has written them in such a way that's impossible not to like them.  All in all I found Two-Week Trial to be a delicious, entertaining read and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Jane's work.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: Pinkerton Operative, Miranda Hunt, needed an important assignment. One that would prove she is as good as any man on the job. When her boss sends her to Cactus Patch to The Last Chance Ranch to track down the Phantom, a local robber that is terrorizing the area, Miranda is determined to get her man. Once and for all this will give her the respect as an Operative she has always craved. Ranch owner, Eleanor Walker, is looking for a female heiress to take over her ranch but there is one condition. The woman wanting the position has to sign a contract stating she will never marry. So Miranda goes undercover as Eleanor's new potential heiress, Annie Beckman. When the new ranch hand Branch comes on the scene, Miranda sees him as a suspect but she also doesn't know how to handle the new feelings he awakens in her. She has always been content with the lonely life of being an Operative but after being in Branch's arms she isn't sure she can ever be content with that life again. When his true identity as Jeremy Taggert, a Wells Fargo Detective, is brought to light Miranda must deal with the issues of her past in order to move toward her future. Can her love for Jeremy and her love for her job come together or will her love of one push her away from the other?Jeremy Taggert had semi retired from his job as a Wells Fargo Detective but when his best friend is killed by the Phantom, Jeremy is determined to bring him to justice. Working undercover as a ranch hand at The Last a Chance Ranch gives him access to several suspects. It also puts him in close proximity to Annie Beckman and Jeremy soon realizes it's a dangerous position to be in. He might find the Phantom but, in the process, he might also lose his heart. When Annie finds out that Jeremy is the detective involved in the case that resulted in her father's death she wants nothing more to do with him. Can Jeremy break through her defenses and win her heart or will he continue on with the lonely life of a detective?This being the third book in The Brides of The Last Chance Ranch series, I was waiting anxiously to read this book. I was in no way disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the characters I had come to love so much. Mrs. Walker's sharp tongue and tough exterior hides the warm, caring person within. I like her toughness, strength and gumption. I love Ruckus' pension to always point others to God when the chips are down. I also love Miranda's determination and the fact that she kept a GTF (God The Father) file where she wrote down all of her questions and concerns that only God could answer. I also loved the quirky little quotes at the beginning of each chapter. I found myself chuckling at them quite often. The characters were lovable and the story was thoroughly enjoyable. A blend of romance, western culture and a dab of suspense all in one. Margaret Brownley is one of my favorite authors because she never disappoints. I highly recommend this book, this entire series, to fans of historical western romaces.**I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for my honest review**

He was raised in a den of thieves; taught to con, cheat and steal from an early age, and boy, does he ever make his daddy proud.Finn enjoys a life of leisure, taking, and sometimes borrowing, what he needs from neighbors...only if they're NOT home, of course. Groceries, clothing, DVDs are all his for the taking, and the owners never seem to miss a few cans of soda or a t-shirt or two. But Finn is destined for bigger scams and before long his capers are making the papers, and he's been assigned a really lame nickname.This was a fun read and the only reason it gets four instead of five stars is because the main character/narrator's astonishing arrogance annoyed the hell out of me.

Sadly, it has come to end after finishing this off but what an epic finale it was, simply stunning and the best yet. Seriously, get Spielburg, Michael Bay, James Cameron and a few other big directors and get this made into a film, it would be mind blowing...back to the story, Jake and his crew fight for humanity against overwhelming odds, making a final stand on Pandem. Witty comments, explosive action, twists that none of us would have foretold and an satisfying conclusion to the series...or is it?...a fantastic series with a rich universe which is more or less Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3 rolled together. Now, I'm off to the read the series again : )

$review_text.: I love when an author takes on the paranormal world and turns it on its head. This book, the first in a series, is a breath of fresh air! I could not believe how fast I became enamored with Rune Alexander's world. This book is as addictive as all the great paranormal books can be. I measure most paranormal books against one of my favorites, Black Dagger Brotherhood, and this one holds its own.In this book, we are introduced to Rune Alexander, leader of the Shiv crew. She is a part of law enforcement that deals with others, she protects the humans from Others that want to hurt them. The Others encompass all &#34;monsters&#34;. Vampires, Shifters, Warewolves, Trolls, Ghouls, the list is endless. She is a part of one cog of the cops that deals with other worldly beings. But, little do her teammates completely know, she is a part Other. She was adopted by great parents, so she doesn't know exactly what she is. All she does know is that somehow, she killed her parents. She sees herself as an abomination, one part her and one part her monster. The only thing that keeps her going is having her boss, Jeremy, beat her to within an inch of her life. It is a twisted relationship, because he gets off on hurting her badly. The only two things that save her are her otherness and her sweet assistant Ellis. Ellis brings her blood to consume and it heals her wounds. She thinks nothing will ever make her better, and quickly, she has her world turned upside down. Someone high up is blackmailing the Other groups and killing a lot of them. Rune realizes, with the help from the only people she can trust (her team) that something big is happening and she has to save them all. There are quite a few additions plots and twists through this book that make you unable to put this book down. Will Rune find the truth and stop the evil in time? Will she learn who she is? Are her adopted parents not dead? These and more make this an amazing introduction to an ever incredible world and I cannot wait to see what happens next!
$review_summary.: This book is hands down amazing!

$REVIEW.: When I got this book, it wasn't at all what I expected. It was free after all so I thought it was going to be some cheap story about paranormal creatures that was really more of a way to pass the time. Turns out, I couldn't of been more wrong!!!! Raven absolutely intrigued me from page one!!!  It has a fascinating story line and characters that you'll just love!! I read the first chapter and then I just couldn't put it down!!!! You know how sometimes a book is so good that you go out of your way to keep reading it? Well this is one of those!  If your looking for a different kind of supernatural novel then I highly recommend Raven!!!!

$review_text.: All six reviews for this book are 5 star so I am really against the grain here but I thought this book was kind of a waste of time. It was roughly 200 pages and really I would only say that 50 pages of it were actually devoted to Josh Gibson. The final third of the book was dedicated to other Negro Leaguers. Much of the rest of the book was about society as a whole and the negro leagues.There wasn't a ton of information about Josh Gibson. That may be because there isn't a lot of info out there on him. Stats are hard to come by and he lived a short life. Maybe there just isn't much of a story to tell. That might explain my disappointment with the book. I probably would feel like I could give it a better review if it would have had a different title or perhaps a subtitle that explained the book's true content.Not saying the book wasn't well written or well researched... I think it is well written. The author clearly writes at a level that is interesting and moves you through the book quickly and it is a short book with not a lot of detail.My big beef and this is why I would give it a poor rating. It just didn't focus on Josh Gibson. It focuses more on the negro leagues as a whole. A different title and a better understanding of the book's subject matter with a good intro or a subtitle would clear up the issue in my mind.

$REVIEW.: Sunflower's a dog, a beautiful dog with a character all her own, eager to please, eager to love her fellow dogs as sisters, and not necessarily wise to what good dogs should do in the home
Her choice of lunch may surprise you--it certainly did her owners

But Sunflower's a sweet character and undoubtedly a pleasing muse to the author who lives with her.Short, non-fiction, gently amusing and pleasing in its very ordinariness, Sunflower tells of the golden cocker spaniel who adopted the author's family when they thought they were adopting her

It's a nice tale for dog-lovers anywhere, offering much to smile about because, well, Sunflower's sweet.Disclosure: I bought a free ecopy of this short story.



$SUMMARY.: Short, sweet, and there's a dog!

$REVIEW.: This book is a persuasive argument for the Hebraic background to the gospel writings.The preliminary argument actually defends the claim that the gospels themselves were written in Hebrew, not Aramaic, and only later translated into Greek.  The argument against Aramaic is detailed, and I am not at all versed in Aramaic so as to respond to it.  At some points it seems forced, as when the authors argue that Jesus' words on the cross, "Eloi," (Aramaic) were actually "Eli" (Hebrew), leading to the claim that he was calling Elijah (p. 10).  It would be just as reasonable to assume that his hearers mistook what he was saying and assumed he was calling Elijah.Furthermore, the two-page response to the Greek theory (p. 14-16), seems absurd, given that our only extant manuscripts are Greek.  That only one counter-argument is given seems like the authors are avoiding the obvious.  Furthermore, there are obvious plays on Greek words in the gospels, as with Peter's conversation with Jesus after the resurrection and the play on varying forms of the word "love," only true in Greek.  The authors are not arguing merely that the authors were from a Hebrew context, but that their writings themselves were Hebrew.  Given that Greek was the standard language of diplomacy in the first century, this seems ridiculous.Still, the Hebraic background to the texts was clearly in the minds of the authors.  Even if they wrote in Greek, that they were translating Hebrew idioms still seems likely (even if not in print).  The first few chapters simply belabor an unnecessary argument, while Chapter 5 (p. 53-65), is the most valuable.  Here, the Hebrew idioms are exposed and translated.  The meaning of offering your peace to a house (p. 57) is infinitely more clear given the Judaic context of the text.Chapter 6, an analysis of a couple of potential theological errors that can stem from misunderstanding the nature of the text, is fascinating.  I like the argument that Jesus was not intending a strict pacifism (p. 67-72) and that he didn't intend an unwise generosity when he talked about giving (p. 72-75).The appendix is a wealth of sermon material for the particular texts addressed.  It plunges into the possible Hebrew intentions to verses which seem senseless in English and even in Greek.  Sometimes I am not entirely compelled by their exegesis, since, for instance, the phrase "cast out your bad name" (p. 115) is not radically different than what we assume it meant in the English.  Nonetheless, there are some priceless revelations here, such as the meaning of the tittle on the jot, the mark on the top of the yod.All considered, I like the direction of the book, though it would be more compelling if they had spent more time on theological ramifications and less time arguing for an implausible nature of non-extant texts.  In the end, I found myself simply wishing the book was longer.

$review_text.: OKAY.  This was the very first gluten-free cookbook I bought and "read".  I found myself, right away, flipping back and forth, (like looking up reference verses in the Bible), trying to figure out what the actual ingredients list was.  The author says NOT to do these recipes differently than she has published them.  Actually gives warning that if you don't, it may not work out.  Doesn't give us long time cooks any credit for understanding wet/dry/rising ratios.  I REALLY wanted to make this cookbook work.  It took me quite a while to thumb through the book to find all the "basic" flour mix recipes called for in each recipe.  They are sprinkled throughout the book, not collected in any one location.  There is one foundational Flour Blend.  Then there are 5 more mixes that use the basic plus.  Example:  Pizza crust recipe calls for "Carol's Yeast Bread Mix", "Carol's Yeast Bread Mix" calls for "Carol's Flour Blend".  So, you are flipping from pg 192 to 184 and then to 37 before you can assemble a list of all of the ingredients.  After spending a lot of time figuring out the mixes, I made the cornbread recipe.  It tasted pretty good.  (I omitted the sugar - I have been altering recipes to remove sugar for years).  I just don't find it "quick and easy".  Sorry.

$review_text.: Another ScatteredThoughtsandRogueWords.com reviewRating: 4 stars out of 5Only his best friend's wedding would make Justice Crawford leave the security of his home to fly across the country to Seattle to assume the best man duties that he has been given.  A  strange place, a schedule of events full of new people?  Just the beginning of a worst case scenario for Justice. Because  Justice is not only a deeply closeted gay Southern man but his social anxiety disorder and OCD make any new or strange situation problematic at best, a nightmare at its worst.  And this is definitely the worst that could happen.  That sometime during the festivities, Justice will be outed to the only friend he has ever known.Sailor and charter boat captain Nic Valentine is returning home to Seattle from his father's funeral when an attractive man literally falls into his lap when their plane hits some unexpected turbulence.  Eyes meet, attraction forms, a phone number is exchanged and then&#8230;.nothing.  Cute guy disappears once Nic leaves the airplane in Seattle.  Nic is certain he will never see that man again but Fate and a wedding brings them together once more.Justice has let his disorders and closeted status isolate him from society and a chance at love.  Nic's past includes a closeted boyfriend that hurt him deeply and now he isn't sure he wants to take another chance with a man who hides who he really is.  But sometimes love finds a way to bring the most unlikely of people together for their HEA.  Will Nic and Justice find the courage to take a chance on each other?J.K. Hogan's romantic tale, I Survived Seattle (Coming About #1) has two opposite personality characters that meet cute on a plane.  A spate of turbulence, ok, a ton of turbulence throws Justice Crawford into the lap of one Nic Valentine during the flight.  A few words, a couple of flirtatious glances are exchanged and hopes are raised for a lite romcom.But  initial impressions are often deceiving. One man is on the way to his best friend's wedding, the other returning from his father's funeral.  One has serious mental health issues and the other is grieving over his father's loss.  Not exactly comedic fare and I am not sure the introduction works to frame out the depth of the problems and the complexities in store for both men once they land in Seattle.  But once that plane lands&#8230;.this story really takes off.  Don't you love it when that happens?Justice Crawford is a man sinking under the weight of his problems.  When he was younger, the decision to come out to his parents, cost him home and family.  Only the support of a grandfather in a retirement home, enabled Justice to attend college and complete his degree.  The trauma of that situation forced Justice back into the closet and no one, not even Rory his best friend and only family, knew he was gay.  In addition to being closeted, Justice suffers from a social anxiety disorder and OCD.  Medication has helped but fear and his anxiety have kept Justice in a cage or closet of his own making along with his decision to hide his homosexuality.  Hogan makes this character delightfully easy to empathize with,even with his closeted status.  He is socially inept and closed off, and still we like him.  We see where his past and his anxiety have contributed to the fears he is letting dictate his life and we are able to understand him.Nic Valentine is the much more genial and open of the two personalities.  He lives aboard his charter boat, accepts who he is and longs for a partner to complete his life.  Nic's past includes a closeted boyfriend so we can understand Nic's frustration with and uncertainty about pursuing a relationship with Justice.  Both men come complete with a pair of best friend/girl friends who support them and help their relationship along.  I liked them as well as I did the main characters.  Rory, the best friend, is a little more elusive a character.  It was hard to get a feel for him and that was important given the fact that Justice's fear over losing him is central to his rationale for staying in the closet.  More of Rory or more of Rory and Justice's past history would have solidified this element of the story.  And I am not certain how I feel about a certain character who seemed more of a plot device to boost Justice out of the closet than a real human being. Maybe he will grow on me if he returns in the sequel.J.K. Hogan may reside in North Carolina but she has life on the water and Seattle down pat.  I loved the descriptions of Nic's boat and the harbor in Seattle.  His carefully organized space and quarters sound realistic and attractive.  Did I want to be there on his boat?  Why yes I did.  I could feel the peacefulness and quiet that Justice felt when he stood on deck because Hogan's descriptions were able to transport me there to stand next to him.Another element of this story I appreciate was the degree of  authenticity in regard to Justice's anxiety disorder and OCD.  There is no magic wand to make it all better.  Instead thee is an adjustment of medication, and long term visits with a therapist to help Justice lead a more normal life.  We get a better understanding of what can trigger anxiety attacks and exactly how that can incapacitate a person.  Like I stated, not exactly comedic fare.  But it works when developing a character that comes across as real instead of a stereotype.  And Justice feels as real as they come.I Survived Seattle is the debut novel for J.K. Hogan and I found it to be a sweet, rewarding and totally endearing first jump for this author into the m/m romance genre.  From the title I anticipate this is but the first in a series.  Perhaps the next in line just might be the recently married but unhappy Rory? I can't wait to find out.  But while we are waiting, grab up I Survived Seattle.  You are going to love Justice and Nic and their journey to their own HEA!Cover art by Wilde City Press. The cover has a number of nice elements but I am not sure they work together to form a cohesive whole.  It's a little murky but the font is nice as is the Seattle backdrop and inclusion of a boat.Book Details:ebook, 161 pagesPublished March 19th 2014 by Wilde City PressISBN139781925031911edition languageEnglish

It has been a long time coming, and though I never forgot what my goals were, I had allowed myself to become stagnant. The best part of this book was recognizing those certain characteristics and inhibitions within myself. It was like I was remembering every time I had gotten discouraged and allowed that to dictate my future.The author, Eran Stern, writes so well and direct to the reader. You get a real strong sense of the author's expertise in self-help and persuading people that they have such unrealized potential. I gained invaluable tools from The Art of Achieving Goals and cannot wait to witness my goals come to fruition.

$REVIEW.: This was a fun book to read. Although I thought it was going to have some murder and mystery to it. I guess I though that because our star, Kate McCall was a private investigator, therefore murder investigations?Kate had her PI license for a year and did not have one case yet. Things were very tough for her and she refused to get a job, even a temp job, so she was on the verge of loosing her apartment, her phone and her electricity plus she had no food in her house at all.Then the story really got interesting. She suddenly got three clients, one being her mother, then her friend needed her help then a old man picked up her card at her Uncle's restaurant. Kate could not charge her mother or her friend but she was hoping to make something from the old man. One paying customer was better then none.This really was a fun book to read. I did not want to put it down. Just do not expect any murders. This is a clean cut story.Tina Lencioni did a great job. But the story ended too soon for me. Although this IS only book one. I will be looking forward to reading book two. I think you will enjoy reading this fun PI story.

$REVIEW.: The thirteen patterns in the book are attractive and practical projects for learning the craft of Tunisian Crochet

The patterns include a set of placemats and coasters, three pillows, a tote bag, a scarf, a variety of shawls and wraps, a purse, an afghan, 2 sweaters, a jacket, and fingerless gloves.I am a knitter and never learned crochet beyond a granny square, but I had a Tunisian crochet hook so I decided to give it a try


 I am a visual learner so I had to use the diagrams first and then go back and read the text to figure out how to do the stitch
 I did crochet up a small (very small!) sample to make sure I could follow the instructions.The projects start out very basic and then progress as you learn and practice
 I would love to make the Tranquil Escape cardigan, but I think I had better start with the placemats first! Great book!

$REVIEW.: I am not giving this book a 5 star rating b/c I feel it is a great book.  I give it five stars b/c I cannot be objective in reviewing the book.  Since I can't be objective I don't feel it would be fair to give it a bad rating.  That said, the reason I can't give the book an objective review is b/c I am 41 years old and this book is definitely for young adult/teen readers.  The characters in the book are in their early twenties.  The decisions and actions of the characters definitely reflect the decisions and actions of immature individuals.  I do recommend it for young readers b/c it is a sweet, clean romance where sex is only discussed.  For the more mature audiences, I would recommend you bypass this one.

$REVIEW.: Long, competent if not inspired MilSF about an interstellar, earth-based empire in decline. A Captain and his Marines are sent to deal with the affairs of a distant colony and get caught up in its civil war. I enjoyed it despite some eye-cringing editing bloopers ("supply deport" etc.) and inconsistencies. The book was more interesting for plot than character development, certainly. Nuttall is able to describe combat in a way that makes sense to me--more often I find combat descriptions too confusing to follow. I may go on with the series because the books are inexpensive, I really like this kind of MilSF, and this book was entertaining.  I hope in the subsequent books the supercompetent Marines meet with more challenges and the editing and writing improve a bit.

$review_text.: I have read Tim's last two books and this one continues the same themes, with some wonderfully funny imaginary dialogues, first with some deceased nuclear physicists, and later with a nondual dogmatist.  One of the author's basic themes is that the awakening experience is a "both/and" paradox rather than an "either/or" paradox, suggesting that you can have your cake and also eat it.  Dr. Freke restores credibility and validity to the "separate inside self" or "little me" identity lived by the vast majority of the unwashed...even after an 'awakening' experience. He does so in several chapters, and asserts that Awareness (the Void) becomes conscious via the human organism...(others have so stated as well.)  The author mentions some other traditions with great respect, but then expands on their limitations (no awareness of the theory of evolution/natural selection, for example).  But Tim is often very much about Tim.  Usually that is a bad thing.  We want him to be about "us."  Or do we?  What if his experiences, and his careful expression of them are universal?  Buddha suggested that everyone was a boddhisatva...had the "Buddha Nature."  Why do we resonate with Walt Whitman?  Or Thoreau? Or Eckhart Tolle? The re-validation of the unique self in a book about a "mystery experience" is an important sidebar.  There are also a number of special techniques (sadhanas) which I assume are quite similar to those he provides at his international weekend retreats.  Lovely work by a fine man.

I wish more women, young and old, would grasp the concept that everything you want in life is literally in your own hands. I learned it at a very young age. Although I am of a much older generation than the author of this book (my book is for women age 40+), I can completely identify with her empowerment advice. Good for you, alpha female!

$REVIEW.: I cannot get enough of Christine D&#8217;Abo&#8217;s ridiculously delicious writing. There was so much to love about this novella and those things don&#8217;t only revolve around the hot as heck sex scenes that Christine tends to write. There were some things that were pretty predictable, but that didn&#8217;t matter in the least. I absolutely loved the premise; especially since lately I&#8217;ve been a huge HGTV junkie. I loved the idea of the designer and the contractor getting together while filming a makeover show. I appreciated the tension between Fynn and Sophia, especially when they really started getting hot and heavy.I haven&#8217;t read a story by Christine that I didn&#8217;t like. She knows how to keep you engaged in the story and care about the characters even when they aren&#8217;t ripping each other&#8217;s clothes off. And then when that starts&#8230;.oooooh dang. Christine definitely knows how to ratchet up the heat. I cannot wait to read more by her and I would love to revisit this world. Perhaps Sophia&#8217;s friend needs to find love and while we&#8217;re at it we can get a little Sophia/Fynn action on the side?!Arc provided by the publisher via Netgalley for an honest review

$review_text.: Cole Alpaugh's book, The Bear in a Muddy Tutu, immediately had my full attention as it began with the story of Buddy Wayne Hooduk, an odd character of sorts who has just abandoned his needy mother and is intent on convincing people that he is God. With stolen guidebook in hand, How To Become a Cult Leader in 50 Easy Steps, Buddy sets out to find his flock. Odd circumstances cause Buddy to take charge of a run-down traveling circus where an oddball loser like Buddy doesn't seem so out of place.It is here in the book that the reader is introduced to a variety of characters and you quickly learn that this book just isn't about Buddy. In fact, pretty soon Buddy is out of the center circus ring and we find ourselves following the story lines of several other more interesting characters from a drunken ranger obsessed with killing bugs to a lonely reporter who has lost his daughter thanks to his ex-wife running away with the little girl.And since you are following a circus, there's all sorts of Midway characters and Side Show freaks coming and going from the storyline that, while not the center of the plot, are just as alluring.  A sexy contortionist, a man who has survived lightning strikes a dozen times, the flat man, and the human cannonball to name a few.My favorite character had to be Gracie the Dancing Bear - an old toothless bear in a pink tutu who becomes separated from the circus during a bizarre accident. Alpaugh treats Gracie's point of view no differently than when he is writing about the other characters. It's as if this is a story he's engagingly told out loud for years possibly to his children. In fact, Gracie becomes a living metaphor for a story Lennon Bagg, the reporter, used to tell to his daughter Morgan at bedtime each night about a bear who wanted a circus magician to turn her into a bird.Although the reader's attention is focused on Buddy and whether or not he can convince the circus that he is indeed God and whether or not they will build a altar to him, the underlying focus of the book will take you by surprise. It is in fact the story of Lennon and his daughter. The author bares his soul as we witness the desperate loneliness of Lennon who has been searching for Morgan for over a year.And then we are treated to chapters told from Morgan's point of view as she is stowed away in Bermuda after her mother told her Daddy was dead. Obsessed with birds and convinced her father has turned into one, Morgan becomes the punchline of her classmates' jokes as she searches the island and talks to birds about her father. And sometimes the birds talk back!I was a third of the way through the book and still had no idea where the sotry was taking me. Buddy and the circus attempt to set up permanent residence on an old island, while Lennon finds Gracie and tries to reunite her with the circus. And yet, by the last page, the reader is treated to an ending that is as satisfying as cold lemonade and cotton candy.Alpaugh pens a world of fascinating characters, not to mention their bizarre unforgettable names, reminding us that it is our individuality and uniqueness that makes each of us special in our own way. If we look past our differences, we can see people for who they really are and we can appreciate the little things that make each of us tick.The fate of each character plays on our hearts as Alpaugh takes us deeper and deeper into each persona. I felt like I knew these characters inside and out, and while the story might lack action at times, the author pushes the story forward with a multitude of point-of-views. If you are looking for a "big top" read with lots of heart and laughs, and characters you can sit down with to listen to their story for a spell, magic, whimsy, and dancing bears, then look no further than Cole Alpaugh's The Bear in a Muddy Tutu.

$review_text.: Reading Tiger's Eye (Stacy Justice #3) felt like running an obstacle course. Instead of everything flowing naturally to the finish line, I felt like I was constantly jumping over tangents and trying to maneuver through a tangle of subplots just to figure out where I was going. And, as much as I wanted to love this book, I found it frustrating and exhausting.The second book, Bloodstone, ended in a cliffhanger when Stacy receives a mysterious phone call telling her that her father's death wasn't an accident, he was murdered.With that kind of earth shattering news, I totally expected to pick up Tiger's Eye and be launched into a fast-paced plot where Stacy tracks down her father's killer. I mean, she is the supposed "seeker of justice" after all. Instead, Tiger's Eye opened up with charity softball game, and the only thing Stacy was seeking was to connect her bat with the ball and, afterward, get in a little "me time."Alright, so it wasn't exactly the dynamite beginning I expected, but I figured Stacy would be back on the case of finding the person who murdered her father soon enough.WARNING: Plot Analysis. If you don't want to know anything that happens in the book, you may want to stop reading.------------But then she couldn't find Thor, her Great Dane and familiar, and decided the appropriate action to take would be to perform an enchantment in a wide open field that would bring Thor back home. Okay, so she was a little tipsy. Of course, the spell goes awry and ends up attracting all kinds of animals, including those from a nearby pet cemetery. Thor returns, accompanied by a beautiful Collie that appears to be sick. Stacy takes the animal to her Aunt Fiona, a witch and, apparently, animal whisperer. Meanwhile, after leaving the Collie, Stacy is taking a leisurely swim at the lake when she's dragged below the surface by the ghost of a man who had been drowned in that very spot. Now she has to solve that mystery.Oh, and I almost forget, there's that whole thing about her dad being murdered. I'm sure she'll get to it, eventually. It wasn't just all the sub-plots that made this book frustrating, it was the lack of dedication to any of them. For example, when Stacy goes to see what Aunt Fiona learned about the Collie (her name is Keesha), the plot digresses into a long story about Aunt Lolly and how, more than 50 years ago, she was supposed to get married but the groom disappeared. Uhm, okay?And I haven't even mentioned the whole tiger that sparked the Tiger's Eye title. That's another one.About 200 pages into the book (it's only 279 pages long), Stacy finally gets around to discovering some documents left behind by her father that could lead to his killer, so what does she do? She puts them aside to go pee on a stick with her cousin, who suspects she's pregnant. She actually says, "Since the folder had been tucked away for all this time, I guess it couldn't hurt to wait one more day."In a good mystery novel, this would be the point the story would be heating up and preparing for the climax. It obviously didn't bother Stacy, but I was tired of waiting. When the climax finally does happen, it was so abrupt and convoluted that I had to go back and read pages over and over again because I couldn't understand what was happening or why it was happening. I kept thinking I missed something, but I eventually gave up and figured either I wasn't smart enough to figure it out or it truly didn't make sense. Either way, it wasn't all that exciting.Then there was the issue of Stacy. She refuses to tell Leo about the call she received because she thinks he'll stop her from investigating, to the point where, as further events unfold, her withholding of information becomes more like obstruction of justice -- all because she wants to solve her father's murder (whenever she gets around to it). Of course, she runs right to Leo's office to investigate a license plate number when someone almost hits Keesha in the vet parking lot. (Did I mention the license plate number was caught by Thor who was wearing spy goggles? But that's another tangent...)But Tiger's Eye did have a few cute moments I loved the canine story line. As always, I love Thor, but I'm a sucker for big puppies. I also liked Thor #2, a feisty chihuahua with a grudge against Stacy. I actually wish more of the plot would've focused on Keesha.-----------------------------I genuinely like Annino's writing and slightly-snarky sense of humor. I thought it was great in the first two books, so I feel like maybe this was just an awkward book with too much going on. I'm hoping for much better in the next installment of the series, Emerald Isle, which is scheduled for release in July 2013. Given the name, I'm guessing it will focus on Stacy rescuing her mother.

$REVIEW.: The first time I read this testimony I was touched by the depth of gratitude of the author's heart for the Divine Will of God in her life in both pleasure and pain. The author's testimony gives clear understanding with each experience that God is Sovereign and always a Just Judge. Some of her experiences I could very well relate to, and you will also.  Pain is all around us and we can either look at it as a curse or as the author of this mighty testimony we can see the hand of God working to bring us to His Holy Purposive Will for our lives. I have read the author's testimony over and over throughout the years and always I am touched and inspired to humble myself and acknowledge, all things work together for the good of them that love God and who are the called according to "his" purpose.

He wants to get away from the people who expect him to give them money and those that resent his success.  He goes to live on an uncharted, uninhabited island by himself, for about 15 months...getting supplies every 30 days.Owen goes to meet TJ and Anna and tells them his story.  It will shock you, as it did me, to find out everything that happened during his time on the island.  Definitely a great story!

Nothing corny; no fill in comments.  Real conversation.  She also puts in enough humor to keep the story moving.  I loved Opal the best in this series up until Origin!  Two things to consider:  The action in this story is off the charts.  There is no good place to stop so you will just have to bite the bullet and put it down if you need to! Second: The chemistry and love between Daemon and Katy comes across as heartfelt and genuine.  They are truly soul mates and the reader experiences their pain and happiness right along with them.  And Daemon, unnhhh, there is a reason he gets into the book boyfriend finals all the time!  JLA has taken this book in the series to the next level.  I anxiously await the final installment! Buy the series.  You won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: "Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner." --Lao Tzu (Kindle Location 9)"Know thyself" is an ancient Greek saying, one of the maxims inscribed in a forecourt stone at the Temple of Apollos in Delphi. There have been several meanings ascribed to this proverb, two of the most prominent being, (1) that those who boast exceed who they are; and (2) to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude. Lao Tzu of the east (quoted above in Scott's book), and the Greeks of the west had a similar perspective in this matter. Author Grace Scott expounds upon this philosophy.THE POWER OF NOT CARING provides a clear, introductory approach to a life that is free from worry, empowering the individual that will apply the principles of her message with a life that is truly free, genuine to self, and the key to happiness. The opening chapter begins with descriptive illustrations in parental expectation, peer pressure, popular fashion and pretentious behavior among others; and it is written in a way that can be easily grasped by teens and young adults-- but don't stop there if you're older than that. Read on as those principles, as well as those in the following chapters, may be applied to those of any age.I read this Kindle eBook using the Amazon Cloud Reader from my account and the format layout was easy to read.I gleaned much from this book and look forward to applying its principles and concepts for a healthier, happier, worry-free lifestyle.

Being from the Sacramento area, and having spent many happy times in the So. Lake Tahoe area both summer and winter these stories make me feel like I'm right there reading the headlines. I can put myself right in the story. Great reading and I'm excited to finish the remainder of the Owen McKenna Mystery series.

$REVIEW.: This is another encyclopedic guide from Lonely Planet. All of India is covered, including the Northeast. If you are just going to be in Mumbai, Delhi, or Goa for a week, you&#8217;ll probably want to go with a smaller, more localized guide. However, the background material on Indian culture, cuisine, art, and history would be invaluable even for a short trip. Plenty of practical information is included, including a guide to the most common scams. (Your driver &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; and taking you to another destination where he gets a kickback, or that requires another expensive fare to get back to where you&#8217;re really going seems to be the most common problem.) There are a lot of maps, and plenty of color photos, including nice diagrams of the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort. Well-indexed.

Outstanding story telling and excellent character growth

Not totally original but a damn interesting take on the whole super hero genre
Also this time he concentrated on the story and less on the sex

This person is an awesome story teller as I have found out from reading his other series that he has written

Each chapter is filled with Hot Tips and quotes from professional writers. Readers won't feel alone while going through this process. Larsen covers things to avoid and information for writing any type of book.The back of the book has a Resource Directory which gives readers a list of agents, marketing sites, podcast directories, media lists and so much more.

$REVIEW.: I didnt go into this book with any expectations other the trying out a new author, which is a bit of a relief since this book would have falling shot. Overall the story itself was not bad, just extremely hard to follow at times. There is several times in the book when there is not a clear break in dialog and the POV changes from one character to the next in the same paragraph, you are not even aware of the shift until after you finish reading that section and relize its not the same character anymore talking. couple this with misplaced quotations in the middle of sentances and the author mistaking calling charaters by the wrong name, making the flow of this story choppy at best.

$REVIEW.: "Vogue" is known for, well being in "Vogue". This book has some lovely crocheted shawls you wont's be likely to find somewhere else. The "Vogue On the Go" crochet books can be a little spotty. In previous books, I have been disappointed to find some sections of the pattern do not seem to be there. But I'm happy to report that this is_not_ the case in "Crocheted Shawls". All the patterns are clear and concise. There is no grading of the pattern - beginner or intermediate, so that might be a problem for some folks. But it may allow others to stretch their crochet wings a bit, just to see what can be accomplished.There is also no charts or symbols. This can also cause a problem for some crocheters. I do like to see charts mostly because they help me visualize how the shawl should be put together in case of multiple motifs.I do recommend this book for intermediate and curious crocheters. I believe they will find many patterns to choose from. The jacket cover shawl is beautiful, but the looped shawl is on my works in mind list.  So give it a chance.

Some authors go way overboard with this. From what the author wrote, we were smart enough to know what happened without all the smut. Thank you. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 was I absolutely abhore 2 things. 1. Using God's name in vain. The author did that, twice. 2. The &#34;F&#34; bomb was used once. Judging from how well this author wrote this story, I'm CERTAIN she has the creativity and vocabulary skills to find swear words that are not those two. Yes, absolutely, I recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: The cover of Ohio 2029 makes two statements: that it is an &#8220;Orwellian Thriller,&#8221; and that &#8220;Utopia Has Never Been So Wrong.&#8221; Set, as Orwell&#8217;s 1984 was, in the not-too-distant future, Ohio 2029 depicts an America suffering from the results of a catastrophic economic collapse. How this situation arose is described in detail in the book, but ultimately, it resulted in the Southern Red States seizing power in the U.S. Government and setting up reform zones in the United States, largely to punish states, particularly Ohio, that have disagreed with their past policies. The overall situation is more complicated than that and shows wrongs cannot last forever, but when the novel opens, the main thing to know is it is now the year 2029 and the reform zones are being closed, save for the one in Cincinnati.Spearheading control of these reform zones is U.S. Senator from Georgia, Ted Marshall. Ted is extremely bitter about the past and what led to the demise of America&#8217;s greatness. When the collapse began, Ted and his family had been friends with the Garners, their next-door liberal neighbors in Atlanta, but the friendship quickly ended, their political ideologies separating them. The Garners soon left Atlanta and ultimately ended up in Cincinnati in the reform zone. This separation hurt members of both families, but most hurt were the Marshalls&#8217; daughter, Mary Catherine, and the Garners&#8217; son Maddy. Yes, Mary Catherine and Maddy are star-crossed lovers, so in love that after high school, Mary Catherine decides she will run away and go to Cincinnati to be with Maddy.Ted is infuriated when he learns that his daughter has gone to live in a reform zone&#8212;infuriated because of the repercussions it will have on his political career. Ted thinks he has all the answers&#8212;&#8212;why the United States economy collapsed, and what is required to restore his country to greatness, and who deserves to be punished for being on the wrong side of history in 2008 and 2012. But Ted is also a complex and dynamic character. I have to admit I do not usually care for politics or political novels, and at first, I was concerned this book&#8217;s agenda might be too &#8220;Republican&#8221; or &#8220;Red-State&#8221; for my taste, but readers should never make the mistake of believing that characters&#8217; viewpoints are those of their author. D.A. Winstead, throughout the novel&#8217;s early chapters, is setting Ted up for a big awakening as he begins his journey to find his daughter.Meanwhile, Mary Catherine is having an eye-opening experience in the Cincinnati Reform Zone, especially since she and Maddy live in an area nicknamed &#8220;Hell Town.&#8221; And there are some unsavory characters in Hell Town, including a &#8220;roamer&#8221; who has set himself up as a leader of young boys, calling himself &#8220;Teacher.&#8221; Mary Catherine soon learns that everyone in the zone fears Teacher, and for good reason. And when Teacher finds out she is the daughter of Senator Marshall, it will put into motion a chain of events that will require Ted not only to find but to save his daughter.I really admired how Winstead balanced out the political issues in this novel, and while he begins by presenting the big picture of U.S. history and politics in the years leading up to 2029, in the end, he hones in on how politics affect real people, can tear families apart, and where the gray lines exist between Red and Blue where people can heal. Winstead has written several intriguing political novels in the past that have been set in what to many of us are exotic foreign locations, such as Sudan, South Africa, Croatia, and Latvia. His years of working in the U.S. State Department have inspired these political thrillers with historical backgrounds. Ohio 2029 is really no different for it is set in a future&#8212;and, therefore, foreign to us&#8212;United States. Winstead makes his future world both real and frightening, and he shows the riveting truth: misguided notions of what would constitute an American utopia often backfire on those unwilling to see the truth. Many readers will disagree with various points made in the novel, but in the end, I think they will appreciate the presentation of both sides and especially the themes of family and forgiveness at the center of this story.

Her mother, in seeming desperation, marries Dutch Hauk and because of that winds up giving up her rights to Lisa. Custody of Lisa is given over to a friend and for years there is no contact between mother and daughter. The trouble begins when Lisa is old enough to free her mother from Dutch's abuse, but he's vowed to keep them apart!Lisa is a great character. She's had a hard life but doesn't let that stop her.

$REVIEW.: The book is a very clean and honest analysis of the unique doctrines of the Roman Church. The order of presentation is well developed with the well-documented Roman doctrinal viewpoint followed by the Biblical considerations of that view. The author does not deviate from the subjects under discussion with side issues that are not directly significant nor does he belabor any particular point once it is made.It clearly can serve as a well documented reference manual and critique on the doctrinal beliefs of the Roman Church from the prospective of the Bible. For one that does not know or understand what the Roman Church beliefs are, this book will be most accurate and informative.

$REVIEW.: In my opinion, The Parent Pact is Laurie Kellogg's sweetest romance so far, but that doesn't mean the hero and heroine don't have their spicy moments. As several other reviewers mentioned, however, The Parent Pact has a Cinderella theme which, I think, gives it a sweeter edge than Ms. Kellogg's previously published titles. All that said, though, even Cinderella must've gone from sweet to spicy after Prince Charming carried her off to his castle -- much like what happened with the hero and heroine in this story!As always, I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Kellogg's work and hope she continues writing books based in Redemption, PA. It sounds like the perfect place to live, and an even better place to fall in love!

$review_text.: I must say, I love it when authors' just keep raising the bar in their own series. I fell in love with each alpha male as I read Nicola's books, but I must say Jason has now edged them all out. Katie seems so high-fashion and a little fragile, a great counterpoint to Jason's rough and tumble soldier, but within the first chapter we find out Katie has been hiding some interesting ways to keep safe. I was secretly cheering her on to show Jason her moves, because he had been a tad aloof to her for months, and she didn't do anything to deserve it. There were some great lines in this novel too, especially Katie talking Jason down from being depressed or even talking herself into fighting for what they were building. And Jason being such a dominant male, but then surprising Katie with wanting to take care of her when she's stressing out . . . such &#34;aww&#34; moments. &#34;Understand?&#34;

I would recommend this book to friends and family for a type of resource. The author gives a lot of websites, other books, and other references in the back that I believe is helpful.

$REVIEW.: Even though I grew up in NorthEast Texas Piney Woods, I've lived/visited many other places (still doing so) due to jobs, etc.  Of all the places I've lived/visited, the West in general and Arizona in specific are my favorite places.  That's why I chose this particular travel guide book.  It has many, many suggestions as to where you can visit/vacation.  This book is informative, and just downright awesome.  I can't wait to get back to Arizona and visit some of these places.Even though NE Texas will always be home, I will always be awed by Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and the such.  If I ever had to live anywhere else, this is where it would be.  And even though I can't go to the SouthWest right this second, reading this book is fun and informative until I can actually get there again . . .(This book also tells the "story behind it" - it tells certain facts and history - therefore, just reading about these places is interesting.)

$review_text.: At some point in your leadership journey, you will find yourself in a position where those words start to bubble up from inside and you wonder:Can I do this?What is happening?Maybe I'm not cut out for this?What went wrong?When will "they" realize I'm just a fraud?If you have gone through this stage or are in it now, there is no better resource I can recommend than the subject of this book review:  Leadership and the Art of Struggle: How great leaders grow through challenge and adversity by Steven Snyder.Finally!My reaction to Leadership and the Art of Struggle was the reader's equivalent of a fist-pump: I leaned back in my chair, closed my eyes, let out a whispered "yes!" and silently thanked Mr. Snyder for taking the time to write this book.In Leadership and the Art of Struggle, Snyder spells out a fundamental truth known to every accomplished leader:  skill comes through growth and growth...is often very painful.Granted, you can read biographies, literature, or watch movies and understand the challenges and adversity that confront leaders.What Snyder adds is a model for understanding the challenges you're going through as well as a process for interpreting them, reflecting upon them, and easing your learning process as you grow in effectiveness.ContentThe definition of leadership Snyder chooses will give you a sense of where he wants to take you. He uses a definition from Harvard instructor Joe Badaracco:Leadership is a struggle by flawed human beings to make some important human values real and effective in the world as it is.That is a deep and profound definition.If it makes you uncomfortable - please read this book.If it makes you sigh with relief and agreement, do yourself a favor and read this book.Following that definition, Snyder guides you through a process of:Understanding where leadership struggles come from.How to respond to yourself when facing these challenges.How to explore new pathways and add to your core competencies.How to depend what he calls your "adaptive energy".The "ART" of StruggleOne aspect of this book I really appreciate is how Snyder begins with literary references, weaves them throughout the book, and closes on the same note.In a world that is often consumed with spreadsheets, it is refreshing and effective for you to be reminded of your own humanity and the role that art plays "to hold...a mirror up to nature".The references are woven throughout a model Snyder presents about how leaders experience challenge, adversity, and struggle, the different forms that adversity can take, and the ability to grow through it.Snyder illustrates every stage in his model through the stories of contemporary business leaders from around the world.Who Should Read This?If you've been leading for any length of time (the greater your self-awareness, the shorter the time required), you will find gold in Leadership and the Art of Struggle.Snyder's model for understanding and growing through adversity will help you make sense and make good out of your current challenges or else will provide you a guide-book through the next storm you encounter.If you are an aspiring leader or just setting out on your journey, you might wait to read this one until you are a little further along. If you do read it, stow away what you learn and begin to apply it as you encounter your first challenges.They hold the keys to your future success!Happy Reading,David Dye, author ofThe Seven Things Your Team Needs to Hear You Say

$review_text.: I received this free to read and review.I was going to abandon this one as I found the style of this book not to my taste and very disjointed almost like a series of connected sound bites. It is written sometimes in the present and sometimes reminiscences about the past. The story just did not flow. However I persevered and it got much better and the style became more conventional and the story came together after about 1/3 of the way through. The ending seemed a bit implausible but I believe there is to be a sequel which may give more explanation.  With the beginning written in a different style I would probably liked the story more as the beginning sets the background for the rest and it took a while to pick up the threads.

$REVIEW.: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review

 That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book
 It had the right amount of intrigue and romance to keep me interested
 There are a couple steamy love scenes but not so many that the sex becomes the main part of the story

 Candi is an author who writes romantic suspense novels when an FBI agent knocks on her door looking for Candi's sister, Jolene, after Jolene drops off her baby and then disappears

 From there, the two of them face danger together

 The dialogue throughout the story flowed well and was believable


 My Sister's Keeper was just as good as many of the monthly romance novels I've read and I will definitely read more books by this author.

$REVIEW.: Code Name: Kayla's Fire (Snow White) concludes  Ghost and Snow White's  story.  I loved the first book, but this one, OMG, it kept me on the edge of my chair and frayed my nerves pretty much from the Prologue.  I knew it HAD to end with marriage, all books do, guy gets the girl of his heart, right?  There were so many tense, and down right nail biting situations, separated by a small calm before each storm, that I was not sure by page 363 that they would survive whole and together and  . . . well, I was riveted to the pages of this book, each situation working on that one nerve I have nursed along over the years until at last, Hooyah, the Blood Shark gets it in the end in a very fitting way.  Mission accomplished in more ways than that. .Read book Code Name: Ghost first, I always like to start at the beginning, then Read Code Name: Kayla's Fire.  You won't want to put it down until Ghost's final mission is completed.  Awesome.  Can't wait for what is in store for Mace and Nina.  Probably will need cookies and coffee for that one too.

$review_text.: I thought this was a cute, romantic story

 I sat down to read a little bit and ended up reading it all in one sitting


 It's a sweet sultry story about second chances, being in love, and heartbreak

 Evie came home heartbroken after her boyfriend in medical school left her without an explanation and won't answer her calls; she runs into Romeo, her high school boyfriend, who she had left without an explanation

 They realize they still have feelings for each other but are their feelings enough to make it work this time?  Can Romeo forgive her for the past heartbreak?  Can Evie get over her boyfriend who left her heartbroken to actually give Romeo a chance?I feel like this story really explores real-life feelings of love and heartbreak


 It has adult content but I felt like it was not over the top
 The sexy scenes lets you understand their feelings and developing relationship better


 I loved the chemistry between Romeo and Evie
 I felt drawn to their characters and relationship

 Romeo is really charming and romantic
 Evie is funny and finds herself in lots of awkward situations

 The family dynamics were really interesting; it gives you insight inside the Filipino culture


 There is lots of talk of food, so don't read it hungry because it will drive you crazy!There are enough twists and turns to keep the story from being too predictable and keeping it interesting and alive


 It was an enjoyable read!  It would make a great beach or poolside read this spring!

$review_text.: I loved both Sophie's Turn and Sophie's Run and wondered how the plot would develop in the third book of the trilogy. Because it had been a few month's since I read Sophie's Run, I was also unsure how quickly I would get back into the story. Not something I had to worry about with this stunner of a book. Within the first few pages I was firmly ensconced back into this fabulous storyline and was not planning to move!When it ended, I was really quite sad! I just wanted to carry on living with these characters who I feel I knew in their lives. One minute I was Sophie, the next I was Dan (if that doesn't sound a bit freaky!). Nicky Wells puts so much effort into developing her characters and making you love them, it really pays off. I also knew the way I wanted the story to end and was starting to worry at one point which way it would turn and how I was going to cope.I could honestly follow this couple until they are well into their old age so hope the author has plenty more adventures up her sleeve! Brilliantly written by Nicky Wells, lots of laugh out loud giggles, plenty of tears and emotional ups and downs along the way with some rather raunchy thrown in, I do believe her ladyship has excelled herself with Sophie's Encore!You don't have to take my word for it. Here are some instructions to do next: Use the links above to buy the book. When you have received it, get rid of your house mates, shut the curtains, take the phone off the hook, and under no circumstances - do not answer the door. You should make a flask up and you may need a box of chocs to dip into from time to time or some snacks as cooking is definitely off the agenda! Then curl up on the sofa, make sure you are comfortable and read away to your heart's content and enjoy every second!

$REVIEW.: Neither was looking for love. However, it will pop up at the most unsuspecting of times and places. Just like a cup of coffee dumped in your lap. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your heart is guarded or if you are unable to imagine finding time for another person in your life. Keys To Her heart is a sweet, romantic, and down to earth read.Everything about this story makes you think this can happen to you.  This makes the characters very easy to relate to. When you feel like you can walk, talk, and feel with them you know you have found a good read. Lily is a single mom who is caring for her mother and working full time. She has a full plate and doesn't think she has room for love. Cody is a police officer in town and wasn't looking for love and has his heart slightly guarded. They have chemistry and heart.So if you are looking for a read that is easier to relate to, this is the one for you. The story will capture your attention and the characters will capture your heart.
$SUMMARY.: The story captures your attention and the characters capture your heart.

I was expecting to read a bit more of bickering and back and forth between the characters.Maybe it was so abrupt because they were like magnets?

$review_text.: A normal yearly gathering of Oria's people turns out to be something quite different from what she expected, when she ends up behind the Bridalveil Falls. She, and four others, become new Dwellers in the land of Ahwahnee, since they reached their eighteenth birthday.All her life unusual things have been happening, which are now starting to make sense to her."You have always been exceptional. You just never considered yourselfspecial. Your gifts were dormant until you turned eighteen."The first sign that things are amiss is the disappearance of Dwellers. Apparently, not everyone is who they appear to be... Oria is discovering her true calling as the Golden Queen fairy of Bridalveil Fall. She has a lot of growing to do in order to fulfill her mission - to destroy the Ala."You have to find compassion and embrace the darkness inside of you, in orderto understand it, and ultimately, to transcend it."Will Oria be able to rise above herself and find the courage and compassion needed to fulfill her destiny?And what about the mysterious Grey Wolf? Who is he really? And what is his mission? Apart from breaking Oria's heart at his disappearance...I love that this fantasy world is actually located at a real place. The author is great at world building and describing the character growth of the personages in the book. It's a coming of age story about discovering who you really are and what abilities, talents and competencies one has - and maybe even more importantly - how you can use them for good. The cliff hanger at the end really pulls me in to read the second installment in this series!

$REVIEW.: Some authors have a gift.A true gift for taking real-world problems and surrounding that with terrific conflict.This author has that true gift.4.5 STARS!!!WOW.  What a terrific book!  I am a huge equestrian fan!  Rode my entire life - until an accident stopped me - and loved that free flying feeling.  That feeling that nothing could touch me.  The barn and those animals were my true sanctuary.  My little piece of heaven where I could always by just me.  This book encompasses that feeling for me.  The specifics needed to make this review make total sense are spoilers.  So bear with me...Bia's family are huge in the Polo arena.  Has many farms, from her home country of Brazil to California.  She's the youngest of 4 boys - her 3 brothers and cousin.  Bia's always felt as she was trying to prove herself to her father and family.  But following her famous polo family around made that difficult.  I felt her needing to branch out in those moments the author gave us that background insight.  Feel her being suffocated by the fame of her brothers.  Bia decides at 22 it's her time.&#34;This was me, living my life, taking charge.&#34;When she arrives at college in Colorado, she's ready to prove to family all that she can be.  But things don't always work out the way we planned.  A sorority and fraternity 'befriend' her.  It's there she meets Garrett.  Garrett is the step-brother to one of the frat brothers.  He doesn't attend college so she's confused as to why he's always there.  I had this same question until I began to put the pieces together.  Garrett is a cowboy - decked out in boots and a hat.  Sexy!  When the pieces to Garrett's puzzle begin to come clearer, I realized just how big a fan of his I was.  I was outraged and frustrated at the things that happened to him.and with things coming to light, I was an even bigger fan.  He knows about loyalty and trust.  He also knows abandonment and betrayal.  I would consider him a tortured hero with all he's been through.  Yet he continues to face it all head on.&#34;I know I'm not a perfect man... but I want to try to be the best man I can be... But when I look at the future and let myself imagine you by my side, I can't think of anything more perfect than that.&#34;Bia is constantly being asked about her culture and being hit on with guys telling her 'You're Brazilian. Come on.'  She's appalled by all the attention.  She has no one to vent to, to tell of her frustrations.  Bia seeks to find a farm nearby.  Somewhere to bring her that solace and that sanctuary she feels when riding.  When she runs into Garrett at the farm she chooses.  He's a trainer there.  And every time they ran into each other or they exchanged words there was so much sexual tension I could cut it with a knife.  Their interactions are penetrable to the souls of readers.  There's much there between them it's steamy and hot.  When they share their first kiss I wanted to jump for joy!  Eureka!!  Finally!!&#34;I had never been with a man that could bring me to my knees with one simple touch - and I wanted to.  I wanted him.&#34;And guess what... SHE kissed HIM!!!  So exciting when us gals make the first move.  Anyway, it's clear as crystal that they have something.  But something keeps him away.  After every great conversation or kiss, it's as if he tries to avoid her.  And as the lies and rumors about Bia become more intense, the more defeated she feels.  It was as if I could see and feel her shoulders slumping more and more.  Bia, so badly, wants to prove to her family that she can do this.  That she can complete her goal with her head held high.  But amongst all the events that happen to her, she looses touch with who she really is.  And as the last piece of Garrett's puzzle is placed in front of her - well she shatters.&#34;I didn't believe in soul mated.  I believed that there were a handful of people with whom an individual could be perfect with, but on a planet with seven billion people, a handful was hard to find... I'd found one of mine... Still, I had to let him go.&#34;This was one stunning display of real world problems - bullying, and deceit, coupled with the realization of really and truly finding yourself.  When the lights go down at the end of the night - who are you and is that who you want to be?  Let it be known that I have not read  Breaking the Reins -  but I will and very soon!  Breaking Fences has become a favorite of mine.  I adored the characters - some I loathed - and the conflicts and how they resolve were priceless.  When something epic happens, I've heard some say 'You couldn't make this s#!t up!'  But Juliana Haygert did... and it was one of the best journey's I've been on!!

He has the full participation and cooperation of his elderly neighbor.  He even leaves the neighbor alone with the suspect giving her a gun and telling her to shoot the girl if necessary.  Several times he is bested in a fight by this 100 lb girl. And even the elderly neighbor gets the drop on him and holds him at gun point. Now the heroine is filthy dirty and foul smelling. The hero is unkempt, living in a dirty stinky apartment. The girl is so traumatized from a brutal past and living on the streets that she has serious mental and social issues.  But since the story is somewhat short, I am sure they quickly clean up and fall in love, live happily ever after without getting any mental health help for the girl.

$REVIEW.: The minutes just drag on at the end of the day.  You try organizing your desk, you try emptying your in-box, and you do anything but work to pass the time. If only you could leave a few minutes early, what would actually happen, really?  To top it all off, you have a boss who loves his job and thinks everyone else should too.  Skipping out early would never enter their minds yet this idea enters your mind more than you care to admit.  In this comical short story, the answer on how to skip out early is addressed as one co-worker executes a plan with another worker to leave just a few minutes early.  It will leave you laughing as they cover as the bases but will they be able to pull it off?
$SUMMARY.: Funny story.  Short story but a good point.

$review_text.: I got a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest reviewThe novel tells the story of how Nick and Mina win the Pen and the Sword and set out on an adventurous path. Nick is new in town and the first person he befriends is outsider Mina. She's much stronger than the average human and she's intelligent and interested in many things. Nick can see ghosts and other creatures that normal people don't see, so it's a perfect fit. But Nick also makes friends with the local baseball team where be becomes a player. One day, Nick and Mina find a sword with a pen embedded in it and learn about their heritage. Nick is destined to chronicle the unnatural world, and Mina has to protect him. There are enemies who have already killed Nicks uncle, and they will stop at nothing to get the Sword and the Pen.Things I liked:I liked the cover. Simple but very evocative and fitting.The banter between Mina and Nick was great. Those two characters came alive and were the reason why I kept reading the book although not much happened. It was clear to me that the author has a great talent creating believable characters. Also, it was quite nice to have a strong heroine who has to protect the boy. The love between the two seemed a bit hurried to me, but then, I'm not a teen any more. Maybe things work out faster these days. ;-)I enjoyed learning about Mark Twain (coming and going with a comet) and about life in an American high school.Things I didn't like:There were way too many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the book. I am German, which means I'm not a native speaker and most likely to overlook errors in the language, and even I could spot them. Luckily, with the help of a good editor, this fault is easily remedied (an advantage of eBooks).The antagonist didn't show up till close to the end, and his impact on the plot was minimal. It wasn't such a big drawback, however, since the dynamic between Mina and Nick propelled the story forward and kept it interesting.There were several great ideas that weren't fully developed (like the leprechaun's luck).Final verdict:Overall, this was a very enjoyable read if a tad unstructured. It makes a good starting point for a series. I recommend finding a good editor to get rid of the errors though. Without them, my rating would have been 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: I didn't get this at first because of the cover and the title. I thought it would be cheesy but I actually really enjoyed it. I loved Juliet and Reed. I Can't wait to see if there is going to be another book about them. The author kind of hinted at it at the end but also left this story completely finished (since it is about skinny dipping lol). I just wish Juliet would have pulled her head out of her butt long before she did.  Dylan was an ass and after she had warnings from at least three people (including his own brother) she still stayed and refused to see what an ass he was...especially when you have a God like Reed right infront of you.

$REVIEW.: I bought this two minutes after I finished Faith and Fidelity (thank you kindle!)  Often when you read an author back to back like that,  the second book doesn't shine as well.  And at the very start,  I was not so happy.  I had just left Matt and Evan in a good space and here they were having difficulties...  But their difficulties felt real and just as the first book took us on an odd journey but was sure every step of the way,  here we see Evan,  truly loving Matt,  but not happy with any outside scrutiny of his relationship,  and thus hurting Matt and harming the relationship.I liked all the characters,  I still like the kids (I know children and often the children you meet in romances have no bearing to any real living child!)  I believed in everyone's actions/reactions and I loved the ending,  Evan's speech...  lovely!So this was my second Tere Michale's book but I'm definitely going to read more5334 locations,  a decent length,  and felt like good value for money.

$REVIEW.: THIS IS ONE GREAT BOOK!  It's well-written, a true-page turner....and more important, a TRUE story!  I not only enjoyed reading it, (so veddy, veddy, VEDDY much!), but learnt something about myself in the process.Jerramy Fine and I, it seems, have more than a little in common
 Her parents are hippies

 Mine are committed, but liberal, Conservative Jews.She grew up in Colorado


 I have recently moved there
 And -- most important of all -- both she and I have ALWAYS dreampt of marrying a Prince!The major difference is that Ms
Fine actually WENT to England to pursue her goal

 As I am a bit older than she is, I always thought my dream completely out of reach
 Silly me
 Ms


Fine went...and found satisfaction, romance and reality, as well!This book is a true gem for romantics
 But it's long-time, permanent value may be in this: It is the first book I have come across, to discuss INDIGO PEOPLE
 What is an "Indigo Person"?  In this book, and on Ms
Fine's website, I have discovered that, in "New Age" philosophy, an "Indigo Person" is supposed to be the next step in human evolution!  Hallmarks of being an "Indigo" are: an intense, life-long interest in royalty, the sneaking suspicion that your parents may not be your real parents, and ear-lobes that are attached to your ears, and not detatched.I must here somewhat sheepishly report that yes, I, too, am an Indigo!(And since discoving it, via Ms

Fine's wonderful book, I sure hope that the good points in we Indigos will outshine our bad ones -- or heaven help this planet!  Then again, maybe the bad points I notice -- shopaholism, not being as grateful for what I have as I should be, being too respectful of all people older than myself, no matter what my better judgement says about them -- are my very own PERSONAL faults, and NOT necessarily those of other Indigos.Charming, readable, and exciting, this book READS like a fairy-tale

 But it's all true!  And -- with the useful information in it about "Indigo" people, I see this book as a classic-in-the-making, for many future generations, to come!

$review_text.: I have just completed my reading of Andrew Bostom's latest work "The Legacy of Islamic Anti-Semitism".  It is a 750 page work so not a quick read but absolutely worth the time.  This is an invaluable resource carefully divided into many chapters that make quick access to specfic areas easy.  The breadth of material is stunning and I found many authors normally reputed to be "tolerant" and "peaceful" making absolutely outrageous statements against the Jews, such as Al-Ghazzali.  The scholarship in this work is excellent and its comprehensiveness will silence those who try to claim cherry-picking.  In fact it is becoming increasingly obvious that the cherry pickers are those who try to make the Qur'an and Muslim literature sound tolerant.  I have found that every verse in the Qur'an which seems to be tolerant, if read in context, actually means the opposite.  Dr. Bostom's book helps people to understand this.I did take some time to read the negative reviews of the book and they all make the same mistake, they assume that the Muslim historical propaganda is accurate in portraying the Jews of Muhammad's day as being people who harmed the Muslims.  These are works of polemic and propaganda that always portray Muhammad's enemies in the worst possible light.  A careful study of the Qur'an proves why Muhammad hated the Jews.  He hated them because they refused to acknowlege him as a Prophet.  Good Jews, in Muhammad's parlance, are really Muslims anticipating the coming of Muhammad.  But Muhammad's chaotic, innaccurate, anachronistic, and simply silly renditions of Jewish traditions ensured that the Jews of Medina would reject him as a Prophet.  They became, therefore, a grave ideological threat because they could show where Muhammad got his ideas from and all the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in his text.  He killed far more Jews than polytheists.  His book and his behavior are now the policy of God and Dr. Bostom illustrates this with all the clarity one could wish.  Thank you Dr. Bostom!

$review_text.: I like contemporary stories with alpha males and strong women. This was my first Jennifer Blake book and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of zing (!) in it. After all, if we're going to escape into romantic stories, shouldn't there be some heat? This story takes place on the Tuscan coast (a beautiful area) between an American woman and an Italian man. His need to control things clashes with her need to be independent, all in a gorgeous setting.I have a few minor quibbles, which added up to taking off a star. The biggest quibble is that it felt dated - at no point does Ms. Blake have her heroine using a cell phone or checking email to contact the office. I'm not sure if this is a slightly older (print) story that has just been released to digital/Kindle. If not, it felt weird to me that Amanda spends her time relaxing and not handling work (when she's not at the hospital).Aside from that, a good read, especially for the price. When you compare this book to some of the serialized works out there (e.g., Beth Kery's Because You Are Mine, $2.99 for each installment), it's an excellent purchase. I'll definitely read more of Ms. Blake's work.I always find it helpful to understand a reviewer's reading preferences since we may not have the same perspective. So, for what it's worth, I like Nora Roberts (newer), Lisa Kleypas (contemporary), Victoria Dahl, MM Daughtridge and Shannon Stacey. I also like some of the grittier stuff like Fifty Shades, Sylvia Day, Beth Kery, Raine Miller (Blackstone) and Samantha Towle (Mighty Storm). Not all are great writing but they are good storytelling.
$SUMMARY.: Love with just enough Zing!

$review_text.: First WOWZA! Erin Leaf has moved into "Automatic Buy" territory.  This is the second in a series of stories about menage couples.  One of the best parts about Erin's writing is that it presents unique situations in a completely believable manner.  I only have one complaint, and that is the length of the stories.  Despite the HEA, I really, really want to know these people, and actually find myself to be saddened at the end of the book.  Crazy as this part will sound - there is an aspect to these stories that makes me wish that my life was closer to that which is represented in the story.  Ms. Leaf describes a kissing scene that makes yearn to go practice on some lucky man (or two of them!).  Don't even get me started on the actual sex scenes.  Holy Moly people - snap on the seat belts and hold on for a fun ride!  I really am a fan of the whole menage concept (despite it being outside my experience) but when I read something from the Desire, OK series - I have to remind myself that there are not entire towns that work with the concept of menage couples.  What Erin writes bypasses all of that - and she manages to write with a humor that had me chuckling aloud.  If you haven't had the opportunity to acquaint yourself with Ms. Leaf's work - then do - trust me, you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: I liked this little booklet. It was an easy read, straightforward, and informative regarding its topic. It explains a small business' need to create an Internet Presence. And it goes through the basic ways to create such a presence. Obviously you will need a Web site. A blog would be nice to have, too. And then getting involved in the LinkedIn site was also suggested and explained pretty well, too. A few other social media sites were mentioned like Facebook, but not overdone. I appreciated this since I am not a Facebook fan.The author is a fan of Wordpress.com, or at least I think he is. I know I am, and I agreed with all he said about it. You can create your Web site using Wordpress.com. You can create your blog or blogs using Wordpress.com. Or you can create all your sites (Web site & blogs) using Wordpress.com.The author is a consultant to companies needing help with their Internet Presence. So the book is clearly a marketing piece to help promote his practice.  Although I thought the booklet was well organized and well written, I thought it was kind of short to be called a book. I've been doing some reading lately on selling books through Amazon as ebooks and based on what I have read the Kindle edition of this book probably should have been no more than $3.99 and probably should have been priced at $2.99. This brings up an interesting point regarding this book - the use of Amazon as a way to sell content ( information & marketing materials) is yet another consideration when creating an Internet Presence mix. The author failed to discuss this, and I think it probably should have been discussed. Do you price such products at a higher price to make much money? Or do you price them so they will sell and be read at a lower price? 4 stars!

But it's been a week since I finished this book, and I still find myself thinking about Enid and Becky as if they were real people I knew.  Their lives are full of all the loneliness, longing and perversity that makes them so frustratingly human.Daniel Clowes does an excellent job of creating richly complex characters, whose &quot;adventures&quot; are also extremely entertaining to read.A big part of the appeal of this book, especially if you're a guy, is to be able to get into the head of a teenage girl, and be able to experience for once first-hand all of her thorny, bitter-sweet, and contradictory thoughts and feelings.  You'll see that their minds can be just as jumbled as ours.

$REVIEW.: This book is much,much more than an episode guide with pretty pictures.  The layout of the book is in a format of a top secret manual, and even the insides of the book maintain that.  Each episode-specific guide is labeled 'Ongoing Archive Notes', and each has a section on Alien Activity, Alien Technology, Rift Activity, Security, Staff, and Other Staff Issues.  The last section often has hilarius commentary like this for example: "Now that we have all tried, it is clear that only Ianto knowns how to operate that damn coffee maker.  I suspect it contains alien technology".Throughout the book you'll see cool things like clips of 'real' newspapers with headlines like "Alien Skeleton Snapped UP by Millionaire Parker', reports by Torchwood staff, and memos between characters.  As a Martha fan I really liked the one on page 133.Overall, if you're a Torchwood fan, then definitely get this book.

Just runs up to his mortally wounded arch enemy and falls for the old "come-closer-I-need-to-tell-you-something-with-my-last-dying-gasp" trick. Howard is not that dumb. He is not. And HAL should have saved him anyway. So sad.Howard Beck and his friendship with HAL really made these books. Fiction where anything could happen is exciting, but goodness!

$review_text.: As several other reviewers noted, this book is a strange historical mix: neither strategic, nor operational, nor tactical, shuttling randomly among different points of view and different timelines. For instance, there is a map of the situation in Heeresgruppe Nordukraine in July 1944 and the author starts speaking of operations around Kovel in March-April, suddenly switching  to the July 1944 battle, without any sort of description of how the situation changed in between. This approach repeats itself throughout the book and ends up being maddening.I bought this as a kindle book, and I pity those who paid for the hardback version.One bright point, as another reviewer noted. The maps are good, and their quality of reproduction is outstanding in a kindle. At maximum magnification, they are entirely readable, something lacking in every other kindle book I have seen up to now. Well done, Helion, and what do they know that every other publishing company doesn't?

$review_text.: I really, really liked this story. I was a little torn on the rating...I'd actually give it a 4.5 stars but it was just too good to go down to 4 stars. This book (and the hero, Luke) reminded me of the book More than Meets the Ink (I just loved James from that story) which I found very pleasing because I just love a sweet, Alpha male and that's what Luke is. :DEmma gets pushed in to getting a tattoo by her best friend and meets Luke, her tattoo artist. She's not sure what to think of him at first and is a little put off by his attitude because he tends to order rather than ask. She had a past boyfriend that acted like that and he hurt her badly so she tries to back off. Fortunately Luke doesn't let her and Emma starts to realize that although he's kind of overbearing he's not a jerk like her old boyfriend. I really liked seeing their relationship grow once she let her guard down.Luke is a hot alpha male that knows how to be sweet. He decides right off that Emma is the one he wants. He pretty much tells her he's claimed her as his from the start and gently but firmly pushes their relationship forward. He does really well at getting past her shields without being a total jerk about it. I really liked seeing their relationship growing and although in RL timeframes things progressed pretty quickly it wasn't insta-love like some of the books and seems realistic.The story was really fun. I will mention that Emma's family is nuts. I liked her family though...her brother's character was the only one I didn't feel was really fleshed out...sometimes it seemed like he was only in the book for an annoyance factor (since he is severely spoiled and most of his parts in the book are him torturing Emma with childish behavior). Other than that, all the secondary characters are great and there's indications of a possible relationship between Emma's best friend Ally and Brandon (Luke's brother) and/or Jackson (Luke's best friend). I can't wait for the next in the series to see how things work out for that trio. :DThere were some issues with a stalker that puts Emma in danger. Fortunately things turn out well and Emma comes out of things alright.I really enjoyed this story, a lot! I was very happy I bought it and am looking forward to the next book in the series to come out. I'd recommend this story. Thumbs up! :D
$SUMMARY.: Great book with a sweet alpha male! :D

$review_text.: &#8220;There&#8217;s no place in the world for you &#8211; a boy like you&#8221; - how short-sighted and selfish can anyone be by saying that to another human being, let alone a defenceless child!  In her latest psychological thriller, Through the Cracks, Honey Brown delivers to the reader a taut and gritty tale that holds you in the grips of your emotions as you turn the pages late into the night.The year is 1984 and we are introduced to Adam.  Illiterate and socially inept, he has been locked in a backroom for most of his life, suffering physical and psychological abuse from a man he&#8217;s always known as his father.  When Adam finally realises that he has the strength to stop what is happening to him, he makes a conscious decision to bring an end to his nightmare and escape the bruising hands of an unpredictable tormentor and the confines of his prison.Adam&#8217;s just coming to terms with the gravity of what he has done when Billy appears, seemingly at just the right moment, taking him under his wing.Billy&#8217;s a streetwise kid, with it soon becoming obvious that he has been left to his own devices for most of his life.  With Adam still trying to make sense of this new chaotic world around him, they embark on a somewhat risky adventure in which we are introduced to the secondary characters &#8211; some good, some bad &#8211; who have in some way shaped Billy&#8217;s, and possibly Adam&#8217;s, life.  But Billy soon proves to Adam that he is someone that can be trusted and for the first time in his life, Adam has a friend.As the police slowly close in on the missing person's investigation that has been ongoing for the last ten years, the narrative reaches its climax and the denouement reveals, through both that investigation and Billy&#8217;s dialogue, the events of that fateful day along with the part he played in what was to become Adam&#8217;s life.Honey Brown doesn&#8217;t write comfortable!  In her four previous novels she challenges her readers to their limits, so why should Through the Cracks be any different?  This time, however, she tackles the difficult subject of child sexual abuse which, while discomfiting for most of us, can only be described as terrifying for the victims.  Without resorting to graphic scenes of the abuse that was perpetrated in the past, she instead delves into her own mind, asking the &#34;what if&#34; questions and using Adam&#8217;s thoughts, along with her short, snappy dialogue to skilfully convey those feelings of dejectedness, fear, hopelessness and worthlessness that every victim must feel, thus providing the reader with a deep emotional connection to these two boys and &#34;pushing beyond the barriers&#34; of our comfort zones.In a guest post over at Monique Mulligan's blog, Writenote Reviews, Honey recently had this to say about the &#34;What If&#34; questions:&#8220;... I believe it&#8217;s my job as a writer to push beyond the barriers our hearts and minds sometimes put up, and explore the tougher topics and issues. I make it my business not to baulk at shocking things, or be too quick to judge what is right or wrong, I try not to fall too quickly into outrage, and I steer well clear of pity. Every element of being human is explored in literature and the arts, and childhood trauma and sexual abuse shouldn&#8217;t be exempt from that. I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s one of the most important topics to cover, because it is so prevalent. We need stories written about it. We need creative minds delving deep, demystifying sexual abuse and pulling back the cloak of shame.&#8221;Despite the novel being written from Adam&#8217;s POV only, Billy too becomes as much a fully realised character through his dialogue as Adam does through his thoughts and, while we all know the statistics on the cycle where the abused can become the abuser, Honey&#8217;s deft hand shines a light on the altruism that they both display, towards each other and the various animals that cross their paths, and I found this extremely touching.I will be the first to admit that there were scenes throughout that had me moved to tears with the sheer intensity of what they had been exposed to in their short existence &#8211; I am a mother after all &#8211; but Honey&#8217;s compelling writing style sucked me in so much that I just couldn&#8217;t see myself abandoning Adam and Billy in their time of need.Although some may say that the blurb leaves little to the imagination, I am of the opinion that it is just the beginning of a story about two boys searching for their place in this world, one in which the reader can only hope that both will find their way out of the darkness to the light shining through the cracks!While themes of child exploitation, manipulation and fear vie for attention, the remarkable human endurance, courage and survival that permeates these negatives will resonate long after the final page is turned and I wish to thank Penguin Books for providing me with a hard copy of this perfectly executed psychological thriller.

$review_text.: This book is an excellent guide for creating specific colors and color ranges with procion mx fiber reactive dyes.  The book begins with a very brief outline of precautions, tools, how to mix the dyes and some general dye instructions and then moves right into the formulas for mixing colors.  Formulas are calculated for dyeing fat quarters in 1 quart bags or 1 yard pieces in 1 gallon bags so if you work in different sizes than that you'll need to adjust the formulas accordingly.  Chapters are broken down by colors; yellows, oranges, reds, purples, blues, greens and blacks and each chapter outlines how to dye clear and muted colors with ranges from dark to light and complementary cross.  There's also a chapter on dyeing rainbows in clear dark/light and muted dark/light as well as some information on specialty techniques such as dyeing obre, twisting, layering and pleating and dipping.If you're working with cold water procion mx type fiber reactive dye and you want to be able to produce consistent color results then you'll find this book an invaluable reference.

$review_text.: Animal is the man we love and loathe all at once. His life is the one we dread hearing about, yet become fascinated when we hear things about it. K'wan is the MAN with the Animal books. Makes me wish I lived in New York, just so I could run into Tayshawn. The character is so flawed, so filled with hate, hurt, and anger that we wanna hate him, but he's so vulnerable, just begging to be loved that we can't hate him. Animal makes us look into the eyes of a killer, yet we see pain, love, and a need to be loved that makes the reader want to hug and kiss him and make him feel the love, so that he may put down his weapons and learn to live a &#34;normal&#34; life. The ending that we read was well thought out, yet, I could see it coming. Not the main ending, but the very end. Oh boy, I can't wait to read the next installment.And I love that K'wan writes so that the reader doesn't have to have read the previous book for us to get it. I appreciate that.

$review_text.: I was excited when I found this trilogy - I find that not many love stories are written by men, so it intrigued me and I was interested in getting this perspective from such an (obviously) intelligent and driven male author.I thoroughly enjoyed the journey both Ivan and Jaden took - 2 very strong, independent characters - 2 very different careers - 2 very separate experiences as each of their lives crumble - Ivan's, self-destructive - Jaden's, self-loathing - -  and the journey back to finding their own selves, which opened their hearts and heads to finding each other.Dr. Ivan's poetic words are highlighted throughout my Kindle and many have turned into mini affirmations for me.  The books are full of "real" advise about love, relationships and life.  I have read many of them out loud to my teenagers and catch myself referring to them when I question my own life.Thank you Dr. Ivan for a fun, exciting, sexy, lovely trilogy. They were a joy to read and will remain a treasure of beautiful, intelligent words I will often read over and over again as I too look for my own perfect destiny.

$REVIEW.: They have twisted the love and discipleship that Jesus modeled for us into manipulation and infliction of pain on helpless babies.  They ignore AAP guidelines and put the health of babies at risk.  They focus on outward obedience at all costs, forcing children to bury their emotions and put on a happy face--regardless.Following these authors' advice will teach your children that God is punitive and vengeful.  It will encourage your children to deny their emotions and individuality.  It will teach them to get away from their parents at the earliest possible age to experience a breath of freedom.Ask yourself how you like to be treated and discipled.  Not like this!

$review_text.: This is a charming little book (65 pages) that took me by surprise.Part One of what author David Tish calls "The Sheldon Beasley Series" (which I have not read), MADAME CHARMAINE begins with Sheldon's awakening on the first day of summer vacation. Excited by the prospect of a summer away from school, eleven-year old Sheldon rushes out with his pal Jimmy to team up with fellow companion Bull--and eventually their mutual female friend Tabby--to gaze upon a mysterious find left behind by recent flood waters: a locked and extremely heavy metal chest.But, as they are soon to find out, every action has consequences, and when they decide to move it downriver so they can keep the find to themselves, they very nearly drown. And when they finally do succeed in opening the chest its strange contents--and especially the mysterious circumstances surrounding it--will lead them down a strange and ultimately dangerous path toward discovery.MADAME CHARMAINE is quite definitely a Young Adult novel, yet parents can be assured that teens and pre-teens will enjoy the story equally. There are some dangerous activities that take place within, and some cultural discussions of characterizations like "white trash," but I think most parents would agree that the story is really intended for all. There is no profanity, nothing of a sexual nature, and the young boys and girl are treated as equals within the pages.For instance, one of the children is a stutterer, and that "handicap" is handled with fairness and politeness, even grace, as that character turns in some of the most crucial and inspirational portions of the story. I found this to be a story told with even-handedness and respect, so these issues should be looked at as definite "pluses."The nearest example I can think of that might provide a parallel to the story would be Stephen King's novella "The Body" (made into a terrific movie called STAND BY ME, with River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton), but the action and intensity in those two works is much more intense than takes place here. This is a much more G-rated tale, and parents--as I noted before--should not expect the intensity of those works in this instance.  But the parallel is alike in other regards, such as mixing humor and drama, and there is even a pancake-eating contest that bears some parallels with the pie-eating contest in those works...but again, there is no "adult" language or vulgarity here other than an occasional "Jeez" or "shut up!"I found MADAME CHARMAINE quite interesting and, while it is a bit short, prospective readers can be assured that it is more a matter of being concise and unadorned by extraneous material. It moves along quickly and keeps the reader interested, even captivated, throughout. There were times I did not want to put it down, and that's the mark of a well-told tale. Young readers (and their parents) will enjoy it, so much that parents should be prepared: I can only assume they will want to rush off to read the rest of the Sheldon Beasley series once they do.

$REVIEW.: I love anything to do with code-breaking and Enigma and this book really fit the bill. The very fact that I'm typing this review on a computer is testament to the work and development that occurred at Bletchley Park in the war.This isn't a book about the code-breaking itself but rather the social history of life at the park and the extraordinary work that went on behind the scenes of the Second World War I had no idea just how large the operation was, approximately 9000 people were working there when it was at its height. It was the little details that were most interesting, such as the billets they lived in and the different personalities of the men in charge. There was also a good deal of perspective from the many women who worked there, from the code-breakers to the WRENs who managed the bombes to the messenger girl.It was very good at explaining the pressures the people were under, the difficult shifts they had to work and the mental stress this would cause. Lots of fascinating stories such as the romances and cultural side as well. It was also very interesting to read how the secret was kept for so long, which was a minor miracle in itself.What I found most moving was the story of Alan Turing and his tragic end. What a waste, imagine what would have happened if he had lived to his natural age and the developments he could have created.Fascinating stuff and if you are interested in the part of history, then a must buy.

$REVIEW.: You think you're in for one ride, but the author takes you on another. And I just love that. ShameLess is a beautifully written story and provides many life lessons along with its tale of redemption, acceptance, and love.Ren and Stefan find their way to each other under less than ideal circumstances, but he never lets that stand in his way of almost always doing the right thing by her. Even through his screw up, he's sweet, strong, and sensitive.I love how strong Ren is even though she is vulnerable as well--a perfect combination for a heroine to weave her way into my heart, twisting and wringing every emotion from me.I highly recommend you buy it, read it, love it!

$review_text.: Can you tell from the title that I loved this book?  I seriously would give it 10 stars if I could.  I am partial to this type of story line.  Madly in love young couple separates for XYZ reason and reunites years later and deals with all the hurt, betrayal, longing they've experienced on their way to a HEA.  I've never seen it done as beautifully, heart-wrenchingly well as it's done in 'Take This Regret'.  Wow, you can feel Christian's pain, regret, turmoil, love.  And you can feel every bit of Elizabeth's hurt, anger, fear, confusion.  It's not often I become SO invested and care SO much what happens to characters in a book.  But because I felt what each of the characters was feeling so strongly, it was agonizing (in a good way) watching these characters figure out their complicated and painful situation.  What Christian did was pretty awful, but for once, I felt a hero truly redeemed himself and then some.  There is pretty much nothing more he could have done to make up for his mistakes.  And even though at one point I was a little annoyed at Elizabeth, when I put myself in her shoes and really thought about how I would feel in her situation, I realized, I would react somewhat like she did.  It would take A LOT to get pst what Christian did to her.  This book is so well written!  I cannot recommend it highly enough.

$REVIEW.: I actually wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book. I downloaded it based off a couple of recommendations without reading the blurb for the book. I was not disappointed. Although there were times when I wished the author would skip over the past parts I realized you needed that information to totally understand the characters and their development throughout the story. I enjoyed the storyline but I wish Sebastian would've fought harder for what he wanted instead of always putting Julia first, especially when they were growing up.  He settled for second best all the time because he didn't want to hurt her feelings. I was glad with the direction the story started to move in towards the end and hope Sebastian continues to go after what he wants. I also loved his interactions with Christian.... and can't wait for the next book.

$review_text.: It took awhile to read this book. It is not that the book was bad, but that there was always something better to read. That in itself, I suppose, can be considered damning praise.The story is about a family with unique powers that are used for evil and manipulation, all except for one girl who has the added power of being able to regenerate at the cellular level so it seems she cannot die. She even manages to heal herself from a decapitation. When she finds out that her family believes the decapitation has finally killed her, she escapes from the family's estate and stumbles across "the Network".The Network is an organization of special operatives that want to find enough evidence to shut the Family down completely and in the process their members keep disappearing. Magnolia, or "Mag" joins up with the members of The Network to accomplish their mission while battling her own demons and a growing attraction to one of the team.The writer does an adequate job with the story and has an efficient writing style which will keep most readers engaged from cover to cover. The ending, however, leaves me hoping there will be a sequel as there is obviously some unfinished business between several characters which makes it emotionally unfulfilling.

$REVIEW.: I read this book in 2010 when I was starting to learn online 6-max LHE.  If I could give it 6 Stars, I would.  It is a very well written book, and probably the &#34;bible&#34; of online 6-max LHE.  It helped me become a winner the short time I was playing online .50/1.00.  I have since switched to no-limit, and I really don't know how applicable this book is today in 2013 with all the other content out there.  But I imagine it is still applicable for today's games.  I'm a huge fan of most of the D&B publisher's poker books.  They come out with great material.

$REVIEW.: Without boring you with a detailed breakdown of all the great stuff in the box, or even the very good quality of the products, I will simply say that this is a must have for any Shadowrun GM. Period. There are alternate character creation methods, including skill and gear kits that can really speed up the process. A book of all the tables from all the sourcebooks - awesome.Best of all, a side by side comparison of the "story" of a Shadowrun and the rules that govern play. This is an amazing method for explaining and teaching how the rules come into play.I have played 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions now, and this product is a necessity.

$review_text.: After feeling so despondent and rung out from Breaking Nova, I almost, almost, didn't want to even pick this one up. Breaking Nova, tore my heart out and mangled it. I ached for Quinton and I was in anguish over what would become of him. How could the ending have been so brutal and so hard to live with? Why couldn't I get him out of my head?I knew if I picked this up that once again my heart would be ripped out and stomped on, more than likely, more than once but I did it anyways. Oh why must I torture myself with these hard realistic, heartbreaking reads?Because, simply put, the writing and the journey make it all worth it, oh yes, they do. And Sorensen knows how to write them. So raw and gritty and sometimes you are so put off and disgusted by what happens to those beautiful characters that she writes, that even though you love her for her writing and having created them in the first place, you can't help but hate her for all the pain she puts them through as well.And just like I suspected from the very beginning this wasn't an easy read. Once again it was gut churning and sad and there was a lot of heartache along the way for all involved. It was gritty and some scenes left me feeling dirty and in need of a good shower simply because I could so vividly see Quinton's surroundings and the living conditions he was in. It was awful.There are some tough situations and scenarios and unfortunately not a whole lot of happiness or light moments, in fact, I think this might have felt darker than the first one. But the writing was captivating and real if not raw feeling.Truly my heart broke for everyone and my only real complaint was the ending. Where was my happily ever after? Was that really how it ended? Is there going to be another one, because dang it, there better be. I did not put that much time, emotion and feeling into this to be left hanging like that. I don't even know what to think other than once again I am left wishing that I would have waited to start this one until all the books were out. Until I knew for sure that it had an ending or maybe even a beginning for Quinton and Nova.Am I disappointed? No, not really, just anxious for the next and anxious for all to have their happily ever after like I so desperately want them to have.

$REVIEW.: I was fortunate enough to be one of ten people to win an autographed e-ARC from the author! I was so hoping to win because, as you can see from the blurb above, this is a steampunk fantasy novel and I truly enjoy steampunk novels!Susan Kaye Quinn writes characters that leap off the page. I don't know how this happens; I only know that it completely enthralls me when an author is able to relay every nuance of a character so that I can see him/her clearly in my head, how they would have a facial tic of disapproval, a smirk, a smug grin. From the beginning chapters, I was already liking Aniri, wondering about Janak, puzzled about the Queen, and had this inexplicable funky distaste for Devesh. Perhaps it was the description of him as a courtesan that alerted me? I didn't think "court lover";  I leapt to "don't you dare trust this guy; he's a silky, court-trained, liar!"Aniri has 2 weeks to go before her 18th birthday when she, as the Third Daughter, can marry for love if she so chooses. Imagine her surprise and despair when her mother proposes to her that she marry a barbarian prince to ensure peace between their lands. But there is, of course, more to it. When you're royalty, things are never a simple matter of heart.Prince Ashoka Malik quickly captured my interest and heart. The more he spoke, the more restrained passion he exuded; the more he engaged Aniri, the more enraptured she became. This was a lovely tale of a girl growing up, maturing, and becoming a woman who thinks, as opposed to being so easily influenced with romantic ideas of love and "roughing it" to be with the one she wants. Incredibly well written, the vivid setting was crisp in my mind and the pace of the novel let everything unfold in my imagination as if I were watching a movie filled with action, intrigue, sweet romance, and drama. As the plot raced on, I was cursing real life for not letting me just sit glued to my kindle, punching the touch screen to get to the next page. Kindle Bruiser? Oh yes. Yes, indeed.And while this particular tale ended, the thread is still on going. It's a cliffhanger, for sure, but one that I think you will tolerate well since there is a resolution to the major problem in this book. I, for one, cannot wait for more. The Third Daughter releases TODAY. Get it. Seriously. You love steampunk, east indian overtures, romance, fantasy, intrigue? Then you need to get this. I'll be keeping my eye out for SECOND DAUGHTER and FIRST DAUGHTER.

$REVIEW.: Serving Him, stories selected and edited by Rachel Kramer Bussel is an anthology that focuses on sexual submission.  As stated on the back of the book this collection focuses on women submitting to men, whether they are their partner or a stranger.I really enjoyed reading this collection of stories due to the fact that there was a lot of variety and I found most of the stories highly arousing.  I liked that this anthology had some stories where the submission was physical, mental or even focused on submitting in a way to combat certain fears and insecurities.  It was really easy for me to imagine myself in the position of many of the main characters and this simply made the reading experience even better. There are 22 stories in all and in my opinion there is something for everyone.Of course I had some stories that I liked better than others either because they were so well written, presented a fantasy that I had never thought of, or because they turned me on more than others.Here are my favorites:Coffee Break by Kristina WrightUnder Direction by Teresa Noelle RobertsSafe Sane and Consensual by Ariel GrahamI Always Do by Kiki DelovelyPinky by Kissa StarlingShining in the Dark by Bex VanKootRoom #3 by Emily BinghamPaper Doll by JoySubbing by Rachel Kramer BusselOverall I give this anthology 5 stars and I was very happy to read it.

However, it is hard to navigate...the sections are spilt into age groups..my baby is 16mths and his age group has by far the least amount of recipes..yet when i looked at the menu planner, it consisted of many recipes from the 3-5 age group..so- which section do i choose from!?The other problem is that so many of the recipes take 45 minutes plus to prepare and cook and i simply do not have the time and energy especially with a toddler hanging off my leg shouting, " Mummy, HOLD!" wanting to be picked up!So far, we have made one thing in the last 2 weeks and to be honest, there are so many items in here, i just don't know where to start


If you are used to cooking elaborate 3 course meals every night for yourself then you will probably love this book

I also do not like the amount of sugar that is used in nearly all of the desserts, i have used Annabel Karmel books prior to this and loved them so will call it quits on this book and order another of hers.Good luck Master Chefs!

$review_text.: I couldn't put this book down! I'm aching to know what happens next, and I have nothing else to read to distract me of my suffering. I give it five stars. It's just as good, if not better than Voyage. I don't know if it's just that I have an active imagination, but from the beginning of Voyage I was able to foresee where Flotilla would be headed. I was glad that I was correct, but also still surprised at events that I had not expected.Scott is such a badass leader, which I love. His character is kind, sympathetic, and loving, but at the same time he knows how to stand up for himself and his followers. His confrontations with outsiders, especially government officials, were hilarious and uncomfortable. He always knows exactly what to say and when to say it. So, I guess now I'm wondering what his major character flaw is. His sympathy might get the better of him, but I just can't really see him failing at this point unless he gets killed, which would piss everyone off. Looking into the future of the story, I'll keep my thoughts about what will probably happen to myself, but I'm anxious to know what ends up happening to Clint.This book was a little slower for me than the first, however it was still so gripping. I love the story, all of the characters, the idea, and the author. I have recommended this over and over again to friends, who love zombies as much as I do. It's also gotten to the point where I'm having badass zombie dreams after reading at night, and I love it when a good book isn't ready to let go of my mind even when I have finished reading it. These are books I will revisit over and over again.

$review_text.: A fundamental requirement of effective foreign policy is cultural competency: The ability to communicate in a way that meaning is not distorted when messages are translated across worldviews and political contexts. When communications are not assessed within the contexts from which they emerge, confusion can result. When one or both sides hears what they want to hear, however, it is not confusion, but delusion that results. As an advisor to two Prime Ministers and Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States from 2008 to 2011, Husain Haqqani saw first hand the dysfunction that can seep into international relations when one or both sides bases their foreign policy in delusion.Husain Haqqani's first-hand experience in US-Pakistan relations notwithstanding, "Magnificent Delusions" is not a memoir, but a case study. Haqqani begins his examination of US-Pakistan relations before Pakistan's independence in 1947, and details a history of both sides hearing what they wanted to hear while ignoring the global and domestic political contexts in which events were unfolding.Neither is the book a polemic against the US or Pakistan. From Secretary of State Dulles overlooking the eerily prescient observations of Ambassador Langley in the late 1950s to Pakistan's misunderstanding of the limits of US obligations in bilateral security agreements, Haqqani details a history in which both countries have developed foreign policy around a set of wishful assumptions rather than contextual analysis."Magnificent Delusions" serves as a point of reorientation for US-Pakistan relations, but it also provides an important case study to guide the development of other relationships as well.

$review_text.: I bought this book as I am an avid meditator and was interested in learning more about the creative force of the universe known as kundalini


As I started reading this book I was able to quickly understand what kundalini is and what a kundalini awakening entails


However, the more I read of this collection of essays, the more repetitive it became


Some of the authors, I believe, had genuine kundalini experiences while most clearly did not
Some of the authors would contradict what they were saying even within their own essay

For example, how can one experience "oneness" with kundalini, yet at the same time speak of how they pray for this or that? If you are a part of this oneness, if you are everything, then who would hear the prayers?Some authors, i.e Ken Wilber, were so painful to read that I had to skip over most of their essays entirely
Read Ken Wilber's contribution, it stinks of someone trying too hard to sound intelligent.Kundalini is the creative sexual energy that rests "coiled up" at the base of the spine
With spiritual practices, yoga/meditation/tantra, one can "awaken" this energy to rise up the spine which will lead to total enlightenment


Thats pretty much the repeated explanation in every essay

Because the chakras are associated with different aspects of being human, I dont believe that they are real

Most of eastern philosophy, where many of these teachings come from, are loaded with myths and fairy tails


In other words, as you progress in your spiritual practice and gain awareness, you become aware of different aspects of yourself that make up what being human is and these aspects mature


These aspects include power, love, sexuality, intuition, etc., until one reaches total enlightenment.All of these authors that talk about their kundalini awakening, fail to talk about what enlightenment is
Its the ultimate shift in perspective


So why some of them would say that the awakening they had was "temporary" is unknown to me

Once your awakened in this way how could one possibly lose it? Even though I have spilled the beans on what its all about, having these practices is still worth it because if one doesn't go through it and experientially gets it, then you will have to take what enlightenment is solely on faith.Overall, I was expecting at least one author in this collection to provide a more realistic and practical understanding on Kundalini and practices


I did not find that in this book.

$REVIEW.: John McArthur has put together a great book. His background as an Investigative Medical Journalist shows in this no non-sense, matter of fact, straight to the point, and "Why it is the why it is" book on how to manage back and neck pain. McArthur's depth of expertise is comprehensive as he demonstrates how someone can avoid unnecessary surgery through simple techniques and exercises that anyone can do. His chapter on Non Surgical Treatment Options is worth its weight in gold. And of course, he covers the common sense things we should all know and practice to prevent having issues with back and neck pain. As a lifelong sufferer of chronic neck pain, I have benefited greatly from this book and have had immediate results. We can all learn from the years of experience that John McArthur has put into this book and for me, I am grateful to have bought a copy!
$SUMMARY.: I'm grateful to have bought this book

$REVIEW.: *sigh* I still love these books


Frostbite has a kind of New Moon feel to it for me
It has at times been my least favorite book in the series as book 2's often are

But at the same time there's so much that happens in Frostbite that is pivotal to the overall story, to each individual character's growth, to moving the plot along, and to turning this into more than a cute vampire novel series

It's really the glue that binds the whole series together and completely sets the scene for book 3, Shadow Kiss, which is probably the most pivotal book in the series

The prologue does a great job of spelling out this fantastic world that Richelle Mead has created


I can't tell you how many friends that I've forced this series on who told me they were so thankful for the prologue because while they really enjoyed Vampire Academy, they were a bit confused

So if you were confused at all after finishing Vampire Academy, the prologue breaks everything down quite nicely.I just love Rose
She's such a strong character

She's impulsive and rash, but she's so passionate and loyal

Rose is stuck in this place where she can't really talk to anyone about what all she's feeling

She hasn't had a chance to really tell Lissa about her feelings for Dimitri and what has gone down between them--especially because Lissa has been pretty wrapped up in her new relationship with Christian


It's completely real to see Lissa and Rose drift apart during this time period as friendships often do when one friend has started a new relationship

Rose starts off Frostbite being extremely naive and even bordering on childish and immature, but she grows so, so much in this book

She sees death in all of it's brutal and ugly glory which forces her to grow up


She learns that she's not invincible and neither are like heroic figures like Arthur Showenberg
As always, Dimitri has a way of putting her in her place without making her feel like complete and utter crap--even when she deserves it.Speaking of Dimitri, it sometimes surprises me how childish Rose can act and yet it doesn't really change the way he feels about her


Dimitri still plays the wise mentor, but Rose continues to see him for what and who he really is thus shaking him to his core
He tries to remain in control at all times, but some things are just beyond being controlled

Rose being one of those things, and his feelings for her being another


However, Dimitri is presented with another potential suitor and decisions must be made about what he'll do with his life and if he'll follow this new path set before him--one that's not restricted and won't put anyone in danger for pursuing.I've always been impressed with the foreshadowing that Richelle Mead uses in this series

And things really begin to pick up in Frostbite as far as that's concerned
We've got stuff going on with the bond, false ideas, changing politics, and all kinds of things that are really eluded to in Frostbite that, again, without knowing the rest of the series a reader would easily miss

Going back through the series is really the only way to completely pick up on all of this stuff, and even after as many times as I've read this series, I still find something new each time

Specifically I love how Richelle Mead will tell the reader something that the character believes is fact


Because the character believes these things as fact, the reader takes them as fact as well


It's a great way to lay down the groundwork for some false ideas that will turn into plot twists and such in the later books
But how do you tell fact from fiction without knowing the ending? Ha! I love it!Along with Rose and Dimitri--my favorite characters--we have the same secondary characters as before, Lissa and Christian (Lissa and Christian are probably main characters, but for me they're secondary), Mia, Mason, and with the addition of a few more, Rose's mom, Adrian--oh Adrian!--Eddie, who's mentioned in the first book, but doesn't have a large role, Tasha, etc

The secondary characters continue to grow, and the new additions shine

Eddie's character is so different from Frostbite to the end of the series that with this re-read I almost didn't recognize him

He seems like a totally different person
Obviously Rose and her mom have issues and seeing that relationship play out was interesting

Nothing brings out Rose's childish side like her mother
Lissa begins to step up and come into her own with the other royals
She's able to discuss Moroi politics with them on a level that serves as mediator and peacemaker during a few of the meetings which is a huge step up from the girl we saw in Vampire Academy.I keep thinking that Adrian has blonde hair, but Frostbite clearly states that he's a brunette
(Is it okay to call a guy a brunette?) I love how Adrian immediately picks Rose out yet throughout Frostbite during my first reading of it, I was so distraught that he might actually be going after Lissa too since he does seem to be a player

Not that I wanted him to go stepping in between Rose and Dimitri either
But I seriously couldn't help but fall for Adrian's charm--even early on.The ending was one of those that had my heart pounding

Do you remember that feeling of playing hide-and-seek when you were little and just sitting in the dark trying to be utterly silent so as to not give away your position but feeling the increased steady drum of your heart? I totally felt this exact way reading the ending of Frostbite


This ending was so brilliant because it's such a pinnacle point for so many of the characters, specifically Rose, Mia, Eddie, Christian, Mason, Dimitri, Rose's mom
It was the humbling experience that Rose needed and turned the series from cute vampire series to something a bit more serious


I loved how resolution doesn't come easy to Rose
She doesn't just miraculously get out of this dangerous situation, she has to fight her way out, and every single moment of that fight is tough and difficult.Frostbite easily gets 4 Stars from me

I still adore this book and this series

$REVIEW.: When he wasn&#8217;t writing Sherlock Holmes detective tales, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was cranking out all manner of short stories and novels in the genres of science fiction, mystery, horror, historical adventure, and what might best be described as medical fiction. Conan Doyle, being a physician himself, obviously had an interest in science, but he was also fascinated by the occult. Somewhere betwixt those two areas of interest lies the realm of parapsychology and his short novel of 1894, The Parasite. Though the title may lead one to believe the book is a medical thriller, the host for this particular parasite is actually mental rather than physical. The Parasite is a suspenseful tale of mind control by mesmerism.Austin Gilroy is a young professor of physiology who places immense value in the certainty of scientific fact. His colleague Professor Wilson, however, who studies the relatively newborn field of psychology, is more open to the possibility of unexplained phenomena. Wilson invites Gilroy to his home to witness a demonstration of mesmerism by the mysterious Miss Penclosa. Gilroy skeptically volunteers to be entranced by Penclosa, and to his surprise she is actually capable of doing so. He decides to research the physical science behind mesmerism, and asks Miss Penclosa to perform a series of experiments with him. After several sessions in which she hypnotizes him, Gilroy begins to realize that she has a powerful psychic hold over him. He is horrified to discover that she is in love with him and intends to make him her slave. Since this woman is capable of controlling him just as a puppeteer directs the actions of a marionette, how will he ever escape her evil clutches?The Parasite is a fun gender-bending variation on the countless tales of helpless women forced into the harem of a domineering svengali. In this case it&#8217;s the man who must fear for the loss of his precious virtue. Perhaps Conan Doyle&#8217;s novel is an expression of a late 19th-century fear of powerful, independent women. If Gilroy&#8217;s antagonist were a male, he would have more options available for retaliation, such as violence or public denunciation. Since his nemesis is a woman, however, his is bound by Victorian era societal codes on how to deal with the fairer sex, no matter how evil they may be. Conan Doyle&#8217;s hands are unfortunately tied by these same codes, which may be what prevents him from capping the story off with a satisfying finale.Though this is a positive review overall, I must offer a warning to the reader: the ending of this story absolutely sucks. How do you rate a work that is 99% entertaining when it&#8217;s ruined by its final sentence? Looking on the bright side, the disappointment inspired by the weak conclusion does not negate the suspenseful ride it took to get there. The Parasite really is a fun psychological thriller that keeps you guessing as to what&#8217;s going to happen next. This premise and plot could easily be made into an exciting Hollywood blockbuster, if only someone would come up with an ending that finishes it with a bang rather than a fizzle.

$REVIEW.: Synopsis:A group of space cadets are learning the ropes in thier first ever real space flight. Little do they know, that the ship that thier ship will be merging with has been overrun by aliens smuggled a board by a greedy crewman.Review:This is not one of the jems in the aliens seris. The story revolves more around the cadets and thier high-scholl like relations rather than about everybody's favorite acid-blooded monsters. If one were to read this book one would be bored with 200-50 pages of gossip and conflict between several obnoxious brats, who one hopes never will be in charge of a starship. Granted in the first couple chapters we are graced with aliens doing what they do best: killing, dismembering and harvesting some characters we may or may not care about. That dosen't last forever, for we are forced to return to more mindnuming bickering between the cadets. Not to mention that because these kids are fairley young (14-17) it would not be in good "taste" to kill them off the way they really should be, so the author pulls some crippling blows on the aliens so that they are not as fast, agial or deadly when chasing the kids. And so, with almost no adult characters left and the fact that aliens are not allowed to kill kids, basicly what this book amounts to is a bunch of braty cadets running around screaming, and bieng chased by aliens who cannot kill them.Grade:CRecommendations:People interested in the aliens serisCost:Get a used copy but 7.99 isen't bad.

The love affair took a bit of time to build up and that was a good thing. The setting and the problems are very modern and up to date with what our society has to deal with and the characters are interesting. The history of the Indians was a welcome and interesting touch.

$REVIEW.: Mr. Ingersoll may have captivated audiences in the 1800s, but I found this short, edited book to be less than convincing when it came to advocating agnosticism. Contemporary works such as "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins, "God is Not Great" by Christopher Hitchens, and "The End of Faith" by Sam Harris are much more entertaining and persuasive. The only thing I found valuable about Mr. Ingersoll's arguments is that agnostics and atheists are not a recent phenomena and they've been around challenging religious' views throughout our nation's history. Overall, it is a very brief read for anyone who is mildly curious about Mr. Ingersoll's viewpoints. But beyond that ho-hum.

It is one of several in a series that he has written, and it was the first that I had read, and won't be the last! If you are looking for a book to read on a devotional level, then this is definitely the one you want to read! it had so much to offer from details about Jesus, to the places he walked, the people he taught, and so many, many things that I had not even thought of, yet I know, has always been right there in front of me, in the Word! That is one thing that I love about books like this, we can read the Bible over and over, yet a simple book as this, can bring out something so deep from the Word, that we fall in love once again with the scriptures that we have read time and time again!FTC Guidelines disclosure, I must state that I was given a copy of the book, "Straight to the Heart of Matthew: 60 Bite-Sized Insights" from the publisher in exchange for my review

$REVIEW.: I'm an unhappy customer after reading The Human Division in its serialized run. It was clear by around episode 8 that Scalzi would not be able to wrap up all the threads of the story, but (no spoilers) the book ends with an epic battle and no resolution of the main plot, and with smoking guns littering the stage. The day of the final episode's release, Scalzi announced that there was going to be a sequel (or perhaps sequels, given how he's likening The Human Division to a TV series), which he'd just been signed to write, and which therefore may be more than a year away.I'm a big fan of Scalzi's work; I just gifted a friend with paperbacks of Old Man's War (OMW) and Redshirts. But this time around, the work, and the process of getting the work to his readers, disappoints.The Human Division is the latest novel in the OMW universe, and for the most part it is enjoyable. I felt that Scalzi has turned up his trademarked Banter-O-Meter a bit too high this time, to the point where many of the characters tended to talk too much alike. For example, if you take lines of dialog from two characters, say Harry Wilson and Hart Schmidt, and place them on a page by themselves, it would often be difficult to know which character was speaking, because they use the same snappy banter style. I like the banter, but banter isn't quite the same as characterization.In terms of plot, there's plenty of it, and clearly there was too much for one book to contain. The book slams to a halt after a huge, masterfully written battle, then ends with a brief coda, with all the major plot threads hanging. Since I didn't know in advance it was going to be a multi-parter, I felt as though I only got half a book for my $13.The Human Division was first available as a buck-a-week serial, and the book suffers from it. Scalzi says its his longest book by word count, yet it felt much shorter; some of the individual episodes could be read in 10 minutes. I think being chopped into so many pieces hurt the overall feel of the book. The book felt smaller than OMW.I've crystallized the big issue I have with the serialization format. I'm fine reading series, either serializations a la Analog magazine in the 70s, where I read a lot of great novels split up into three or four chunks, or current book series, like James S.A. Corey's The Expanse. I was happy to read Leviathan Wakes knowing that it was the first in a series, and the book kicks so much ass it is effectively stand-alone.The difference between the serializations of the 70s and today is that now we have Internet reviews, which would have alerted me that The Human Division was not a complete novel. Had I known that, I would not have bought it now; I would have waited until the second volume was released. I just did that with the Benford/Niven book from last year. Because of the nature of this experiment in serialization, Tor/Scalzi (I'm not saying maliciously) withheld reader information that I for one have come to rely on. As a result, I ended up as an annoyed customer, rather than a happy one. I look forward to reading the next installment of The Human Division, but I won't buy it serialized, and I won't buy it if reviewers say it doesn't wrap up the plot lines. I signed up to read a novel, not watch Lost (I did watch that, and you see where that got me).

$REVIEW.: "The Fall: The Insanity of the Ego in Human History and the Dawning of A New Era", a must read for every member of the human race.Look around you

Watch the news
Read the paper
What is wrong with us? Why does it seem that everywhere we go, there is pain, sorrow, violence?Watch people on the street


Listen to conversations at a restaurant Why is it that our idea of conversation is complaining about our problems? Why does it feel like everyone on the planet is miserable, and feel like their lives are missing something?Adam and Eve, a fairy tale from the Bible..
or is it a tale of the earliest cultures of humanity? Nearly all religions have a story of a eutopia, where humans lived in peace, at peace with nature, their own bodies and the universe

All of the tales are suspiciously similar, could they be a type of historical record?The Fall takes you back to the earliest groups of human beings to inhabit this planet and follows their path to present day society


Anthropologists have been studying prehistoric cultures for decades and finding some fascinating information about how our ancestors lived
For a long time, whenever someone would refer to earlier human cultures, especially those of the prehistoric era, they were refered to as barbarians, violent and lacking of compassion


Anthropologic research reveals a completely different image of our ancestors.You will be taken back to a time when human-beings were in touch with the essence of nature
They lived in peace and at ease, until something horrible happened to the groups living in the Middle-Eastern area known as Saharasia
An environmental tragedy somehow changed the human beings living in the area, endowed with a new, and increasing, sense of ego, the Saharasian peoples began migrating and affecting every culture they came into contact with.From a world of peaceful, hunter-gatherer cultures, to a world of greedy, violent egos, took meerly a few centuries and started us down a road of violence, materialism and patronism

You will learn how each step of this change took place and what the affects of the sprouting ego had on our treatment of the planet and each other.You will be awakened to the true cause of our collective misery and suffering and you will see that there is a way out

We are in the midst of transcending the insanity already, but will we make it before we destroy ourselves? That will take some extra effort on our part.

$review_text.: Oh boy, this has much more depth than I thought it would have.  I have to admit, I found the first part of the book to be rather slow; and I had to force my self to keep going.  I'm so glad I did.  I think perhaps the most touching part about this story isn't the love story between the hero and heroine, which don't get me wrong was sweet in its own right.  It was the story of the father that touched me the most, and I have a feeling thats exactly what the author intended.  The love a parent has for a child can be so deep and unending that it changes a person.  In ways that the people closest to them can't understand.  I  don't want to say too much more as I don't want to give anything away.  I will say the story is slow at times, and the Reggie's father seems like the perfect villain; selfish, cruel, and cold but the do say &#34;don't judge a book by its cover.&#34; This is the perfect example of that.The ending I thought was perfect, and Im thinking that Reggie's brother Robert might have his own story in there some where. ;) I also have to give props to the author, the cover art was beautiful.  Check out this story, you won't be sorry.

$REVIEW.: It's a book about using large-scale fabrics and nine-patch blocks placed here-and-there to give some sort of effect.  Sorry, but I just don't think this is quilting.  Just sloppily putting together fabrics. It's easy to finish these projects in a day because there are not many pieces.  The nine-patch blocks are thrown all over the place.  It's like either making a cake with a box of Duncan Hines cake mix and canned frosting or making a cake from scratch with home-made frosting that takes time, care, and lots of love.  That's true with quilting too.  A quilt should be made with time, care and lots of love, not something thrown together like the patterns in this book.

She is imaginative and creates characters you care about, plus the situations they get themselves into are believable.Something else about this book: it wasn't depressing.  The subject may be distressing, but I felt that she handled it in a realistic, challenging way that left me feeling inspired rather than down.I had never heard of Cholley before coming across this book, but now that I know about her, I've gone to her website and subscribed to her RSS feed.BTW, this is the first time I've subscribed to an RSS feed.  I thought it might be complicated, but no, it only takes a couple of clicks, and then you have to answer an e-mail the RSS people send you to confirm that you really meant to sign up.

$REVIEW.: I really liked the way the characters overcame obsticles as they faced the death of a loved one and life's disappointments. The author particularly shares a wonderful thought on how our dead loved ones can speak from our own hearts in ways to comfort the living.  She also shares an episode which depicted complete forgiveness.  Sometimes we say we forgive, but deep down there are reservations.  I think, we all need examples of ways to completely forgive.  I look forward to reading more of Julianne MacLean's novels.

$REVIEW.: "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" is difficult to categorize. It's not a graphic novel, nor is it quite a picture book. The tale of a young man investigating his grandfather's questionable death at an old orphanage is illustrated with a wonderful bunch of beautifully haunting vintage looking photos.For me, the characters lacked development and the plot was somewhat labyrinthian. Still, the photos had my imagination and kept me reading. Honestly, the photos are the best part of the duo and are well worth the book alone.Rebecca Kyle, July 2011

$review_text.: I recently finished reading Sirocco and enjoyed it immensely. The story gripped me from the first page to the last. I am normally a slow reader, but once I began to read this book I could not put it down. I am an avid reader of James Rollins and I would put this thriller alongside any of his books. The best stories draw you into the page and  allow the reader to develop a relationship with the characters. For me, this was one of those books. My wife loved the book also. This well written novel is an exciting page turner that would make a great movie. I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: Why download this version and not a public domain or competing edition? The Top Five version features 104 of the Sidney Paget illustrations many of us love, and these are more sharply defined than in other versions I sampled for my Kindle. The table of contents works, and as with their edition "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes," it comes across appealingly on screen.Alex Lubertozzi offers a brief overview of what these twelve stories aim for, and about Conan Doyle. This provides an ideal introduction or, in my case, reminder of what I first enjoyed reading as a child. I look forward to more from Top Five, who promise in addition to "Adventures" and "Memoirs" of Sherlock Holmes--the best two collections of the detective's short investigations--other installments at what cannot be beat for affordability (as of this writing!) and handsome presentation.

$REVIEW.: I had been looking to buy this book for a while, purely based on the cover picture. The price and my reduced budget put it a little outside my comfort zone. When I did finally decide to buy it I was astounded by the array of beautiful patterns it contained.This is a book with which you could curl up in a chair and just drool over the wonderful designs, making a long, long list of those you want to try out. There are patterns for every skill level and I reckon that this is a book to encourage any crocheter to push themselves to try something a bit more complicated than had maybe done before.Lovely photos and little snippets of information about the various State Fairs and the winners whose designs are included in the book.This book does not provide basic instructions for the various stitches used and I would have liked to have seen each design marked with the skill level required, but those are minor points that really do not detract from a terrific production.If I could only buy one book of afghan patterns this would be the one I would go for.

$REVIEW.: I purchased a copy of this book almost a decade ago and was quite disappointed. I only recently had someone ask my opinion of it, so I went back to give it a second look. Unfortunately my first sense of it has not changed. The author's Hebrew is poor, worse than mine (and that's saying alot). By comparing the Hebrew text with the translation, I find the English is stulted - at times mangled - sentences, frequent mis-translations, and has the recurrent phenomena of the author rendering Hebrew words he did not recognize as if they were angelic names. The translation also shows a lack of background knowledge concerning Hebrew magical traditions that causes him to overlook obvious meanings.Sefer Raziel deserves to be available in translation, but this is not it. Those interested in Hebrew magical books in translation are better served looking at Gaster's "Sword of Moses," Morgan's "Sepher ha-Razim," and the two-volume collection of Aramaic magical spell texts published by Naveh and Shaked.

$REVIEW.: This was hands down my favorite of the series.Curt and Jack finally get themselves a story! We meet these two in the previous books and from the first introduction of them , i could tell i was going to love their characters and yeah i did and i do.Jack is the older of the two and he's been through a lot in life
Family wise and relationship wise


At first we learn that Jack was in  a previous relationship with Peter

We learn why it didn't work out and we always learn that his ex-boyfriend (Shawn/Shane) cheated on him and it left Jack hurt and doubting future relationships


He meets Curt at the wedding, flirts with him and things get a little hot and heavy
He makes a decision that he's going to start a change in his life and that Curt should do it too.Curt is so reserved and bit shy
He's also quite neurotic in a way


He likes his control and i think a part of the attraction with Jack is that he doesn't at all mind giving Jack that control because he feels safe with him.It was such a good story


A few bumbs in the road with the characters kept things interesting and the sex was hot hot hot!Great sequel
Definitely going to be re-reading this!

It's easy to get invested in all the characters and each character is lovable for their own reasons.  Each of their journeys is a little bit different, and they're all the more heartwarming for it.What's also great is that in just the length of a novella, Tara Lain gives us three characters with depth, both internal and external conflict, and introduces us to characters that we'll get to know better later.Volley Balls is a very sexy novella that'll take you on a journey of exploration and acceptance among three strong and courageous men.  If you like M/M romance and m&eacute;nage stories, you definitely need to read this!

$review_text.: Reviewed by April Sullivan for Reader Views (8/06)"Breadfruit" is the tale of Tahitian woman, mother, and professional cleaner Materena Mahi.  It is the middle book in a trilogy about this heroine.  The first book is "Frangipani" and the expected third will be "Tiare".  In this book, Materena is proposed to by her man Pito after thirteen years and three children together.  She does not take this drunken proposal too seriously, but it gets her thinking about marriage and how she would like to have a ring on her finger and a marriage certificate on the wall.Author Celestine Vaite writes knowingly about Tahitian people and their ways as only someone who has had personal experience could.  She was born and grew up in Tahiti.  She fell in love with an Australian surfer at age sixteen, whom she married and followed to Australia where they now live with their four children.The story follows Materena as she broods over the thought of a wedding in silence.  This is not something she wants to put out on the "coconut radio", the local term for the gossip chain.  In this small Tahitian village, Materena is constantly running into streams of cousins, aunts, and other friends and relatives.  The book links all of the stories they remember and share as they pass each other on the street or visit in each other's homes.Vaite's writing style is simple and perfectly portrays the lifestyle of these Tahitian villagers.  My favorite part is the cultural lesson you get in a fun way.  She throws in native words and phrases among the English in a way that makes it possible to understand their meaning instantly.  The names of the characters and Tahitian words are so different and sing-songy, I was tempted to read the book aloud to really get into the flow."Breadfruit" was great as a stand alone book, but now that I know there are more I am eager to read the first and third starring Materena and her family.  This funny and fast-paced love story was a wonderful summer read.  As Materena would say, "Ah oui girlfriend, pick up a copy today!"Received book free of charge.

$REVIEW.: Andy does a fine job in breaking us in on the basics.  I have always 'preached' that Christians should eat that meat of the Word with a glass of milk within reach.  Let's not forget the causes for the effects, and sometimes we forget we do need that occational full glass of milk.Andy's book is more for the immature- but growing Christian, although I enjoyed reading again things I had forgotten. We can never be reminded too often of the building blocks for good leadership. Infact, this book is great to teach a leadership class from.Andy did some research here, and I have to applaud his efforts in his successful attempt to compile very useful and applicable information in an easy to read book.  Good job, Andy!This book will always remain in my 'reference library'.

thanks in advance from Hilary for a ARC Copy for a honest review.Book #1 of the series between their story of Eavon and Talon the hot drummer ( and did i mention a Twin = Yummy).I couldn't put the book down once I started reading! It's so full on and I loved it! It's captivating, intense, wrong (in a good way), smart, hilarious and so romantic that they found the one after so much heartache xo The heartache of the previous relationship that Talon had experience was a lot to take in at such a young age and still had the heart to help her through it.Loved this line:"What are you doing?""Listening to your heartbeat"
I start to think how much I care for this girl.There are many moment where I laughed out loud literally


My husband thought I was going loopy


LolLoved the additional characters in the book especially the frustrating sexual tension between Ivy and Taron back


she has one quick smart mouth
You can tell there is also fire between them
 I can't wait to read the next book in the series about these 2! Cannot wait for the release.

$REVIEW.: One year passes since the triumph over the aliens, and the magical saga thrives on. Mathias is like a runaway train and the onslaught continues in this fourth addition to the acclaimed Dragoneer Saga. Our beloved rider, Jenka returns again with a vengeance and will leave readers breathless. If book lovers have been smart enough to indulge in the prior amazing installments, they have been lucky enough to witness Jenka's growth. He almost feels like family since we've been rooting him on and by his side the entire time. The aforementioned books don't have to be read in succession, but one may miss a significant point or reference which builds up to the dynamite finale. This serial has been consistent throughout and never fails to scare, thrill and excite. Mathias' excellent writing ability is a phenomenal trait to possess and without question  fans of fantasy will hear about him and his work for years to come.

$review_text.: Being Frank is Donna Earnhardt's first picture book to be placed into the hands of eager children, and it is a beautiful one.The story begins with these words: Frank was always frank. "Honesty is the best policy," he said.While that motto is a very good one, it got Frank into big trouble. Although he knew how to be honest, he didn't know anything about tact. Eventually, everyone was upset with him, he was being ignored by his friends, and he didn't understand what to do about it. Enter ... his grandfather. Yay! for grandparents!  ;)  What he learned from his grandfather Ernest changed how Frank handled his honesty so that he could still be honest but without hurting people's feelings.Although Being Frank is a story with a moral, it does not come across in a preachy teachy way that could put children off. It is entertaining and funny while getting the point across.Donna has everything in this book that should appeal to a child. Words used are fun and a little challenging, there are amusing situations, she uses great names that describe the characters - another example being Mr. Wiggins, the school principal who wears a toup&eacute;e - and she has brought out true feelings expressed by her characters. It is believable and entertaining for children (and grown-ups, too.)A fabulous picture book story falls short when there are not great illustrations to back it up. Well, there is nothing amiss in this book! The characters in Donna Earnhardt's Being Frank are brought to life through the bright and colourful illustrations of Andrea Castellani. (His name is pronounced An-dray-a.) When my grandson and I read this book together he was busily taking it all in, there is so much to see and enjoy that goes with the words.Being Frank by Donna Earnhardt is a wonderful book to add to your bookshelf.

As a retired, conservative, elementary school teacher I found this workbook to be easily understood.  Many of the math concepts in this workbook are presented in word problems, estimates, graphs, and illustrated format which is different from the straight forward rote mathematics commonly taught in the past.  The math problems presented in this workbook use many of the techniques commonly used to help children better understand the concepts of numbers and not just rote memory.  I found that this workbook would be beneficial for children who are home schooled.

$review_text.: It's the end of the world as we know it and as one might expect, there is death and destruction, survival and loss


Plays for power and control abound in a world torn asunder

A new day has risen and it's nothing like the day before


Very few people were prepared for such a disaster, and certainly not for such a disconnect from the reality they were used to
Adjustments have to be made, lives are lost, psychopaths seek power, and justice is but a dream burst into flames.That is the world you step into when you read WICK Omnibus


The disconnect that left people without any of their familiar comforts is beautifully woven throughout the story as you follow the lives of a handful of survivors

You get a clear picture of just how bad things can get when the moral compass is no longer pointing north and when fear is the guiding factor.I found myself walking an emotional ridge, falling this way or that with the turning of every page

As I read this story, I wondered about the secrets that lay buried under a blanket of snow and I was consistently surprised as they came into view.Coming in at a whopping 572 pages, this is a remarkable story and not one to miss!

$REVIEW.: Ms Zinovieff has written an entertaining journal-style "letter from Athens" about moving her family from the UK to Athens and integrating herself and her family unit into contemporary urban Greek life, circa 2002
There are certainly parts of the book that dragged, challenging the reader to continue


For example, her reflections on her earlier trips to Greece with her boyfriend as a graduate student were actually quite boring and her reminiscences as a late adolescent lend little to the experience of reading this book
A prepossessing style when you have little to say is actually quite hollow
On the other hand, the last chapter, in which she travels to the countryside with her husband and daughters to view her late father-in-law's home and confronts the question of whether or not she will make the long-term commitment to keep it and repair it is quite touchingly rendered
 Ms Zinovieff, like many "ex-pats," highlights the many negatives in Athens life, but she makes a fine attempt to highlight some of the positives, too


She is best when she leaves her English anthropological interpretations aside and gives direct quotes from real Athenians -- something she does quite a bit


If you are thinking of an extended stay in the city of Athens I would recommend this
As a history of the capital of the modern Greek state, as  a tourist guide, or as an "anthropological study," I would not.

$REVIEW.: Up to now there hasn't been a biography about the witch with a twitch that even came close to being worthy of her memory. And it's suitable that Herbie J. Pilato is the one to give us a biography about Elizabeth Montgomery, as he was one of a handful of people to be able to interview her in her post-Bewitched years. Pilato had originally interviewed her for his awesome "The Bewitched Book" and he had lots of material left over which he was able to put to good use here along with interviews with some people from Liz's life like her old friends Sally Kemp and Cliff Robertson amongst others. These are interspersed with snippets from magazine interviews that happened her whole life. There are also behind-the-scenes stories from "Bewitched" which have never been told before!The book includes photos, both black and white and color.But the most important thing is that Pilato doesn't present a rose-colored glasses view of Liz. He presents a real view of a very complicated woman without being sensationalist about it. All though most of us always think of her as being the beautiful perfect Samantha, after reading this book, you will think of her as the imperfect, but still beautiful, Liz.
$SUMMARY.: FINALLY! A worthy Elizabeth Montgomery biography!

$review_text.: I just finished "Fey", and found it to be a gem of a book. My only regret was that it was'nt longer. It follows Major Lombard, a former G-Marine who was forced to retire following an engagement that resulted in the destruction of a Navy Battle Cruiser.You'll have to read the book to find out why, unless you've read the previous book, "Starfire". Major Lombard, now a professional poker player, becomes involved in a life and death struggle to protect an item wanted by his government, and an unknown alien culture. They never should have messed with a former G-Marine. I look forward to the next book in the series, if the readers can convince Mike Lee to continue the series. I hope we can.

$REVIEW.: Alice James and Jim Snow run James & James Detective Agency
Both former police officers, the case becomes personal when Alice embarks on a quest to find the truth about her half-sister's disappearance.Desert Drop is not a fast-moving mystery

Additionally, it's almost as if the author tried to take on the voice of the film noir hard boiled detective...and didn't quite get there
What results are a few stretches of awkward dialog and predictable plot
That said, it's a reasonably enjoyable way to pass a few hours and if I come across something else by this author (particularly if it's in this series -- the set up seems to imply there is/will be one), I won't necessarily dismiss the option.

$REVIEW.: In 1978, Wayne was a 315 pound financial advisor.  He also had five credit cards maxed out.  It took someone calling him a "fat slob" to wake him up.  He got his weight and spending under control.  (At the end of the book he tells us he had a coach.)  But, as his wife said, he was still a jerk.He began investigating the core thing that drove his behavior and realized his attitudes and beliefs were driving his behavior.  He investigated others struggling with similar problems and found certain underlying attitudes.Wayne has written this book to help us understand these inborn, underlying attitudes, and how they affect everything we do and every decision we make.  (This core is established by age six.)  He then takes us through a step by step plan to regain our life.He doesn't ask us to change who we are but rather come to terms with who we are.  He uses ALTER with purpose: Awareness, Learn, Tactical plan, Execute the plan, Re-evaluate.He calls the core drive out attitude and developed a 3 minute survey to identify it.  (The survey is included in the book.)  It shows that every person is wired differently.  Everyone is a combination of four categories:T for tactical (planners, goal setters)R for rational (logical thinkers, attending to facts)I for impulsive (playful, spur of the moment, generous)M for mellow (laid back, harmonious, trustful)Wayne covers each combination, their traits, and what they need to watch out for.  He has practical plans for physical, financial, and relational fitness, noting the pitfalls of each personality.I wasn't surprised to find out that I'm a barge (you've got to read the book).  The 3 minute survey only confirmed what I already knew about myself.  I thought the plans for altering one's life were a little weak on the various core attitudes.  Most of each chapter was on general change, then a paragraph on each of the boats, barges, and sailboats designations.  I would have rather seen a couple of chapters devoted to T people, then a couple to R people, etc.  The information just felt too general to me.One who has done lots of reading on personality styles may not find anything new here.  One who is interested in finding out his or her own personality for the first time will find this a quick and easy way to do so.And, as is always the case, it comes down to just doing it.  Wayne has included a 91 day plan to help the reader get going and accomplish change.I received a complimentary copy of this book from The B & B Media Group for the purpose of this review.

This time around it's Noah and Jesse story - yes patient Noah finally gets his man!  This book also gave us &#34;titbits&#34; of most of our favourite characters from the other books, big bonus as I love those guys.  Also some questions were actually answered! but as we are talking Sandrine Gasq-Dion here, as one question is answered, another one is raised!

I have used several recipes from this book and am happy with all although some we like more and have made them regulars in our dinner line-up. Besides the recipes there is other info in the book that is very helpful such as the shopping guide, the food matrix for building dishes, and the sauce/condiment recipes. These books are well worth the money. Dinner is an event most every night. And we're losing weight not going out to eat and making healthier choices thanks to this series of books.

$REVIEW.: As she is sitting for a portrait, beautiful Eleanor Farnham meets young Frederic Thorpe


 Fred overcomes his shyness in order to court and marry her


 And on the surface, their marriage is a happy one
 But disturbing events in both of their personal histories gradually come back to haunt them


 This complex plot evolves into a stunning climax which I won't give away but that you won't want to miss.The Crimson Bed can be described as a family saga that involves several generations between the years 1839 to 1913
 At the same time, it is a very intimate story where Ellie, Fred, Henry and the others come alive and make the reader care about them

 Ms
Proctor uses her knowledge of settings and language to make the story both authentic and entertaining


 There are wonderful descriptions of life in the Victorian world
 The society's language, mores and attitudes are realistically depicted.I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys good, historical fiction and a timeless love story as well.

Alexis Norwood is a nave college student who happens to be trapped in the car with her roommate's "boyfriend."  The sex scenes at the inappropriate time bothered me as well.

$review_text.: Kukuku! This volume really surprised me! Especially the relationships between Usagi and Mamoru (Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask). Takeuchi did a wonderful job of making me feel for these two in such a short amount of time. Especially, once the all the scouts finally meet up&#8212;SailorV finally comes in. The whole Princess of the Moon was handled very well, and if the art for the missing princess had been a bit more vague I think it could have almost fooled readers. Make that a really big almost. Ok. No the readers would have never been fooled. Still it's the thought that counts.The art is still gorgeous and the color pages are so pleasing! Ah, they're fantastic. It all goes together well with the memory reveals, and the origin story. Mythology! Yes, thank you! (It was sorely missing from the anime.) The tragic past of Prince Endymion and Princess Serenity is the right kind of tragedy and melodrama I love. Especially when there's plenty of sweet notes to make my cynical heart go all &#34;ahhhhhhhhh!&#34;It can be argued that this volume still has it's &#34;monster of the week plot&#34;. Let's be honest most super hero/fighting manga do. This time around Takeuchi does a wonderful job with volume two and lifts it up from the last volume&#8217;s cheesier standardized monster of the week fodder. Even more I enjoyed the gem stone guys&#8212;as I fondly call the guys named after rocks&#8212;when their twist came up. Which I wasn't expecting, but wish it could have been explored more! There was a hint of a lost love with Sailor Venus that is just begging to be realized!It's a official I'm hooked! Volume 2 is a great indicator of how this series can grow. Usagi has already grown so much, but what I love is that deep down she's still the fun and lazy person she was before. She's just growing up. More growth on the other scouts would be the cherry on top, but there's still plenty of time for that. The funny thing is that harsh manga judge inside of me wants to give this series a lower rating, but I've been converted. Especially since Sailor Moon gets to save damsel Tuxedo Mask as well as be saved sometimes. It's official the manga is working for me, when the anime couldn't. (I lied, I mentioned the anime.)Sexual Content: Some kissing not much else. Clean!4/5- Great! Really enjoyed it.Orginally reviewed at Book Whispers.

$REVIEW.: I can't believe how badly this was written

There was this whole "stream of consciousness" writing in the beginning which was supposed to explain the heroine's back story but in the end just came across as someone blathering away nonsensically like they just had a stroke
The timeline for the heroine's supposed meteoric rise to fame also seemed very illogical and implausible
She gets her first book published and one year later she's on her 3rd or 4th in the series and has been on a convention tour for her book and also managed to work out a movie deal, adapted the book to a screen play and was ready to film and also get trim and fit again? How exactly did she accomplish all that in a span of a year? I would've been more forgiving if it had been over 2 years


That seems believable.I'm also starting to notice something about the author's attitude towards nurses that came across very loud and clear in this book...she seems to hate them
Almost every book I've read by her (and yes I've read more than one by her) she's always referring to some nurse as an apathetic bitch

As a nurse who tries her hardest to make her patients and their loved ones feel safe and secure, I take great offense to this
Why all the nurse hate R.L.?Her other books, especially "The Neighbor from Hell" and the "Pyte/Sentinel" series I've enjoyed, but this seemed sloppy and rushed.

$SUMMARY.: Was this an early attempt at writing?

$REVIEW.: This book will most benefit solid sit'n'go players who already have a mastery of the sit'n'go basics. If you aren't sure what fold equity is, or how being on the envelope should make you adjust your play, this book will be beyond you. Beginners would be better off with Harrington's "Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments; Volume I: Strategic Play."If you have the basics, this book will teach you two new major areas. First, it teaches the basics of using online tools to track and predict your opponents. Using databases like those from Sharkscope combined with a HUD, it becomes easier to play in many tournaments at the same time while still making good decisions against a particular player with his past tendencies knows.The second focus of the book is play changes based on the specific weaknesses of your opponents. Low-stakes sit'n'go tournaments are often filled with less than skilled players that make certain types of mistakes repeatedly. When you can anticipate these mistakes, you can adjust your play to maximize your gain from those mistakes. An example in the book includes changing your frequency of continuation bets if the only other caller is a loose player, and your hand did not improve with the flop.If you play in online tournaments, consider this a mandatory read. My only regret is that this book did not come out ten years ago during the golden age of internet poker.

$REVIEW.: I thought the premise sounded really interesting--bridging WWII to 9/11-- and it was free, so I thought I would give it a try.  The writing is pure high school.  The metaphors are out of control.  Expressions are out of time context.  I'm halfway through, and I plan to finish, but if the author tells me one more time that the tears were pooling, puddling, flowing from, or glazing the main characters greenish-gray eyes, I will stomp my Kindle to smithereens!

Jonathan "Burn"5 stars for "Burn" {Songs Of Submission #5} CD Reiss does not disappoint..the writing is brilliant, you are drawn in from the beginning. At the risk of repeating my self... This series get's better with each book !!!I have the sweetest Ache for Jonathan Drazen ..He can Tie me down any day! "Burn" is sexy as hell !! It delves deeper into Monica's and Jonathan's Dom / Sub relationship, things are changing between them, emotions are taking center stage. Jonathan keeps a secret from Monica that could destroy there chance at happiness. Jessica has an insidious plan to ruin Jonathan. We learning that Kevin is a major douchebag, with secrets of his own.There is a cliff hanger that left me shaking my head.. although I did not see it coming, I knew Jonathan would pay for his small indiscretion in some way. I only hope that Monica has enough love, trust and faith in him, if she does they can't be torn asunder.I can't say enough about this series. "Burn" {Songs of Submission #5} has it all. It is emotional, seductive, there is longing, passion, just the right amount of drama and a hint of danger. While it explores the theme of dominant/ submissive, it is so much more. If you have not read "Beg, "Tease" and "Submit" {you can purchase a box set with all 3 books} and "Control" do so before reading "Burn" Be prepared for a marathon reading session, You will want to devour this series!!! On to "Resist" for me followed by "Sing" I am not stopping until I read it all tonight!!!

It was a juvenile plot and unbelievable to think young girls would actually hitchhike great distances, and be at the mercy of people they met along the way, yet still have a somewhat happy ending for them, even tho it may be short lived.I will continue to read other Catherine Hyde Ryan's books.

$review_text.: This is a good story, that spans years  between the Spanish Inquisition and present day, and takes place on the Iberian Peninsula and moves to South America.  The middle of the  book bogged down a little, and at times it was not easy to understand why the story was being told.  There are no surprises here, not even the ending.  More than anything, to me, it is a chronology of how a convent was started in the mountains of Spain to protect women, and how it survived to present day.

$review_text.: This made for an easy light read
I thought it was a cute storyline.Pros:* It was a quick read at 168 pages, and it made for a fast paced read* The plot was really sweet, even though easily predictable* I loved the idea of a self-sufficient heroine (especially the ones skilled with power tools whom do their own home renovations)Cons:* A bit tame compared to my normal reads
A very clean romance (as in no sex, just a couple kisses)* I am not a fan of book virgins, especially 28 year old women (although her being a virgin was assumed, it was obvious and implied) being portrayed as so beautiful but completely innocent (just seems overly far-fetched)* It was priced at $3.82 at my time of purchase which to me is a tad on the steep side considering the books short lengthOverall, this story was charming, and I'm glad I read it

 I just personally prefer my books to contain more adult subject matters


 I will still recommend this read however, and would definitely read more of this writers work in the future.

$REVIEW.: I personally think this is a great book for beginning vegans or anyone who is concerned with products having animal ingredients in them. It covers a wide variety of topics - everything from common myths, to nutrition, to the names of animal ingredients and what they are. The book is set up in a way that's easy to read. You could use it as a reference guide to let you know if a certian product contains animal ingredients, but my personal favorite chapter is the one on nutrition. Many new vegans have concerns about what vitamins they need and where to get them from. This book explains it all. I give it two thumbs up. I highly recommend everyone buy and read it several times. It's a very nice addition to any book collection. --Reviewed by Melissa White

$REVIEW.: In the Christian tradition, it is reported that after the death and resurrection of Jesus, the apostles were stunned and in shock; how could someone they love be crucified and left to hang on the cross?  What madness put this in motion, and why didn't he, (Jesus) save himself?  Jesus, the second person of the Blessed Trinity took on the form of a human, lived among the people of His time, and allowed Himself to be scourged and then crucified on a cross.The people watched as the soldiers tore into His side with a spear, and they heard Him cry out to His Father
 When finally he took His last breath, they were there, too, watching and crying as Jesus gave way to the moment


 Jesus' journey on earth ended on the cross, he was buried in a tomb that was intended for another, and on the third day, Jesus rose from the dead, and walked among the people, though they didn't know it was Him

 The apostles and disciples were grief-stricken to have seen Him die; they didn't understand when He told them He would rise from the dead


 They didn't know what that meant.And, like you and I, we each have a journey, a pilgrimage in life; our pilgrimage is to follow the example of Jesus in reaching out to others and at times, helping others to carry their crosses, their pain, their hurts.Several days after Jesus died and was buried, He rose from the dead and walked among His friends
 There were two of His disciples walking to the town of Emmaus; they befriended this stranger (Jesus), and spoke about what had happened


 They grieved publicly, and He continued to engage in conversation with them, and they didn't realize He was Jesus....

until, that is, they sat down to eat and share the little they had

 And it was only when He went on His way that they realized that they met Jesus in the "breaking of the bread".And so, like Jesus and these disciples He met on the road to Emmaus, you and I will be travelling our own journeys, our own pilgrimages, and more than likely, we, too, will meet a stranger or two, who will share in conversation with us, and in our "breaking of the bread", in our sharing of our stories, we will meet Jesus.Jim Forest has put together this wonderful book that brings to life the concept of being on life's journey, being on our own pilgrimage wherein we, too, meet another or others, and we, too, open up ourselves and share our lives, our stories, our pain, and our joy
 And, we will meet Jesus "in the breaking of the bread".There is a quote in an early chapter that gives room for hope; I gladly share it, here:  "It's a special feeling walking an old road
 The pilgrim may see no one else behind or ahead and yet be profoundly aware of not being alone."  May this be your experience!

$review_text.: I received an ARC copy of &#8220;Vengeance is Mine&#8221; for review.Ben Tucker is an ex-investigative reporter turned author who just happens to be married to a multi-millionaire Maggie Marshak of the Marshak clothing empire. Ben has had his own trouble with the law when he was younger, his girlfriend was murdered and he blames himself. He spiraled out of control for a long time.Now, Ben is on the other side of the law and helping the Cary Police Department investigate two gruesome murders of women who have been decapitated among other things. The suspect leaves his own distinctive calling card at all the crime scenes in the way the bodies are positioned and a Bible turned to the same page and verse. A couple of weeks later the women&#8217;s heads turn up in the strangest places.Ben is asked to join the task force and his goal is to figure out how the suspect gains entry to the homes. Because in both homes no forced entry is to be seen.There is an interesting cast of characters, from Lieutenant Netter the very grumpy and opinionated lead investigator on these cases to Roberta the housekeeper who tells it like it is and is always onto Ben about something. All the characters are enjoyable and have their own distinct personalities that help the book along.Ben&#8217;s ex-wife becomes the third victim and now he is more determined than ever to find out who is committing these murders.The suspect looks just like Ben, same color hair, height, everything.There are many twists and turns in the solving of who committed the murders, you will not be disappointed. There is a little romance, surprises, and intrigue all rolled into this thriller. Harry Krebs keeps you hanging until the very end and just when you think you have it all figured out, he throws in another twist. This is a very well written and researched book, Harry Krebs has done his homework on the criminal behavior aspects of the book and it was a pleasure to read. A great start for a first book in what I hope will become a successful series.No spoilers here, I am intentionally leaving out some parts of the book in the review because it would give away the guilty party.

$REVIEW.: Cat Grant again brings us a highly emotional read that's over before you know it.  In Priceless, a young man with his whole future in turmoil starts selling himself to men who care nothing for his heart and soul until he spends the night with overly studious Connor who shows Wes his first real taste of affection.  After a brief time apart it's Connor to the rescue when Wes' life goes spiraling out of control.This was a quick read that packed a big punch.  With its likable characters and realistic situations it's easy to become immersed in this book while rooting for Wes and Connor.  Wes is young and feels invincible and in total control of his life until things slowly start unraveling and he ends up at the mercy of a truly evil man who transforms Wes from exuberant and fun to withdrawn and terrified.  It was difficult seeing this change in Wes and even more difficult seeing what he was going through with no foreseeable way out.  Connor was definitely the more mature one in their relationship.  He's totally devoted to his work and doesn't really experience life because of it.  This is why Wes was a great match for him.  He dragged Connor into the real world and I liked seeing this assertive side to him.  He and Wes were a perfect yin and yang and brought each other out of their self-imposed shells.  Not only was their connection out of the bedroom satisfying, but their sexual interludes were equally satisfying and perfectly spaced throughout the story.This was a well-written story that put a modern twist on the Pretty Woman theme.  I'd love to revisit this couple, especially if it means finding someone to tame wild man Steve who totally intrigued me with his brief appearances.  Cat Grant has added another satisfying installment to Riptide Publishing's Rentboy Collection and I look forward to what comes next.

She clearly addresses the technical/mechanical aspects of spinning and helped me understand how to step back from the "intuitive" yarn I've been making (which is pretty good yarn) and pay attention to the details so I can repeat my successes. A lot of the information she provided on fibers is excellent and the details there answered several questions I had. She has raised a storm in the spinning community with the sideways drum carding idea... but that is NOT addressed in this book.

I love Sloane and Kat.This is a "series book", normally a pet peeve, but in this instance I don't care, and I begin to see why the writer did it this way.  I have to say, this author has another book out with a price point of 5.87 or something like that.  I did not buy it or take a chance b/c of the pp.  Now I did on this b/c it was .99, why not, let's see what it is.  It is fantastic!!! I loved the characters.  I got 1/3 of the way into this book before I just purchased the next 2, I loved them that much.Sloane is forceful but not a jerk, and Kat is flawed but decent and sweet, and not so emotionally ruined that you roll your eyes at her.  This is a GREAT relationship.  It starts out a little cliche, but the way we get to know them and their interactions are the best!!!I love the depth of the characters we get.  I have already purchased that 5.87 book.  After reading this I am hooked on this author.  I look forward to future works, and must say, she might have just gotten me over my aversion to chapter books, the secret is giving us enough chapters and having them be well written.  I would have never tried her otherwise and would have lost out.

$REVIEW.: The mother/daughter dynamic is one that is always full of ups and downs


Over time, I think the majority of mothers and daughters learn to traverse that path and minimize the rockiness that most seem to see as innate and unavoidable
In Mother-Daughter Duet, Cheri Fuller and Ali Plum (a mother and daughter) look at their relationship (which appears to have been considerably more rocky than most) and explore how they got off those rocks into a mutually satisfying friendship.If you've read any type of relationship book before, a lot of this will not be new - it's just geared toward mothers and daughters rather than husbands and wives

(This is stuff like how to listen, not projecting your expectations onto someone else, etc.) That said, I don't really think daughters are going to get much, if anything, out of reading this book


It's really a book for mothers of daughters (and probably adult daughters, at that), though Ali does chime in with her perspective at the end of each chapter.That said, I disagree with what appears to be the overriding idea that mothers should not voice concerns or questions about their daughter's decisions so as not to damage the relationship
One example given is an 18 year old's decision to get a tattoo


While I would agree that flying off the handle isn't going to help anyone, I disagree with the authors that the mother shouldn't express her thought that it was perhaps not the best decision that could've been made

Further condemnation is pointless, but I know I benefit from hearing my mom's advice, even when I disagree with it and even if, as an adult, I choose to dismiss it
I think our relationship is better for the honest communication (even when that honesty is pointing out her disapproval)

Certainly we have bumps and bruises on both sides because of it, but at the end of the day, I know my mother isn't patronizing me or building up resentment because she's trying to preserve the relationship by becoming someone she isn't.Overall, I can't say I was overly impressed with this book - but then again, I'm really not the target audience.

$REVIEW.: I LOVE J.L. Mac but I did not like her when I finished Wreck Me!! I think I may have cussed her out a little as I was throwing my kindle at the end of the book! Let me say that was one hell of a cliffhanger! If you do not like cliffhangers I beg you to please, please, please still read, it is one you will not regret. It was a great story and even though I threw my kindle it is a story I can read again. 5+ stars all the way!You think dominate, wealthy, sexy (drool worthy) man meets poor girl. I know if you are like me you have read a ton of these already but J.L. Mac throws a twist in there for her readers that has us holding our breath while reading pulling us in more and more every time we turn the page (or tap our screen).Hurry and read you wont be disappointed!! Plus after you buy this book you can turn around and buy Wreck me book #2!!-Harper

$review_text.: Big thanks to Alyssa and Kelly for an ARC copy for review.I love being back in the Petron world again. I was beyond excited that I get to see more of characters that I have grown to love, as well introducing some new ones, and a new city. Yes New York City to be exact, or Toby's territory as appointed from King Levi Laurent. Gosh I love saying that. *giggles*Casey was a great character. She was quick witted and fierce, just like my girl Allie. I love how Alyssa makes her main female heroines strong, and independent. Now when it comes to Toby and Jared my mind is very torn. I really like Toby, he is charming and serious at the same time. Then you have Jared.. who I loved from the Crescent Chronicles. He has that magnetic quality that draws you in.&#34;Yes, you will. I hope you know what your getting into though.&#34; I closed the balcony door. She wasn't going back inside that night.&#34;And what's that?&#34;&#34;A night you'll never forget.&#34; ~ Jared and CaseyWow, What's a girl to do? I loved seeing Allie and Levi again, and it was great seeing them through someone's eyes. You can really see how in love those two are. This novel has is packing with action, heated and tender moments, and one big shocking secret that I did not see coming. Yes the ending left my mouth hanging wide open, and in desperate need of book two. I am waiting anxiously to find out what happens.&#34;He laughed, &#34;Your always asking questions, Casey. How about you find your own answers for once?&#34; ~ Murphy and Casey

$review_text.: The portraits are quite startling, and technically dazzling. However there is little empathy with the children apparent to this eye, and the results are a bit chilly.

$review_text.: First, let me say I LOVE reading books about the South, especially South Carolina.  I have family that live right outside of Charleston, and I have been visiting there almost yearly for most of my life.  When I read a book set in Charleston, I get an extra thrill, because I know those streets, store, restaurants, etc.  I also know the outlying islands, including Edisto.  The author does a great job bringing the area to life.  The story, of betrayal and forgiveness, works very well in the southern setting.Julia's best friend Marney broke up her parents' marriage in their senior year of college.  Almost twenty years later, Julia is enjoying s successful career in art and teaching, and has just gotten engaged.  Marney shows up at her door.  Now a widow and the mother to Julia's three half siblings, she has lung cancer.  She needs surgery, and there is no one to care for the children during her recovery.  She asks Julia to return to Edisto to help her.The story is told from the points of view of different characters- Julia, her mom MaryEllen, her sister Meg, Jed-doctor and neighbor, and Etta, her nine year old half sister.The characters develop quickly and I became immersed in each of their stories, especially MaryEllen.  She is still hurt by the collapse of her marriage and confused as to why both her daughters keep her at a distance.I thought this was well written and moved quickly.I received a copy of this book through Goodreads Giveaways.I have posted this and other reviews on my blog- http://turnthepagereviews.com

$REVIEW.: If you've ever had the experience of having to do your job in spite of management, then this is the book for you. This book is all about diagonal thinking on the job. While most books of this type just throw countless examples at you in the hope that you'll just figure out what the people are doing, Hacking Work provides concrete steps for identifying where the opportunities for improvement lie, how to take best advantage of them, and how to weather the inevitable flack you'll get for daring to be different.The book is primarily aimed at anyone who has to work in an environment where bureaucratic standardization has made things easier for management, but unreasonably difficult for those who have to do the work. A lot of the suggestions it provides involve an investment in effort to make sure that the change your making is an actual improvement, but there are a few items that just involve negotiating a new process.Having been on both employee and management side of this, I would also recommend this book for upper management. It can be difficult for those insulated by several layers of managers to spot when issues crop up. These kind of hacks call attention to themselves in a way that can get through that. By encouraging celebration of the kind of hack presented in this book, you not only can encourage creative thinking in your work force, but a large number of these in one area can help identify middle management issues.In general, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone simply because it encourages a frame of mind that can improve any environment you have to function in, whether it's at work, at home, or in social groups.

Something tells him they are  connected, and that their deaths are not as innocent as they appear. He attempts to investigate. But why are powerful people trying to stop him?This book is an easy read and moves at a steady pace, with engaging characters.I hope Mr. Swank doesn't keep me waiting too long for the next one in the series........

$review_text.: The loud banging reverberates through the small house
Sophie's father hands her the gun and tells her it is up to her now to finish it


The police are at the door
He tells her again that everything he has done was to protect her from the harm that exists in the outside world, and reminds her that he loves her


The police woman barges in and finds seventeen year old Sophie huddled in her closet
Papa is hauled away and Sophie learns that she is the missing baby known throughout Idaho as Callidora
She was kidnapped by her father from her maternal grandparents when she was just a few days old

For seventeen years her father hid her away in the quiet hills of Arbon Valley

Sophie has been alone with no friends, except Damien and Donnie the boys that used to come and play when she was eleven
Now, Sophie is going to live with her grandparents and try to find her way in the real world
Can she really find love or is she truly under a curse?What I Liked:*I knew the minute I saw the synopsis that I had to read this one because it is set in Idaho, the state where I grew up


I am familiar with every single location in the book having traveled there on numerous occasions
The author does a wonderful job of bringing the Idaho setting to life

From the rural farm lands, the small towns and the culture right down to the green jello with carrots, a Mormon staple

I especially appreciated how she showed how difficult life can be in a small town that is predominately Mormon for an outsider due to prejudices.*I was fascinated by the entire story and eagerly flipped the pages to learn how everything plays out


The book relates the tale of a young couple who engage in a forbidden love back in the early 1990's

Fate tears them apart and they are separated
Each never forgetting the other, but the world is cruel and circumstances keep them away from each other until the fateful day of the birth of their illegitimate child
The girl is reared in a small house in the sequestered hills of the Arbon Valley
Not knowing that she was kidnapped
The reader sees the world from her sheltered and naive eyes, as she slowly tries to acclimate herself to her new surroundings
Sophie is convinced that she is cursed and that everyone who loves her and shows affection toward her will die
Imagine never having contact with anyone and being forced to live a strict lifestyle

Her story is engaging and interesting.*I admired Stephanie, Sophie's step cousin
She is a girl who attempts to rehabilitate Sophie and show her that some of the religious dogma she has beens spoon fed by her father is erroneous, along with the idea that Sophie is cursed


She tries to show Sophie the good in the world and shelter her from the evil that is roosting in her own home
I was heartbroken when I found out the truth about her past and why she almost ended her life


She is a strong and admirable young lady, who not only is fighting from the horror in her own life, but also against the prejudices that come from not being a part of the Mormon in-crowd that is the majority of the small town.*I loved how Ms
Stanley was able to weave together the events of the past with the present in order to give the reader a full understanding of all the secrets, betrayals, heartache, mental illness and misfortune that led to Sophie's kidnapping
In the end, the reader is presented with a fascinating, complex read with some surprising twists
I truly raced through the pages wondering how everything would come out for Sophie in the end
Could a girl surrounded by so much heartache and sadness find a bit a peace and happiness?And The Not So Much:*While I appreciated the author relaying the history and backstory behind the events, it was a little jumbled in its delivery
For instance, the story would flash back from present day to the early 1990's and then to the mid 2000 years and then forward
There was no pattern for the glances to the past, and it tended to jump around a bit.*The narration shifts from Sophie's first person narration to a third person narration with a couple of strange interjections at the beginning of the chapters that were Sophie's voice in present day looking back
I wish the book had stayed with one type of narration.*I was disappointed that I didn't get completion on the back story of Sophie's Aunt Elise

She has a hand in the events that ultimately tear the young couple apart and it seems that she is haunted by her role
Unfortunately, there wasn't any further expansion on her story
I wanted to know why she disliked Sophie, was it because of her guilt? What happened to Elise after Vee dies how did she deal with all the aftermath?*I was very confused over a scene that occurs when Sophie attends a youth stake dance


There is a moment where it seems that there is some type of paranormal activity that leads her to Damien, but it is never explained
I was left scratching my head over that one and wondered just exactly what happened.*There are some dark themes in this one such as suicide, sexual abuse, mental illness, betrayals and lies


A few times I feared that it was going to get uncomfortable as the story delved into some dark subjects

Thankfully, the author steers clear of the details and just eludes to the bleak material.*I am not sure that I completely agreed with Sophie's sudden change of heart at the end

She spends the entire book questioning her full existence and then it seems she is able to let it all go and just move on

I felt that her actions weren't quite in line with her previous thinking and behavior

Furthermore, I was a little bothered by the fact that Sophie never received any kind of professional mental care after spending her entire life sequestered away


I think trying to acclimate a young girl to the outside world would definitely require the intervention of a mental health professional.*Another storyline that was dropped and not finished was the involvement of the detective Carpo who worked on Sophie's kidnapping case

He has an ulterior motive in trying to get Sophie's story, and at one point he ends up driving her to Boise to see her father and then he just disappears after that leaving me wondering why he was even a part of the story.The Color of Snow is a book that lingered with me for days after I finished reading it
This is a haunting and powerful story that covers so many different angles and events that snowball into heartbreak


Can a girl overcome her burdensome, lonely childhood and step into the real world and find a chance at love? It truly is a thought provoking read.Favorite Quotations:"I felt my body collapse into her
The relief was like a warm blanket on a windy night.""Just because she goes to church doesn't mean she's a good girl.""It rained all day; the sky was exceptionally gray


It was as if the weather was scripted for a day of sorrow.""I felt my secret was slowly killing me, and the only way I could get relief was to talk about it


I was still scared that once it was out, it would sprout wings and fly out of control.""These people are pathetic


They are so small town that they aren't happy unless they are feeding off someone else's pain

If you lived somewhere else, you wouldn't have to deal with this.""One of these days you've got to just go for it
Hold your head high and don't care about what people think or say.""People need religion because they need something to blame terrible things on, or give credit for the good

It's used to make people feel guilty so they do what's right.""It seems the more I learn about my life the more complicated and difficult it becomes.""That is life

You can either accept it or bury your head in the sand, but either way, eventually you must face it
It does no good pretending things will go away."A big thanks to Nicole at Tribute Books for the review copy in exchange for an honest review

$review_text.: playing for love wasn't a favorite, but i think it's one of those stories that will grow on me. i've been reading excerpts from &#34;taste for love&#34; on tia kelly's blog, and finally decided to read this book before the new release next month.while i liked each character individually, i do think the chemistry wasn't there as much as i've seen it with kelly's other characters. it felt as if more time was spent on the backstory than there was allowing the love between paige and kenneth to flourish. then again, paige needed to sort through her issues before she should really understand and accept kenneth's love. i must say i really do like paige as a character, she has her issues, but she was so much more that a party girl trying to recover from her past and i was pleasantly surprised by that.the constant flashbacks in the story are sometimes confusing, but eventually it all comes together. the transitions between the flashbacks and the present were not always as seamless as they could have been, but i think that will probably improve as kelly writes more. i think a few more pages would have helped do the characters and their love stories a little more justice. it didn't feel rushed or anything, i just didn't always feel well-flushed out or detailed enough if that makes sense.overall, i enjoyed the book. i think i'll enjoy it more when i read it again because i'll know the storyline and will be able to pick up on the details a little more.i'm hoping that my issues with the lack of chemistry are addressed in the other novels in this series. i really do like this group (especially carlos), so i'm hoping i can get into their heads a little more and see how they work through their issues with love.

Well, I always thought those Reindeers were never given enough of the credit, not to mention those busy squirrels that do the bulk of the work while Santa visits the good little boys and girls. I can just see kids looking over their shoulder, watching to see if a squirrel is nearby taking notes on their good and bad behaviour.  That gave me such a chuckle and I think kids will enjoy learning Santa's well kept secret.NB I received a copy in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I think that some folks may have found Dust harder to appreciate because it is such a shock after being so thoroughly gripped by the claustrophobia of the silos in Wool to be yanked back into a very modern and recognizable world, with scheming politicians, ambition and fear. But the juxtaposition of what we knew in Wool and what we're learning here adds so much depth to the series that I feel Dust is absolutely necessary and I enjoyed it (while still being impatient to get back to the silos).

$REVIEW.: Ok, seeing these 2 negative reviews is really making me angry.I guess these people just can't stand that the truth has come out about their awful little school and the cold heartedness in their community both before and after the shootings.I applaud Brooks for telling it how it really is and refusing to let the lies about Columbine being a land of milk and honey continue.It takes guts to stand up against a whole community like he has.The refusal of certain groups of people in Littleton to admit the truth is astounding to me.But the book is awesome.It should be required reading in schools.This book gives you the real story from behind the scenes over the last 3 years.It provides you with a inside personal experience of Columbine from a person who lived it.Rob did a great job of helping to pull it all together.I like how Brooks shared his personal memories of Rachel,Daniel Mauser and Eric and Dylan.It gives a more vivid picture of them as people.In closing this book is a very important book .It has a message people need to hear. It has something for everybody.Anyobody who follows the Columbine story will love it, but I think people who are interested in bullying and school violence will benefit from reading it.I recommend it to everybody.
$SUMMARY.: A very important book about  Columbine

$review_text.: I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Ennis has some issues with Catholicism.Wormwood treads a lot of the same ground as his earlier work - mostly Preacher and (kind of) True Faith. The cast is certainly the same. God = crazy. Jesus = misunderstood. Pope = corrupt. Devil = conniving. People = mostly awful. Who does that leave as the hero? The Antichrist, of course. (And his talking bunny sidekick.)There's a fair-to-middling apocalyptic plot, but this is mostly a celestial road trip through Ennis' take on Judeo-Christian mythology. Except for the occasional bout of preachiness, Wormwood is actually entertaining, mostly because of Ennis has enough humor & charisma to pull it off. He clearly has an agenda, but he's conveying it with chuckling and warmth, rather than sarcasm & ranting diatribes.Burrows contributes solidly. It is a good partnership, as a more stylized artist would've spun the entire work off in a random direction.
$review_summary.: Like Dogma, but actually funny.

$review_text.: This was a great story about strong women. The author did a great job creating characters that have real life problems that I could relate to. I felt for these women and I felt the same emotions that they did. The strength of their friendship helps them to deal with their issues. I liked that the characters were all having issues at the same time, rather then there being a sequel. There was so much going on, like in real life, and there was stuff that happened that I did not expect. I am giving this book a 4/5. I was given a copy to review, however all opinions are my own.

$REVIEW.: Trust is the final book in the Finding Anna series.  After feeding my addiction through all four books, I'm at a loss as to how to fill the void.  Stephan & Brianna have kept my heart racing, my face blushing, and the pages turning as I waited for all the pieces to line up and fit into place.  I wanted apologies, retribution, healing, closure, and most of all love with a HEA tied up (wink wink) in a nice bow.  This series has been an awesome ride, I loved every loop and dive that made my stomach drop before we started the climb up to experience the next thrill.  It is a beautifully written, heartbreaking, emotional journey that I won't forget any time soon. &#10084;&#65039;

I  am not going to give you this story in a nutshell . You need to take a number of hours out of your life and discover this author and his ability to tell a tale that will have you questioning the characters sanity and in my case some aspects of my own. It is a very dark and disturbing psychological horror story. Give this one a go...and see what you think.

$review_text.: This is a paranormal romance.Heavy Metal Heart is about Misty and Trevor.  Trevor is a Rock and Roll star, who happens to be a demon. Misty is a videographer who is from KC but now lives in LA. Ever since listening to Trevor's music Misty felt a tug, a pull towards Trevor.  When you say demon we normally think ugly. Trevor his demon side is more elemental, rocks, trees that of the sort. When I first started reading this book I was wondering where the story was going to go. It started out with Trevor doing an interview drinking some bourbon and I was confused when I read his hand was of stone. I had to re-read that part. It then went to explain what Trevor was and his purpose walking amongst men. I figured hmm not something I normally read so let's keep going.  We then get switched over to Misty and what she does for employment. She likes what she is doing just not who she is doing it for. She decides she is going to go out her norm. That night her life would change forever.The minute she set eyes on Trevor there were twists and turns, confusion and lots of heavy making out. Which was great don't get me wrong. Even though the 2 felt like they had to hurry to get their tongues down each other's throat, I myself didn't feel like well I read this before let me skip it. I kept reading and all that teasing with their tongues, their hands feeling each other up, grasping, biting led to an explosive love making scene I haven't read in a long time. After they had sex Misty's life would never be the same. Sparks flew, light glowed in the dark, and you could smell the earth and feel it move under them. There was a connection that was thousands of years old. Misty she didn't want to believe it. Trevor showed his true self to Misty. Her reaction wasn't what he was hoping for. Death loomed over them they fought for their lives in 1 night. There was a lot of action between their lust for each other, their love making and fighting to the death.What was Misty's reaction? What was Trevor looking for? What kind of connection did they have that was thousands of years old? Can legends come true? Read Heavy Metal Heart and find out.

$REVIEW.: This book is ok for $1. But not really my style, so i only got about 40% of the way through. It is very short, so I am surprised that more didn't happen by the time i stopped reading. The book has "wee folk" and "faeries" etc, so the way I categorise it is that it is fantasy based on real folk stories, and I personally don't like that style. But I also felt it was really slow. By 40% of the way into the book, nothing of much interest had happened. It was also a little far fetched how the characters draw conclusions that lead them on the most appropriate path to take, where an ordinary person in that position would never be able to reach that conclusion.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this one, but I enjoyed it!  It reminded me a little of the ideas from Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy series, except more contemporary and about the actual angels themselves.I really liked the innocence involved in this one, though.  Anael's extremely curious, perhaps to a fault, and it sort of gets her in trouble at times.  Sometimes this trouble turns out to be rather sexy and other times it's a little heartbreaking.That's one thing I really enjoyed about this story, though.  It's sexy but it's got a sweet side to it, too, and the story itself and the concepts behind it were really interesting to think about.  I like erotica stories where I can get a good feel for the characters and the setting because I think that makes it sexier in a lot of ways, and this was definitely that.A really interesting read, and if you want something different from the rest but still sexy, I'd definitely suggest it!

$REVIEW.: In You Make Me we have Caitlyn, who finally is getting the life she wants.  She is working toward have a safe predictable life after growing up with a mother who had mental health problems, a brother who is just a jerk, and a sting of foster kids in and out of her house so that her parents could have the government checks.  She has the perfect safe boyfriend who will give her that safe comfortable life she has dreamed of.  She does love him, but then Heath shows back up.Heath, intense passionate, disappeared without a trace, Heath.She introduces him to Ethan as her &#8220;brother&#8221; but Ethan knows that there is something more there so she has to admit that he is her foster brother.And then the story takes off.I am wavering back and forth on what my star rating is going to be on this book and I think I am going to go with 3.5.I think if there would have been more back story to Heath he would have been put at the top of my book boyfriend list, but there just wasn&#8217;t enough there to make me get to know him enough to swoon.  I did like his character a lot.The characters who bugged me were Aubrey, Ethan&#8217;s sister and Caitlyn&#8217;s best friend, and Caitlyn herself.  I get Ethan being upset a bit over some situations in the book, but I think Aubrey was very high school. I realize that this was set with college age people, but to me her behavior and reactions were younger than that.  She acted very childish with some of the digs she tried to get in.  If I had just found out my best friend had gone through some stuff as a kid that she didn&#8217;t really want to share because she was leaving the past behind, I would let her know I was there if she needed to talk.Our heroine&#8230; sometimes I liked her, sometimes she struck me as a brat.  Her jealous reactions to some things rubbed me the wrong way.I think honestly if there was more back story, more detail about what she went through with her mother, with the other foster kids, with her childhood, I would have been able to have empathy for her and I would be writing a 5 star review because the writing was great.  There was just some stuff missing that let&#8217;s me build that connection with the characters, things were glossed over quickly instead of going into detail and letting me really get to know them.I think there could have even been something added with the character Darla.  Darla confronting Caitlyn, or something revolving Heath.  Anything that would give me more.All in all, I enjoyed the book, I just could have used a lot more to give me characters that I could fall in love with and root for.Thank you for my copy of You Make Me!

$review_text.: I found this book to be packed with practical ideas and information. After reading it I felt that I had a sound basic knowledge of how the news media works, and was confident about how to prepare materials for them to use. Of course every layman thinks they know how the media works, but after reading this you realise how intricate it can be.Strengths of the book:- Covers the whole industry - print, TV, internet- Fairly up to date (2003), with a better Internet chapter than a 2005 PR book I just finished- Dense with tips and practical information- Written in a fun, up-beat style- You will walk away from this book and actually use many of the suggestions. I've had a top-name PR agency on retainer for a year and I now realise how uninspiring and lazy they have been.Weaknesses:- Information isn't logically laid out. The first third is set out as an encylopedia in alphabetical order, rather than a logical narrative, which I find is a poor way of "teaching". Overall it is a collection of tips rather than the step-by-step guide it claims to be- Assumes you are in US and only deal with US media- A little bit too up-beat at times for my taste (no shortage of exclamation marks)- Assumes quite an advanced understanding of the media to begin with - reads like he's talking to a fellow PR buddy over a coffee- I think case studies are especially useful, but there aren't many in here.Overall: Highly recommended, it really gave me a "quantum leap" in terms of my understanding of the media, inspiration, and practical ideas for how to get my material out.Incidentally: Much, much better than "Media Relations" by David Henderson which I finished last week.

$review_text.: This was a DNF for me. And I ended up returning after about 18% in. I just didn't see how it could possibly get any better, or any less predictable. I thought Mia was kind of stupid to tell you the truth. She finally fights back against her abusive boyfriend and instead of calling the police, she runs away leaving her apartment unlocked and gives out false addresses and avoids airports because she's afraid he'll look for her.I just couldn't wrap my head around that. Mia comes from money. Why not hire a body guard? She can afford $175 a night for a two week hotel stay, but not a body guard? And what about the police? Does a grown woman really not consider calling the police when her boyfriend beats her repeatedly and almost rapes her? If she'd done this in the first place she wouldn't have had to drive all the way to Durango. She just leaves everything behind and runs instead?One second she doesn't want to look for her mom and the next second she's running to the town where her mom supposedly is because her boyfriend cheated on her, gave her a black eye and nearly raped her all in a span of hours. This could have been a much better story with a little more thought and research. But I guess some of these things had to be overlooked in order to make the plot work.Sorry, I need books to be more believable than that.

This book promised same, but instead of doing such, it further confused the diagnoses of I and II.  This work concentrated on finding out if you're a "little" or a "lot" bipolar.  As one who has suffered many years with this disorder, I could care less about this.  I just wanted help understanding as to better manage bipolar.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.

$review_text.: Thanks to netgalley for a free read in exchange for a review.This book made me completely lose my mind. I can't believe what I just read, and I'm not normally stumped. I read the synopsis but what's actually on the pages....I feel twisted. I went in thinking one thing and then had a complete one eighty by the end. The author takes everything you think you know and turns it to something else.As I started this read, it's starts out with Ein in school, and she has a relationship with a girl there. Not a tame one either. The sexual scenes from that made me reread the synopsis to make sure I had the right book. WTH. I should have known something was up when I had to Google what LGBT was. Not my normal read. So I was a bit lost. I really should do my homework and learn a bit more about what these books genre are. That's the thing about reading any kind of genre. I go by a synopsis of the book to see if I want to read it, or by a pretty cover. This book had me in turmoil though, I almost just gave up. About fifty percent in, I almost threw in the towel. I guess because I couldn't put a finger on the genre. This book was a lot of things, and many genres in one. Ein played a strong role model, who gave up pieces of herself for everyone around her. If she considered you family then she would do anything to keep you safe. There are a lot of difficult situations in the book, nonconsensual sex, m-f domination, slavery, group sex. World building was good and the ending was written well. I really want to give this book four stars for entertainment value but because I almost didn't finish, I gave it three and a half.

She is fatally wounded in a car crash, but instead of letting his little girl go, Lei Heaton decides to have her repaired by allowing doctors to alter her wounded body with bionics.  Deimos - a prominent military team leader - is assigned to safely transport her from the bionics lab back to her father's house.  Not only is her body completely remade, her mind is as well.  The consciousness of Magdalena is still there, but the software that was &#34;born&#34; calls herself, &#34;Sapphire&#34;.The story is filled with excitement, anticipation and romance; many bad people want to get their hands on this kind of advanced technology.  Deimos, who has also had some bionic alterations, feels an immediate attraction to this young, 18-year old girl.  Can he deliver her safely?  Can he protect her and his team while under constant attack and numerous problems along the way?One warning - this story has a QUICK cliffhanger .... the reader will be along for the ride and then the story abruptly ends.

$REVIEW.: I loved Shine not Burn. Strong female and male characters are important to me. Shine not burn is a strong book and Mac is my kind of cowboy (and I don't usually go for cowboys). I had extremely high hopes for By Degrees, especially when I read the synopsis online. (I follow Elle Casey on Facebook.)The story is good, but I may be a little bit burned out on the troubled rockstar kick because I just finished a two part series on one a few weeks ago.I liked Scarlette. She is kick ass, but her mental breakdown towards the head kind of threw me. I know us girls all have our weak moments, but come on? Two weeks in bed?I couldn't connect with Tarin very well, which might have been a bit of a drawback for me. In Elle's other book Shine Not Burn I connected so deeply with Mac that I found myself crying when I thought he was going to be kicked to the curb. Here? Not so much with By Degrees. I almost caught myself rooting for Scarlette to end up with Jack, which would have been a nice surprise.The ending? Well, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. I feel like maybe there should have been more backstory with Tarin and why he chose to raise Jelly's baby. Why the about face? I know he was working on it before and during his tour, but that's a pretty big leap.All in all, I'd recommend it to someone else. But for me, I read so many novels that some of them blend together. I probably won't be able to tell this from the next within a few weeks. Doesn't mean I won't look for Elle Casey's next book, she's an extremely talented author. I just happened to not like these characters too much. Would I read it again? Maybe. Is it worth a few hours of your time and $4? Most definitely. Will it reach the top like Shine Not Burn? I don't think so. My reasoning for that? Well, nothing beats Mac, a cowboy that's hot and makes steamy love to a woman in the shower while saying to her You.Are.My.Wife.

I really wanted to love Maxim but he had to win me over, he was so stubborn. Everyone knew what was best for him but he sure fought it and them. I just about set the book down halfway through b/c I was so mad at Maxim! I am glad I stuck it out because I was very pleased at the end. I am going to recommend this to all my paranormal romance reading friends. I am going to check out more books by Selena Blake.

$review_text.: Chloe has been secretly in love for years with her soon-to-be stepbrother Zack. It all started in elementary school when she founded the Unofficial Zack Warren Fan Club. But now, thanks to her friend, Lana, the fan club is still going strong in college. Chloe is mortified and tries to stop it before Zack finds out. When Zack's years of teasing Chloe turn out to be camouflage for his own feelings, her fears of discovery escalate. Will he forgive her when he finds out about the club? Does he really care about her even though he throws her mixed signals from every direction? Etc etc.The characters are good. Chloe is intelligent and funny, just like Zack, and they're both totally hot, of course. But they're also both college aged virgins. It's ridiculous. We are supposed to believe that a 21-year-old star pitcher who's probably going to play Major League Baseball is a virgin. Right. I'm tired of all the girls in these books being virgins, too. I know beautiful, 19-year old virgins exist but you'd be more likely to find the 16-year-old teen pregnancy that Chloe's mother was, in this country. Not that I think that's a better situation, but WHY is a woman's value so frequently tied to her "purity" or "virtue"?? It's offensive and insulting.In any case, that wouldn't be as much of a problem if the dialogue wasn't so repetitive, stilted and unrealistic. (Plus a lot of typos) There's a few predictable and boring skirmishes between the "bad guy" and Zack, in defense of Chloe. Mostly, Chloe comes off as weak and frivolous and Zack seems to be a self-appointed moral barometer for everyone. And, after years of tiptoeing around each other (and some decent relationship tension/set up)  it's all thrown away with an anticlimactic "Be my girlfriend." There's no realization or surprise, mutual-chemistry-moment other than one, BRIEF kiss.I don't mind if there's no sex (there really isn't). But then there has to be a satisfying romance with angst and a build up and release....are you getting the picture? LIKE sex but in story telling. Well, that's not here.This book is a let down.And there are more books with similar titles by this author so I assume the formula will continue with slightly different stories but the same result.I won't be reading them to find out.

$review_text.: I had the wonderful opportunity to get this book early as it was offered at the American Academy of Religion conference in November before it hit the shelves.The concept of this whole series is fascinating and its intention, if carried through, should have a lasting impact on the relationship between biblical and theological studies.  Too often there has been a traditional divide between the two fields and Brazos has decided to show how theology not only is "useful" for biblical interpretation - it is the very breath of theological talk.In this first Volume on Acts, Pelikan has arranged his commentary so that he can pull out major theological "themes" - everything from Mary as Theotokos to the "Gospel of 40 days".  With a rich analysis of the greek text and enlightening insights into the strong theological backbone if the book, Pelikan exemplifies the reality that theology is not about the Bible, but the other way around.If you are looking for the typical textual and historical analysis, dry criticism and a search for redaction, please, go elsewhere.  Pelikan, and I suspect the authors of the rest of the series, simply take the Bible to mean what it says.  It is a reading "in faith".What Pelikan has also been able to do is not only present to the reader a great scholarly work that is of interest to those who are in professional ministry, but also to make it accessible to people who may wish to use the book for personal use in biblical reflection.  I would love to see this and the subsequent books to be used by bible study groups to really get a sense of the theological "meat" that can be found in all biblical text.I look forward to reading more from this series.Read and Enjoy!

$review_text.: I received this this book for review by the author for an honest review.Ember is a dark paranormal book that will leave you wanting the next one. The storyline was great and I loved Asher & Ember they have to be my favorite character's in the book. I also really loved the Grim Reapers/Death Angels are in a war over souls.  Once I started reading it was really hard to put down Jessica did a wonderful job creating this story for people to fall into.Ember is a 17 year old girl who can see people's death with just a touch, so she tries to keep herself away from everyone. She goes to great lengths to have no physical contact with anyone. But that doesn't always work. With her father missing and her mother addicted to drugs and just flat out not taking her meds sometimes ok well most of the time. Her brother also suffers from depression but he seems to want to be there for her, it's just she knows her brother could not handle what is happening.  The only person who knows is her best friend Raven.That is until she meets Asher Morgan he's gorgeous, mysterious and has tattoos *Swoon* but he's not the only one vying for Ember's attention there is also Cameron But there is not really any love triangle in this book because Ember knows what she wants.With people disappearing and people trying to kill her Ember must figure out what she is because the war with the Reapers/Death Angels has just stepped into her own back yard and to save herself and the ones she loves she must find a way to stop it for good.

$review_text.: Oh I am excited to read this book now because at the beginning the author states she used actual historical events and people in this story. Yeah! The nerdiness in me looooves this kind of thing.Oh man I had to break out a map and look up all these places mentioned in the book, never heard of them before.I know I am obsessed with Indiana Jones and try to connect it to every thing but this book is really giving me the Jones vibe; a man traveling in distant lands&#8230;.The scenery and places the characters travel eclipses the story for me at times. Ross and Juliet faded into the background a lot.It took me a long time to read this story because of all the interesting tidbits Putney threw into it that I had no clue about. I am almost ashamed at how much time I wasted on reading about Heavenly Horses of Ferghana. The story never seemed to settle down for me so that I could focus fully on Ross and Juliet.Really wish the reason for Juliet leaving Ross was revealed a lot sooner, the reason isn't given until there are only 20 pages left in the book. Not knowing the reason held the story back for me because without knowing I felt their relationship couldn't move forward. Juliet's reason was highly dramatic also; it just didn't seem justified to me especially since I had to wait the entire book to get it. There at least should have been some blackmail, barrenness, or deathly disease thrown in there!Juliet was a great strong woman character but her actions when she was 18 really dimmed the character for me. And yes I know kids do stupid immature things but for some reason in this story I couldn't accept it. Ross was definitely &#34;the man&#34; in the story, being able to adapt and adjust to any situation. He was almost too perfect though. Once again as with Juliet something just didn't mesh right with me and Ross.At times I felt this story was to long, but I honestly don't know what parts could have been cut out. Like I said before I wish Ross and Juliet's relationship would have progressed faster. I'm not sure I would categorize this story as romance, but as an adventure with romance being secondary. It was a highly fascinating read, I learned a lot. If you want a romance read I would say this book isn't for you, but if you like Indiana Jones, want to learn about Asian/Southwest Asia (Middle East to Americans) cultures this is definitely a book you'll want to pick up. Even though this book is second in a series it is not necessary to read the first one to understand it.

Jennifer Sage keeps getting better and better. If you read the first one read this one for sure your going to love delving deeper into this world she has created and added to. If you've not read the first one read this anyway AND the first one. I cant get enough of Jennifer Sage she is truly magical how she makes you become the character it's truly not just a story of this person or that and all this filler of what happens, you truly feel as if you've been reborn into a new person and you don't ever want to change that. This book is so filled to the brim of wonderful and dark magic,adventure, love, fantasy, mystery its absolutely a one of a kind I can't get enough of it I've read it have a dozen times already and I really do have to keep coming back to read it some more. I loved the first book in this series but this book WOW that is all encompassing. You cant walk away from this book and feel the same its truly amazing Jennifer Sage is an amazing story teller she doesn't do what you expect she brings something new and fresh and I can't wait to see what she has in store for us in future books. Love your work Jennifer I hope you write more soon I'm on pins and needles waiting for more more books more stories more more more.

$review_text.: This story made me cry, a lot and repeatedly...A beautiful and painful coming of age story about two young men facing very different realities


 The shy artist and the outgoing jock brought together by mutual fears about a world that might not except who they really are.In my humble opinion, the emotional reactions that a few others mentioned were not unrealistic at all

 But just right for two young men just starting to deal with their sexuality and how to embrace themselves in a world that struggles with emotional honesty.They struggled, they failed, they rebounded, and they eventually moved on
 If anything the only complaint I had was how easily they reconciled at the end after all that had happened

 But it was portrayed well...the thoughts made sense and flowed well to the conclusion that was eventually reached.Well that and the Schizophrenia which was a tad off


 Probably because the character was so minor that it almost seemed just slipped in...Definitely at the top of my list, and I will seek out more work by the same Author...

$REVIEW.: This book was by far, in my opinion, better than the rest of the books so far in this series. I was anxious to read about my boy Amir and the TRUE woman of his dreams, Alexis. I know a lot of people hate on Amir and call him a cheater, but he wasn't the only one who cheated in his past relationship. I absolutely loved, loved, loved Alexis. I think she might be one of my all time favorite characters. I have so much respect for her because of the way she stood up for her man when the time came around. I have to admit though, once Alexis & Amir's part in this story was over, I kind of lost interest in the rest of this book. I can say that Alexis & Amir's story alone is worth 4 stars.

 I walk 10,000 steps or more for a minimum of 5 days a week
 I'm also using my Fitbit to increase the number of stairs I climb, the distance I walk, calories burn, etc

 Nothing.I must say I still believe in this program


 I think this is important for most Americans as our lifestyles have become more sedentary over the years
For that reason,  I would recommend this program to anyone and everyone just to get us all out of our chairs.This program is also good for anyone with a dog

 Cesar Milan recommends walking with your dog for at least an hour each day as that is what dogs do in the wild

 So walking is beneficial to both man and beast.Regarding results, I will report back in a few weeks and let you know how I fare!  Wish me luck!

Some odd word choices here and there and I laughed at the line that he had an eye on each side of his nose.When Liam first attacks Lachlan I thought Liam was his father leading me to wonder how the author was going to deal with them being half siblings


Which brings to the point that Elizabeth began a romance with a man who likely was her 1/2 brother and it never occurred to her to slow things down until she knew one way or the other.

$review_text.: I wanted to like this book, and I want to encourage this type of writer-after-the-8-hour-work-day-is-over kind of author, but this book is not good.  Its not so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I certainly won't read any more in this series.The main character, and some of the supporting characters, just didn't behave in a believable way.  Its like the story was written by an alien that didn't really know how humans behave.  The story was also very monotone, never building tension, no real drama.  Ben Stein should read for the audio version of this book.  Monotone squared.

$REVIEW.: Hard to believe all these five stars; couldn't get through it


It's okay, adequate, but certainly not worth five stars


The diction is contrived and stilted and stodgy at times (e.g., "committed depredations upon the girl") and the "just-the-facts-ma'am" style make for a fairly boring read
Hardly an edge-of-your seat true-crime page-turner thriller, especially since the back cover material practically tells the entire story


Really makes you wonder: where the heck are all these five star reviews coming from?

Uhhhh,  let's just say 2 or 3 weeks after purchasing part 3 I haven't gotten pass the first chapter. I guess I can try to understand the author's need to continue adding to the story, especially with the success of the series thus far. But, really sometimes they (the authors) need to leave well enough alone. Please!!! No disrespect to Ms. Pittman you are not the only author who does that with these books.

So Amazing I couldn't put it down. The whole time I'm reading it I was sure that J.A. Schneider was a physician because of all the terminology and knowledge of hospitals and procedures. I soon found out she hounded her physician husband for all the details. Anyway, back to my review, this book kept me on the edge of my seat and I lost precious hours of beauty sleep, which I depesperately need, to finish it! If you like MEDICAL THRILLERS then Embryo is the book for you!!!! I will not give spoilers but definitely give this book a definite 5 STARS and a positively TWO THUMBS up!!!

$review_text.: Lovelines is one of those contemporary romance out there that can still give us a refreshing and original storyline with a hero and heroine that truly make you feel as if you are encountering them for the first time. I assure you I'm not just saying this because the heroine had OCD. Despite the cover that reminds me so much of Kristan Higgins book, this one is definitely not a clean romance. The sex was even borderline kinky, which caught me entirely by surprise.Bailey, 31, had a serious case of OCD. She had 31 failed relationships all due to the fact that her boyfriends can't stand her tics. She count her steps, arrange her pens, walk into office at 7.58am and a perfectionist in everything she do. Those are just some of the examples, she still have a truckload of other tics kept hidden awaiting to emerge.She inherited the OCD from her dad, the person she love most. Her mum can't stand her, her sister can be a total biatch. I love her bff, Erica though. She was married with two kids and the family was a riot.&#34;I want Little Noah looking like a beat-up mess by the time he's eighteen. Cause no woman wants a delicate man. He needs to be sporting at least five scars.&#34;Truer words have never been spoken, Erica!Reece Powell is a new marketing executive in the firm where Bailey works as a proofreader. She caught his interest when she was bouncing by the hallway in her red cigarette pants. Even after discovering that she had OCD, Reece find it interesting rather than repulsive.&#34;I'm pretty sure she's OCD. I find it uncomfortably sexy. There's something strangely erotic about it. What the hell is wrong with me?&#34;Reece is almost perfect with his easy going demeanor, charming, flirty and the most important of all, he loves Bailey for being who she is. He never demand her to change, although Bailey was constantly trying to overcome her unreasonable urges all the time. Yes, he is only almost perfect because I love the fact that the man do had a little flaw in him.&#34;He made me forget that I was tic-bound, schedule-bound, urge-bound. He made me feel like I was breaking free.&#34;I love their casual relationship that blossom from light and fluffy to something more later on. There is just something so genuine about their interaction. Nothing over the top or cliche at all. Reece also had his own story to tell and together with Bailey, they both were searching for the acceptance they never get.So I was surprised by the borderline kinky sex scene. I had no idea that sweet and charming Reese had a little fetish. Don't worry, is mild though. But I did felt uncomfortable at some scene wondering why did he came off as demanding. He was exerting total control in the bedroom. But after he talked it out with Bailey, I came to an understanding and it makes me feel everything was perfect. Just plainly love the guy.Everything was picture perfect until something happen to shake things up. Will Bailey able to cope with the aftermath? And will Reese able to help her overcome it?&#34;Everyone's pain is different. I don't like when people marginalize their feelings because they think they're not allowed to have them. Someone will always have a tougher go than you. Does that mean you're not allowed to feel hurt? To be sad?&#34;The supporting characters in this book were very well fleshed out. I love every single one of them. Erica, Noah, the two kids, Christopher and Camden, the father, the mum, the sister and even her neighbor, who I had totally no idea what she was saying all the time.Actually there isn't any big drama in this book, but the underlying theme was about dealing with acceptance and loss. The flow of the story was really engaging and I like following through how Bailey and Reese relationship kept moving forward towards their HEA, despite some hiccups on the way. This is a very well written standalone with refreshing storyline, well fleshed out characters and non of those overuse cheesy line or OTT drama.

In Lena's character the author gave us insight as to how deeply guilt, grief and disappointment can affect a person


We find out why Lena is so depressed, and how when she pushes herself to do something she dreads, her life changes and the burden eases even as she discovers secrets and mystery surrounding her fathers life


With an unexpected romance, great historical facts and reconnecting with her family, Andrea Goodson has given us a great read! Overall this was a very well written story

I always love it when I hate to finish a book or series because these people have become my friends! Ms
Goodson is definitely on my favorite author list!

$review_text.: Reviewed by David M. KinchenTo foreign policy expert Michael Mandelbaum,  Sept. 15, 2008 may turn out to be as significant a datein American history as Sept.11, 2001.He reminds us in his new book, "The Frugal Superpower: America's Global Leadership in a Cash-Strapped Era" (PublicAffairs, 224 pages, index,  $23.95) that  on Sept. 15, 2008 Lehman Brothers "collapsed, creating a panic in the nation's financial system and an immense loss of wealth, and deepening an already serious global economic downturn."The date also will be significant in American foreign policy, he predicts, because the events of that mid-September day two years ago "accelerated a series of developments that will change the resources at the disposal of policy-makers in Washington, limiting the financial means available to conduct American foreign policy."Mandelbaum posits that the economic crisis of 2008 -- and especially the gargantuan economic obligations that will confront the country in its wake -- will redraw the boundaries of American foreign policy in two closely related ways.First, the limits of the possible for foreign policy will be narrower than they have been for many decades. The government will still have an allowance to spend on foreign affairs, but because competing costs will rise, it will be smaller than in the past.Second, the limits that constrain the government in its external initiatives will be drawn less on the basis of what the world requires and more by considering what the United States can--and cannot--afford on its borrowed dollars. It makes sense to Mandelbaum -- and the average man or woman in America -- that in an era in which fewer resources will be available for everything, it is certain that fewer will be available for foreign policy.When working Americans are paying more than in the past to support their fellow citizens who have retired, and retirees are receiving fewer benefits from the government than they were promised, neither group will be eager to offer generous support to overseas ventures.For almost seven decades beginning with World War II, and in contrast to the experience of almost every country throughout history, freedom of maneuver rather than constraints on action was the norm for U.S. foreign policy. In foreign affairs as in economic policy, the watchword was "more." That era has ended. The defining fact of foreign policy in the second decade of the twenty-first century and beyond will be "less."The country's soaring deficits, fueled by the huge costs of the financial crash and of its entitlement programs--Social Security and Medicare--will compel a more modest American international presence.In assessing the consequences of this new, less expensive foreign policy, Mandelbaum  describes the policies the United States will have to discontinue, assesses the potential threats from China, Russia, and Iran, and recommends a new policy, centered on a reduction in the nation's dependence on foreign oil, which can do for America and the world in the 21st Century what the containment of the Soviet Union did in the 20th Century.Speaking of containment of the Soviet Union, Mandelbaum believes that President Bill Clinton's administration is reponsible for one of the two major foreign policy errors of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the former satellites -- and even former republics such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- of the former Soviet Union.He writes: "NATO expansion soured relations with Russia because expansion broke the promise that Soviet leaders believed, with good reason, they had received from their Western counterparts, as the Cold War wound down, that NATO its reach into what had been communist Europe. The result was to create festering doubts in the minds of Russians about the trustworthiness of the West, and especially the United States."The other major error was the George W. Bush administration's March 2003 invasion of Iraq, Mandelbaum writes: "The debacle in Iraq resembled, in important ways, the misstep of NATO expansion. The resemblence strongly suggests that the root of both was a feature of post-Cold War foreign policy that transcends partisan differences."Mandelbaum says "what the two fiascoes had in common was expressed in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby, by the book's narrator, Nick Carraway,  in describing the wealthy socialites Tom and Daisy Buchanan. 'They were careless people....They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.'"We obviously can't afford "carelessness" in our foreign policy, given the horrendous budget deficits and the entitlement programs -- Social Security and Medicare -- that will be accessed by the gigantic baby boom generation of 1946-64, Mandelbaum writes in his clear, easy-to-comprehend prose.I recommend "The Frugal Superpower" without reservation and I hope that President Barack Obama and his Cabinet and advisors and Congress will follow the sensible policies advocated by its author.About the AuthorMichael Mandelbaum is the Christian A. Herter Professor of American Foreign Policy; Director of the American Foreign Policy Program at Johns Hopkins, SAIS. He is a former faculty member at Harvard University, Columbia University and the U.S. Naval Academy; his Ph.D. in political science came from Harvard University.Publisher's website: [...]

Charley is a beautiful, sensitive painter who makes her living as a model. She is a very private person and has only one true friend. Naomi loves Charley and always is there for her even when she hits her lowest points. Charley was devastated by a terrible tragedy four years ago. She has since pushed everyone and everything associated with that event to the past.Jude was a photographer who had spent several years covering human interest stories for magazines such as Time and National Geographic. Having told the story of human triumph and despair as taken a toll on Jude emotionally and physically. It has made it difficult for him to become close to people and his romantic relationships are shallow. He has since become a very famous photographer, taking pictures of beautiful people each day. It is a far cry from where he was. He is very good and it and enjoys his work. He has also made it a commitment to himself to never become involved with any of his subjects either emotionally or physically.Charley and Jude have several chance encounters on numerous occasions. They begin to develop a beautiful friendship. You start to see the emotional curtain begin to lift as each one lets down their guard. They have many hurdles they must each overcome emotionally and physically. It was truly a joy watching this beautiful story unfold. I literally became emotionally attached to each of these characters. You fall in love to with their strengths and weaknesses.Michele McMullen

$review_text.: A true murder mystery that Batman can't solve because he, or rather Bruce Wayne, is the main suspect.  I love this book.  I loved it when I read it in issues way back in the day.  The main writing force behind it, Greg Rucka, has such a great handle on the Bat universe.  I love that Bruce's friends and loved ones start to rethink everything they've been taught.  We truly get to see how Batman sees himself.  The two big reasons that keep this from being rated higher are the inconsistent art, which is usually par for the course for crossovers and the lack of a resolution.  From readers the issues before, I know how it turns out but there is nothing here to let reader where to turn to next to see this tale play out.  Great read and almost a must for Bat fans.

$review_text.: The common perception of Abraham Lincoln is that he was a man whose lifelong, deeply held Christian faith gave him the courage to prosecute a long and bloody war to right one of mankind's greatest wrongs: slavery.  The facts, however, tell a different story about Lincoln's long journey, a journey that, although it ultimately may have arrived at the same destination, involved numerous sidetracks and obstacles along the way.As Stephen Mansfield notes in Lincoln's Battle with God (A President's Struggle with Faith and What It Meant for America):"He was a complicated soul, an innovative mind, and an oppressed spirit.  He was raw and earthy and poetic.  He could be ambitious and enraged and cold...  We can hope to understand.  Yet never can we confine him; never can we seek to make him conform."Abraham Lincoln is, after all, a man who sporadically attended church services but never officially joined a church.  During his presidency, he often spoke of God and made Biblical references in his public addresses, but almost never mentioned Jesus Christ directly.  Many of the people of New Salem, Illinois, those who knew Lincoln longest and best, remained skeptical about his supposed Christian faith right up to the moment of his death.  And because Lincoln was such a vocal anti-Christianity advocate when they knew him, who can blame them?Lincoln simply could not keep his personal convictions private - he never missed an opportunity to ridicule a preacher or to express his religious doubts (privately or publicly) to the more pious of his acquaintances.  Citing an old Winston Churchill saying that, "a fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject," Mansfield stresses just how obsessed Lincoln was about debunking organized religion.  His resulting anti-religion reputation cost Lincoln many a vote during his political life when preachers specifically asked their congregations to vote for his political opponents.But Lincoln was a tortured soul from the beginning, and his journey would be a long one.  His mother died when he was nine years old, leaving the boy in the care (if you can call it that) of a wandering, but demanding father who saw his son more as slave labor than as a member of his family.  And it did not help that Mr. Lincoln was a Christian of the most hypocritical sort, helping to nip the boy's budding faith in the bud.Through the years, Lincoln would lose others close to him, including two young sons, and would suffer from regular (and sometimes near suicidal) bouts with depression.  And just when America was most severely tested, Lincoln was forced by his incompetent Generals to redefine the presidential role of Commander-in-Chief, a role for which he was not prepared.  By war's end, Lincoln had come to believe that God was playing a direct role in what was happening on the battlefield, that the country must pay a heavy price for its past sins before God would allow the killing to stop.  Although his evolutionary religious journey, almost complete, was cut short by an assassin's bullet, the man who died in Washington was far different from the one who lived in Illinois.Lincoln's Battle with God is an eye-opener, particularly as regards Lincoln's days in New Salem - a reminder that the real Abraham Lincoln is no less amazing a man than the mythical one.

$REVIEW.: I recieved this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. And an honest review ye shall get. Haha.Okay... I just need a second to breathe...Alrighty, down to business.I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK! HARDLY ANOTHER BOOK CAN COMPARE!The whole storyline was captivating and made me not want to put it down. There were so many twists and turns that I was fully invested and needed to uncover.And the brothers... let me tell you, totally swoon worthy! Oh my gosh!By the way, I'm team Puck all the way.I also loved the fact of which the author kept us (the readers) totally ignorant to what was going to happen next. Everything was a surprise pretty much. This book is one of the first books I've read where I wasn't able to figure out what's going to happen.And oh man... let me just talk about the visuals the author gives, completely chrystal clear. Nothing was confusing.I could go on and on about how rant worthy and fandom worthy this book is but I think you get the point. This book is a sensational, swoon worthy, whirlwind that keeps you guessing till the very end.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a hoarder, however I know someone close to me that is. I have watched just about every 'Hoarders' show on A&E, mainly because it inspires me to clean my house. I live by a rule of thumb; if I haven't used it in a year, I don't need it. I realize that many who hoard do it compulsively and need help to gain control again. This book has given me a lot of useful information to hopefully help me in helping my friend. From the reason people hoard to different methods of controlling your existing hoard and preventing hoarding in the future, you'll find it in this book. Excellent buy and well-worth it.

$REVIEW.: 3.5 StarsI recently discovered Kirsty Dallas and read both Mercy's Angels books back to back


Saving Ella, Book 1, is Ella's and Jax's story; Fighting Back is Rebecca's and Charlie's story

Both work well as standalone novels, however I think I benefited from reading Saving Ella first as I felt a strong connection right away with all of the characters and what Mercy's Angels are all about.Fighting Back starts with an intense, painful situation for Rebecca


I was immediately drawn into the story and definitely felt all of her conflicting emotions that arose out of it

And then there is Charlie...he's a tough fighter with a soft spot for Rebecca - his 'Betty Boop' - and a tendency to fight before asking questions
I really loved watching their relationship grow in Fighting Back as they helped each other fight their own demons.Kirsty Dallas adds just the right touch of humor mixed in with the danger of not knowing who is the 'bad guy'

I loved seeing the same cast of characters from Saving Ella along with a few new faces - Lola and Emily and Braiden
Kirsty Dallas definitely knows how to dish up a hot alpha with a side of sweet and her female characters, while having experienced some at-times god-awful situations, are fighters with a sense of humor and a backbone

I can't wait to learn more about the others we've just begun to meet in future books! Overall, a quick and intense read that left me hanging just a little bit for book 3.

$REVIEW.: WOW! Angela Catio the author book sure has a way of writing that allows you to step into her shoes and experience what she experience during the abuse she went through. She is an awesome writer and has the ability to paint a picture so vivid that as you read this book you actually reach out in your mind and touch the things she is writing about. There few writers that have this ability. As you read this excellently written book you have no choice but to feel what she felt. Her ability to be so detailed in her writing I found myself having to stop reading because it was becoming hard to read her words through the tears swelling up in my eyes. I don&#8217;t know if I would be able to drum up the courage to put the painful experience she went through down on paper to allow others to read. In my opinion, Angela is every courageous to be able to open the door of her personal experience and let each and every one of us to walk through it. What she went through no person should ever have to go through for a minute let alone five years. Angela Catio is truly a unselfish person to have gone through all of these horrible things that she could have easily kept to herself, instead she shared her story in the hope to help others that maybe going through these experiences. The Survivor is a book that everyone should read; it will definitely change your life. Angela does an excellent job.

The seemed to be trying to create a sense of mystery so we would be surprised by the child 's lack of power and personality so that we would be happy when she did something.Yet not much was exciting...just a jealous and vengeful child emerged.

$REVIEW.: This is a well writen account of of a time frame on the Easrern Front that usually gets little attention. The main focus in on military and polictal decisions made by both sides and brings to light many facts that were not known untill thirty years later. If you're an advanced student of East Front warfare this is great stuff. On the other hand if you're looking for action and a soldiers point of view you may want to look elsewhere. It's true it's the best work yet on this time frame it's also trus that the reading is very dry and you may find yourself putting the book down more often than you might be used to doing.

$REVIEW.: Too Many Cooks is a sweet romance about finding love when you least expect it. I see Estelle and Gaetano like most parents. They want their kids happy, and happy equals married and having babies. Estelle misunderstands a conversation the she over hears her doctor have and assumes that she is dying. After fleeing before speaking to the doctor she stops off at a restaurant to have a drink. a simple drink turns into crying on the shoulder of chef and owner Gaetano. Gaetano in a great Italian chef with a big heart. He comforts Estelle. They end up forging a plan to bring their kids together. Seems like it may work but Gina and Alex are stubborn. this stubbornness prevents them from really getting to know one another. Gaetano and Estelle grow closer each day. their friendship blossoms into much more. They worry the kids will never be as happy and in love as them.I thought this story was cute but I didn't like the storyline revolving Boris. He is a client of Gina's and is harassing her. It felt like this part of the story was placed here to create a reason for Gina and Alex to get together. Yeah they were taking a little longer to get to were they should be but in time I think without Boris they would have worked. This part of the story stuck out but not in a good way. It was out of place. I think that Alex and Gina work. They push each others buttons in a good way. I think that they are happy in their lives with their thriving careers, but their parents feel different. Most parents do. Whose parents don't question you about settling down once you hit 25? Estelle and Gaetano mean well, they just want to secure their children's happiness by finding them love.Overall I thought that this was a sweet love story. It is appealing as a quick weekend read, but not something I would write home about. It does have some flaws in the plot but it did have a few things I enjoyed too.I received this book courtesy of the author and Innovative Online Books Tours for an honest review.

 However, all of these paid-by-the-word authors just got way to carried away


 Pages and pages describing every shot fired in the Battle of Waterloo just to set the stage for the thief being there


 Hours of diatribe by the revolutionaries
 Way to much


 Definitely would have been better as a Reader's Digest Condensed version!  But I was very grateful to have this free text-to-speech version!!!  I never would have sat down to read the whole book.

$REVIEW.: The past always has a way of catching up with you, and sometimes what you thought you knew becomes re-written when life brings you full-circle - and for Ellie that was face to face with Finn Donavan
Growing up, Ellie and Finn competed against each other in everything - who knew that when fate brought them back together in the town they both left to escape their pasts, that they would both learn that things aren't and weren't always what they seem.This was an interesting read, mostly because of the setting - not sure I would have ever guessed that I would find the main setting for a romance novel to be centered around the funeral home business, and for me the dialogue around competing for business was a bit odd, but I really enjoyed the story and the interaction between the characters.I loved Ellie and Finn - their lifelong competition provided such a great back-drop to all the drama in this story and could really be seen in how they have lived their lives."Good Lord, she'd been a pain in the butt
Always competing with him


Half the time beating him out of prizes that should have been his, and the other half making him work his tail off to get the ones he did win


She was like an energetic muse who wouldn't let him rest.Of course, he credited surviving boot camp and a tour in Afghanistan to the tenacity and discipline she'd worked into him


Competing with her had made him sharp
Tough


Resilient

Without somebody as intent as he was to be the best, he never would have reached his full potential
Even their silly tormenting and teasing in the halls kept the spirit of competition he needed

His favorite was sitting with her at lunch before a big exam, both of them being snarky, punching up each other's confidence to prepare for the test."You could feel the tension and see the sparks on the page every time the two of them got together, and I was really rooting for the two of them to realize the truth of their situations and the honesty of their feelings."I know


But I feel like the past - our constant competing - is making you do things out of habit, and you're holding out when I know this is what you want."The family relationships were also wonderful

You could really feel just how deep the bonds of Ellie and her dad's relationship went, and I thought that the depiction of his illness was so touching and real
It was hard not to tear up reading some of the exchanges between Ellie & her dad..."Besides, I don't want you to go back to Pittsburgh permanently." He raised his hand to her hair and stroked softly as if mystified by her


"I may only recognize you ten more times, but I want those ten times."And Finn and his family had me laughing and sighing - his banter with his brothers had me laughing out loud and his protectiveness of his mother was so sweet.Overall, this was a fun read with lots of romance and some steamy scenes, witty banter and lots of colorful, small-town characters that kept me turning the pages and rooting for a HEA!I received an complimentary copy from the Publisher for an honest review.

$review_text.: You probably don't know Carol Leifer by name but chances are you've seen her work

She has been a stand-up comedienne since the 70s; she wrote for Seinfeld and the Larry Sanders show
She also has written for a few Oscar telecasts, performed with Frank Sinatra and even had her own sitcom on the old WB network
Her writing work today can be found on popular series like Modern Family and Devious Maids.How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying (great title by the way) is a book for aspiring stand-up comics, or others pursuing glamorous and creative careers

It is also part memoir, and Leifer revisits her early days in the stand up scene with one-time boyfriend Paul Reiser, Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld


A lot of the book, though, comes across as a job hunting guide for people who are extremely stupid
Sample tips: Don't be late for a job interview


Have good hygiene on the job
Don't wear sexy clothes

You don't say, Carol! I would never have figured that out.Throughout the memoir/job guide Leifer takes a know-it-all approach which is less than appealing


It's admirable that she worked so hard in the industry, and a lot of her stories illustrate that hard work, but she also does not mention that she got lucky too, knowing people like Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld, and how that may have furthered her career
It is also strange to read a job guide from someone in the stand-up business

Stand-up is such unconventional work and it's not like there's a clear path to stardom, a clear guide of how to get there

It mostly amounts to talent and luck and neither of those things can be taught (well, maybe talent can, but only a little)

Leifer also believes her tips can help anyone in any industry and that is definitely not true.I also didn't care for the way she addressed the women-in-comedy conumdrum

She thinks she was lucky to be a woman in stand-up in the 70s,  when it was acknowledged it was a boys club


She doesn't take men to task for holding women back in comedy, and thinks women are just complaining too much and not working hard enough to change the system.That being said, this is an amusing book, and it's fun to hear backstage gossip--spoiler alert: Diana Ross and Lorne Michaels come off like total douches--but I would have much rather gotten an honest memoir from Carol about her life in comedy


She also mentions her partner briefly but never talks about what it was like to discover she was gay mid-life.If you are looking for a really good book on being a woman in stand up comedy, I highly recommend We Killed by Yael Cohen
It gives a very broad, balanced perspective on this same subject.

$REVIEW.: I not ashamed to admit it--I love a sweet but pure romance. I say pure, because Meet Me Under the Mistletoe is about two Christian people who are both intent on acting like committed Christians. And there is no one who can write that better than JoAnne Durgin.I say sweet romance, because from page one of this book you really want to see the two main characters together. You want to see them kiss under the mistletoe.I give this book 5 stars because it fills its particular category perfectly. No murder or mayhem, but a page-turner because JoAnne Durgin has a way with getting into the heads of these two really nice people, Jake and Julia. Jake is a hero firefighter, and Julia is a nurse. You feel the tugs on their heartstrings, as well as the Christian Spirit that just flows from both of them.The background characters are also hilarious. This author is a genius in populating her novels with characters you just want to hug and laugh with, everything from funny toddlers to wise-cracking cafe owners in small-town USA.If you like to sit down on one snowy afternoon, to be swept away with a sweet romance that has a strong spiritual thread, then I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: This is one of the best thrillers I've read so far this year.An action packed, high octane thriller, it grabs you from the start and continues through its page-turning twists and turns. A thriller as it is meant to be written. Fast-paced, lots of action and strong plot line. It is the story of Pete Maddox,a CIA agent, who discovers a secret Libyan terrorist training camp in the Amazon jungles of Venezuela. He falls in love with a woman who is a CIA asset in the country, making them the target of the brutal head of the Venezuelan secret police.The book is a "fast and furious" read with a background plot of a planned coup against the regime of President Hugo Chavez. Some real international intrigue here.The author writes from experience. He was born in Costa Rica and raised in Venezuela, so he knows Latin America well and it shows in his writing and descriptions. He now lives with his wife in San Francisco, but sets his novels in Latin America.The only flaws I found with the book were a few minor editing issues, but they didn't hamper enjoyment of this exciting read. The ending was also a bit lacklustre after such a breathtaking journey. I think the author could have done a better job here. It finished rather abruptly.This one would make an excellent beach or airplane read. I look forward to the further adventures of Pete Maddox.

$REVIEW.: When I initially read this book (downloaded for free), I found it slightly entertaining
Since it was free, I judged it worth four stars


After thinking it over, with input from the author, I realized that if I had spent $2.99 the current price for the book (I got it free - and now it's priced at 99 cents), I would have been very unhappy
The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying

The two exercises offered extremely brief
This information can be found quite easily on the Internet for free (google free meditation tips to see what I mean).Five star reviews should be left for books that really touched you and brought something meaningful into your life, not because an author doesn't want their feelings hurt.I've recalculated my stars based upon the following:- this book comes up on my Kindle reader at 22 pages

It's SHORT
It ends abruptly
There is no satisfying conclusion
The two exercises offered are brief and not comprehensive
If you are interested in meditation this book doesn't even open the door.- price


At free, it's an interesting read but not thought provoking or "change your life." Simply an interesting 15 minutes spent standing in line
Obviously, each person thinks differently about how they spend their money and time but consider this: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a free download on Kindle
That is a five star book.Do you think 22 pages = $2.99? Okay, go for it

(BTW since my review was posted the book dropped down to 99 cents).Sorry Life Coach, you may want to go do some meditation! ROFLMAO.Reviewed by Cinnabarys.com

$review_text.: I have at least two dozen books on raising chickens. My favorite was printed in 1885, but I have books from the early 1900s, the 1920s, the 1940s and several others more recently. Yet, if I only had Backyard Chickens: The Beginner's Guide to Raising and Caring for Backyard Chickens, I would have enough information to succeed with a few chickens for eggs.Besides the excellent organization and easy-flowing manner in which Rashelle Johnson explained the salient points, what I found exceptionally welcome was the inclusion of two photographs - one was of a chicken tractor. Curious about the chicken tractor? Get the book.Although this is such a terrific book on backyard chicken raising that I can't praise it too much, there was one ever-so-minor point I would be remiss in not highlighting:The author stated that one British study reported the percentage of chickens carrying salmonella was far more prevalent on large, commercial farms where hens are kept in cages (23% vs 4 to 6 % or so on organic farms). I'll not quibble with the statement as presented by Johnson, for my gut tells me it's accurate. My concern is the the writer did not give the source or a link to the study.Again, despite this one very technical point, I absolutely loved Backyard Chickens. It is an outstanding 76-page book for anybody considering a small flock of laying hens.

$review_text.: As someone who has spent weeks in a boat, some it shivering in the cold and damp, I can sympathize with poor Tan and her bud Russell, a pair of paddlers on a flooded Earth trying to get their canoe to Leadville, where it's rumored one can stand on dry land and live like a human being again. Despite my sympathy, however, I found it hard to like this story, all history and setting and very little forward progress. The writing is excellent (star number two)  and the setting is thoroughly explored (if monotonous). While I paid nothing for it, that's about what it was worth to me. My curiosity wasn't sufficiently aroused to pay for the next installment. Maybe the author should slip a bit more meat between the slices of bread in the free sandwich if he wants to sell the side of potato salad and the glass if iced tea that go with.

$REVIEW.: If you are an A. C. Clark reader / fan / obsessed, well this is the book for you! These are some of his earliest published works and they are short, masterful and truly breathtaking. The brilliant observations and well crafted writing is a joy to explore, and several of these works were done when he was barely twenty.There are many counter points in this collection which are bits and pieces of some of his larger, later works. But virtually every one of these stands on its own. They are that good. And, they want you to read more ...Well worth the price.

$REVIEW.: This is my 3rd C.J. Ellisson book that I&#8217;ve read and I must say, her books are such a breeze. Each book read so smoothly, effortlessly that I always feel like her books are so short. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re not but you can&#8217;t help but devour these books. The characters feel so real and the sexy scenes are HOT HOT HOT!!!I&#8217;m VERY glad that this book came along because after Vanilla On Top, I felt like Heather and Tony&#8217;s story wasn&#8217;t over. I wanted more. This was the perfect next book in the series! :-) The best part is that Vanilla Twist takes place right after Vanilla on Top so it&#8217;s like we never left them.**spoilerish if you didn&#8217;t read Vanilla on Top**Now that Tony has more time on his hands after his recent career change, readers are able to see a slightly different side of him. I like the fact that he seems more &#8220;normal&#8221;. In Vanilla on Top we know he&#8217;s a really rich and wealthy business man but I like the more manly/handyman side to him. Tony is more down to earth then most men with his wealth.Heather is just starting her new role as CFO, so they are both settling into their new lives. Heather is smart and confident still but has a very situations at work that test her conviction. Tony as well goes through some possible life changes and has to question himself on several occasions.I like the fact that in Vanilla Twist, Heather and Tony are both going through REAL LIFE issues. Something that lots of people can relate to. Their relationship is full of sexual chemistry, love and most importantly trust. I like that when Ellisson writes her characters they seem real. Their relationship although new and fresh is reminiscent of a marriage. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read and look forward to more books in this series. :-)

$review_text.: A world without coffee? According to author Regan Black, it's not as far off as you think


In 2096, caffeine and sugar are illegal

There are also some really dark villains out there.The Shadows of Justice box set is a great gift for the futuristic paranormal romance reader who's looking for something other than a vampire
Each book features a kick-butt heroine as the central character

There's enough of current society in play for the reader to feel instantly comfortable in her world.Then she mixes is her strong characters with special abilities
Each has motivations that make them believable and their histories make them lovable, although they don't necessarily think so


Her heroines are so strong, you'd worry they overpower their male counterparts, but Black builds equally strong heroes who give as good as they get.The final ingredient -- strong, action-packed plots -- and Black has mastered a thrilling recipe for success.Although the books in the series are written so you could read them as stand-alones, why would you when you can start with this box set?

(As a decent cook of many years, some of the recipes did make me gag, but I'm not the audience for this book now, am I?)

$review_text.: Vampire Parker Hollis took full advantage of the free love and hippie lifestyle of the sixties...right up until he ignored a friend's warning and dallied with someone he would long regret ever meeting. Sure, he learned a valuable life lesson: hell hath no fury like a witch scorned, but he payed dearly for that lesson. Determined to be Parker's blood wife, the crazy witch captures the vampire, then casts a dark spell that will change Parker...and his existence...forever.That's how Parker Hollis becomes the world's first vegetarian vampire.Decades later, Parker's best friend Greg's death, and his deathbed vision, prompts Parker to move to a town called Maggie's Grove. What he and Greg's ghost finds astounds them, a town dedicated to the various supernatural races. It isn't long before Parker meets his neighbor, a dryad and for some inexplicable - and inexcusable reason, the town outcast, Amara Schwedler. Her scent makes him yearn for a taste and her heart calls to his.Amara's used to the petty hurts from being ostracized her whole life. She knows she's different. Heck, even other dryads avoid her - and that's the cruelest hurt of all. Still, she lives her life and she has a few select friends, even a job with a boss who understands her need to occasionally commune with her tree. Still, when Parker moves in next door, Amara is captivated by him...if a little perplexed by his diet, and his easy acceptance of her is a balm to her soul that puts hope in her heart.When psycho witch sweeps into town smelling of putrification and decay, intent on destroying anything standing in the way between herself and Parker, Amara considers her nothing more than a weed in need of pruning. A pervasive weed with an evil streak. When she messes up Amara's garden, then targets innocent townspeople, Amara gets very, very angry. And when Amara is angry, she's very, very scary. The witch may be almost impossible to kill but Amara is something else altogether, and she and Parker have every intention of finally plucking that damned weed and ending her reign of terror. The trick is going to be making sure they don't get mulched in the process.Without a doubt, Bell's new series debut definitely offers something new to vampire fiction. It's first vegetarian vampire botanist. Poor, cursed Parker, with his dietary restrictions, ghostly best friend, town-appointed Renfield...who keeps getting it on with his gay ghost - all over Parker's furniture, and, of course, the homicidal and seriously messed up witch who wants to be Parker's one and only chew toy. I'd feel really bad for him...if I wasn't having such a darned good time chuckling at his plight.Actually, I just had a darn good time with the whole book. It had it's serious, threatening moments, but the majority of the focus stayed towards the more comedic and sexier end of the spectrum. And the sexier end, in traditional Bell style, was quite yummy.Amara was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure I was going to like her, worried she'd be a bit too naive for my tastes given her social seclusion. As it turns out, she totally kicked butt - even more so than Parker did, and had a dry but sharp-witted sense of humor I enjoyed. She was a definite force of nature, and I very much liked how she fit with Parker. Other characters, secondary and ancillary, were plentiful and delightfully quirky, as is also typical of Bell, and they provided a nice preview of future main characters for the series.I wish the plot of the book had developed a little differently, with Amara and Parker's relationship evolving at a more gradual pace than it did. I thought the weedy witch of the west could've been introduced to the town a little farther along into the story, allowing for more time for all the characters and interpersonal relationships - especially but not exclusively the romantic one - to develop a little more thoroughly. And I would've liked Parker to have been a bit more successful in his endeavors. Seems he was getting his butt kicked - or cursed - fairly often throughout the book.Still, for a light and humorous paranormal romance dripping with sizzling sexuality,Blood of the Maplewas a fun read and fairly classic example of the type and quality of funny, sexy fiction by Bell. I plan on continuing the series, as there was quite a lot of interesting and original mythos and world building here. I'm looking forward to seeing where Bell takes it all. I just hope we won't have to wait too long to get back to Maggie's Grove and its quirky coterie.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by CozyReaderfor TheRomanceReviews.comCHRISTMAS BREAK is a short story and a new spin off series of Jami Davenport's Seattle Lumberjacks and it's a great start. The seed has been planted into my mind and now I need to see how it is going to flourish.Braxton Davis is a college football star who has set his mind into going into the NFL. His family doesn't agree with his choice of profession, but he doesn't care. He is going to be the best in the NFL.Aubrey is a waitress at the Grizzly Den and has a badass attitude. It is her way of closing herself off.Both have decided to stay away and spend Christmas on their own. However, that one night, Braxton wants something to eat and Aubrey is the one taking his food order. He takes a peek at her tattoos and he has a sudden desire to see if she has them throughout her body.Aubrey knows who he is, but it seems he doesn't remember her. They share classes together; they have the same major. So what starts as a one night of exploring each other might be a wonderful start of a romantic relationship...if he can accept her past.I love Ms. Davenport's writing and how she is able to captivate me. This story had everything--steamy hot kisses, lingering touches and fun characters. I found this story very sexy, romantic and well written. I enjoyed seeing how Braxton and Aubrey interacted with each other and how they just seemed so right for one another.The storyline has been seeded and I can't wait to see what else Ms. Davenport has in store for Braxton and Aubrey in Rookie Mistake. Opposites attract, and I totally recommend this short story.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed the first two books in this series but somehow this book for me was just OK.  I think for one, the book seemed kind of rushed.  Events that happened to Garrett and Laurel that a reader would be interested in were just kind of skimmed over by the author.  Also, what happened to my dominate man from the first book?  I realize love changes you but Garrett was way too "mushy" and was certainly missing his "man card" in this book.  I wanted dominance and I didn't feel Garrett possessed it in this book.  I really hated to give any kind of negative review for this book but to me it was just to sugary sweet and had an almost too good to be true ending.  It may be for you, but it wasn't for me.

$REVIEW.: The grammar is cleaned up I'm guessing from when some of the other review were written. The repeated use of women when woman was the correct word bothered me the point of distraction but I could live with it.Generally I liked the book. I feel like I missed something though about Lil and her education and career. Other than a brief mention as a catalyst for some other stuff I didn't get it. It didn't seem to fit her by any stretch of the imagination. I was more prone to believe with her behavior that she was much younger.And I really didn't buy into the relationship until the very end when everything started to happened. I'm trying real hard now to not spoil anything. But it wasn't until that point where I felt anything for either character and I kind felt cheated by the rest of the book.

$REVIEW.: John Cooper has crafted a well-documented tale of Sir Francis Walsingham's life in the service of Protestantism, England and Queen Elizabeth. The title is a bit misleading in that more time is spent upon his work as principal secretary and ambassador to France then designing a spy agency. Did he employ agents, double-agents, and counter-agents? of course, but not in an organized fashion (according to the evidence presented and documented). Instead, he was the spider pulling on all the threads and he had to recognize the worth of any message before it could be acted upon. In all, a solid, readable biography concentrating less on personal details and more on organizational service.

$review_text.: Have a number of books about mushrooms and all the countries they grow in and how various cultures and ethnic groups enjoy them


 Its the cover of this book that caught my attention, to the point I think it would make a great print to have framed for in our kitchen

 Grew up in a family that belonged to the mycological society in Seattle


My Dad could smell a shaggy mane and other mushrooms half a mile away, much like he could smell the wee alpine strawberries on the north side of Mt Saint Helens when we backpacked in the 60's when I was a kid
 And with fall and the nip of cool air just starting here in the Sierra fond memories of a beef roast in the oven and Dad and I finding shaggy mane mushrooms to pick quickly, to place around the roast the last fifteen minutes of roasting come pouring back to my memories;Love this book because its not how to find various safe mushrooms to gather and eat, but because it talks about the Mycological mindset and how some gathering folks are sane and some border on nuts


 And how some mushroom folks gather mushrooms to sell for  a big price where folks like my family gather them because we are self sufficient living types who see wild mushrooms as a food source, as much as we do deer, elk and other wild game we need.Chapter 5 The Exotics  is an interesting chapter, because it is about rare mushrooms and how to the untrained palate a crimini may taste the same as a white button mushroom, the most common mushroom sold in grocery stores
And the story of how the author tried to grow oyster mushrooms in her NYC loft is a hoot, and if you have a great sense of imagination be it visual or smell, should make you laugh out loud.Chapter 6 Truffles I liked simply because we love France and Italy and the wonderful spring and winter truffles we have gathered and savoured


Am also overjoyed that the author warns the reader that what grocery stores sell as truffle oil often has anything but real truffles in it, aside from a sliver the size of a hang nail.And that the 8 oz wannabe $8 bottle of truffle oil in the average grocery store if it were the real deal would be closer to  $30

$REVIEW.: Like others, I was first swept up in Noren's story when I was 12 years old
I loved 'This Star Shall Abide' but was less than thrilled with 'Beyond the Tomorrow Mountains.'Last night, at age 36, I re-read 'Tomorrow Mountains' (in one sitting!) and understood immediately why a young teenager would have found it difficult: the story of Noren's new challenge was far beyond my youthful understanding, much less sympathy
But as an adult, I found it an amazingly vivid and true-to-(my)-life portrait of an existential crisis.Engdahl has a gift for creating compelling, sympathetic characters whose minds and hearts are engaged in their relationshps with each other and their world


Each one has a different perspective, and each (slowly) learns from the wisdom of the others


The &quot;lessons&quot; are there, but so are rich stories of people you enjoy spending time with.Tonight I'll start &quot;The Door into the Universe&quot; third book of the trilogy, and I'm delighted at the chance to discover a whole new chapter.And don't miss &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot;, also by Engdahl.

$REVIEW.: There are so many incredible things this book has going for it. First up, it had two incredibly beautiful, likeable, strong characters. There wasn't a single thing I didn't like about them. Did they frustrate me at times? Yes! But I understood where they were coming from and their reactions were human. Second, the voice of this book is POWERFUL. You feel so much of the journey. I'm surprised I have any fingernails left because I read most of this book with my hand near my mouth. I literally feel like my own heart has been through a minefield. Third, the supporting characters were AWESOME! They added to the story rather than distracting. (I loved how the author handled David.) Fourth, Sebastian is just HOT, inside and out. His raw emotion killed me. There were so many memorable lines. (One day I'll learn how to use the highlighting feature on my device so I can include them in reviews.) And finally, Sebastian and Caroline's steadfast love...perfection. I borrowed both books in this series, but will be buying them to have in my own collection...that's how much I loved them.

$REVIEW.: Sapphire is holding a deadly secret. One that she doesn't know will claim multiple lives in a short period of time. Unbeknownst to her, her husband Zeke knows all about it. When this betrayal captures his heart in ways that he can only describe behind the malice of revenge, things start to get really thick. Lives are literally rearranged in this fast pace drama to the point where you will not want to put down this book.Wow. I love it when a book has a wow factor and that's exactly what I felt when I finished reading this book. The details were crisp, the scenes were painted vividly and I was very appreciative. I felt like I was in the room as everything was going on. I wanted to reach out to the characters and show them another way. It's crazy how one simple omission of the truth could cause a domino effect of down falls to occur. Poor Sam, I felt like he couldn't get a break! I was so disheartened at the difficult choice that he was made to make. He didn't have a way out. He didn't have an alternative. He was literally put between a rock and a hard place.I didn't really have any dislikes. There were only a handful of editing errors, not even enough worth mentioning as they didn't take care of the story at all. My eyes were too glued to the pages to be concerned with such minor details! Great job!

$review_text.: I loved reading this book, and truly enjoyed it.  Renee did an amazing job building the relationships between her characters; you are able to sense the strength in the bonds between brothers, friends and lovers alike.  The connection and instant attraction between Beaux and Lacy was instantaneously infallible, sexy and relatable for those who have met their soul mates.  And, although you only see a little bit of her, I found that my favourite character, and someone I thought was relatable to most, if not all readers, was Beaux's Mother.I also enjoyed the plot line.  It was truly suspenseful, and magnetic.  There were times, where I thought it got a bit confusing, but it didn't deter me from enjoying the book or the plot.  The unknown hardships that Lacy and her cousin Sara were in, were unpredictable, and suspenseful. Every time I thought things were settling down, and things would end happily for all parties involved, something just as suspenseful would happen, keeping me glued to the book and wanting to know more of what'll happen, and how things would get resolved.Overall, I truly enjoyed this book and recommend it for all to read!

$review_text.: This book really drills down to one of the basic skills of the "Kumon Method"...namely, sequencing.  If your student knows how to count, how to place numbers in a sequential order, then you really have laid the groundwork for a firm foundation in math.  This workbook also helps the young student to learn how numbers are oriented so that the student doesn't write numbers backwards.I honestly wish I'd used this for my 3rd grader when she was in Kindergarten or earlier, as it would have helped her transition into Kindergarten far more smoothly.  I had imagined incorrectly that Kindergarten was about learning to count to 20, like it was when my now 9th grader was in Kindergarten. That concept is a thing of the past.  Now, students are challenged to write to 100 and count forwards and backwards from 100.  And that's in Kindergarten.  Wow.  Times have sure changed in education.  Help yourself and help your child's confidence by making sure they know sequencing from the very start.  This workbook will really assist you in that task.

$REVIEW.: If you like novels about time travel - then you will love Tear in Time.Chris Petersen takes a present-day day surgeon, Dr. David Warner, and places him in the 1860's Civil War battlefield to help the elderly surgeon, who is in charge.  Dr. Moran is swamped with horrific casualties of the war and does not question the sudden appearance or the impressive, successful techniques of Dr. Warner. Working together the two surgeons prevent their patients from succumbing to infection and save more lives than would have been possible in that day and time without the expertise of the time traveler Dr. Warner.The author goes to great expense in describing the horrific battles at Antietam and Gettysburg. He even lets the time travel surgeon meet General George Armstrong Custer, General Ulysses S. Grant.Will the Dr. Warner doctor be able change the outcome of the battle and war? Will he survive his own grave wounds and be able to come back to his present year? You will have to read this intriguing novel to find out. I don't think you will be disappointed.Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of "Fighting the Devil" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder

$review_text.: If half stars were an option, I might have considered going 3 1/2 on it.  I wasn't totally feeling the 4 stars but 3 is to low.  This story continues to be very action packed.  Surprises pop up from time to time keeping the book from getting predictable. The few editing issues I saw were no big deal at all.  Some of the drama in the book seems a bit over the top though.  But for the most part the story is good and doesn't let the reader get bored.  I think any book you read, if all you are looking to do is criticize it, you will find things wrong with it.I would certainly recommend this book to anybody.  I might advise them to not sweat the little things in it but to just go with the story.  Just see what the writer is seeing as a possible outcome to a chain of events.  And then stop and think about the possibilities of it actually happening.  It might not be as far away as some might think.It's worth the read.

$review_text.: Heat Factor - scorching hotBorrow or Buy - BuySexuality - 18+Typos - very minorAlthough this story is a novella, it did not feel too short.  It was the right length to tell a compelling story of suspense and romance.We meet a ballerina who needs help from her first love, a security expert, to find out who is stalking her and might be behind a recent accident.  Mix that with the heroine's obsessed exes, sexual chemistry and the angst of first love.  Throw in a good looking policeman who's interested in more than solving the mystery and you got a story that makes for a great read.  Did I mention the hero is all alpha?I really liked that the stalker's identity was a mystery until the end.  Some romances have a very thin veneer of suspense but this one delivered.  I also liked how the "event" that separated the hero and heroine was realistic and not some silly thing just to keep them apart.  This is a well written tale that is worth the read (and a bargain at the sale price).

$REVIEW.: With every book, my respect for Beth Kephart grows. In fact, she's one of those authors that I enjoy so much I have to find the perfect time and place to read her books so that I can finish comfortably and uninterrupted. For DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS, I tucked into my childhood bed (no longer in my childhood home) and closed the door to keep my desperate-for-affection dog out of the way.In DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS, Kephart makes bold stylistic choices. It's told in close third person present. The present is a rough tense, especially when the book moves back and forth in time. The key lies in Kephart's skill. I used the words "bold" and "rough," but those don't suit DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS at all. DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS is fluid and seductive. Kephart plunges right into the action, moving between Katherine's actions during a few days at the Centennial Exhibition and her past with her dead twin Anna at will. It's slightly disorienting but absorbing. Kephart never once underestimates her audience.In the end, DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS is a short novel. But I didn't feel cheated. I just felt like my time hadn't been wasted on useless scenes or extra words. DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS feels tight. Since the reader delves into Katherine's life for a brief period only, there are open ends. But the important parts - the emotions - those climax.Historical fiction is not usually my thing, but Kephart pulled me into the world of 1876 Philadelphia. I sympathized with Katherine and Anna the same as I did with the characters of UNDERCOVER despite being so removed from their place. Much of Katherine's inner conflict stems from her feelings about Bennett, who had been Anna's secret lover.Once upon a time, my sister had a boyfriend she kept secret from our parents. Like Katherine, I knew. Like Katherine, I kept her secret, because however I felt about it, I trusted my sister. Unlike Katherine, my sister is still alive, but that doesn't mean it ended well. I felt betrayed. No one can betray like a sister.That's the force of Kephart's writing. It is what the stylized prose builds to. Her technical proficiency isn't empty, but a vehicle to deliver emotional truths. Her words have a resonance.But DANGEROUS NEIGHBORS isn't some stuffy literary work. Kephart doesn't forget the importance of entertainment. There are love stories, new friends, and - of course - danger.

$REVIEW.: Cover Art:  I hope I'm not the only one that's able to see the pyramid of Giza at twilight during a sandstorm when I squint?  Very cool!Flow:  This author has a gift for describing complex technical topics to a blended technical & non-technical audience.Gripe #1:  Malware is a catch-all term meant to describe all forms of malicious software.  Likewise, virus is a catch-all term whose definition includes worms and Trojans - but not spyware.  Viruses are fundamentally different from spyware because they're designed to propagate while causing havoc and/or destroying data.  By comparison, spyware is meant to propagate while surreptitiously transmitting stolen data/user credentials in order to monetize exploited systems/networks.  Assuming you agree with my definitions, you must agree that this book is obviously mistitled.  Single-word titles tend to set high expectations because of the absence of scope limiters. It is for that reason that I believe this book represents an epic failure to deliver.  Whether you believe the author chose the title in good faith or you believe the title was selected due to a combination of an over-sized ego and weak moral compass - that's up to you.Gripe #1a:  The author utterly failed to provide a satisfying explanation as to HOW the malware was adaptive.  The ending was preposterous and unsatisfying.Gripe #2:  The author was unsuccessful in his attempts to develop sympathetic characters. The author totally failed to provide the reader even the slimmest empathy for either antagonist.  Furthermore, the author failed to convince the reader that either of the antagonists were geniuses while also failing to describe `turning points' in their lives that would explain such zealous allegiance to each other and such a demonstrably flawed plan.  The author failed to write persuasive dialogue. I never laughed. I cannot recall a single interesting turn of phrase.I'll stop there.

$REVIEW.: I really got a lot out of this book
I'm an old Basic and C programmer, trying to get my brain around OO and Java

I have several &quot;Bible&quot; type books that attempt to cover it all, but they all seem to have too much detail on components and such and not enough help connecting the dots


I was still baffled by how you approach a java project like the one I was working on


This book put it all together for me, and gave me a good foundation on which I'm currently adding other methodologies and frameworks.I recently recommended it to a friend and, since the book is 4 years old, I figured I would find used copies fairly cheap (like less than $20)

The Amazon price is still up around 60% of the cover, and used copies are only about $5 less than that! In a day when computer books seem to go obsolete in 6 months, I'd say this is one book that holds its value.There are a lot of reviews that seem to recommend reading other books before this one

I guess it depends on the individual needs of the reader


Whenever you read it, I still recommend it


If you are struggling with just getting your Java program off the dime, this book gives you a good nudge!If you're already familiar with Java, UML, development methodologies, etc
and are just looking for some new perspective, this book probably won't add much to your knowledge base.

$review_text.: I read Club Number 5 and loved it. The cliff hanger ending lingered in my mind, so much so, that I was compelled to read the second book in Ms Louiske's Immortal Blood series, Lucas.I liked Ms Louiske's use of first person. I enjoyed her unique storytelling style where Vampires, mystery, murder and romance flowed together in such an entertaining way. When a protagonist lends their name to the book's title, the author must make sure that he/she is addictive, and that they carry the story throughout. Lucas certainly did this in spades, giving us a wonderful look inside his character and leaving me, at least, rooting for him, even though he was a , bad boy!I must confess that I rarely read books on Vampires but I will certainly be following this series, which has well and truly captured my attention.I have left out the description of the actual story in this review, for fear of spoiling it for others, but I urge you to read this series, beginning with Club Number 5. You will not be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: There's a reason that L. Ron Hubbards name on a magazine sold tremendous numbers of issues.  He delivered, again and again.  This is no exception.  A fun, exiting tale from a true master.  I love it.

$REVIEW.: &#34;Parking Lot Kings&#34; is a book whose title and cover I found intriguing. With a picture of a king's crown on the cover, it made me wonder who, or what, would be the king of a parking lot? As you can see, the cover made me curious, and drew me into the book. I really wanted to know who was ruling the parking lot. So I have the book on my Kindle and here is the opening line: &#34;By the end of the summer one of them would be dead.&#34;When I read that, I started smiling. I wanted to read the book.Two points for the author..Point 1: Who is the King of the parking lot? I have to read to find out. A great, creative visual that told a story.Point 2: A great opening line. Somebody is going to die by the time the summer is over. Can I figure out who the dead guy is going to be before the dead guy, is, a dead guy?  A great hook. I am in good hands with this author, so I invest the time to read the book. The dead guy? I didn't figure it out before it happened. That wasn't as important as the fun I had matching wits with the author. Can you figure out who is going to be the dead guy? Good luck.This author, Evan Bollinger, as you can tell by now, really knows how to construct a story that will keep you reading, looking for clues in the book, trying to answer questions you have formulated yourself, yet were suggested by his imagery.Next stop: Table of contents: What clues can I find here?1. Another Day in Paradise: Phil Collins? A perfect world? Adam gets tempted by Eve?2. A Future of Clouds: Uncertainty? Rain? Conflict? Trouble? Decisions? Opportunity?3. A Plan For the Ages: Murder? A Perfect Crime? Guaranteed, Fail-Safe-Success?By now, I'm totally into this book. It looked promising, and I have hopes of being entertained. Will the author deliver the goods? My answer: Yes. The author delivers the goods. I recommend this book for young readers, late teens and young adults. You will enjoy reading this book,.
$SUMMARY.: Who rules the parking lot?

$review_text.: If you haven't read these stories, you should


 If you have, you'll love reading them again
 Although several of his novels (especially Martians Go Home) are masterpieces, his true forte was the short and short short form


 These stories will make you laugh, moan, cry and maybe even through the book across the room groaning as you do at a very bad (or very good; what's the difference?) pun

 I loved them all and still do
 One of the few books I reread regularly especially if I feel down
 Not the Marx Brothers but the effect is the same.

$SUMMARY.: You've Got to Read These!

$REVIEW.: I read in other reviews that it has a lot of errors in the printing. This seems to be a problem endemic to basic books. However this book errors and all was really helpful in understanding the basics of Astrophysics and is good for an amateur astronomer to look at to know a little more about what is going on in the objects he or she sees through the telescope.
$review_summary.: Really helpful primer on astrophysics

$REVIEW.: It was pretty funny

It was obvious it was written by a male author because the main character, an aging male, was obsessed with sex, a detail female authors almost never include but men often do.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
