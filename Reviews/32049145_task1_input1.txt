$REVIEW.: This Thermaltake 500W power supply is robust, is reliable, and has threaded protected cables.I was able to run my AMD Phenom II 955 processor, 6870 Radeon graphics card, two hard drives, and a few LED fans smoothly.It was a plus that all of the cables were protected with mesh

Very easy to move around in my computer case.Overall, I recommend this power supply to anyone needing some extra wattage for a computer built for editing or gaming rig.

$review_text.: Western Digital *really* needs better quality control. My latest purchase, a 2TB Caviar Green, failed after just 10 months, and a previous purchase, a 1 TB Caviar Black, failed after just 3 months (though the replacement is still working). They have also shortened the warranties from 3 and 5 years to one, suggesting that they are well aware of their quality control issues. Thankfully, I have backups, which one should have regardless, but it's unsettling to need to use them so frequently.

$review_text.: I use these plugged straight to ipod with mp3 ripped at 192 - 256 rates or higher

 I listen to mostly rock & techno, along with other genres for about 2-3 hours each day.Got these at the Amazon Gold Box Deal Price, so there is no way that I'm going to be disappointed with this item, but assuming I paid its normal street price, I would consider these IEM's to be pretty good, but not special like the Shure SE530 (the SE530 present an almost emotional listenting experience, especially with good vocal tracks).The Ultimate Ears Triple.Fi 10 are very good, overall....the bass reproduction is excellent--plenty & HIGHLY detailed (better than SE530)....the soundstage is huge/the best I've heard in an IEM (so the music does NOT feel like it is contained to just the space between your ears).....detail & instrument separation is excellent

 These are sure winners if you like techno music


 I wanted to really love these IEM, but gotta say they are just plain Very Good, and is a bit short of reaching the Excellent/Special range, promised by its advertising materials & MSRP.....just nothing that special over mid-range IEM's.

$REVIEW.: I got this lens to expand my range from the canon 50mm 1.8 MK1. It's big, heavy, and as sharp as the 50mm. I really can't tell the difference between this lens at 2.8 and the 50mm at 5.6. I use a old 300d with the the crop sensor, so if there are problems on the edges, I'm missing them all. Good color, good depth. It hunts for focus here and there, but it's not really a problem unless the light is real dim. I'm impressed. Once you get used to the extra weight, you don't notice it. I just use the 50mm 1.8 if i'm shooting at night by lamp light.

$review_text.: The small size of the 9-18mm is the first striking observation when I unpacked the lens -- it's only slighty larger than the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens and much smaller (in its retracted position, it extends for use with a small slide switch on the lens barrel) than the Panasonic 14-45mm lens.  Zooming is smooth and the lens extends as it zooms but not enough to become awkward.  Image clarity and color are very good and the field of view range is excellent for wide angle work.  The lens is threaded to accept 52mm filters and does not rotate while focusing or zooming -- so a circular polarizer will remain in adjustment.A slight amount of chromatic aberation is apparent in the corners of the image but not in the central area, not objectionable to my eye and easily corrected.The 35mm equivalent 18-36mm field of view is outstanding on a Micro Four Thirds camera -- especially for such a small and lightweight lens.The chief competitor is the Panasonic 7-14mm lens, also rated highly by reviewers and offering the advantages of wider field of view (35mm equivalent 14-28mm) and some auto-correction when used on a Panasonic camera but more expensive, larger and does not accept filters.This lens is not stabilized on a Panasonic camera but is stabilized on Olympus cameras since they have camera-body stabilization -- although a wide angle lens shows little hand vibration.I would give the lens 5 stars but I'm disappointed at this price that it comes without a hood or even a soft case, items that are included on lenses like the Panasonic 14-45mm, 45mm and 45-200mm lenses.Overall, I highly recommend this lens so far based on a few days use.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent images, small, light and accepts filters

The dog ran and hid, the wife told me to stop because the pictures on the opposite wall were swinging, and I actually felt a little queasy.  If it's not tuned properly it is overpowering.  When properly tuned it gives a good bass punch.  Years ago my brother had some big Bose speakers that could easily have broken windows.  This speaker isn't that good but it does pack a powerful rumble.  My older Infinity iL100s sub doesn't have the same power but it does have better overall sound quality.

$REVIEW.: I got this cover when I ordered my HP TouchPad

 The case is lightweight but offers protection from banging the edges as you carry it
 I like how it improves your grip on the tablet so it doesn't slide out of your hand.The case folds to act as a stand for the tablet while you are watching videos,  while it is setting on your desk, or you are typing


Even with the case on you can use the camera, get to the earphone jack and the on/off button and volume buttons
 The Micro-USB jack is open at the bottom for charging.I use the HP TouchStone charging dock and it will charge the tablet through the case with no issues
 I like the integrated screen cover flap and I have had my case for 3 months


 I wish there was a way to hold the cover in place like a magnet or strap


 I deducted one star for not having a way to latch the display cover in place when closed.


$SUMMARY.: A nice cover that fits well on the HP TouchPad.

$REVIEW.: If you mount your GPS in a small car on the windshield, it blocks your view.  Most dashboard mounts that we have used, we have 4 GPS units of varying ages, will not keep the GPS in place.  We tried a friction pad with a beanbag mount with poor results. The Bracketron Friction Dash Pad finally does the job.  The only time that we have experienced a problem is when hard breaking or going around a tight corner on rough roads.  The rest of the time, the GPS stays in place.  The quality of construction of this unit is also very good.  Be sure to moisten the pad before attaching your GPS.  Also, if you are going to be away from your vehicle for long periods of time when the sun is bright, I would remove the GPS from the dash and onto the floor.  This keeps it well and out of sight of others that might like it more than you.All in all, I think that Bracketron makes a very good product.

$REVIEW.: I love this optical drive. I purchased it specifically for the HD-DVD support as I have a small collection of HD-DVD's that I do still watch, otherwise I would not have bothered. I didn't bother with the provided software due to personally not liking PowerDVD...at all. I'm using ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre which supports both HD-DVD's and Blu-Ray's with no issues. I did install the LG software for firmware updating to make sure the firmware was current, so I do recommend doing that if you pick this drive up. The only thing I haven't tested yet is if the LightScribing works at all, but I don't burn CD's often enough to actually care to.Basically, if you want HD-DVD support, this is really the only optical drive that's still readily available to buy to do HD-DVD's.

I carry a point and shoot camera in the pocket of my cargo shorts every day.  In 9 years here, I have averaged a camera a year.  I have been through most major waterproof cameras, and since we spend a lot of time on and in the water, ruggedness is critical.  I've been through Sony, Reefstar, Olympus, Pentax, and Canon cameras, and now this Nikon.It's battered, and scratched.  It's been strapped to a kite, the mast of a sailboat, and a dog.  I've been underwater with it, and literally carried it with me in a pocket along with keys, pocketknives, etc. for almost two years now.  It takes great photos, decent video, and has outstanding battery life.  If it died today, I would call it good value and buy another one.

$review_text.: UPDATE: Amazon fully refunded me the money I paid for this unit and though my experience with this model was lacking, my experience with Amazon has been exceptional. They informed me they had received the unit within 3 days and refunded me the monies owed within 5 days. Thanks Amazon.ORIGINAL REVIEW: The picture quality while watching non-3D programming either via cable, Roku 2 XS 1080P streaming (ethernet) or by PS3 Blue Ray (via high speed CL3-rated HDMI cabling) was really poor. When someone or something is moving onscreen I'm often clearly seeing distortion around that figure. I believe someone else here suggested this model is NOT running at 120Hz but rather 60Hz. Perhaps that's why I see such distortion.I could cite some positives about this model but why would anyone want to watch distorted figures moving about? This by itself makes me want to pass on this LG model and at $1000 such a serious defect is unacceptable.I kept this model for almost a full month and nothing I did improved the poor picture quality. If others don't see this distortion then they should be thankful they recieved quality units, because I most certainly did not.We also have a 26-inch LG model that has been of very good picture quality, so it would seem it just depends on the specific model sometimes.

$REVIEW.: This may be nicest backpack I have seen.  The designers have thought of everything one might need.  The main compartment has multiple removable dividers.  On the outside it looks like a square, smaller backpack but the features it offers are great; laptop sleeve, pen holders, wallet holders,  a carry handle, a hidden set of straps for using it as a backpack or pull out the handle and use it as a roller bag.  It is very obviously a quality product and to top it off, if you are caught in bad weather, it carries its own weather cover up.  I have to say if all of the Lowepro products are this good, I will be an absolute fan.  The bag is rather heavy and I think it would be better as a carry bag, or roller bag, but maybe a bit heavy for a backpack.The price is high but it does buy you top quality.  I would recommend this product.

$review_text.: The only thing I have used other then these are the Skullcandy INK'd earbuds, which recently shorted out on me and died. The Skullcandy's lasted me a good 2 years and I loved them for the price, the only thing I hated about them was they didn't label the right and left earbud, minor issue for some, but major for me!Anyway I decided to try the Sonys out and comparing them to my previous buds I personally think the INK'd sounded a little better, or maybe they were just a bit lounder.As for the on cord volume, I honestly think they are dumb and mine never gets used. another problem I have is with the 3 sized tips included the small ones are way to small for my ears the mediums fit great but fall out very often while jogging or a slight pull on the cord, and the large tips hurt my ears after a while.With all that said I do actually like these, they sound great and just have a few personal shortcomings for me.Edit: I decided to purchase the highly rated Klipsch Image S4's, even though nothing was wrong with my Sony's, I just wanted to see what these overly hyped ear buds sounded like. I was very disappointed to say the least, anyone interested in my comparison with these buds and the the Image S4's please see my review for them.In a nutshell I returned them and am keeping my Sony's.

$review_text.: First off, I'm located in Everett, WA and live in a single story house. After reading suggestions to go to Antennaweb.org, I did just that and it showed a majority of channels from 20-30 miles away. I decided to test this antenna by hooking it up to my bedroom tv (50" Samsung DLP) and simply laid the antenna on my bed pointing out the slider door & wall. I did a channel search and was impressed to find about 20-ish channels w/ about 6 of 8 bars of signal.The problem lies that this antenna is intended for my living room.My living room tv (46" Samsung LCD) is mounted on the wall with the attic space being just on the other side of the wall. After mounting this antenna and pointing it in the same direction as I did in the bedroom, I did a quick connect to the TV before mounting & running the RG6 through the wall and was very disappointed to find only 1-2 bars no matter which way I pointed. After taking it down from the attic, I literally held it in the middle of my living room and again, pointed it in the same direction (this time pointed through multiple walls, and got it up to 5 bars but only picked up some 10 channels at best. Even pointed out the window didn't help.I will be returning and trying a medium multi-directional.Updated 10.16.10After receiving my Antenna's Direct DB4 and performing the same tests as above, it was a no brainer that this is the option I should have gone with first time around. Bedroom test was about the same, but the living room test was MUCH better with around 18 channels found hand held AND 6-7 bars of signal. After mounting it in my attic as before, got full signal on all the local HD channels and found ~20 channels. I have yet to fine tune and try my motorola signal booster.Today we had clear skies but in our more typical Washington weather, I worry about degraded signal due to clouds & rain.Antennas Direct DB4 Multi-Directional HDTV AntennaMotorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier

$review_text.: I bought this to watch video from my computer on my TV. It has a PC video input and a mini jack audio input so this seemed like all I needed. The problem was that I am using a laptop and there is no "audio out" jack. Just plugging it into the headphone jack gives you analog out and the TV is expecting digital audio. So I had to go to Radio Shack and buy a couple of adapters to switch that end to RCA and hook it into my stereo. The end result is still about 5 times cheaper than buying a device that can stream Netflix and can do a lot more. I also now use the audio jack to feed my MP3 Walkman into my stereo.

$REVIEW.: IMPRESSION BASED ON EXPERIENCE:This is my second pair of Motorola 2-Way radios.  I have tried other bands like Midland and been very disappointed, but Motorola has never let me down.  I needed two extra radios for a fishing trip to Colorado so that my father, my brother, my son and I could stay in touch.  I was amazed at how good these radios did in the mountains.  At one point I was over three miles away from my father on the other side of a mountain and we could still talk clearly.  Now I know 3 miles in not as far as the 23 miles range that is claimed these radios can reach, but if you know anything about how these radios transmit, then you know that for it to transmit clearly through 3 miles of solid mountain is close to a miracle.  I have a pair of Midland G-300 Two Way Radios that claim a 10 mild range that cannot even reach 1/2 a mile through forest on straight level ground.  I was also impressed with the battery life.  Even after a long day of heavy use these units had plenty of power left.  One was left on over night after being used all day and it still had power the next day.Since I want this review to be helpful to people people wanting to buy these, I want to make something clear.  The range claim that any 2-way radio manufacturer makes, is base on optimum conditions with no structural or atmospheric interference.  In real life you can never expect to get those kinds of ranges out of any unit.  Due to the curvature of the earth I would not expect that any radio could reach farther then 10 miles under normal conditions unless each radio is located in an elevated position with a valley in between, such as on either side of the Grand Canyon.  So when you buy a 2-way radio, don't pay much attention to the range claims that are made.  Just make sure that they will do what you need them to and don't expect a miracle that deifies the laws of physics.PROS:Motorola quality, great range and battery life.CONS:None that I can find.THE BOTTOM LINE:If you are looking for a good pair of 2-way radios for hiking, camping, fishing or similar, look no farther.  If you are looking for 2-way radios for some sort of specialized professional use or something else these may or may not be what you are looking for.

$REVIEW.: I got this case to hold the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V.  I stored a few backup batteries, the camera, and a plastic bag for rain emergencies.  The shoulder strap is great and rugged.  The hand strap is also solid and reliable.  It feels really cushy, so if you dropped your camera, it might provide a bit of shock resistance.  I took it to Costa Rica and it held up during a light misting in the jungle, but I wouldn't trust it during a deluge to protect your camera.If you want something that's going to last and that's built rugged and don't mind paying a slight premium for it, then this is your camera bag.

Plugged it in, my micro SD was recognized immediately and .....
that's all you expect

The design works great too since it is difficult - or impossible - for me to plug in 2 USB devices side by side on my notebook

This design allows me to use it without having to unplug something else

Also, very reasonable price, and super fast shipping.



$SUMMARY.: Compact simple and priced right

$REVIEW.: This mouse is a great accessory for my Macbook Pro.  It works flawlessly.  As other reviewers have stated about the performance, I am in total agreement with. This is the first ergonomic mouse that I have owned.  The little button underneath the scroll wheel was a little uncomfortable to begin with but I have since gotten used to it. I am very happy with the forward and back buttons.  Great purchase.

$REVIEW.: Short Version: Works great in Macbook Pro... Tested extensively with 0 errors.  Huge usability jump for small money.Long Version:  When I bought my Macbook Pro at the Apple store late last year, they told me "8 GB is more than you'll ever need"... That was marginally true until the Adobe CS6 suite came out, ditto with Lightroom 4... I've been running just 2-3 programs and seeing around 400-500MB free out of 8GB available.  Even with apparently some memory still free, I think disk swapping was taking place as programs were taking a long time to load/close/save files/etc...  If I fired up a Virtual Machine (via Parallels), I basically had to close everything else or it would take 5+ mins to load... Even with just 2GB allocated to the VM...  I had priced 16GB modules months back and the cheapest was around $275... When I saw this module for nearly 1/3 the price, I jumped on it...  It arrived yesterday, I ran it for several hours and noticed huge speed increases with the Adobe Suite...  Also, I ran memory tests on it all night long (using the command line tool MacTest for OSX)  with no errors reported...All in all $100 to make a $2400 laptop work so much better is a good deal in my book...

 The IR mode on the S7-B only gives me five more minutes of recording capability


 I suppose if I used an IR spotlight, I'd be able to record longer, but I don't think it's legal hunting practice.The camera only runs for about 30 minutes in IR mode with the standard battery

I was kind of expecting a tripod that could be adjusted even when it was all tightened up (which I did not want to happen), but I was surprised when this little thing arrived and was able to hold its own.It is lightweight and the fasteners actually fasten securely, so you won't be accidentally adjusting it when you don't want to. And even though it is lightweight, it is incredibly stable. I have walked into it a few times, and my precious DSLR did not go tumbling--rather, the tripod just shifted along the floor.It has multiple height adjustments, and this is where my only knock is against the tripod is found--I wish it would go higher. But, that's just me being nitpicky, and overall I would highly recommend this tripod.

This cable will also let you share Internet connection with other HDMI devices without a separate ethernet cable.The braided design and shielding supposed to help reduce outside signal interference and help maintain the purity of the digital signal. Make sure Amazon send you the braided version when you order this. Also check the basic non braided version for lower price.If you are trying to use the HDMI on tight corners (or backed up to the wall), you might want to buy the HDMI cable which have pivot-head/swivel design instead of bending the  head of this cable.The packaging (with Amazon 'Frustration Free' Packaging) isn't as nice looking as many other HDMI cables but I actually like it a lot since it is so easy to open compared to the hard plastic clamshell casings that most product have which is often very hard to open (where you definitely need a scissors or box cutter to open). And especially for those of you who aren't very careful and probably have hurt yourself before (as the hard plastic are sharp once you cut them) when trying to open one of those hard plastic casing.Sidarta Tanu

$review_text.: After using this laptop for a few weeks I have decided to finally review it. Regardless of the negative parts of the laptop if you buy the base model with Dual 755 Nvidia graphic cards it's totally worth it so keep that in mind when I review the laptop. Things I did even before I turned on the laptop was install an SSD hard drive (removed the 1tb with 8gb cache hard drive they do not give you mmc ssd anymore) and  installed 16 gb of OCZ memory (removed the generic memory that came with the laptop)Overall the laptop is very nicely built. My only problem with it is that if you lean your hands on the edge of the laptop while typing the edge is somewhat sharp and bothered me a bit. I am not really sure why they did this they could have easily made is smooth.Keyboard placement and lighting is really good. I like having a 10 key on a 15 inch laptop so it's a really nice feature. Track pad outside of windows is pretty bad (while using acronis to ghost the 1tb hard drive to the SSD)  but once windows boots up it works just like any other touch pad.LCD and Sound worked great didn't have any issues with it at all. Very happy with it. Try and get the Matte LCD not Glossy if you don't want to see your reflection while playing games. I made sure I got the Matte.Wifi... Now this is where the laptop loses a star. The wifi included with the laptop is complete junk. I use a 2.4ghz mouse and it basically made the wifi null. I am not sure why they only included a 2.4ghz N wifi on this model. They could have either put a 2.4/5ghz or even a newer AC wifi card. It only costs around 20-30 dollars to replace this on your own but I left it in to review. I have an old core2duo Lenovo and even it came with a 2.4/5ghz wifi card!Another issue I have is with power mgt on this laptop. What I don't understand is this laptop is a SLI 755 when plugged into the wall which is great and works perfectly with all the game I played on it. However when it's running off battery and switches to using only the GPU on the CPU I don't understand why you only get 3 hours battery life. This slightly confuses me since your not using either 755 video card so why does it use so much juice. I assume it's just because the battery is super tiny and can't hold anymore than 3 hours worth of juice. This doesn't really lose a star since I knew about this ahead of time and I don't plan on using the laptop off the AC anyways. But if someone was buying this for school and gaming I would look at a different brand of laptop for sure.Another feature that makes me mad with Lenono itself and not the laptop is the fact that they said in the advertisements you could get an ultra bay Fan module (yes there is a fan on the video card ultra bay but since that generates a lot of heat it's mute). This was a lie. They never made it for USA customers and I have yet to even find an aftermarket one. It would have been really nice to have one since a lot of the games I play are MMO and I don't need to run SLI to play them but since I can be playing for hours at a time an extra fan built in would be nice for keeping the laptop cool. I have a cool pad for the bottom but as you know that doesn't really cool the internals of the laptop very well.So overall for the price you can't find a better laptop even if you get a cheaper dual 750 I would pick it up. Just make sure you budget to replace the Memory, Hard drive, Wifi if you really want the laptop to scream.

We got this for my wife to use with her laptop while sitting at a table, where you have a stable platform to use a mouse. The range is somewhat limited. Ours is only about 3-4 feet. Again, good enough for it's intended use. I personally couldn't use this size mouse for a full day's work as my hand would probably cramp up but for casual surfing, it's way better than the laptop's touchpad.

I was unsure about the quality due to the low cost and a few bad reviews Ive read
I was pleasantly surprised at how well it fits my MBP


After a few months of use its getting a little more &#34;stretched&#34; out at the bottom near the spacebar


Maybe due to excessive use of the spacebar? Still sits nicely on top of the keybed and it gives the keys a more &#34;rubbery&#34; feel that is nicer on the fingers

Id give it more stars if I thought it would last more than a couple of months but you get what you pay for.

 They are long enough to help with working out without the distraction of them pulling out of your ears.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Worth every penny to play a VHS tape again cleanly with no tracking issues and excellent sound.  I use this player to rip old VHS to my computer and the quality is excellent.  It was brand new in box, not a refurb so I can fully justify the price.  There are a fair amount of options to hook up with, rgb, rca, s-vid, coax.  It is plug and play with any TV really and looks surprisingly great on my plasma TV.  The DVD side also works great and upscales a tad.  It's no blu-ray but I'll definitely take it!  If you need a VHS player or a combo player in the age where they are hard to come by, this is the one!

$REVIEW.: The Tritton Switchblade wireless headset works as advertised.  It works great both with the PS3 and also with my cell phone.  It's very easy to use and setup and the charge seems to last a long time (since receiving it I've only charged it the initial time and haven't had to recharge it yet).The wireless range is excellent, with the instructions stating 30 feet although it as a test I had it out to nearly 40 feet and it was still functioning fine.  Voice communication through the headset is also very good.  The front half of the headset swings inwards towards your cheek/mouth to help cut or at least reduce ambiant noise and this works well.So operationally this is really quite a good headset.  However with headsets perhaps the number one factor has to be comfort is this is where the Tritton is let down horribly.The earpiece is too big (bith with and without the rubber cover) and the ear hook to keep it in place is terrible.  It actually pinches your ear, is not very flexable and is just clipped onto the actual headset so I wouldn't rate it's durability very well either.The recharging base is USB, therefore needs to be plugged into a computer or similar to draw power.  You can't just plug it straight into a wall socket.If Tritton fixed the problem with comfortability then this could be a very good headset, as it is you really can't wear it for long without it hurting therefore my recommendation would be to pass on this.

$REVIEW.: This is obviously not one of those high-end $100+ headsets with a really finely-balanced feel to it, and it is certainly not cordless.That being said, this unit works very well, and provides a high level of sound quality, and is reasonably comfortable in its fit.What is really surprising is the price, which is shockingly low for such a relatively good-quality headset.  I'm impressed.

Being able to position the ipad in so many ways for viewing is great, and the case offers great protection on top of the utility it offers.My only complaint is that at night I like to read in bed and it is a bit cumbersome for that so I have to pull it out of the case...however it is so easy to do I will not even knock off a star for that.

$REVIEW.: You're likely buying this to connect the mini DisplayPort (or Thunderbolt port) to a monitor with a DisplayPort. I bought this to hook up my iMac to a new 27-inch WQHD display I bought and it works like a charm.Important: Apple isn't great at supporting 3rd party displays. I, at first, thought that there was something wrong with this cable because I kept getting faint display irregularities (faint red pixels on whites). But, no issues on Bootcamp (Windows 8.1). Turns out that while I was getting 2560x1440 support, my monitor was detected as a Television, which can cause all kinds of weird issues. The resolution is to force RGB mode for your monitor, which there are sites out there that'll show you what to do. If you have issues with this cable on OS X, just confirm that your monitor is being detected as a monitor first before assuming it is bad.

$review_text.: I bought this router over 2 years ago to replace a failed WRT54G


 I chose this due to price at my local Microcenter and because I wanted something that supported wireless N and was compact


 This router is great
 It is small and can stand vertically (my setup) or flat


 I would consider myself an advanced user and although DD-WRT is fully supported on this router, I continue to use the basic firmware


 I have several ports custom mapped and use VPN to my home network, which this router supports just fine
 It also never gets very warm, even under heavy load
 On a consistent basis I have about 10-12 wired network devices plugged in via the back ports and switches, and about 2-6 wireless devices, and this thing can handle itself very well, something my WRT54G wasn't always able to do quite so well.

$REVIEW.: These walkie talkies are small and easy to carry

The range and clarity were better than what we expected


My wife walked to a nearby park (maybe half a mile) and even though there were several houses and a drop off between them, the units performed perfectly
I know they advertise 30 miles, but realistically our units probably won't be more than a mile apart
We just wanted a small device that we could use to find each other if we got separated while travelling
We didn't want to go the sim card route because the phones may become an expensive target for thieves
At home we can just use our cell phones


I figure in an emergency we could also call for help if we were hiking in a forest or other more remote area where phone reception isn't available


They are as clear as telephones for conversation but have the expected static sound when the conversation starts

One of the units is a bit louder (speaker and ring) at the lowest setting, but it is acceptable

Unfortunately we found out later that we cannot use these units overseas (Mexico and Canada are fine)
I guess in other parts of the world they use the same frequencies for their emergency services and will confiscate these if you try to bring them in
There are European versions that use different frequencies and are okay for travel in Europe, but you have to purchase those over there

So we may have to do without for now.

$review_text.: The NT600C is probably the most convenient battery pack I have ever had. By having the wall plug built-in, the battery pack is able to be kept charged anywhere- cafe, airport, bar. If there is an outlet, you are set. And with the micro cable built in, there nothing extra to have to carry or remember (assuming not using an iProduct).When you plug the NT600C into the wall, a red led comes on telling you the battery pack is charging. The blue leds come on showing how full the battery pack is.Once you plug a device in, the NT600C turns on and starts charging- no having to remember to push a power button. Another nice, convenient feature. The leds are on always and show the remain charge in the pack. This is nice to know but annoying if you charging your device overnight or in a dark room. I'd like to see a way to turn the lights off while still charging the device. To stop charging, you simply unplug the device and the unit turns off. Alternatively, you can push the button on the top to stop charging with the device is connected.The built in cable only does 500ma so my Android device would only charge at usb speeds. MY Blackberry wouldn't charge off it. If you use your own, data shorted cables though, both the usb ports are able to be used without issue (or if your phone is rooted, just use fast charge mode).Likes:A)Built in wall charger.B)Built in device charger.C)Auto on feature.D)Multiple ports with varying amps to charge multiple devices at once.Dislike:A)Blue leds are on while any device is charging. This can be very distractingB)Built in micro usb cable is just a bit short in my opinion. With devices that have charging port on bottom, it makes you bend the cable in funny angles of you want to carry them nicely in pocket while charging.C)Built in cable seems fragile (see comment above).Other:A) Seems a little "fat". Not a bad thing, just a comment. If the cable was a bit longer, this would be nice seems it could be a self for charging a phone while the pack itself charges.Overall:Highly recommend this charger. Great for anyone who uses their device a lot and is on the move. Keeps devices charged when not near an outlet but gives you the easy option to recharge pack without having to carry an extra items.

$REVIEW.: I bought this to take with me when I travel
I use the navigation ap on my phone and like to have it close to the steering wheel

I have a holder that mounts to the windshield, but the last time I rented a car, the car had a very long, sloped windshield and the windshield style holder wouldn't attach in a good spot
I ended up keeping the phone in the cup holder which was not easy to see while I was driving, or picking it up and holding it
Also not convenient or too safe.The bean bag part of this holder was a little heavy in my travel bag, but I really loved using this in the rental car

The suction part that holds the cradle really sticks to the bean bag base, in fact it is very difficult to remove it once you attach it, so I just packed around it and left it attached
The base did not slide around on the dash at all while I was driving

I had to use both hands to insert the phone; one to hold the phone in the cradle part while using the other hand to squeeze the gripper sides together, so this is not something to do while driving unless you are more dexterous than me


It fits my phone (Samsung Exhibit II) well, not covering the buttons or power port


It was also easy to adjust the angle of the cradle and base position with one hand to adjust for glare as I was driving around.

I only wish you could pinch zoom with it and something of the other newer touch features that I can do with the touch pad Windows 8 machine. Perhaps they will come out with software updates that allow me to do this. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to scroll up down left and right. Oh and also there isn't a center click, like how you could click the the scroll wheel on older ones to change angel of perspective on Google Earth etecetera. You never realize how much you use that button until you don't have one. Otherwise all in all a great mouse.(update, they did make more gestures for windows 8. I haven't incorporated into daily use yet... glad they did though)Another thing I noticed is that it does not have an alternative for the center press button which is used frequently on web pages and Google Earth for tilting the perspective. Not really a big deal though.

$review_text.: I bought this as an upgrade to my venerable Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 which I had running DD-WRT firmware


What attracted me to this Asus was a couple of main points:- Feature complete FW, meaning no need to risky DD-WRT firmware flashing- 3x3 802.11n and GbE wired networking, to help speed up access to my NASInitial setup was easy and I had my laptop connected over wireless within a couple of minutes


Some advanced settings, like PPTP VPN took a little longer, but all was pretty easy thanks to Asus' configuration GUI.The bad news, as others have found, was that within a day of setting it up I was noticing that all my wireless devices were dropping their connection randomly


This was confirmed in the router log since each device was requesting a new IP address by DHCP at the same time
Sometimes it would be every other hour and sometimes it would happen a few times within an hour.I tried fiddling with some of the wireless configurations settings to see if that would help, but no luck


Needless to say, this one is going back to Amazon and I'm hoping the replacement will be more reliable


For the moment, it's back to my Buffalo which has reliably served me for 3+ years without ever doing anything like this...

$review_text.: First the good news.  It's inexpensive.  It seems to work if you are somewhat careful.  And for those who were missing screws, I got 4 but only needed two.  I'll give you a couple :-)The bad news is that it is a very cheap piece of hardware.  It is simply a metal box with a plastic plug in each end.  On one end, the plug contains a small circuit board with the SATA/USB conversion electronics and a place to connect the disk.  This one is held in with screws.  On the other end, is another plug that is held in just by tabs that fit into holes.  However1) There is NOTHING to hold the disk other than the connector on one end.2) I'd guess that the disk end opposite the connector is supposed to be held by the plastic plug on that end, but it does not fit.  Remember those tabs that fit into holes in the case?  The block the disk from reaching the end where it (might) be held a bit more securely.3) The metal case has no insulation.  Since the disk is not being held up, it can drop onto the metal and potentially short some of the electronics.  (Maybe not...it is at an angle, but lousy design anyway).  I used it with the disk PC board facing up, so that the droop was harmless.I would return this except that it will do what I want (just using to transfer from an old disk to a new on) and it is not expensive enough to be worth the trouble.

$REVIEW.: Why do most tablet cases only support horizontal view??? I use vertical 10 to 1 to horizontal (of course I hardly ever watch movies on my Nexus 7). This case does both, thought the low tilt horizontal view is a little cheesy/flimsy, the vertical stand/position is excellent, as is the horizontal tall stand/position.I've only been using it for about 1 week, and it's starting to loosen up some (which is to be expected). If it locked on itself like the iPad Smart cover, or like this case does for Vertical position this would be a perfect 5 Star. The on/off is perfect (especially because the power button on the Nexus 7 2nd Gen 2013 is impossible to use!Great case, my favorite on any tablet so far, I highly recommend it, just have low (but functional) expectations for the lower horizontal position.

$review_text.: Noticed I didn't write mini-router, because in spite of its small size it performs as well as a regular size router, but it has many more capabilities. Some of the most important ones are the following: It's portable, and it comes with a  Lithium 2000mAh chargeable battery, it supports 3G Router Mode, WISP Client Router Mode, Wireless Router Mode, Access Point, Repeater, Bridge with Access Point and Client. It includes a 10/100 RJ45 Ethernet port, and one micro USB port, and it's compatible with iPad, iTouch, Android Phone, Kindle and the majority portable WiFi devices.It also comes with a complete command control panel or web management page that can be access with any browser by typing [...] in the address bar. It can be easy to setup by choosing Quick Setup or if one needs it, it can be set in a custom detailed way using many security features like parental control or WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK authentication, and TKIP/AES encryption security. I uploaded a screen shot of the web management page where the many options are displayed.My favorite mode is the WISP Client Router Mode because in this mode, the TL-MR3040 is wirelessly connected to the WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) or Access Point and it can share the internet to multiple users. In this instance the TL-MR3040 acts as a wireless adapter, catching the wireless WiFi signal from any Access Point and sharing it. It's my preferred method of using the TL-MR3040, mainly due to the fact that I can plug the TL-MR3040  into the Ethernet port of a laptop or a netbook, leaving the USB ports free to use with other devices while reaching the maximum speed, which in this case is up to 150Mbps - one that excels what the integrated wireless adapter in the device can provide.I got it because I wanted a router that I could use with my Virgin Mobile 3G. The service can be expensive, but at least, I always have a good connection at any time, and anywhere. I added the TL-MR3040  to my emergency kit list because it can be charged like a smartphone, using a solar system charger, or with a car battery using an inverter. This was tested in the most unexpected way after a storm, when we spent a few days without electricity and without our regular Internet connection. I already had the Virgin Mobile 3G for about a year, and it has been useful during previous storms, but during those, I also learned that having a child who is bored and wants to go online, is another issue to deal with during a power outage. So, the TL-MR3040 can be a stress suppressor by allowing to share Internet with the rest of the family at all times.Please keep in mind that like every gadget which uses a Lithium battery, you need to keep charging and discharging the TL-MR3040 battery in order to keep it alive. Using the modem while traveling and storing it after coming home until the next time you need it, might result in a dead battery. So, just use it once in a while around the house. It's a good way to share a connection with friends or family members that are visiting during the weekend, for example.

$review_text.: A cute MP3 player.  You can probably get one made by Now Evolution for cheaper, but Evolution's quality is questionable.  This one seems more durable, and music transfers are smooth if a slow over USB 1.1.  The product picture here doesn't do justice to the screen, which is actually pretty clear.  I think the sound output is pretty good.  Web support however, is not the best.

I ended up returning this because it just does not work.If you are looking to do the same, which I assume you are if you're looking at this product, here's what I did that worked:1. purchased: "3.5 MM Male to Male Audio Cable" (don't know if link will always work, but this one:[...]2. purchased a cassette player with a headphone outlet - I got the "Vextra Cassette Tape Player Recorder"[[...]3. plugged the cord into the headphone outlet of the tape player & the other end into the "line-in" jack on my computer, making sure your "recording device" is set to "line-in"4. (in Windows) turned on Sound Recorder; pressed play on the cassette player, clicked record on Sound Recorder & let it runThis easily got it into digital format & the quality was quite good.After this, I used Foobar to convert into flac format & then Audacity to edit and save separate pieces into individual MP3s.

$REVIEW.: First thing this camera did was make me aware of how much better the image quality of my DSLR is.  I haven't looked at point and shoot pictures with any kind of criticism since last Christmas, and I was originally disappointed with the quality of these pictures.  They tend to be a little noisy/fuzzy, and not necessarily "tack sharp," BUT THEY'RE FROM A POINT AND SHOOT THAT IS WATER PROOF!  I bought this camera because my hubby regularly dumps us over in the canoe on float trips and there is no rational way to excuse taking more than a grand in camera equipment down river when you know it's going into the water sooner or later.  Have already had previous issues with supposed "water tight bags," not GOING there.  So, a waterproof camera became a "must."This camera is great for fun snap shots and at fairly close range.  The zoom makes you feel like you got maybe 40 or 50 feet closer to whatever you were looking at (at least that was how it felt when I went from unzoomed to zoom from my front porch looking towards my barn and arbor - I had gotten across the front yard and was maybe ten feet from the arbor at "full zoom."  Don't expect to hear a blackbird in the tree a hundred yards away and zoom in on this thing and get a "right beside it" style picture.  Not happening, and with the IQ, you're not going to be able to crop out a really interesting bird picture, either.However, if you're canoeing, at the pool, at the beach, etc., and you want a camera that you don't have to have a heart attack about if you set it down on a beach towel and it comes in contact with sand, or if you take it into the water and some gets splashed on it (do NOT take it to a lower depth than recommended or force water at it because that will invalidate the warranty; also read and review manufacturer's instructions regarding the seals and how to clean the camera after it has been exposed to various elements), this camera is for you.  I think I will enjoy it on my next float trip, even though I'll never get the breath-taking shots I would hope for from this.  Maybe one day I'll get some of my DSLR pictures published/sold and be able to afford to look at higher resolution, better waterproof cameras (maybe pigs will fly, too, because if I got that much money I'd be investing it in an f/2.8 zoom lens), but for what I wanted it for and what its capabilities should be, it meets the test very well.  Since I wasn't bowled over and thrilled by the image quality, though, I'm just going to give it four out of five instead of five stars.Oh - on LCD shooting - the screen hasn't given me trouble in any light (unless you're in some kinds of sunglasses, then you kind of have to look underneath them).  Really it is more than bright enough for regular-style shooting.  :)

$review_text.: I always wanted one of these and the price seemed too good to be true. I thought if it didn't work I was only out a few bucks. It works great..... The only thing is, it's very directional. You have to point it straight at the camera; the signal won't bounce off the wall but that's OK with me. You have two features; the first, fires the camera instantly and the second sets the camera to fire in 3 seconds. For a cheap little add on to your camera that works great.. buy it. You'll make those Chinese happy and add to our trade deficit at the same time.

$REVIEW.: I got this card reader for use with my MacBook Pro which lives inside a Pelican briefcase.  This card reader fits perfectly in a pouch on the briefcase and what's more,  it has just two slots, CF & SD, which happens to be the only cards I'll ever need to read.  It's fast and reliable.  I originally went with a cheap multi-card reader and it worked, but it would take 45 minutes to download a 2GB CF card.  That was simply unacceptable so I went and got this.  Now my 2GB card takes less than two minutes to download.  Big difference.If you are in the market for a CF & SD card reader, this one is perfect for you... I think so anyway : )

$review_text.: I have experienced several of the issues being reported about this product on the Logitech web site: Intermittently turns itself off (using smart playlists seems to have stopped this behavior). Has caused one of my Nanos to freeze in the ON position, requiring a RESTORE to turn it off (Yes, my iPods and iTunes all have the latest upgrades). Occasionally the sound level varies for no reason. My SHUFFLE button does not seem to function, and its light does not come on when pushed. My latest problem involves plugging in the power pack and having it trip my ground fault circuit breaker. I suspect the Chinese-made power brick may be at fault for several of the reported problems. And beware...the rechargeable battery is NOT user-replaceable. The sound is pretty decent at MODEST levels (it's no boom box). The Stereo"XL" feature adds considerably to the sound quality. The remote works pretty well, but is not very intuitive. You will make a lot of errors at first. I will not trust leaving the unit plugged in when I am not present, and will not store any of my iPods on it between sessions, for fear of lock-ups or even permanent damage to the iPods. Sadly, all you ever hear from Logitech is to use the reset button on the bottom of the unit to solve your problems. It would be a great little product (and IS, if you get a good one), but it appears that some units may have defective parts and/or operational problems. Quality control is definitely an issue with this product, and IS haunting lots of consumers. Good Luck.

$review_text.: I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins. Hope you could find valuable information in my mini review.

$REVIEW.: We bought a Toshiba T115D-S1120 for our son entering middle school.  We have had it 5 months.  I passed on a notebook because I wanted a little bigger screen.  The larger screen size is definitely better.  As a PC, it generally works fine.  3 issues.  1) It overheats sometimes when it has been used for several hours and behaves erratically.  It has to cool for two hours before it can be used again.  2) The wireless drops all the time, so internet has become nearly useless.  Since my son needs to access his school almost daily, this is a real issue.  3)  I leaned towards Toshiba's disk lock feature thinking this would be valuable for rough-and-tumble boy.  But, the disk lock engages with the slightest movement, including bumping the table.  So, even when I use it carefully, it locks, and I have to click to an OK button to get it going again.  I was going to rate this a 3, but as I wrote this and recalled all our frustrations, I changed it to a 2.By the way, my daughter's ASUS notebook, which was bought at the same time, works like a charm.  It  hasn't given us even the slightest issue.  We also have had 10 different laptops over the years from 8 manufacturers, so we have a good idea what to expect from a laptop.  This one has been the most problematic.

$REVIEW.: everything works great, except two annoyances.1) I thought the remote or the sensor was broken. The remote does NOT work at all. well, it turns out the glass reflection and the cardboard border blocks the signal. The border does have a cut-out where the sensor on the frame is, but the thin layer covering it along with the glass, is enough to block the signal unless you put the remote about an inch away. I tried it without the glass, and it works OK, but then I tried it just the frame alone, and the remote works perfect as it should.2) Also, the frame it comes with looks really nice, however, it is heave, too heave for the kick stand it has. If you barely touch it, it will fall back. When I removed the frame to test the remote, it stood so much better and the frame itself sans the wooden one, actually looks pretty good.3) I know I said 2, but this one is an FYI, for the life of me I could not find a firmware update anywhere, to the point that this model is not even listed on their website. P.S. there is a WiFi setting, but don't get confused, that is only if you have the dongle.

 I have a Samsung LCD, Motorola DVR, Xbox360, JVC HTIB, and an audio switch
 After a few years of decent use, I was having a lot of issues


 I had to press the "Help" button too many times


 My wife hated the remote, I just found it a little annoying


 It was time for an upgrade
 Initially the 700 was working better then the 520

 It was rare I had to use the Help button
 But, soon after my purchase my remote kept rebooting

 I thought it was a battery issue, but after several different batteries I realized it was the remote


 Logitech customer service was very responsive


 We tried a couple of items via email, but none worked

 Eventually they sent me a new remote!!  I didnt even have to return the defective one

 The new remote did not have any issues
 Occasionally I have to use the help button, but not as often with the 520.

$review_text.: This is a review for the bottom portion of the UltraTough protector
I only applied the bottom film and not the side strips that were included.I recently purchased a new computer and wanted to protect the bottom since old laptop got so scratched up that I could no longer read the model number


I had trouble finding any protective film for the MBP and this was one of the only ones for sale on Amazon.Pros:-Fits well
It does take some massaging/stretching/tweaking to get the film to line up on the bottom since there are lots of cutouts for screws, feet, vents, etc
Just be patient and take your time.-Seems rugged
The plastic is thinker than the typical screen protector and should prove to be durable.-Nice deep, glossy appearance.-Does not interfere with the feet and does not make the bottom slippery.-Complete kit with film, liquid, cloth, instructions.Cons:-Price


If it lasts then I guess it is worth it but I feel the price is high for a cut sheet of plastic.Notes:-I used the microfiber cloth to push out air bubbles and not the included card


The cloth also helps to absorb excess liquid as it gets pushed out.-Be very careful to push liquid out away from vents

The retina MBP has open vents on each side so be careful!-The corners sometimes need a little persuasion to stick completely


Try waiting a few minutes for the liquid to dry a bit and then pressing the corners down firmly.-I applied mine before bed and let it dry overnight before turning it back on just to be safe.Overall I am pleased with the product

I do think these types of products are often overpriced but if this holds up then it will be worth it.

Even though LG is a great electronic company, the employees are nice but the wait was too long

It took about 2-3 weeks for the TV to arrive at our house and another 3 weeks to wait for the stand which was not rushed at all

It took almost a month for us to finally be able to set up the tv
Other than that, the TV works fine, here are some of my pros and cons for the TV.Pros:LED makes screen brightAppearance looks goodincludes two remote (one that looks like for kids)Has netflix and wireless readyPlenty of HDMI portsCons:Bulit in speakers not too great (i didnt expect it to be)Swivel stand only can spin about 45degree.Overall this TV is great, just make sure you have external speakers for bluray movies =)Be sure to check if they include everything they are suppose to!

$review_text.: This board has lots of memory (256K), lots of analog and digital pins, and it supports a microSD card.  No library updates were required and it works right out of the wrapper.  Only select the Uno if you are working very small projects.  Also, having more than two interrupts to play with is essential.Update:  The regulator has now gone bad.  My source was a 12V battery.  This may be one of the consequences of the board not matching all of the specs on the Arduino website.

$review_text.: Dragon touch 9.7 IPS Allwinner A10Update 2/27/13 TabletExpress complete lack of concern for their customers continues by still selling the tablet as the MID970IPS. MID9716W is the new model and there is a firmware image available for it on TabletRoms.UPDATE 2/14/2013: They are still listing this as the MID970IPS but in fact are shipping a different model with slightly different specs. The ROMS for the MID970IPS will not work on the new tablets but we have access to a new ROM on TabletRoms if anybody need one.UPDATE 1/3/2013: There a currently two custom ROMS for the Dragon Touch 9.7 . Tabletroms is the first sight with a link. They fix pretty much all the bugs that are inherent in the stock firmware including Play working correctly.I have had two of these for a couple months now putting it through it's paces before putting out a review. They retail at the $150-$170 mark. Normally I do a first impressions but one issue with the reseller made me hold back a little which I will go into at the end of the review.First the Manufacturers Specs:Operation system: Android 4.0.4 Support HD Flash 11Main IC: A10 (CPU+ GPU+ VPU) Cortex A8 1.2GScreen: 9.7 inches IPS 5 Points Capacitive Touch 16:9. 1024 * 768Storage: 16GBMemory: 1 GBStorage Extend: 128MB-32GB SD/TF SupportWifi: 802.11b/g/nCamera: Dual-Camera, 2.0Mpx Back, 0.3Mpx FrontG-Sensor: All gravity inductionUSB: Dual Min USB (this ias actually incorrect. It is dual Micro USB)Battery: 7800mAhLanguage: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese,Polish ,Russian, ChineseOnline entertainment: Support Online video, online TV, online Movie, Online Music, Online Radio.Game: 3D Game can be supported by internal 3d accelerate of hardware. There are more than 200 thousands kind of free software in google marketMusic Playing: MP3,WMA,APE,FLAC,WAV FormatVideo Playing: Formats Support: MKV(H.264 HP),AVI,RM/RMVB, MPEG-1,MPEG-2Video Output: HDMI 720P to 1080P to 2160P full HD output,and Video OutPut(AV OutPut)The tablet comes with the standard USB cable, OTG adapter, and charger. Functioning Play Store installed. Unit charges off of USB as well.Out of the box this is a nice feeling solid tablet. The screen is bright and crisp, touch is very responsive without being over sensitive. It is a very nice looking 9.7 tablet. There are some pics of the tablet and ports below.This has been a really solid tablet. WiFi is strong, battery life is about 5-6hours with WiFi on. Screen brightness is phenomenal at the low setting.Benchmarks are pretty decent. Stock CaffeineMark gives it 5700-6020 and Quadrant scores a solid 2290, which for an Allwinner A10 with no tweaks is pretty good. The system actually comes stock at 1.2GHZ as opposed to the normal 1.0GHZ that most 1.2GHZ advertised run at. o far all is stable. Have not tired overclocking yet, but I know SetCPU and OverClockWidget work on it.Movies and TV shows look awesome. Netflix works. Speaker sound is pretty good. The system seems to not like AC3 audio too much, it plays it but seems to over modulate it. But that is a complaint on a lot of 4.0.4 devices. Definitely better sound than a lot of other mid range tablets I have and have tested. Movies play great through HDMI to both my big screens.Dual Cameras. What can you say for any front facing web cam quality camera? MEH? Looks good video is fine. Now the 2MP rear facing camera. That is a little different story. This seems to be a step up from a lot of the secondary cameras on tablets. While only 2MP it takes really nice pictures, does well in low light, and has an auto focus feature. You can see the reticles finding and adjusting parts of the image when you are taking pictures. Takes very nice 720P video in good light.E-reading is really strong on this tablet, looks pretty good even in sunlight. 9.7 is, IMHO, the perfect size for comic and graphic novel reading.Overall this tablet itself is a great little tablet for the price. If saving a few bucks over the latest and greatest dual core is good for you than this is the tablet for you.But let's get to the issue I mentioned earlier. More and more tablets are being released onto the market with little to no support from the resellers or manufacturers. This used to be almost solely limited to China direct white box tablets. But lately it is becoming more common in US based sellers as well. Zeki is a good example, great tablet, zero support from the manufacturer.In the case of the DragonTouch by Tablets Express, the first unit I got had dust under the digitizer. Customer service from Tablets Express was quick to respond and I had an exchange in a little over a week, on their dime. Pretty cool. The new unit arrived, it was shipped powered on and in sleep mod. Now technically nothing wrong with that except running electronics are more susceptible to thing like moisture, shock when running. When it woke, the tablet froze. When I powered it back on nothing happened. I connected it to my PC and was able to show that the device would boot into fel mode (the hardware recovery) and the Livesuit drivers would install successfully. I contacted Tablet express to see about getting a link to firmware to flash. They wanted me to ship the tablet back to them for testing. I replied that if they gave me a link that I could test for them and save us all time and money, they again stated I could send back the tablet and if it was defective they would replace it. After several attempts to explain to them I was not just a joe schmoe user and I knew what I was doing, even going as far as to offer a non disclosure agreement, I gave in and sent the tablet back. After some more e-mails about future tablet updates a response came that "had no idea how to flash or the firmware for the tablet." Wow. But as far as replacing the tablets they are fast and courteous.This all boils down to, this is a really solid tablet. But if you like to play with and customize your Android firmware, there is currently no stock firmware image to fall back on if your should kill an install. There are scripts available that can pull the necessary files needed to build a Livesuit image to flash, but it is a tedious and not 100% guaranteed process. As with most Allwinner tablets there is not a typical recovery to boot into, but the firmware does say it will run updates from microsd so that could be a way to go.I would give this a 5 out of 5 stars if it wasn't for the firmware not being available. I would still recommend it, unless you are tinker junkie then it all depends on how you look at no established image for recover.

$REVIEW.: I really love this keyboard. I primarily use a laptop and while the keyboard on my laptop is fine, I bought a new computer cart for my home office with a slideout keyboard drawer. I was using an old PC keyboard and it was way too big and bulky. This one is perfect. It's small enough to fit on my slideout drawer WITH a mouse next to it making it easy to put papers or whatnot on the laptop keyboard so I can easily reference what I am working on. It doesn't bother me at all to not have the keypad because my laptop doesn't have one anyway...and this keyboard is SMALLER than my laptop board (or maybe it just feels like it is). It's really great for the awesome price!
$SUMMARY.: I love this keyboard!

$REVIEW.: The 35mm f/1.4 lens can pretty much be welded onto the X-Pro 1
 I also have the 18mm lens, but the 35mm is considerably better
 If the X100 had a 35mm f/1.4 I would've gotten it

 I love the "normal" 53mm-ish effective focal length.It's fairly lightweight for it's size, but it's nearly all metal construction feels very sturdy

 I like that it's lighter in weight (much like the X-Pro 1 body).Minor complaints I have are that it's Auto Focus is noticeably slower than the 18mm Lens

 The Aperture ring is looser than I'd like, but it's very smooth


 Focusing motor and aperture are fairly noisy, so it's not ideal for shooting video.Major complaint, is the poorly designed old school Leica-wannabe lens Hood

 Sure it's metal and looks kind of cool or like a crushed soda can, depending on your point of view


 But the hood is NOT reversible
 It makes it difficult to access filters when it's on, like circular polarizers

 And you need to remove the hood completely to be able to remove / add a filter

 The rubber hood cap is going to be lost soon, it comes off way too easily


 The regular center pinch lens hood cannot be removed / replaced with the stock lens hood in place either, and it has a pretty loose grip, soon to be lost as well
 The lens cap I will likely buy to replace it will be better.Hopefully a third party lens hood will be reversible and this already awesome lens will be nearly perfect.


$SUMMARY.: 35mm F1.4 Lens is Amazingly sharp wide open.  THE lens to own for the X-Pro 1

$REVIEW.: This is my first tablet and I'm really enjoying using it. However, I wonder if there is a user guide to help me with the different features that are available.  The young man at Best Buy told me there wasn't one and I just needed to play with it and figure things out on my own.  Ha, ha! Oh boy, this really won't work for me.  I'll end up just using the very basics and miss out on some neat features.Also when so much on the internet requires Adobe Flash Player and this doesn't support it, what is one to do?  Maybe I'm just doing something wrong or don't know what to download. When I go to the download site it tells me that, "This item isn't available in your country." Can someone help me? I've scoured the internet and so far can't find an answer. Some of my favorite websites require Flash Player and then have to go back to my laptop. Had I known this, I probably would have bought an ipad.

It is indespensible to riding knowing where you're going, where you've been, and everything in between.  This unit gives me more information than any monitor I've ever used. I don't really care about the ability to store my workouts on my PC; but it's a nice feature to have if you're interested in going back and looking at what you've done on the bicycle.

$review_text.: This is a terrific case for the iPad 2.I tried scores of cases at B&H;, and none came even close to this one.Pros:-Beautiful real leather, very elegant looking.-Protects iPad quite well, with velvety material on inside and hard shell on back, with leather on front and back.-Works as built-in stand, that has ***infinite-variable adjustment***. You can create practically any angle for typing and viewing.The friction-based adjustment is unique and ingenious.-Stand can be used to view iPad horizontally, or rotated for vertical viewing.Cons:-Adds a bit of weight to iPad, but there is no way around this to get the protection and functionality.-Back camera is blocked in horizontal position. One must rotate to vertical to use back camera. Why is there not a small hole in case?I have seen no other iPad case as good as this. Try it before buying any other.Addendum (12/22/11)The rubber pads on the bottom of the vertical side have come off. Macally will not send me new pads, but insists I send back the whole case for "repair", which is ridiculous, as it just needs two tiny pads stuck on. This is a design flaw, as there is more pressure put on the pads when viewing vertically. I wouldn't mind if Macally would replace the pads, but I'm not willing to send it in for this. I will look for substitute pads on my own.Other than that, the case has help up quite well and I still recommend it highly.

$review_text.: Do not be lured in by the price after rebate!  There is a reason for this price.  This router is a piece of junk.  I read previous reviews of this wireless router having rebooting problems and wireless signal degradetion, but the nice price after rebate at the time suckered me in.  The wireless signal on this router in 54G mode goes from excellent (54mps) to zero in about 2-3 minutes and then takes at least another 2-3 minutes (usually 10-15 minutes) to reestablish the wireless connection.  To make matters worse the router resets every 2-3 hours for some unknown reason.  If you own one now, check the routers logs to see the reinitialization.  I returned mine to Amazon.com.  I will give kudos to Amazon...  The router arrived within 3-4 days after ordering even with Free Super Saver Shipping.  They also credited my credit card within a week and a half of returning the router.  I now have a Linksys WRT54G and it works flawlessly.

$REVIEW.: My old DTV remote was four years old and needed replacement.  Since I've had problems with the HR21 slowing down communication with the remote, I decided to give this RF model a shot.This seems to have fixed a lot of the problems. It doesn't move at light speed, but it's twice as fast.  And I don't have to "aim" the remote anymore.  The remote still communicates with the TV via IR.  The back light is a nice touch.  And as this is a newer model, it communicates with my Blu ray as well.Essential?  No.  Very handy?  Heck yes!If you have a newer DTV model, you likely don't need a antenna.  Look on the back of your tuner to see if you have a jack for it.

$review_text.: The TRENDnet Wireless N Gaming Adapter TEW-647GA allows you to connect devices with an ethernet plug to a wireless connection on your own wireless network or wireless internet router/modem

 Typically, this is not used for laptops or desktops (for which you would use a USB or other wireless adapter that you can configure from the laptop/desktop)


 Instead it is used to connect "dumb" devices, like some game systems, other hardware, or in my case, a Yamaha CVP-509 digital piano.Because "dumb" devices don't have a way to configure a wireless connection, you first have to set up the TRENDnet Wireless N Gaming Adapter TEW-647GA on your desktop or laptop using the downloadable or CD-ROM based configurator wizard
 A warning to Windows users: when you first run the wizard, some Windows configurations will pop up a warning that asks how you would like the wizard to connect to the network


 If you do not choose the least restrictive option, you will be unable to configure the adapter

 The configurator will lead you through several steps

 After it has finished configuring the adapter, it will instruct you to unplug the adapter from the desktop or laptop and plug it into the "dumb" device

 If you were successful, your device will now be connected to the internet, so that you can download games or connect to other players online (or, so that you can download music, piano radio, or piano lessons as in my case).I had some problems in getting the configurator to work

$REVIEW.: I had some difficulties setting this up but they were resolved by carefuly following the instructions. I have successfuly used it to locate  items the house several times.  The ability to link seveal diffent things to one finder is a big benefit.  Some of the items I've linked are a remote control, a cell phone, and a camera.  I haven't yet tried it outdoors. Ido wish the sound of the alert was a bit louder.

$REVIEW.: This is a clever and fun idea, and is probably the only portable picture printing solution where you can just toss the printer in your purse or briefcase (though it is a bit heavier than its size would suggest).  The Pogo's bluetooth printing works fine (although I wish it would beep or give some other indication that it has started receiving data) -- after about 20 seconds, the actual printing begins.  The few prints I have made so far have had ehcolor balance and banding issues -- if color quality is important, this is not the right device.  However, for on-the-go fun, this little gadget works fine.The 2"x3" paper is a bit on the small side, and the adhesive backing is only moderately sticky.  The media cost is a concern -- at a dollar per sheet (for a 30 pack at Amazon), or even at 30 cents per sheet, this is much more costly than a desktop printing solution.
$SUMMARY.: 1 star for print quality, 3 for usability, 5 for gadget factor = 3 overall

$REVIEW.: The Case is to match the one I have for my Ipad 2 and IPhones, in looks alone, be a temporary option till the real one becomes available (Brand Oriented: Coach), so it is limited what I was willing to spend on it.The case is sturdy and offers a good protection for the Ipad front and back. The Leather is not REAL, it is Synthetic, means MAN MADE, but for the price, it is hard to expect anything different. but as long as it serves its purpose (protecting the IPad), no complains.I do not know if it is just mine, or it all of them, but this Unit DOES NOT Passify the IPAD when the cover is closed, meaning, SCREEN DOES NOT Turn OFF.I am aware that the rubber sealant around the corners on the Back Unit will eventually come off, and the "Leatherette" will peal off the casing itself. That happened to the case I initially had for my IPad 2, and it happened on the case I had selected for MA Hon's Ipad Mini. but as it is just a temporary case, I think I will be able to live with it.Bottom Line .... Like the Product. Can recommend it to any 1 who need an immediate and/or temporary fix (not so short lived, thou).

$review_text.: I'm not one to try to describe the illustrious sound that eminates from this speaker.  However, this speaker is quite an upgrade from my Infinity primus (valued approximatley $125-$150).  At the time I'm writing this there are 3 of these left through Amazon and Definitive Technology has discontinued them.  They are amazing.  I believe the Mythos seven is very similar but have not heard how it compares.it's almost as if my old center speaker was impeding the sound rather than doing its job.  They mythos three allows me to turn my receiver way down and still clearly hear voices and have more clarity.  Especially if you primarily use your receiver/amplifier for surround sound function you do in fact need a quality center channel speaker.  Getting one of these while they are still available would not be a bad option.I put it off because of the vast difference in price.  Didn't know if there would really be an audible difference or if I was paying for a name or &#34;technology&#34;.  I have found through trial and error you generally get what you pay for with speakers. I purchased mine on ebay used for $150 less and it did not come with the adjustable foot or mounting hardware.

$review_text.: This case is effective at protecting the Kindle from your average bumps and scrapes. There would still be a risk of crushing damage if sat on, however (the cover is somewhat flexible); and large falls could still crack the screen. But the intent of the case is to protect it from normal wear and tear, and the awake/sleep function from opening/closing the case it quite convenient. It does seem a bit pricey for what it provides in my opinion, but it does look nice, so I suppose that makes up for it.Several other reviews seem to complain about the cover slipping when trying to use it as a stand. The cover does have a rubber "foot" on it, but it seems to be most effective at smaller angles. This seems to be a matter of physics rather than a "design flaw". Just decrease the angle of the cover to be closer to the back of the device, and it works fine. This probably won't work well if setting it on a counter or table and watching while standing, unfortunately, but I believe it's design goal was to be on a surface at or just below eye-level. TL;DR: Don't expect a steep angle from using this as a stand.

It doesn't give tons of base, but the music is clear and was actually better than I expected. The cord is a bit short, but it doesn't take away from the quality of the speaker. It really does sound great for how small it is. I also liked the carrying case that it comes with. It keeps it from getting all scuffed up.

$review_text.: This player's menu allows you to divide your mp3s into several categories
The only negative is that it's tied to Rhapsody
You must &#34;rent&#34; songs from Rhapsody, which requires paying a $10.96 monthly fee, unless you acquired your mp3s from somewhere else


I didn't like the earphones which had a small nylon cover over the end, which had open metal pieces which will cut your ears if you lose the coverings,, which eliminates wearing them as you go to sleep listening to music or scriptures


I had to buy a different pair of headphones that didn't have metal at the ends

Rhapsody is a great service which you will have to subscribe to


Not all artists are on Rhapsody, some are on I-Tunes


Weigh all this before you buy.

The magnetic catch is great because it not only looks good, but presents no bothersome (noisy) Velcro closure that always get in the way; simultaneously, it ensures positive closure.  The beautiful leather case is excellent as it not only protects the reader but lays perfectly flat on any surface on which it is placed.  Some past covers I purchased would not do so and it drove me nuts!  If you have a Paperwhite, you must have this cover...it's worth every penny of the cost...you will literally love it as the quality and utility are perfect.  Amazon did good on this one!

I got this one for times when I want a small camera that fits well in my purse, and I don't need a big zoom.  Best of all, it has a viewfinder.  This was great when I was out in the sun and trying to frame a shot.  Also uses AA batteries, which is my preference.  All in all a nice camera that I will enjoy using.

$review_text.: This type of large plastic housing was poorly designed key to begin with

I have other mix electronic keys that have lasted longer and still in one piece.So, if you need to replace your Lexus Key like we did and don't want to pay those pricey dealership prices, this will sort of do it

Wht sort of? Swapping the elctronic part of the key was the easy part
However, you have to have the key &#34;re-cut&#34;
First, I found that not every place (like Home Depot) can cut this type of key
Then the places that can, well, let's just say it is still A LOT cheaper than getting one from a dealership
So please be warned, find a place that can cut a replacement first before you just buy this thinking you can swap out the metal key shaft part thingy.

$REVIEW.: I started reviewing the 650/750 models in December.  The reviews on Amazon and other sites really helped in determining which model to order.  The added features on the 750 caused me to order this model, as well as the price at the time I ordered was [...] with the NFL rebate.  Too close to the 650 model, why not order the 750!Shipping was a little quirky.  The TV was shipped to Minneapolis, which ordinarily ships from there to our house, outstate.  After a couple phone calls, I found that CEVA shipped the TV from Mpls to La Crosse.  They sub-contracted another company to ship it to our house, thus causing perhaps a day or two delay in the TV's arrival.  The guy who delivered the TV, brought it in and unpacked it carefully.  He did lift the TV onto the TV table and off he went.  TV was very cold - below zero outside, so we let the unit warm up to room temperature.  Easy setup. The remote is user friendly and I love the features on it.Picture on the TV is wonderful, vibrant colors, easy on the eyes.  You can easily adjust to your preference.The speakers do project to the back, so we attached a Bose radio to project the sound.  It is wonderful and a simple way to enhance the sound.A great purchase!

$REVIEW.: I am a big trackpad fan and love the Apple laptop trackpads on the MacBook and the Pro. The sensitivity, multi-touch, and tapping are all just right for my touch and I have a great user experience with these portables. I think Apple achieved the same feel with this magic trackpad.However the problem I have is I think lining it up with the keyboard, side by side with the same slant and such, is not the best configuration. It looks good because it lines up and has a matching batter compartment and slope, but does not give me the advantage I get from laptop trackpads.What I mean is that laptop pointing devices let you keep both hands in typing position while accessing a pointer (joystick or trackpad) with a thumb. So my preference is to take the magic trackpad and put it in front of the keyboard (reversed so the thick part is toward me) rather than beside the keyboard. This almost allows me to keep both hands in one place as I do on the laptop. But unfortunately the slope is wrong. If the trackpad were flat then I could come closer to the laptop experience.As it is the product is not bad. It's no worse than using a mouse, the usual desktop experience of moving your hand from the keyboard to use the pointing device. But in that case I prefer my magic mouse that has both the multi-touch and the mouse that I am just used to while using a desktop.I think Apple made an interesting innovation here and a very good looking product (as usual). I just give it a star short of perfect because I see it as a bit of a gimmick (against my magic mouse) and I think a little more thoughtfulness would have made something closer to the laptop trackpad experience, which I find far more convenient. Maybe in time I will get used to this new tracking device, but so far I have stuck with the magic mouse and the trackpad sits by the wayside looking petty.

The only ones these compare to are the Grado's.  Are they better...hmm...better for me at least becasue they are closed HPs, and thus better for travel and work.  I would like to think better in soundstage, and over clarity and depth that the RS1i; but I was pleased with Grado.  Was considering the top GS Grado's 'till I realized, they were open also.  The advantge of these and the Grado's is that they are 32 Ohms and tuned for portable players, even without a headphone amp.  Bottom line, I am very pleased with these, and have no regrets.  These I will wear, will not sit around unused.  I think although they are not noise cancellation, their isolation is down around 10 db, is as low as many NC HPs.  For me their Bass is more than all I want.  I cannot think of a negative!  If you buy them I am sure you will love them!

$REVIEW.: I looked through MANY similar products & read a ton of reviews before picking this case. I'm glad I researched extensively, because this case is great. The camera is NOT BLOCKED, nor any other buttons/ports. The case fits the tablet perfectly. The snap-on button that connects the main sleeve to the flap-stand makes it easy to rotate to either portrait or landscape positions. The hand strap is useful for holding the tablet in one hand & it doesn't add bulk or stick out past the case because it's recessed. The case looks good, protects, props the tablet up for easier viewing, & it's a reasonable price. It even has a place to store a stylus. There are 3 strips to hold the tablet at various angles & they work, but are a little thin; perhaps this is to ensure that the case is flatter. I'd really prefer that they were replaced with grooves instead as this would not thicken the case & would probably hold the tablet more securely. All in all, a satisfying buy.

The unit must be very fragile
As I had only had it about 5 months, I contacted TomTom about purchasing a new one at a discount or having this one repaired
They basically told me I was out of luck

That if I had cracked it in any way, even ran over it on purpose with my car, within 30 days, they would replace it, but they would not replace mine or offer me an option to even pay to repair it, since I had the unit for 5 months.They offered me a 20% coupon off a new unit on their website, but seeing as how the prices on their website are ridiculous & MUCH higher than what I paid on Amazon, I couldn't see how that would help at all
I asked them if they really wanted a customer that was offering to pay to have it fixed or replaced (and had already purchased 3 units from them) to purchase another brand unit instead, and the customer service supervisor said she was unwilling/unable to do anything to help

Garmin seems to get better reviews anyway & several units are cheaper & have more features right now on Amazon, so I guess I'll purchase one of those as a replacement.Just be warned that this unit is very fragile & that TomTom customer service could apparently care less about fixing it or replacing it, regardless of how many units you've had before
I'd recommend getting something else and told the customer service that I'd be saying that to others & their reply was basically, "Do what you have to do." The whole experience was irritating.And if that wasn't enough, it always took FOREVER for the unit to find a GPS signal

Most times I'd end up having to do a hard reset to get a signal


Do yourself a favor and get a Garmin.


$SUMMARY.: Very fragile & takes forever to acquire a GPS signal

$REVIEW.: I've had two of these filters for nearly a year now, and both are the clearest filters I've ever owned.All my previous filters (all cheap ones, so no surprise) degraded my images. Either via flaring (when near a light source) or via very slight color distortions, neither of which would show up without the filter.However, with the B+W 007M, I have been hard pressed to tell the difference between images shot with and without the filter. Which is exactly what I wanted in a filter.

I opened it, and the instructions were really easy to follow and it was really easy to apply, and apply with no air bubbles.

$review_text.: CROOKED PATH TOWARDS FINDING EAR WHATEVERS THAT WORK AS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO UNTIL THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE ALLOW US TO HAVE AN EAR WHATEVER SYSTEM THAT WORKS CORRECTLY WITH WI-FI AND OVER NOT IN THE EAR AND WITH A SYSTEM THAT WON'T BREAK UNDERNORMAL USAGE.  Sorry I didn't mean to have the caps on.  Anyway I bought these because I assumed they wouldn't fall out constantly every 10 seconds like Apple's brand.  That is not the case don't believe the instructions.  I didn't require super sound just what is needed to hear the podcaststhe people in charge give you that aren't an Ad or half of something so you have to pay for the premium version to hear the rest or whatever else that means most podcasts are worthless- you want these things to change On Demand to be most content from tv, films and games then youhave to bang the monkey and not buy until the people in charge step up to the plate and do the right thing which they can do already but choose not to.  C'mon people we landed on the moon in 69 they can do it.  Also I use walking the dog as 1 or 2 times when I can hear my podcasts andNPR is a lifesaver because they deliver full content so I can bypass most other incomplete products or people babbling about nothing when there is so much we could get in this format.  With cars I can at high volume barely hear anything.  But I can hear the cars and the construction of the rich old people's Mexicans becaues the old people spend their money on I'm told by the checkers $2000-$5000 a week on groceries and then working on their property.  Folks don't let that one happen to you.  The cost to me is that the construction drowns out the sound on these and I don't want to burn my Sure's that I had to buy because the $30 or less pairs are too breakable walking the dog- it's adding up in my current situation which should change at some unspecified date to keep buying ear systems due to the poor work of the people in charge in creating them for us.  And I don't want to reward them with my money anyway out of principle.  In an age where technology should make us less corporate like a cool version of the indie world of the 50s we are way too corporate and too restricted in quality of choose.  You know fight the power all that.  These ear piecesare just good enough to use but a let down and should fit better and provide louder sound.  What I am hearing is drowned out the second a car or construction worker is in my path.  I don't recommend these for anyone.  Find another make.

$REVIEW.: I have been using the new Galaxy Note10.1- 2014 now for about three weeks ever since I traded in my aging iOS device, an iPad 3.I am blown away by the beautiful Ultra HD display which far exceeds any clarity and color of any tablet I have seen!  Blows retina away!The S Pen let's me be "naturally" creative as I would with a pencil on paper, as it responds well and handles almost flawless to transcribe what I write as text into typed text from taking notes, to searching in the URL box, to the new ingenious Twitter application that let's me write or draw tweets! The ability to open multi windows is a great new experience from the decaying stagnant features on my old tablet. Not only can you open two apps and work between them at the same time, but you can also open two windows with the same app such as 2 websites or 2 emails... and you can even draw another window, or 2, or 3 on top of those windows to watch youtube or bring up a calculator and more!The one gripe I have is because of its advanced specs, some of the software, especially touchwiz related items, does not seem to be optimized for these higher specs and tend not to run as smoothly as they do on the S4 or Tab3. There are also some game apps that falter or slow down for some reason (like Simpson's Tapped Out) when they work fine on my other Galaxy products. I don't know if they just haven't been updated for android 4.3 which is standard on this device or if they just can't keep up with the tablet's specs. I hope Samsung releases an update to speed up these issues, and that Kit Kat 4.4 is planned for this monster of a tablet soon!I highly recommend this tablet. Samsung makes it easier to switch from other formats such as Apple's iOS to android than some of the other manufacturers that just give you vanilla android.I made the switch earlier this year when the S4 was released and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be...I did not lose functionality or choices of productive apps, but actually gained a lot more and also can customize my device to reflect my taste, not some hot shot designer in an IvEry tower telling me the way my device should look and function.  You can also expand this device's storage by an additional 64GB with a micro SD card!HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tablet for anyone who likes to be creative or productive and enjoys the freedom to have the additional input that the S Pen provides!********************NOTE: There is an UPDATE from Samsung dated November 1 that adds MULTI-USER and resolves most of the sluggishness issues.  Go to Settings/General/About Device/Software Update to get it.  Mine did not automatically update.

$review_text.: This may be user error but I'd recommend reading this anyway.I put the screen protector on with a friend. We read the instructions and everything but it was still hard to get the air bubbles out since it was for a 10 inch tablet. I was able to get the bubbles out with my sister's much smaller Kindle. Anyway, I didn't use it as directed for over 24 hours.Fast forward to 2 months later and I notice that my Nexus 10's screen is looking worn out in one spot. I thought the pixels were dying. Upon further investigation the screen protector is messed up in that area. I'm not sure if there's air in there or if I just use my tablet too much.Overall, I'd say this is a good product and I would recommend it to other if they have a smaller tablet or Kindle.

$review_text.: This seems like it would be a perfect flash for my needs, It appears to be practical and well-designed


It's hard to find a compact, lightweight flash designed for bounce usage (most small flashes only aim forward) which is exactly what I need for work.Unfortunately, the Sony website said this flash would work with my NEX-6

The web site was wrong

Or mostly wrong


This flash is designed for Sony's proprietary "Auto Lock Accessory Shoe", which is nothing like a standard camera flash shoe


But the NEX-6 has a more standard "Multi Interface Accessory Shoe"
They're completely different designs that don't come close to fitting.There is an adapter: the ADP-MAA

At least in theory..


but it seems to be sold out everywhere, including Amazon and Sony

So now I'm stuck with a camera with no useful flash

And I need a flash like this for work in one week

Great.Amazon did great by me here


Sony did the right thing in moving to a standard shoe

But Sony completely failed me with accessory compatibility


They should have made a version of this flash that works with their new cameras
Or they should have at least ensured availability of the adapter


They definitely should have provided much better info on compatibility on their web site and in their product descriptions here on Amazon.

I also didn't want to cut down longer cables and splice my own ends on because I suck at soldering.So these cables were a life saver.

$REVIEW.: Ever since Apple's Magic Mouse appeared a few years ago, I had wondered why some entrepreneurial manufacturer hadn't picked up on the idea of a low-profile quality mouse that could also be PC compatible. There have been a few, but in many cases, the emphasis has been on price and not quality.ThisLogitech Ultrathin Touch Mouse T630 for Windows 8 Touch Gesturesis up to the standards of quality that we've seen from this company before with their other mouse products. Will admit that I'm a mouse person, and only use the touchpad when no mouse is available.  This product is not a conventional mouse in the sense that we've been accustomed to, but more on that later. Have spent some weeks living with this new mouse so far, and here my highly-subjective key points found so far, followed with some expanded details.&#9670; Pros:+ Excellent manufacture quality; this mouse is certainly no toy+ Professional looking minimalist design looking; brushed metallic trim+ Small and compact; excellent size for carrying while mobile+ Internal battery powered; USB charger cable included+ Two Bluetooth channels; pairs with multiple devices+ Supports Windows 8 gestures+ Three year warranty&#9670; Cons:- Charging port is on the bottom of the mouse instead of side or end- No included carrying pouch&#9670; On the Fence: Small for larger adults hands; may take some getting used to&#9670; In Use:The packaging is impressive, and immediately one can see that this is a serious product... but for traditional mouse users, it will take some getting used to. The gesture controls from Windows 8/8.1 did not bother me, but it lacks the mouse buttons and scroll wheel to which many of us have been accustomed. The feel in use is good, but it does have a light touch.Had no trouble using this Touch Mouse T630 with either my Windows 8.1 notebook or with my Windows 7 PC, but there's a slightly different feel with each. Its compact size is a bit disarming, as at its broadest points, the T630 measures 3 inches in length, and 2 inches in width. It is a scant  inch in depth, and that tapers down towards the front end.In truth, I did not like the feel of this Touch Mouse T630 at first, and set it aside in frustration after the first few minutes. But in fairness, and feeling that this would be the trend in future mouse products, went back to it, and slowly am warming to its use.  It is still better than using the native touchpad in a notebook.&#9670; Summary:TheLogitech Ultrathin Touch Mouse T630is a well engineered product that looks and feels good. It recharges quickly, taking about a minute, which will give you power to keep going for 45 to 60 minutes. Once charged it will run for days. There's a switch on the bottom which allows you to toggle easily between your devices. My only issue is the charging port on the underside, where it might have been better on one of the ends. And though it still feels small in my hand while in use, the feel is good. It works quite well, and it's easy to see that over time the T630 will become a favorite when going mobile.11/27/2013

$review_text.: First of all this is a great hard drive, but if you spend just a few $s more you can get twice the capacity, so look for atleast a 250 GB drive.Note: If you want to skip the long review, you can go to the last paragraph of this review where I have some useful tips on how best to use your portable drive and how to keep ideal data backup.It is a given fact that any portable drive you buy in the market today is going to perform good in the short term - maybe 3 months, 6 months or even a year.But when you are buying a portable drive - you have to look beyond 3-5 years because thats how long you are probably going to keep your drive. You have to look at the reliability of the drive - to not lose any data because of hard disk failures.I have used various drives - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung .., but I can vouch for the fact that Seagate is the numero uno when it comes to drive reliability. I have had many laptop & portable drives give up on me, but Seagate has never let me down.Seagate is usually bit more expensive than others - but very reliable.About this particular drive:+ It is light weight, has a dim light indicator on one of the sides which tells that the drive is plugged in+ Neat sleek casing which makes it look good+ Thick and flexible USB cable which makes it easy to plug the drive without any fear of breaking/twiching the cable+ Very light weight drive+ Comes with the Ceedo software which will make your desktop applications portable (I have never used it myself, but there are good reviews about this software on the internet)What I do not like about the drive:- I wish if it was packed with some better backup software like SecondCopyTip #1: Backup software=======================Ok, now that you have a backup drive, how do you plan to use it to backup your data on your laptop/desktop ? I use a software called SecondCopy - which I found to be very addictive to use:- Once you have this software installed, you can select all the folders on your desktop/laptop that you want to backup and also select the destination where you want to backup- You can configure the backup profile in such a way that either automatically or manually, the software will find the differences between the 2 drives and display the differences to you and let you backup data from your laptop/desktop on to your drive.Tip #2: Secondary Backup=========================+ Now, that you have all your backup setup and you throw in your drive in your laptop bag and unfortunately you leave your laptop bag in your car and your laptop along with your backup drive is stolen, what do you do in this case where you have lost your primary data as well as your backup data - there are 2 options- Do not keep your portable drive in the same bag in which you carry your laptop, which is a bit of an inconvinience- Or, you buy another drive - you can either buy a similar drive or buy a 3.5" big hard drive(which needs external power supply) and keep it at home and keep your backups on both the portable drive as well as the big drive which you have at your home - this way even if you lose your laptop bag or even if you lose your big hard drive at home, there is another backup from which you can retrieve your dear data - your photos, your projects, your movies, music ...Tip #3: Network drive======================This is the ultimate nirvana of any drive. Basically you will have to buy a network drive device and connect this to your hard disk, once you do that and do some additional configuration, you can let your drive be available on your home network - this way, you can listen to your music/watch movies that are there on your hard disk from any computer in your home/from an Apple TV .... Or you can even leave your hard disk at home and access the data from outside of your home(from office/anywhere else there is internet). The network drive comes with its own security settings etc, so you do not have to worry about a hacker accessing your drive.

$REVIEW.: First, let me state that Anker supplied me with a sample of this product free of charge in return for my honest and fair evaluation of it.  What follows is my personal opinion and has in no way been influenced by Anker.I already have a case that I love for my iPad, but wanted a keyboard and a case that would hold both.  First, let me talk about the keyboard.  I love it!  This is the first compact BT keyboard I've owned and I find that I use it surprisingly often, much more than I anticipated.  The keyboard feels solid and well constructed as all Anker products I've owned do.  It charges via a USB cable either through a computer USB port or with a 5V AC charger.  I charged the device fully before using.  It only took about 1 1/2 hours to be fully charged and there is an indicator light that stays on during charging and goes off when charge is complete.  Other reviews state that the same light flashes when battery gets low, but I haven't been able to run it down that far since I've had it.The keyboard pairing process is extremely simple.  You just press the connect button and then the iPad gives you a code to enter on the keyboard and you're done.  The keys are a little firm for my taste but I imagine they'll wear in over time and I'd much prefer them to be a bit firm than a bit sloppy.  Keystrokes have a nice tactility and I haven't had any issues with missed strokes or sticking keys which seem to be common issues with BT and compact keyboards in general.  The keyboard is extremely thin and very light.  It works well for me on my lap or on my desk and the size makes it easy to hold with one hand and type with the other when necessary.  There is an On/Off toggle switch as well that should make the battery last for several months for the casual user.  Even for the constant user, it has a Lion battery which doesn't suffer from memory or charge fatigue issues so you can charge it as often as you like with no fear of degraded life or overcharging.Now the case... When I first unboxed the product, I was immediately pleased with the look and feel of the case.  It has a slightly textured exterior and a very attractive black finish.  The asthetics of the case are nice and the magnetic flap that folds over blends well into the case design.  The inside is a nice gray &#34;sued-type&#34; material that feels good and works well with the rubberized insert that secures the iPad to stand the device up.  The insert secures the iPad well without obscuring any portion of the screen and leaves access to all buttons and ports.  There is a round cutout in the case for the rear camera as well.Unfortunately the case has some drawbacks that, in my opinion, keep it from being a viable option for use.  First, the keyboard is secured to the case magnetically.  The problem is that it's not really secured very well at all.  The keyboard slides all over the place.  If you fold the bottom of the case over to close it, the keyboard slides all the way down and you have to re-position it to close it all the way.  If you pick up the open case, say to move across the room, without holding the keyboard, it'll slide and likely fall off completely if you're going far.  While the magnetic attachment is convenient, the design needs to be re-worked a bit to make it &#34;stick&#34; a little better.Secondly, the case doesn't have magnets to turn the iPad On/Off using the smartlock feature.  It's likely that the keyboard prevents simple implementation of this and I guess I'm spoiled, but I don't think I'll go back to a case that doesn't have that functionality.Finally, the case liner and the rubberized insert work well to hold the iPad at an angle...sorta.  The first issue I have is that when the keyboard is on the case, the iPad stands almost straight upright.  This isn't a good angle for anything.  On my lap I can't see the screen at all.  On my desk, I have to lean over to see it well.  So you have to take the keyboard off the case to use it.  You can move it partially off the case and get a good angle, but then they keyboard rocks on the case edge.  So this isn't a solution for having a good &#34;laptop&#34; type setup where the screen and keyboard are fixed together and can be easily used while sitting in a chair or laying in bed.  Removing the keyboard allows the screen to be positioned better.  But, the angles it can be stood at are severely limited because eventually the friction between the rubber and the &#34;suede&#34; is insufficient and the device slips down.  It would be nice if it had recesses under the keyboard to allow it to be positioned at shallower angles when the keyboard is removed.So, in summary,  I love this keyboard and will be using it for the foreseeable future.  However, I'll be using the case I already had and just keeping the keyboard separate.  The case tries hard, but just doesn't make the cut.  If the keyboard stayed secure and the device stood at a usable angle I'd bump it to 4 stars at this price point.  Smartlock compatibility and more versatility in the device angle when the keyboard is removed would get 5 stars.  But they keyboard alone doesn't justify the price and for me, that's the only usable thing I got.  So the keyboard alone - 5 stars.  The case alone - 2 stars.  And with the price point factored in, I think it comes out to the 3 stars I gave it.

Everyone says I sound crystal clear - and I never worry about running out of battery! My only issue is with the ear clip (the clear portion of the earpiece). It is a little hard to get on got my fingers, but I can always get it done. On the plus side - I walk 5-8 miles daily and it has never fallen off! Buy one even if you aren't going to use it most of the time. It serves as a great back-up for those times when the Bluetooth fails.

$REVIEW.: The EasyAcc 4 in 1 is a router, a battery charger, a flash drive and SD card reader, that enables wireless sharing and wireless storage.I've tried a few wireless sharing devices like this, and their most important use is to expand the storage capacity of limited storage devices like phones or tablets.Some have built in storage. This one doesn't. You have to connect memory to this, and then connect up with this via its own wifi signal, in order to get the extra storage.What this has, that many others don't, is an SD card slot, which would make it useful for photographers, who can use this on the road to upload what they've shot and share it directly with those who need to see it. It also, in addition to having a battery, has a built in charger with enough juice (8800mAh) to charge a phone a few times and a tablet maybe once.It also has an ethernet input - so that it works as a temporary router, or allows you to get the internet at the same time as you are upload your files. Of course, I'm only likely to use this much when I am on the road, and can't just plug devices into my laptop, and certainly won't have access to an ethernet cable, so I don't find that to be very useful but imagine it might be for some.The app they offer is not very intuitive, and the instructions aren't very clear. Only tech-savvy folks should bother with this. I was given this product by the manufacturer to test and try out for the purpose of a review. I was at first excited by the various possibilities - and I think that this could be just the thing for some folks, but I have to admit that this is likely to end up in my drawer of rarely-used gadgets. I've got chargers, and I've got external hard drives, including some that transmit their own wireless signal and are self-powered and that I find to be more intuitive and convenient than this one. The SD card slot could come in handy but it would be nice to have a micro SD and Compact Flash port there as well - if you really just need wireless transmission from an SD card, I'd suggestthis Wifi Sd Cardthat will transmit files without even removing it from your camera.
$SUMMARY.: A worthwhile device for expanding storage wirelessly, and more - but it's not all that intuitive

$REVIEW.: It has been many years now since I bought my DSLR. At the time I splurged on two HUGE Compact Flash cards ... ONE GIGABYTE!!! They cost a few hundred bucks back in those days, but over time it paid for itself in saved film and development costs.Still, a one gig card held so many photos that over time I got lazy about transferring them off the card, and recently on vacation in Orlando I pressed the shutter release just to see a "Memory Full" error! No problem, thought I, digging into the assigned pocket in my camera bag. Well, there was a tiny problem ... my other card was sitting at home in the memory card slot of my computer. So I hastily paged through a few dozen images with the camera's viewer and nuked some duplicate shots where I'd snapped more than one for safety.Determined that this would happen no more, I went out to buy one or more additional CF cards that evening, just to find out that it is rare to be able to find a CF card in a store anymore ... especially a "smaller size" like a 4 Gb card ... my camera is old enough that it can't address a high capacity than that. I could stick a 32 Gb card in it (and use it) but I'd only be able to save 4 Gb of photos regardless.So once I got home, I poked around on Amazon and ordered two of these. They work great, and the transfer speed (or potential speed) is greater than my older DSLR can manage anyway. The price is a no-brainer, and is less than half of what I would have paid in a store if I'd even been able to get my hands on one there. (I'd found the prices online, and drove to a Best Buy that claimed to have them in stock, only to find out that the web site was wrong once I got to the store).I've used Sandisk memory for years, and never had a problem. The original 1Gb cards that I bought at the same time as the camera years ago are still as good as new, and I've certainly had no problem with these in the time I've been using them.Highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Wow has the price of memory come down :-)

$REVIEW.: Good glass for the price. I tried it on the 70d and it gives you a very wide image. It is very soft at 3.5 but gets sharp from f5.6 - f16. I find f11 to be the best, f22 seems a little soft. I like how this version gives you light metering info on the camera. I have it canon ef 17-40 for my 5d mark ii and the rokinon 8mm on my 70d is a lot wider than that lens.I wouldn't recommend this lens to anyone who will be using it on a full frame because it won't give you a circular image. Its gives almost a half circular image. Its circular on the left and right side of the frame. The top and bottom are not circular, you just see a straight black line on the top and bottom of image. The lens is still very wide on a full frame.If you are looking to take pictures that gives you a crazy amount of distortion this is it.

$review_text.: The WRT320N router replaces my Linksys SRX400 which has sporadic wireless issues.  At first, I'm not sure this is a router issue or some PC wireless card went bad.  The wireless error counter keeps going up over time so I suspected the hardware starts to break down in less than 4 years.  As I'm more familiar with the Linksys interface, WRT320N seems to be a good choice.The router comes with v1.0.3 so I do not need to make firmware update.  I would suggest to use the cable provided by Linksys and reset your cable modem first so the setup is clean.  The router solves the sporadic problem of wireless link loss and the reception is better through the house.  WPA2 replacing insecure older WEP also works without any problem among serveral home wireless devices.  If I place the PC next to the router, you can see the wireless speed @130 Mbps.  I have used the router for 4 weeks now.  It's running great.The new router does not provide basic statistics (transmit/receive/uptime) like in SRX400 model.  I used that information to see how long the router can be used without reset - an important reliability indicator.  Why remove such function from the new router model?

Loose threads were coming out of both of the ones I bought (I bought one for a gift but even with its kitsch value decided against giving the other one as it was just too garbage-y to give except for maybe as a white elephant).  One of them also came out of the box with a stain in the &#34;fabric&#34;.The pockets it secures to the table with do not feel very sturdy and I don't really want to place my $900 tablet on the corner of a table or the arm of a couch as the promotions suggest--it's so light and unbalanced with the Styrofoam beads in it that it just feels like a ticking time-bomb of an accident waiting to happen.On the bright side, I guess the light weight makes it portable, and maybe it would be handy for travelers due to the neck pillow idea (wow lol), or for those with kids in anticipation of a road trip or long flights that lay ahead.

$review_text.: I've used this motherboard a few times now. It's hard to find anything comparable for the price. Really the perfect board for building a basic computer at a good price. Lots of great CPUs available to fit it, supports 1600MHz RAM with a simple BIOS setting change, has both a VGA and DVI graphics port, a rare feature in this price range and handy when you don't know what sort of monitor will eventually be hooked up to it. Plenty of SATA ports, including 2x SATA 6Gbps ports. It really covers all the bases for a solid budget motherboard.I like that pretty much all ASRock motherboards have built in IR headers. I've only used them once or twice when doing HTPC builds, but it is a pretty unique feature that is great when you find yourself wanting to remote control a system. IR sensors to fit the headers are inexpensive and easy to install.

$review_text.: I purchased this adapter with Motorola S305 headphone. I am using a my laptop with Wifi based internet connection.GOOD - It serves its purpose, once you connect it with your computer and switch on your bluetooth headphone, it will connect to it within seconds.When you connect this adapter to you computer, your computer will detect it as a USB headphone, therefore it will not install or need anything related with bluetooth.Your computer will directly start to send all audio data to your adapter (if it does not do that automatically, right click on the Volume control in taskbar and set USB headphone as the default playback device), this adapter will stream this audio data to your headphone.No hassle, no worries, it should work with any computer without any problem.BAD ... VERY BAD - Yes this device uses a nice concept but still not a good device, because when I connect my headphone with this adapter, it keep producing very high pitch crackle sound at some interval (you can not tolerate it, its extremely bad).In one review I saw that this adapter interferes with other wireless signals which causes this adapter to produce this sound.As a result it is useless for me because I am using WiFi connection with my laptop and as a result I can connect my headphone only by using in-built bluetooth of laptop.Although it claims to be of BlueTooth Class 1, its range of bluetooth is very limited. You can not even go from one room to other room while listening to music.However if I connect my headphone with my mobile, I can easily go to any part of my apartment without an hiccups in music. So beware, bluetooth coverage of this adapter is very low, you can just move in the same room where it is connected to PC.

$REVIEW.: Pros: First thing that did catch my eye is that this card has massive metal heatsink! Now this is something! If you familiar with latest EVGA products then you know what I am talking about
My previous EVGA 280 GTX was simply wrapped in plastic! :|Despite all other complaints about EVGA products this is indeed a serious card

I previously tried to upgrade to 570 GTX by MSI, however after two RMAs decided not to

The noise levels that 570 GTX produced made my ears bleed
Not a good experience


If you check benchmarks for both of these cards 480 GTX is almost as fast as 570 GTX, no point to pay more for less!Cons: None by far.Other thoughts:I see that some people here have problems with this card overheating and making noises
I was seriously concerned and worried about this however none of that happened and I may have solution for those who have problems


This card indeed moves a lot of air however it does not make any vacuum cleaner noises


Ultra high settings: Arma 2, Dead Island, Skyrim tested.Make sure your card is properly installed and DO NOT use plastic clips to lock the card use actual bolts instead
Use your computer case as a heatsink! On this card the part that produces most heat(processor) is located not far from where you bolt it so if you do that properly your case will take all extra heat
I took all plastic locks out and used actual bolts to fix it


Also I opened extra slot for air flow
Tada! No vacuum cleaner noises! No utilities or any other methods used to adjust fan speed


Everything works perfectly on factory settings
As a matter of fact its even more quiet than GTX 275 that I have.

$REVIEW.: I have experienced a high failure rate with some Micro-USB cables
I have not used this cable long enough to make an unreserved recommendation
I will say that it has the look and feel of a quality cable and I have high expectations


For now, I give it five stars-if it fails, I'll be back


One very positive thing I can say is that shortly after receiving my order, I received an email from Metabridge Products thanking me for my business and listing the support options available to me

This is impressive and I feel confident that any problem I have with their products will be quickly resolved

This is the kind of company I want to do business with and, in the future, I'll look for their products first.

$REVIEW.: I love my Ipad, but I have only been using it for movies and games because I find it cumbersome to try and type with the touchpad keyboard. I went ahead and got a laptop for surfing the internet and typing documents just because it was so much easier to use. I have seen bluetooth keyboards, but not one that looked very convenient to me.I was excited to try the Belkin YourType folio case with keyboard to see if it would make using the Ipad much easier. I was thrilled at how easy it was to set it up with my Ipad, and it has a nice protective cover. The cover can be manipulated to allow you to set the Ipad upright while you type with the keyboard. It works just as well as my small laptop! The keys are nicely spaced and easy to type "normally" with.This case with keyboard and brought my Ipad to life! There are special short cut keys on the top of the keyboard so that you can bring up music, photos, and other applications easily with just one keystroke.A must for getting full use of you Ipad!

$REVIEW.: OK I agree with most of these reviews
Its fast, light and aesthetically it looks good
But, like many others, I'm sending mine back due to light bleed

 Lots of it!  If the new one is good (amazon is overnighting it to me) then I will definitely be keeping it and getting rid of my Galaxy Tab 7.7 (great tablet but I wanted a bigger screen and Samsung is too slow in upgrading the O/S).Couple of things worth knowing if you are buying this tablet...- you must format your external SD card as exFAT if you want full write access with 3rd party apps


Thanks to another reviewer for this tip.- battery life is OK, not great
People are claiming 6 - 8 hours depending on use, I'd say that's about right.- external speaker is good, when enhancements are turned on, but not great

 Does the trick for watching vids online but not ideal for enjoying music.Overall as long as I can get one with no (or minimal) light bleed, I will be happy with this tablet.*** update 23-May *****Got replacement tablet from Amazon

 Less light bleed but still there

 It honestly isn't a huge thing but for this kind of money I may give up on it and get the new ASUS or ACER that are coming out in June


 Not sure yet...*** update July 14 ***I returned the 2nd Toshiba and ended up getting a third


I ended up getting the 16gb version, still has some light bleed but nothing major
After checking out the new ACER and it's overheating issue and deciding I didn't want to wait for the new ASUS tf700 (or pay for it)  it came down to Toshiba or the new Google tablet but I didn't want to lose out on expandable storage

 I would have gotten the Toshiba 7.7 (I love the screen)  but the price is ridiculous

In the end, for the price I happy with the Toshiba.

$review_text.: I love this device.  I've taken it with me to provide music in hotel rooms, and most recently, outdoor music festivals.  The sound quality is amazing for such a portable device.  I always have people asking me where I got it.  It's very durable and mine has been through a lot without any sign of degradation.  I've dropped it off tables, had things spilled on it, and all kinds of other abuse.  The speaker grills are a little dented from a drop off table, but the speakers are far enough from the grills that they're well protected.  The buttons are all water resistant, so spills and light rain or splashes is no problem.  I've taken it to Bonnaroo 2 years in a row for music at our camp site and most recently Electric Forest festival in Rothbury, MI.  There are only 2 things wrong with this device, and they are only issues because it was created before the iPhone 4.  The iPhone 4 doesn't fit in the pull out door.  It will still play music, but you have to leave the door open.  All iPod touches fit perfectly though.  A minor inconvenience that doesn't affect music playback.  The other issue is that it won't charge an iPod touch or iPhone.  This isn't as much of an inconvenience to me, because I'm normally using the unit with batteries and it doesn't charge when using batteries anyway.  All in all, if mine died today, I would have to pick up a new one because I don't think there is anything even close with the sound quality and portability on the market.

$REVIEW.: After purchasing my iPad 3 six months ago, I decided to also purchase the Smart Cover in blue leather to go with it. A short time later,  I purchased a thin back case made by Belkin to protect the case from from scratches..  This combination looked and felt great. The dark blue top cover with the transluscent shell on the backside.What made me change my iPad case the first time, is when I dropped the iPad about 3 feet.  I was fortunate that the fall was onto soft carpet, and the iPad survived just fine, but the Belkin case snapped off and was loose after this.  If the fall had been onto concrete, I doubt the thin Belkin shell would have protected the iPad from damage.  It!s designed for scratch protection, but not falls.I next purchased the Griffin Survivor which gave the iPad great protection.  The biggest problem with the Survivor is that it was bulky, heavy, and access to iPad features like the camera are covered with a rubber flap.  Every time I took a photo, I needed to lift the flap and hold it in position with my finger.  The rubber stays to hold the flaps open, did not work well at all.  Since I don't use my iPad in severe conditions like hurricanes and dust storms, I retired the Survivor and returned to my original set up.  The blue leather Smart Cover and the thin Belkin back shield.I began reading other people's reviews on cases and watching reviews on You Tube.  I was looking for a case that had the following features:  well made, a professional look, a stable stand, easy to use, light weight, unobstructed openings, and capable of taking a moderate fall onto concrete without damage to the iPad.Eureka. I finally found what I was looking for. The Ridge by Devicewear.  The Vegan leather feels similar to my iPad leather Smart Cover and is even the same dark blue color that I like.  The fit of the case is perfect and the thickness of the shell is at least double that of the Belkin.  It looks like it would protect the iPad from a moderate fall onto a hard surface.  The overall look of the case is professional.  Slim, lightweight, and appearing much more expensive than it actually was.  The openings are unobstructed so taking a photo is easy.  Also the Ridge system works great.  All the viewing angles are very stable, in sharp contrast to what I was accustomed to with the unstability of Apple Smart Cover set-upAlso the touch of the inner portion of the Devicewear cover feels like rich velvet and I actually prefer the feel of this cover to the inner portion of the Apple Smart Cover.  When you close both covers, a magnet turns off the iPad.  Both the Devicewear and Apple cover work the same in this regard.  They both work very well.Since nothing is perfect, I worked diligently to find fault with this product.  The only two things I could come up with were minor.  My dock speaker can't be used with the Ridge cover on and I wish the opening for the on/off button were a bit larger.  Maybe a holder for a stylus would be nice, but since I infrequently use a stylus, I didn't find this to be a drawback. Also, I only stand my iPad in landscape mode and have no use for it to stand in vertical mode.  I also don't like the style of the multiple viewing cases.All in all, this is a great iPad case at a very reasonable price.  The first day I brought my Ridge iPad case to work, a colleague liked mine so much, that he ordered one in black for his iPad.  Hats off to Devicewear for developing an excellent product at a very reasonable price.  This case is worth every cent, and then some.
$review_summary.: After two cases and $130 spent, I found the perfect case for about $33.

$review_text.: Remember when jean notebooks and marbled notebooks were all the rage in the good old 80's in elementary school or middle school? Well, I  thought this case for the Kindle Fire was pretty cool so I decided to try it out.  I will say that for the list price it is a tad to expensive. It is very light weight and supposed to be a cover for your kindle. However, there is no latch or locking component for example, if you do not want someone snooping in your kindle. For that kind of money this feature would have been a plus. As a security measure it can be a deterrent in it of itself because most people would think you have a notebook in your desk or bag and might not swipe it.  Again, it is not bulky, light enough to not be cumbersome and aesthetically pleasing {at least for us kids that grew up in the 80's ;) }
$SUMMARY.: Throwback to the 80's!

$REVIEW.: I have this ancient Compaq PC laptop that was not bad for the portability it gave me for almost 7 years.It was good for surfing the web, word processing, email, youtube, music and ebooks until the day arrived when Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows XP.I used the laptop at Starbucks, on weekend getaways, vacation and in other portable situations and it was a nice supplement to my Mac Mini which is my go to computer.As Windows XP became a web surfing security liability I decided to move on to a tablet...one that I would use mainly as an ereader, surfing, etc..Yeah I checked out the Nexus 7 at 199.00 and the Nexus 7 2013 model at 229.00 and even the Nexus 10 at 399.00.  Fine tablets but I just felt for the money....149 bucks at Walmart...the Nook  was a very sweet deal.  Besides with a 2 year warranty at just 15 bucks tacked on it would be replaced  even if I dropped it and cracked the screen.I like it's size.  I don't know that Goldilocks out of the three tablet sizes 7, 9 or 10 inch would have chosen the 9inch Nook HD+ but I found it to be just right.  Not too small. Not too big...but very easy to hold in my hands.. not  heavy at all with a solid feel to its construction. Handles quite comfortably for extended periods of time while  ebook reading.CONS:No camera(s).  If you want a tablet with  a camera or two...then you'll  want to pass on this puppy.  Myself I have a  nice, little , 12 pixel Canon that I call upon for picture taking. So this is a non issue for me.No further (at least at this point) Android updates.  But, what the heck, I can live with Ice Cream Sandwich for another say 3 to 6 years. I use it primarily for ereading and I don't know how you can improve on the superb technology that exists on this Nook HD+ for enjoying ebooks anyway.Trying to think what else is negative about the tablet...no ....I guess that's it.PROS:Price; Like I said before ...one heck of a lot of tablet  IMHO a lot of bang for the buck.A Plus for book lovers: If you are into books and magazines you have the best of both worlds on this Nook ...Amazon and Nook.Google Play.  Thousands of applications.  I find the downloading of apps faster and more user friendly than the Itunes experience on my Itouch. (although I highly value the Itouch too).The Nook Community:  Take your Nook to a Barnes and Noble and while sipping an SBucks latte you get a free hour to download and read any book you wish.Then there are those marvelous Free Fridays.  Oh yeah!  On Fridays you can download a B&N; featured book and an app absolutely free. (ya don't have to be at a B&N;)And there is a very nice  B&N; Nook forum...with everything from book reviews to technical support.  Lots of Nook owners out there.And what's wrong with a brick and mortar store where, if your Nook acts up, you can present it to a living, breathing technician.Google Chrome: its comes with your Nook.And I really like Magazine Play...where you can browse any  magazine  and in the Nook's dazzling. high resolution, 9inch color getting  an overview of the cover and  two or three opening pages of featured articles.Speed in surfing the web.Good battery life.Movies in beautifully, detailed high resolution.I understand one can root this Nook with that CyogenMod 10 thing from XDA Developers. If you undertake this proceedure, as a lot of Nook HD+ owners have done, you get a more powerful and versatile Android Tablet with Jelly Bean 4.2 but I am  afraid I came down with a case of white knuckles and sweaty palms after looking at the technical hoops one must jump through to make that happen.  At the moment I would qualify more as a fraidy cat than a geek regarding the possibility of rooting my Nook.  But I may just gather all my courage and take a crack at it.  If I am successful I will update this review. On second thought I really like the tablet as is...but...it would be nice to root it so I'll see what happens.I could go on with more of what I like about the tablet.So I'll just say if you want a very nice 9inch tablet at a very affordable price the Nook HD+ gives you excellent value. Also would make a fine gift.UPDATE  2/10/14 :  I surprised myself and did root my Nook HD+ and am glad I did.  As I am no geek I watched the YouTube Nook Hd demonstration of how to root the tablet by Jonathan Yang several times before I got up the nerve to do it and it was pretty straightforward and rather painless.  I like Johathon's demo because he takes his time and I did appreciate his keeping beginners like me in mind.The other thing is I have no idea how this review is under a  "certified Pre-Owned  Barnes & Noble Nook HD+" as it was purchased new.

I tried it out and the sound quality was pretty good
I used it mainly to listen to podcasts
There is a feature to save your spot when you stop driving but it was too hard to use

I tried to save it but it wouldn't many times
So it go frustrating to try and fast forward every time I wanted to continue that podcast

$REVIEW.: Excellent bag, Best Buy had this same bag for $79.00 so this is an excellent deal. One serious complaint, this bag is designed for a midget. The shoulder straps are literally the size that would be used for a toddler. I am 6'2&#34; and cannot wear this bag. If you are 36&#34; tall and weigh 50 - 80 pounds this bag will work nice. If you own a DSLR with telephoto lenses you are probably not in the 1st grade. If you are a first grader going on a field trip to the zoo this is great, if you are an adult and you don't work in a chocolate factory singing songs all day this bag will not fit.

$review_text.: i've had this anker battery pack for over six months now, and it still gets used every day. i use it to charge my and my wife's gs3 phones and my android tablet, when it's not as convenient to be attached to a wall charger. i also use this when traveling, and it will keep my phone going all day long when i'm using gps to navigate or play ingress. it's light enough that you can carry it along with your phone or stuff the whole mess into a jacket pocket.the additional tips make it versatile for charging non-phone devices as well. i can power a musiclites transmitter with this, a raspberry pi, a charging dock for handheld radios, and several other devices with ease. also, i have not noticed any drop in capacity over the 6 months i've been using it.my only complaint is that the anker charges devices more slowly than i had hoped. while plugged in and playing candy crush on my gs3, the phone's battery level still decreases (but at a much slower rate). if i'm using my phone for web browsing or using social apps, the anker will keep the phone's battery charge at a sustained level, but will not help increase the phone's charge. it will take around 3-4 hours to get a full charge on my phone, compared to about 90 minutes when charging it off the wall plug. i have other backup batteries that charge devices almost twice as fast as this anker.nonetheless, this battery is still a must-have. i can get nearly four full charges on my gs3, from a battery that's only slightly larger than a gs3. nice work!

$REVIEW.: OK, so I buy a good bunch of books but it's really great to have a Kindle.  I like to read in bed and one advantage I have found in having a Kindle over a regular book is that I can lie on my back and read the Kindle.  Since it is back-lit, I can read without having to worry about having enough light to read.  Lying on your back and reading a book normally poses challenges since the book is normally between you and the light.I have also found that books are less expensive when I buy them on the Kindle rather than in the store.  I haven't watched any movies on the Kindle yet but I have listened to some music.  I even got an awesome case for it after a good deal of research.  I found the normal 7&#34; screen is just fine over the larger 8.9&#34; screen.  If you decide on purchasing the Kindle, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do or even more.  I am certainly reading a lot more since I got it.  It is just so convenient.  All the best!

$review_text.: I had an old monster cable ir remote and it was getting a little touchy
 We have a harmony 1 in the bedroom so I thought it was time to upgrade the family room remote

 I'm a little lost of some of the complaints about bad IR, etc

 All my components are behind a wood cabinet on two shelves and I didn't even need the extender

 One thing if you have had previous harmony's, it used to populate the touch screen with commonly used functions like EJECT for your dvd player, etc


 It would seem that you have to now select what you want to show on the touch screen for each activity


 Pretty cool actually, but had to re-program because I did not know this up front.One issue as another reviewer has said, this is not a MAC friendly device

 I do not know if this is a MAC issue or harmony as my harmony 1 worked fine on the MAC

 Luckily I have VMWare and windows on the mac so was able to program.I love the harmony 1 and this harmony 900
 They are not perfect, but to get the functionality and the ability to program it yourself, I can think of no other product that is comparable

 If you want to spend $800 plus for a remote and then pay someone else to program it the Pronto I'm sure is a stellar product


 This was much easier to set up than my old monster IR remote.

$REVIEW.: My previous SIII got dropped and broke the screen


When I got a replacement I bought this and I've dropped it multiple times (sometimes from the nether reaches of space) and it just bounces and the phone is fine


it does add some girth but that's to be expected for the level of protection
All of the holes and buttons are in the right place
It rarely comes off unless I do something to make it come off
It also has a good feel, making it easy to hold


When wearing jeans that rubberized coating does make it hard to take out of pocket but I think that's fine for making the grip about perfect


One thing I'll say is that I got a black one for my wife's phone and a blue one for my phone, thinking they would be easy to tell apart if we had them next to each other...
well, unless you are in direct sunlight the difference between the black case and blue case is practically zero
I routinely pick up my wife's phone..

but I guess that means I should have gotten her the white case.

$REVIEW.: I got a good laugh when I tried for the 11th time to pair my new MOTOACTV to my Android phone and the screen showed me the message "server not available, try later." I laughed because if you don't login onto the Motorola's website then you cannot use half of the functions advertised, that was the last straw. I know, it doesn't make sense, then again, there is much that doesn't make sense about this trinket. It appears to do everything but in reality it does very little indeed.Do yourself a favor and read the real-life horror stories from pitiful marathoners who lost all or part of their tracking info because the device either failed or ran out of batteries in the middle of a race and that is partially Motorola's fault for claiming the battery last twice as much as it really does. How silly to expect that sports fans who are obsessed with time would not notice.The truth is that it takes unnecessarily complex maneuvers to setup, pair, transfer, charge, recharge, restart, reconnect, only to have the device die before you finish your workout.In the end, you can't even use it as a watch because who would want to wear a watch that needs to be recharged twice as week?There is a much better alternative to buying a MOTOACTV: buy a used Android phone, the one with the longest battery life and GPS built in. It does not need to be linked to Verizon or any provider, just the phone alone is probably $40-$80. Use that instead to track your exercise. It is cheaper, it has a bigger screen, it does more and it does it more efficiently. Also you can buy spare batteries for the phone, you cannot buy spare batteries for the MOTOACTV. Just my two cents.

$review_text.: When I went looking for a cover for my new Kindle 4, I had three objectives: maximal protection, minimal bulk, and quality construction

This cover meets all three objectives
Initially, I looked for a Spark FitFolio like I have for my Kindle 3, but it appears that they are not yet made for the Kindle 4
After looking over dozens of covers in several stores, I chose this Belkin in black


The stores also had an attractive pinkinsh red version, but being a guy...well, you know
While I'm not a big fan of strap retainers, these are well made
They are flexible enough to fit the Kindle into place fairly easily, but not so elastic that they allow the device to move around
There are also leather segments over the centers of the straps that act as spacers when the cover is closed, keeping the cover off the face of the Kindle

As others have mentioned, if you fold the magnetic closure strap back, then the front cover, the magnet will hold the cover back very securely
I've been using this cover for just a couple of weeks now, and am completely satisfied with it's quaility and convenience

It is attractive, well made, and well designed protection for the Kindle 4.

$REVIEW.: This camera shoots great quality video but the one caveat is the battery life.  It lasts at most 1hr of video shooting despite saying 1hr 46mins on the display itself.  There have also been times when the battery has been drained while the device itself is turned off.  However, that may just be the fact that I had it stored near a speaker and the magnetic field drained it over time.  If you want to buy this camera you will need to buy another battery Panasonic VW-VBK360 Li-Ion Battery Pack for sale on amazon if you plan to shoot video for a long time.  No complaints other than thatThe camera is very quiet and operates efficiently.

$REVIEW.: (update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.

The battery which I received simply did not fit properly

Whereas the Dell 9-cell battery comes off easily, this battery was really difficult to take off and put on
(the times I could jam it on)I was not comfortable with the fit of battery and the difficulty of putting it on and removing it


I also noticed that some of the areas of the battery were covered by cheap stickers which imitated the material of the OEM Dell battery, I think these stickers contributed to some of the problems since some were not aligned properly

If you peel back one of the stickers, you can even see into the internal battery pack.I know that you get what you pay for, but this battery was much too low quality and I am sending it back.

$REVIEW.: About two years ago I bought a cheap ($40) Apex DVD player, because my RCA died


 I didn't want to research which was the best at that time, I just wanted something cheap that would last a little while

 What a mistake!!!  That DVD player was the worst I've ever seen!  I'm surprised my discs don't have laser scratches.So, after looking around on Amazon for a while, I found this Sony
 I read through all the reviews about people saying it doesn't do this or that, so I didn't know what it would be like

 Despite some bad reviews, I know I can trust the Sony name, so I bought it
 I'm glad I did!  I've been very satisfied with my purchase!If you're looking for a DVD player with all the bells and whistles, then you should be prepared to pay over $300

 However, if you want a reliable DVD player that will play all your movies and some MP3 discs at a reasonable price, this is the player for you!Sony backs their products, and quite frankly, they don't sell crap!  So, if you're in the market for a new DVD player, spend the $70 and get yourself something that will last years instead of a year or less
 You won't be disappointed!

The same design barring minor changes like color and texture.The inclusion of the DTS down-mixing and network connectivity in the LIVE is certainly welcome. The Wi Fi connectivity is a definite plus but had to purchase a wireless adapter.Since I make DVD archives, the VOB support has proved beneficial for me. The preview mode, while watching movies, is very useful should I need to pause for a few minutes to concentrate on other work. But I never had an opportunity to use it because the video streaming is awkward. It drops frequently for no apparent reason. Learnt later that this happens when the network is shared.One plus is that it has the Unicode and supports the subtitles in non-western languages too.

$REVIEW.: This is actually a rebranded Sunpak flash model, refitted with the proprietary Fuji hotshoe

I'm using it with a Fuji HS20 camera - one thing you should know, the flash's own focus assist light will not work with this particular camera (evidently the HS20 doesn't have the wiring to make that happen - no big deal since the HS20 has its OWN focus-assist light built-in)


So if you purchase this flash unit and the light that's buried behind that red plastic front cover doesn't come on - it's okay, the flash isn't broken


The manual from Fuji specifically states that this function isnt going to work with all cameras
I've only had the unit for a week and have been very pleased with it thus far

I have NOT been able to find any written details as to this model's shutter sync speed - thus far, I've used the flash in TTL mode and at 1/30 shutter it's great

I've seen some forums where this flash is apparently able to sync with some of the Fuji line up to 1/2000.All in all, it's going to be a great addition to the HS20 - it's a bit pricey for what it is but I'm quite glad I've purchased it.

It's nearly impossible to imagine using the Paperwhite without it. If I can (I need to check) I'll get another in white. Black gets hot in the sun, which is where the Paperwhite shines. But that is not a design flaw, just an error in judgment on my part.

$review_text.: Just set my DUET ups that i bought at B*** B** ( bought before i saw it on  here)!Unlike other reviews i can honestly say i have had NO TROUBLE hooking this up or with Squeezenetwork SO FAR !I hooked it up to my PIONEER ELITE 92THX using an optical cable and set it up to my wireless network - have not had a single drop yet or low buffer from the stations i have tried at this point.My only issue so far since using this is - depending on the station you tune to i have seen anything from 128/kbs to as low as 26/kbs. i know this depends on the broadcasting station but the lower bit rates sound horribleIF YOU ARE AN AUDIOPHILE - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS !

$review_text.: Someone told me the sound quality of Sennheiser headphones would compare to the $40 Sony in-ear buds I used to get at Target... it does not, sound isn't very deep, lacks bass.However I thought these would be good for running and jogging since the wrap around style wouldn't fall off my head. That is the only good thing about these.The past few weeks the sound controls have been acting up with the volume randomly spiking then becoming whisper quiet as I am walking. No visible damage to the wires. Too annoying to use them now, so I've chucked them in the bin.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera as replacement for an older Logitech model, and I use it mainly for video calls via Skype. I selected the QuickCam Orbit AF because I wanted the best possible picture quality and I thought it was cool to place the camera at some distance from my computer and control its pointing direction by mouseclicks. This works as well as expected. Also the automatic face tracking works to some extent, but don't expect too much. The camera will not follow your face very smoothly, and it will sometimes decide to pan into a direction where it doesn't see any face or moving object anymore. If the auto zoom is on, it will then zoom out, try to find you again and zoom back in. From a technical point of view this behavior is clearly suboptimal, but it can actually add entertaining elements to a video chat. I like it! If you find all the automatic panning and zooming annoying, you can always switch to manual mode and control the camera by hand through the graphical user interface. The picture quality - focus, exposure, colors - has always been good on my own screen as well as on the other side, but I haven't tested it under low-light conditions so far. Also the built-in microphone has not been tested because I am using a headset. Anyway, I think this is a quite good camera with nice-to-have remote-control and auto-tracking features for an acceptable price. I recommend it to anyone who wants a little more than conventional video calls with stationary face close-ups.

$review_text.: First of all, I have to say "no" to those 2 people who rated 1 star, I read almost every single review before i purchase this monitor (27 inch), I was about to connect both my PC and XBOX on to this computer, so after i read 1 of the 1 star review which stating that have major problem for switching, i was hesitating,but after readingr some 5 stars review, i made a great decision. I picked 1 day shipping, the monitor arrives with it's factory box, and after all the accessories, the monitor really impress me, a 27 in monitor is HUGH (i realized that after i get it) The quality of the monitor has no problem, sharp and sleek, not cheap.i have 0 problem switching input sources, the colors are RICH, feel DEEP, qualities are AMAZING. fantastic product with an extremely reasonable price,i believe there's an Asus VH something that's 27 in too on the market, i heard it has ghosting, and it doesn't look as good as this one, there's no dead pixel at all, this monitor worth 5 stars!STRONGLY RECOMMEND!

$review_text.: This item reduces the source-switch to a "least necessary to get the job done" paradigm


It's a very light, all-plastic-but the contacts device that has the necessary hardware (connectors and a patch cord) to "get 'er done."  As such, it delivers


 But if I could offer a suggestion to the builder of these, I'd prefer the switch detents be more solid and reliable
When you slide the selector switch from one source to the next, sometimes it's hard to detect whether you actually have the switch mating with its internal contacts, or whether you're off just a bit--which results in no sound or video being passed through
Sometimes I have to fiddle with the slider to get the switch contacts to mate up.However not all of my "3-way Audio Video AV RCA Switch Selector Box Splitter 





" devices perform the same--I have one of these in a another room that works better, with more positive "clicks" as you set each source, and which rarely fails to pass through the program signal.So I'd guess that these are just inexpensively built and are consequently imprecise due to the materials used in their construction.Overall I like the product--they are inexpensive, and that's usually good--yet they perform inconsistently from one unit to the next
Nevertheless they get the job done at a far better price than many competing items.If your application is "mission-critical" skip these
But if you want to select which coaxial spdif goes to your receiver, this is good enough to get it done.



$SUMMARY.: Good enough to get 'er done in non-critical applicatons--but get something else if you need absolute, consistent reliability.

$REVIEW.: We bought these a few years ago and loved the 5.1 sound for movies. We use an inexpensive Sony receiver in the living room.Then we moved and had a baby - thus had to step down to a 2.1 system. 6 speakers+baby = nope.This left two of the satellite speakers to be placed in a drawer to be used again someday, maybe...Recently found a use for the two leftover speakers in the nursery - gentle rain/white noise via an ancient ipod and a Lepai LP-2020!As you can tell I am no audiophile but if it sounds good to you go for it!I am happy with the sound and recommend these to anyone looking for good value.Finding yet another way to use these speakers inspired me to write this review!

There appears to not be much of a CD player market any more and most of the first tier vendors have gotten out of the business
But after wondering what a Coby product would be like I found it to be as nice as anything Aiwa or Sony would put out

It has a nice finish, good sound, and the controls are not the cheap pieces I thought they would be

I am happy with this purchase.

$review_text.: I am so happy I got this binoculars. I have been using a small Bushnell for going to the opera for so long, and these new Kenko put those to shame. Needless to say, the Kenko are a clear upgrade in quality and usage, because they are designed for truly outgoing people who like to observe animals (birds mainly). I have tested this binoculars so far at the opera, where as I said above, the Bushnell can't compete, and also in my backyard observing birds. I have seen three little birds over the fence, far far away, that now with my new Kenko look no so little and oh so pretty!The Kenko binoculars are made of highly durable polycarbonate and light weight body. They have fully multi-coated lenses for maximum light transmission and brightness and they are fully waterproof. I am not very comfortable trying this, but it is good to know, especially if you are on a boat, or if it rains. They are also impact resistant, and they have an easy to grip rubber exterior. Large focus ring for precise, easy adjustments.Magnifications: 8 times Objective diameter: 32mm Eye Relief: 14.8mm Close focus distance: 2.5m Weight: 455g (one pound). Size: 127.3x52x138mmThey come with a case, a strap, and very brief instructions in Japanese, French, Chinese, and English.Kenko is a Japanese company based in Tokyo. It does not say where these binoculars are made, though. I'd like to know.I strongly recommend this as the first binoculars to go, for bird watching, opera going, and to be kept for a long time for quality, price, and features. Highly strongly recommended.Thanks for reading.

$review_text.: Based on reviews, I thought these would be good drives to use to upgrade my RAID based system.  In all fairness, these are not RE drives, but 2TB RE drives cost more than I wanted to spend. My older drives were Samsung RE drives, but only 1TB each.RAID edition drives are nice to have. They coordinate with each other. They are fault tolerant in ways that individual drives are not. They power up and down in sequence, so when I turn my computer off or put it to sleep, I hear the drives turn off at one second intervals with the computer powering down one second after the final drive. They survived catastrophic "blue screen" Windows failures without ever having to rebuild. And nicest of all, their performance blew these 2TB drives away.With these 2TB drives in non-RAID mode, I was able to get speeds that were in the neighborhood of what other reviewers were getting. In RAID0 mode, I was shockingly disappointed. I'm using an Intel controller that uses their matrix RAID technology. With the older RE drives, I was able to have a lightning fast RAID0 array for the OS, a very fast RAID0 volume (in the Windows sense of volume) for ephemeral media, or anything I could afford to lose in a catastrophe, although I never once lost anything due to hardware or controller problems. I also had a RAID5 backup partition for my OS, and a large RAID5 partition that offered reasonable protection for my other data. (I still backed things up regularly of course.) In my configuration, all media libraries were kept off the OS disk, so I could restore the OS quickly if needed without needing to worry about data files, and vice versa.I tried replicating the environment with these drives. I was able to get usable performance out of them, but if I tried copying huge files across the network, the performance of the OS became degraded significantly. I never got throughput on the RAID0 volume that came close to the RAID5 volume, although it should have been much faster. Ultimately, I ended up using one drive stand-alone, and putting two of them in a RAID1 array. The performance is more than adequate for my purposes, but it's still possible to run things that cause momentary pauses in other tasks.Some people are concerned with the 5400 RPM speed. In reality, the platters are the same size as they were for my 1TB drives, so the heads need to move about half the distance to read the same amount of contiguous data. Rotations take longer, but the net effect of 5400RPM is not what users might expect.I use the computer primarily as a media center. Assuming the average one hour HD TV program is 7GB, and I want to record four shows at once, watch another, and stream another to another part of the house, I don't want to lose speed. But considering that all this happens in real time, it's only 1/3600 of the file that is read or written per second on average, so the throughput will still far exceed my needs. But if I want to copy one of those recordings across my network, I can no longer do it in 2.5 minutes, let alone without affecting performance. The saving grace is that my OS is on a disk that's separate from much of my data.Overall, the performance is not stellar, and you can't expect to get RE performance out of these. But you can expect to get performance that is very good for the price, and my history with Samsung drives has made me feel comfortable with their reliability. These drives are certainly quiet enough for my media center, so overall they may be the best (but not ideal) solution to my current need. Windows 7 gives them a WEI score of 5.9 on my system, which doesn't seem much worse than the 6.3 that my old drives got.  But I would not recommend copying several files of a few hundred GB concurrently while expecting the computer to maintain full performance on everything else.

$review_text.: The UI is completely different from what any Window uses entire existence is use to. I have used Windows from 3.1 and have upgraded fairly regularly but I have to say I have never downgraded, until now. I am now back on Windows 7 which I love. I agree with comments saying this is really meant for people who will have a touch screen for this OS or for Window users who want more of an Apple feel.However there is one BIG problem with that because if I wanted more of an Apple feel I would buy an apple which I use also. Its hard to explain but Apple has a simplicity that works, but I have Windows at home because I like building my own computers and I like being able to get in to ticker with Windows. Win 8 is hiding everything, making me search which leads to frustration and anger. Its like when Coke tried to copy Pepsi even though they were successful already and we know how that went! Microsoft is alienating there core users because I want to set it up the way I want and not be told and then not given the opinion to make changes. Microsoft you really messed Windows 8 up!

constantly putting it on and taking it off)


After about a month of constant on and off, it developed cracks in the frame where the connecting arm meets each earpiece


Eventually one crack developed into a complete break, which affects how it sits on my head, as well as making it very delicate to handle during putting on/taking off.Bottom line: if you are in a situation where it goes on and stays on, then it is probably ok
If you constantly are "on/off" then select another product (like the h800).***/The headset is comfortable and lightweight, easy to adjust
The hardware was instantly recognized by Windows 7 Pro 64-bit


The software installed correctly, including the update over the internet.No conflicts with the Logitech c525 Webcam (nor should there be since both products are from the same company)


Used constantly with Firefox browser (for YouTube, Flash media), WebEx, MS Lync, and Skype.Occasional clicking when the signal from the pc dongle to the headset has interference, or there is a heavy processor load, but it never persists to the point of distraction or discomfort


Speakers are open and on-ear, allowing other environmental sounds to get through.Best feature: the microphone mute when the bar is rotated away from my face

I can listen privately without feeling like I am in a call center, but then quickly swing the arm down to participate in the conversation.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this lens as a replacement for my 18-200 vrii lens.  I do a lot of international traveling and I have been looking for a single lens to carry on my quick trips across the pond.  Since I have a d300s and a d700, I wanted something that would give me maximum resolution on both bodies.  This lens seems to do the trick. I found it to be quite sharp at all focal lengths, particularly shooting at f/8 and f/11. Not surprisingly it tends to be a bit soft wide open at both ends, but forme that is a minor problem since I tend to shoot mostly in the daylight. So far it is the perfect replacement for my 18-200.

$REVIEW.: Optics are decent for the price and it gathers a fair amount of light.  I bought it on a whim to carry on the days I just won't drag out the binoculars. It's great that it's water proof.  At 6x there's not a lot of magnification going on so don't plan on any long distance close up views.  Still it's pretty darn good for $35 bucks.  I admit it. I'm addicted to optics.

He's stable now, but can't do a lot of the things he used to do.He has problems with complex electronic devices.  His old remote control was useless to him.  With a little patience, I was able to set this beauty up to load his favorite 10 channels, so he can just skip through them.  I change things easily enough if he gets bored with the current setup.Now, if I could persuade someone to make a cellular phone, compatible with the major carriers, that is as simple to use as this device, we would be doing really well!

A few hours later, the light went out (signifying they were all charged), and I removed it from the wall.  It was that easy.  I have 4 sets of batteries for my digital camera, and my camera is always charged up and ready to go, thanks to this wonderful little piece of equipment.  And to make it even better, I understand that with a set of adapters, I can plug it in anywhere in the world.

$REVIEW.: This switch works great! I replaced an 8 port 10M hub in my house that still works but is technically obsolete
The switch is great for home network

I have the switch connected to myLinksys EA3500 App-Enabled N750 Dual-Band Wireless-N Router with Gigabit and USBand connected to all the wired network computers in my house
It auto senses 10/100/1000 Ethernet operation on each port

It also auto senses crossover on each port so you don't have to remember to connect your router only to the specific crossover port or remember to use a crossover cable
And if you have a crossover cable lying around (like me) and accidentally use it that will work too


It has LEDs on each port that blink indicating network activity and light 1 side for 10M or the other side for 100M or both to indicate 1000M operation
The LEDs are really bright which I like but other people might not if you have this sitting on your desk or something


I was really impressed by the sturdy metal construction of the case


Most devices like this have gone to flimsy plastic cases


My laundry room doubles as netork closet so this was an important feature for me.

$REVIEW.: Targus normally makes really great cases for laptops, so I made the assumption that I would really like this case

It has both pros and cons, but the cons are outweighing the pros of late.I believe that you really need to use something at bare minimum for between 2-4 weeks to judge whether you like it or not, so I used it from the day it arrived about a month ago.The pros: it has a lot of zipper compartments for everything you can possibly think of from a tiny pocket for the transfer wires from your iPod, one for the iPod itself, right up to a large front compartment that can quite literally hold 6 computer gaming boxes (I know, I tried it)
It also has a hook up wire for your iPod that travels through the straps to a port on one of the straps so you can plug in the tiny ear buds you use with your iPod.The cons: it is hard to get your laptop out of this bag without moving part of the top area of the bag


Not all the zippers operated properly - mainly the part that hold the laptop

The case detailing at the top stops the smooth operation of the zipper

It takes two hands and quite a bit of zipepr manipulation to close it and most of the time it doesn't work

I know this is a quality control issue - unfortunately this bag was shipped with the flawed zipper operation.Another use for this bag: you could use it as a carry-on when you travel
The bag is so big and could easily hold the laptop and power cord along with multiple changes of clothes


I guess that's also a con..

the bag is enormous when full.

Try opening this with your own hands, and you WILL hurt yourself. The case itself is made of a nice, hard plastic, but I simply cannot open this without hurting myself.I emailed Pelican support about the issue, and they wouldn't help me. They simply replied, "They are very stiff to provide a tight seal to protect the memory cards." Talk about crappy customer service.Like others have mentioned, the images do not match what is actually shipped. The inserts are different.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Sound is very nice and solid.Very easy to set up and without a birdsnest of wires.It's Polk Audio....great name in sound reproduction


My first set of Polk speakers was purchased in 1975 and I kept them for over 25 years with great sound the entire time.Cons:DVD player should have been blu-ray, but hey it was manufactured about 3 years ago
At least it's a 1080i upscaling DVD player.Remote is not compatible with every device (Customer Support asked me if my Dish network satellite receiver was a fairly new model which it is, and then told me the remote has its codes burned into it and will not have codes for newer receivers.)No big deal, a Harmony remote would work better anyways.Not much sound seperation between left right and center channels, but I expected that, after all it's a soundbar not a 5.1 ch system.This system definetly needs a sub woofer
(Polk Audio PSW-10 $99)Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black)Mine is set up in my bedroom with a 46" Sony that we use mainly for about an hour before the lights go out so it does the job for me.----------------------------------------All in all the sound is good, but I feel sorry for anyone that paid the $1200 full price for theirs

Mine was one third that price.........

So for a total of 5 C-Notes I think I did pretty good pricewise for this soundbar and sub woofer combo compared to all the other brands out there

I've heard terrible reviews on the Samsung and Sony soundbars, (they need to keep concentrating on making TV'S as they are about the best two brands in HDTV's out there right now.)The only other soundbar in my opinion out there that rivals the Polk Audio system is the Bose Cinemate GS Series IIBose CineMate GS Series II Digital Home Theater Speaker Systembut it sells for about twice the price.

Seriously people start getting crazy when their phone or mobile device is about to die :)It also replaced a lot of old surge protectors that were old and looked bad hanging on the floor

 These plug in nicely and stay on the wall keeping the floor looking clean and professional, and make it easy for people to know where they can charge their devices and not have to keep looking for a wall outlet to usb adapter all the time.Save yourself some time and declutter your office with these awesome surge protectors.

$REVIEW.: After reading the reviews and searching the web for reviewers saying that this could work/couldn't work for subwoofers other than the Buttkicker, I'd thought I'd give it a try, not wanting to run 40-some odd feet of subwoofer cable.  Seems to be working fine with my Definitive Technologies powered subwoofer, and I'm not hearing any noise or outside signals/interference.  I don't have any wireless units using the same frequency and I'm using it in a single home, so that might be a factor.  I have the transmitter pointing out from the front of my entertainment console, directed at the receiver unit (which I have on the floor under the nonsofa bed couch), which is about 15 feet away.  I tried having the receiver sitting on top of the sub behind the couch, and that worked fine as well.  The only downsides I see currently is that all the units have power running to them so they're always sucking juice, and if you have the transmitter in view, the bright green LED could be distracting; otherwise, it does just what I wanted it to do.

$review_text.: Gave my new STK battery a 6-hour day of use in my Canon T2i, hundreds of shots
By hundreds I mean hundreds x3 as I take bracketed shots so three for every click of the shutter


Plus, I kept Image Stabilization, Autofocus, and Live View on as well

All use up power


I let it Auto Power Off after 30 seconds between shots and it did not go off all that much

At end of the day I still had power left

It did not take two hours to recharge, so I assume I had a good supply left before I would have needed to change batteries

I saw no difference between that and the OEM Canon battery used on the prior day's shoot

It did not take long for the initial charge either

Thus, I assume it came with a substantial charge out of the box.Of course, this is just my first day of use, but it performed well all day just like the OEM at a fraction of the cost


I will have to update my review at a much later time after I see how it performs over time


I know that I have used non-OEM 7.4v 2200mAh BP-511 batteries in my older Canon G1 and I have about 5 batteries currently
I always used 2 or 3 on a shoot such as this, sometimes 4, and over ten years have had perhaps 4 go bad, including the OEM


I am sure I would be comparing apples to oranges, but I am impressed that one battery (OEM or STK) is handling my photographic needs with the new camera where I needed 2-4 with my older G1 on a day's shoot, all for about the same price each for this STK vs


the former ones I have for my G1
At the moment, I am very happy with STK
I have no way to test that it is a 2000 mAh battery, but I have read that batteries from some other sources say they are rated one way and then come stamped another way - never a good sign
Glad this one at least comes as stated in the ad and not at half that, plus I like the 1 yr warranty


While made in China, it claims Japanese cells - supposedly a plus


As the warranty year wears down, we shall see where the battery stands
I hope it continues charging!

$REVIEW.: Massive and compelling in stature, this TV is breathtaking with it clarity. It simulates surround sound MODERATELY well, has MANY inputs for the accessory finatic (4 HDMI...one on front, 2 component...Yb, Yr, Yg, 2 S-video, 2 coaxial antenna), highly adjustable color, and produces a crisp picture when given a HD signal. Learning remote has minor trouble actually "learning" your other remotes' functions, but nothing to worry about. Overall it is a beautiful TV and I recommend it. If you run standard definition it's quite grainy, but is to be expected; after all, you bought a HDTV to run HD, right? I am resubmitting this review as I was incorrect on some of my statements previously and corrected (in a rather cynical fashion, might I add...thanks ALK) so please excuse my ignorance to HDTVs. I'm rather new to the HD world, but am learning. Anyone new to the HD world, I was recommended this TV for its price and versatility versus overall performance from a friend who knows his HD stuff. He pointed me in the right direction, thus I recommend the same! I'm happy with the TV and would also suggest seeing the Planet Earth HD series on this thing; breathtaking and worth the money. I think I will stick to HD from now on!

$REVIEW.: Not a "professional" photographer so this review will be a lot less technical than most of the ones that I read prior to purchasing the Nikon CoolPix S8100 digital camera


 The automatic settings have worked well for me in most cases

 Taking away noise reduction for the HD video helped quite a bit with the sound quality
 The pictures look great but the video is even better!  The images are very clear, and good quality...take up a bit of space
 The video takes up a lot of space...even for a short video
 But got an entire video of about 25 minutes for the Dolphin show at SeaWorld Orlando, FL
 Looks very nice when hooked-up to the 42" Sharp Aquos

 Batteries last for about 200 images as advertised

 Purchased 4 batteries (two Nikon and two not), a case, two 16gb HDXC memory cards, quick charger and a tri-pod....total purchase (including camera) was around $350...excellent price for what you get!  Only three "complaints"....I have yet to figure out how to take photos of faster action (dancing at a wedding), how to take video with a flash (if possible) and the sticker that was on top of the flash came off so the surface is sticky (perhaps from the fact that the flash has to pop-up automatically and then be pushed back down after use.)  Lot of good comments when images were posted on FB


 Included SW takes out red-eye, etc
after the fact so good deal there also
 Excels taking outdoor photos (with the help of the Optical 10x zoom.)  Recommended purchase for any casual photographer.

$REVIEW.: This is actually the second graphics card I've bought for my computer to replace one whose fan failed. The first card I ordered (from another company) was defective. I did research and decided to try this card due to the great reviews I've seen on it at several different review sites. I am not a gamer but like to have a good graphics card for video and photo editing. The XFX Radeon HD 7750 turned out to be a great buy. The card is a PCIe 3.0 card but workk flawlessly in my older PCIe 2.0 system. In addition, it is a single slot card so it frees up the second slot my prior card too because of it's large heatsink. The card has both HDMI and Display Port connectors for either adding additional monitors or to ensure any new monitor will work with the card. The card also features Duratec solid capacitors. After doing quite a bit of comparison shopping, Amazon.com had the best price for the card, including free delivery. Actually, they had the lowest shipping charge for UPS 2nd day delivery of any of the sites I checked. I'm very happy with the purchase and wanted to let shoppers know this card does work well with an older system Pcie 2.0 or 2.1 system.

It's also light as a feather which is great because between the almost 3 pounds that the batteries way and the 7 pounds that my Klipsch speaker weighs that uses these batteries, it adds up to a hefty 10 lbs.

$review_text.: An SSD was the most logical upgrade for my otherwise well-spec'd Lenovo T530 laptop. I was already familiar with, and confident in the Samsung 8xx Pro series from several desktop PCs I've worked with.Good preparation was the key to an accurate and speedy installation. Even before I ordered the SSD, I reorganized the HDD free space so that my C: drive partition could be reduced to fit onto Samsung's 256 GB product. With this laptop I had already used the &#34;bare metal recovery&#34; procedure available with my Windows Home Server 2011 system, so that was the migration method of choice. I ensured a timely backup of the original HDD on the server, performed the actual component switch-over in a few minutes (having already consulted the Lenovo T530 owner's manual), then booted from the WHS 2011 client recovery CD. About 25 minutes later I rebooted my recovered Windows 7 system from the new SSD.The only trace of an anomaly was the next day while syncing my iPhone, when iTunes complained it wasn't authorized for the apps on the phone. When I authorized the computer, it complained the computer was already authorized. I can only guess that iTunes does some additional hardware signature matching to check authorization validity and that the HDD to SDD transition confused it.Following the upgrade, I downloaded and installed Samsung's Magician application (though I removed it's shortcut from the Startup folder to avoid an annoying dialog box when rebooting). I followed most of Magician's suggestions for optimizing the system for SDD based on the reliability objective.The T530 is now very quick on its toes. Even large applications like Photoshop now seem to snap open. If you've already got 8 GB RAM or greater, this is definitely an upgrade worth going for.When planning your new partition layout for an SSD upgrade, be sure to note when &#34;1 GB&#34; means &#34;1x10^9 bytes&#34; (the traditional interpretation) vs. contexts where it means &#34;2^30 bytes&#34; (computer geek interpretation, as displayed in many places in Microsoft products). The usable capacity of the Samsung 256GB model is 256 GB (traditional interpretation), equivalent to 238.47 GB (computer geek). The figures shown in Microsoft's Disk Management partition layout display are based on 2^30. Right-click and open Properties of your C: drive to see both styles of figures side-by-side.
$SUMMARY.: Quick installation due to good preparation

$review_text.: There isn't much to be said about a 2.5 inch hard drive. It's the same size as all other 2.5" hard drives and works exactly the same. Unlike WD or Seagate, the case is not designed to light up or look pretty, but there is no reason that it should have to light up or look pretty; it's a hard drive. This product comes formatted NTFS but it's easily reformatted if you are on a Mac or Linux PC. It spins around, stores data, and after an indeterminate amount of time, will probably stop working. Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: I own a rather large camera (2 Mega pixel) with a large lens which I love to carry around when I want to do zoom photography.I wanted to get something a bit smaller to take with me to parties and other events, something that I could have at hand for snapshots and the like.This camera is pretty good and versatile for the price.I also use Sony's new format Memory Stick Duo adapter (which I can also use in my Sony Ericsson phone), and is also the "Magic Gate" in which you can save several "licensed" formats.I recommend it.
$SUMMARY.: Great Camera for the price.

$REVIEW.: I experience considerable impact when I jog which makes it rather difficult to keep earbuds in my ears.  I was extremely pleased with the stability and comfort of these athletic earbuds.  Even through a strenuous warm-up and several mile run, the earbuds remained snug and comfortable in my ears.  Beyond that, I feel that the sound quality was greatly enhanced and seemed to be channeled directly into my inner ear which, in turn, blocked any ambient noise in the immediate area.  I found the 3-Button Control & mic very easy to use as well as being dependable. I would highly recommend these to all my active friends.

$REVIEW.: We bought our son a 24&#34; Vizio for his room. Due to how the tv is made it stands at a strange angle for viewing.  We decided to order this wall unit for its mobility and hung it on a side wall with the use being swung from the left. It works fine but would not have any clearance if the TV was any bigger. We have plaster walls and did locate a stud for hangingas the instructions suggested. It was easy to hang just wish we would of gone one  size larger.

$review_text.: The pink little carrying case is Soooo cute and sturdy. It zips open and shut and on the inside it has a net pocket to hold your Nano. You can fit the charging cord and earbuds inside. It also came with a clip on. The pink silicone case matches the storage case it fit my 7th generation Nano perfectly. It also came with a screen cover which was easy to apply. I bought the pink case so that I could find my Nano if I put it into my big purse. The case was easy to see and kept my Nano safe.

$REVIEW.: This product seemed like a good option for me, living in a fairly safe neighborhood and not wanting to pay for monthly security monitoring. Having pets as well it would allow me to monitor their activities while away from home and make sure they weren't doing anything they shouldn't! Installation was a piece of cake, simply plug in the receiver to an outlet, then into the back of my computer, install the software and set up the camera. I currently just have the one internal camera and I decided to set it up in the center of my main entertainment/dining room area where my pets often hang out and also where a thief would most likely head for all my electronics. The main issue here though is apparent. Since all the video is downloaded to my own computer, all a burglar would need to do is to steal my computer, and I'd have nothing! So as a security tool, it definitely is pretty useless unless you purchase the Premium upgrade that can send alerts. Even then though, it's clearly not going to provide the kind of coverage a full security system would, even using some external cameras, simple entry through a window or other location around the house to avoid detection would always be an issue, as well as false alerts from other people approaching the house. So the benefit of this system seems to lie more in simple monitoring than in security.Here again though, the benefit is rather limited without a Premium subscription. While away from home I tried the online viewing and wasn't particularly impressed with it. Without Premium, you only get a Live View, you can't review the older videos so I wasn't for instance able to check and see what my pets had been doing throughout the day, I could only watch and hope they'd show up while I was online. I also had a lot of problems with it constantly dropping the video feed, and having to wait for it to re-acquire. This happened constantly and with a good strong internet connection so did not make me feel particularly inclined to upgrade the service.Overall, I had mixed feelings. If you don't mind paying the $80/year for the Premium service, this might be a worthwhile product, particularly to monitor activities at your home and/or business while you are not there. I'm not sure it is quite sufficient to provide true home security, but it might be an option to consider if you just want some basic security.

$REVIEW.: Avoid disappointment!If you have a Scientific Atlanta cable box, you will have to set the device to "A" in the back.  Unfortunately, if you do that, none of your other equipment will work--just your cable box.  Therefore, you need two receivers, one set to "A" (for the cable box) and one set to "B" (for everything else).  You can order a separate receiver by calling NGHP's phone number.I have used this device with the Logitech Harmony 550 and it works flawlessly.  You can really control your A/V devices from anywhere in your house!

$review_text.: My 450w APC battery backup battery had stopped maintaining a charge, so I looked into buying a replacement unit with power conditioning and larger load.CyberPower battery was preloaded in the unit and did not need any attaching. Worked out of the box. Quiet, handles draw from 850w power supply, led monitor, modem, and other peripherals fine. Test cycle worked ok, and battery is currently maintaining its charge. Wall voltage is slightly higher than 120 and is conditioned down, so it's preserving the attached devices ok.Like that the power to the LED display dims and then goes out, so it's not costing extra with power for a light (just its normal operation).The spacing of the power outlets on the back is pretty tight (even ipad power bricks would block an adjacent slot), with the exception of one space reserved for a brick on each side. I didn't realize this at purchase time, but had bought an amazon-suggested 5-pack of 1 foot extensions. Haven't regretted it.Attached CD is fine for windows, but doesn't offer many features except the important one: shut down after N minutes, or shut down when battery is at N percent.There is surge protection for one phone/ethernet line; you can't do both phone and ethernet. I still use a land line with DSL, so I ran the phone in.Overall, this is an improvement over my smaller 450w capacity APC unit.

$REVIEW.: The Titan is the only bag I have found, that my ASUS Republic of Gamers G74SX-DH73-3D fits into. The G74 is an extra large 17.3 inch computer that does not fit in normal laptop bag slots, even on 18 inch bags. You can fit it in the main area of a bag but you can not fit anything else with any size. I was thinking that I might have to go to an normal Backpack and forget about finding a bag with a deicated slot for this massive computer, when I read about this bag and decided that I would give it a shot.With the computer in its dedicated slot in the Titan, I have room for the cooling table, LG power brick, gaming mouse, Zalman clipon speakers, 3g/4g router with mobile modem(in its original box), the 3d glasses (again in the original box), an external 2gig hard drive and my Ipad 2(with stand). There is still room for more things with all the pockets and the way it can be organized.It rained/snowed all day the other day and the backpack repelled it, I put on the rain bag just to see how it fit and was very happy to see it shed all the rain.The price is a bit more for the Titan than I could have bought a regular backpack or even the largest Laptop backpack but is well worth it when you think of all the stuff you can carry around in the same bag. The price is offset by conviance of such a large bag and the fact you now have a bag that definately protects your equipment. The 180 degree swiveling Laptop section is definately a boon.

$REVIEW.: First, the box it came in had a dented corner, which given the price tag for this motherboard, did not inspire confidence right off the bat. Mind you the shipping box was in great condition, so this thing was apparently dropped in shipping to Amazon, or in an Amazon warehouse, so who knows, maybe getting batted around is what caused the damage.It ran for a few days, but had a funny smell, which eventually dissipated. Despite looking over and over I could not put my finger on what was causing it, and it was running OK. Well, at the end of its life it burnt out on the underside between the CPU and the back ports. This was so violent that it actually ruptured the top of the board underneath the heat sink, between two of the cylinders, located between the CPU and the back ports as well. Looking on the other board I have I see that there is nothing even located on the top.The motherboard was properly mounted in an Antec 1200 case, with a Corsair 750w power supply, and 2xGTX280 graphics cards, with of course nothing touching the backside since it was on the raised mounting screws, in a computer where all parts save the new RAM, CPU, SSD, and Motherboard were in use for about 5 years on an i920/X58 Pro set up, so I don't believe for one minute that this was due to a bad power supply or other issue.Fortunately it seems from testing in another identical computer, that I upgraded identically, that it did not fry the CPU and RAM, but this does not inspire confidence at all. 1 star for being defective and actually causing a VISIBLE flare. Completely unacceptable.Military class my butt. I have lost a lot of faith in MSI over this.

$REVIEW.: I am by no means an expert on tripods, but I really like this one
 I had been using a 60 year old tripod that belonged to my father and although I was reluctant to stop using it, I knew it was time to get something a bit sturdier


 I really like the way the pistol grip works and that they included a second quick-mount

 I can see where it might be a bit heavy if you were hiking, but that heaviness makes it feel very solid and steady
 Everything works smoothly and it seems to be very well constructed

$REVIEW.: Other than the fact that I received no cables with the fountain (which was disappointing).. I had cables that would work. I thought these were filled with oil, then when music was played, air would be how it works. This is not true! The upper speaker cases have no oil in them (unless you tip them to the side), the oil is down in the bottom and as the music plays it squirts oil from each of the jets, just like a fountain you would see in Vegas. The led's are very bright and if you choose the right music / song to play be ready for quite a show. I have tried these on my PC, iPhone, iPad 3 and a few other devices, they work flawlessly. You need a USB power source .. So if the device doesn't have one. I purchased a 6 foot USB to Micro USB cable on Amazon and you can use any USB wall charger to power these up. I did not expect the sound to be that great but was surprised at the quality of these speakers... Good bass even on full volume there is no fuzzing !  Recommended to ANYONE!

$review_text.: I purchased this via another online retailer at a great price, but even the normal price is a good buy for this battery backup. I have it currently connected to my mid-range gaming pc (overclocked Core i5 processor and EVGA GTX 650 Ti graphics), and it performs just fine. My power supply has the PFC that some people are concerned will cause issues without a pure sine wave input, but as far as I can tell, it is perfectly compatible. The built-in power meter is interesting, and the included software bundle should work well for automatic power management due to power failure.Running a full gaming load and an LED monitor pulls around 200W from this unit. Although I haven't tested for half-load battery life, I'm sure it will be plenty long enough to exit a game and safely shut the computer down. Unless you're running a very high power graphics card or have delusions about how many things can be safely backed up, this should work fine for low and mid-range desktops.

$REVIEW.: Unless you need to carry a tent in your backpack, this bag will fulfill your photojournalistic needs.I had no idea the backpack was this big until I saw it in person. Yes, I read the dimensions, but still, it's a shock to see it up close and personal.But it was a good shock, as I can carry almost everything I need in this backpack.You might have seen the descriptions, but it's worth revisiting. I can fit 2 cameras with their lenses attached, as well as extra lenses, my Canon Speedlight external flash, my 17" Dell laptop, batteries, cleaning accessories, etc. - it even has an external strap to hold a tripod.Yes, it will fit everything short of the kitchen sink!And if the kitchen sink starts running, it even has a water-resistant cover that can be pulled out from a pouch at the bottom of the backpack to enclose it entirely.And the extra straps(waist and sternum) really help to keep the backpack tight and secure to the body when you carry a full load like I do and need to do a little bit of trekking.As with other Lowepro products, the material and construction are extremely high-quality. Just one handle and you'll recognize it right away, down to the zippers - high quality zippers are an essential but often unmentioned quality.The bottom line is, it's very BIG, and very worth it!

$REVIEW.: For me, this camera was an upgrade.  I am a purse-sized point and shoot user (e.g., Canon Elph, Kodak EasyShare).  However, i'm finding that (1) I don't carry a camera around much anymore due to the improvements in cell phone cameras and (2) the shutter speed of point and shoots is frustrating such that I constantly miss shots waiting for the darn camera to focus and take the picture.  I got the opportunity to try this camera out and I was very impressed with the lightening fast speed and picture quality.  I can't compare with a DSLR because I've never used one, but compared to the relatively cheap cameras I typically use, it is impressively fast.  I think it does really well in low light.  I took some pictures on Halloween night, for example, and they came out really good.  I was surprised/impressed.  I didn't even think my flash went off!  So this does way better tha the cameras I have used in the past in low light settings.  It is also really easy to take video (caution, the video button is easy to hit by mistake) and there are tons of different settings that you can experiment with.  The zoom is really nice and adjusts very easily.  Unlike a poket sized point and shoot, I had to actually read the manual pretty carefully - several times.  This camera isn't as user friendly to a novice, although it's far easier to use than a DSLR (as far as I can tell).  There has been a learning curve though.  I found this camera to be intimidating at first, but after I took a few hours and mixed manual reading with some online videos (all with the camera in hand) I began to feel more confident when using it.I am not a camera guru, so I can't really speak to the special features etc. compared to a truly high end camera.  My understanding is that this is an entry level "nicer" camera.  I've honestly never used a DSLR - they scare this novice - and I am not completely clear on the tradeoffs.  What I can speak to is this - if you are a true amateur photographer, like many of us are, but crave better pictures, this is a good pick. I think this camera is a great choice for people who want more than a point and shoot or cellphone camera but who are not really avid photographers such that a DSLR is a wise purchase choice.  This isn't a camera to carry around every day - it's bigger than whet I am used to.  But you can take nice pictures and the shutter speed is great for parents who know that you have precious few seconds to snap a picture where your baby or toddler is cooperating or looking at you.  Also, you can change around lenses.  I don't have other lenses (and I'm not sure why I'd need any) but my understanding is that this camera works with other lenses in the Fujifim X series.  It's also small enough/light enough to take with you on vacation.  I haven't done this yet, but I will be taking it to Disney World.

Of course, these days, most PDAs will do all of the above, but I wanted something with an attractive design, plus good color resolution, a minimum of 32 megs internal memory, plus Memory Stick option, and at a resonable price.  This particular model satisfied all of those needs.Upon registering with Sony you're issued a code that allows you to download a free copy of Documents-To-Go Professional, the software that enables you to use MS Word and Excel documents on the PDA.  The Clie installation disk comes with Data Export (lets you use the Memory Stick as a removable drive on your PC), Palm Desktop for Clie, HotSynch and much more.  Unfortuntely, most of the additional software included is of the time limited or stripped down variety, most of which I decided not to load.  So far, the unit has held up well, producing pictures that are adequate for emailing or viewing on the PC desktop, and documents that synch flawlessly with the originals on my hard drive.  Both keypad and Grafitti Pad are functional and comfortable in relation to the overall size of the device, although using the Grafitti Pad takes some practice.The only real drawback I see is that the battery can't be easily replaced by the user, however, it does fill up pretty quick after the initial charge.  And I would have gladly paid an additional $20-$30 bucks to have a cradle (very difficult to find in the stores) included in the package rather than wires, but that's just a personal preference.  Overall, I'm quite happy with this device.

$review_text.: Nothing fancy here. I would have liked more side support options - as it is the only real attachment support is at the front via bend tabs on your head unit and a back strap, which is a pain. The CD pocket is warped, as it appears their injection mold designer didn't properly account for shrinkage - the top of the pocket bows down a bit. It's noticeable against the straight lines of the head unit faceplate. But, like I said, it works - and it's cheap.
$SUMMARY.: Eh, it works.

$review_text.: I gave this CD changer 4 stars for ease of use only because there seem to be a ton of advanced features that are just techno-Greek to me, and they make the remote control overly complicated.  Using the basic 5-disc changer is easy, however, and the USB plug-in is outstanding: the sound quality of MP3s on a thumb drive was excellent.  I was looking for a 5-disc changer that would play MP3 and WMA discs, and although this unit costs more than others with those features, it had much better reviews from users.  I've had it for a little over a month and am quite happy with it.
$SUMMARY.: Good quality and features - complex remote.

Be forewarned, though, that my DVR (2 years old or so) either lets you use the internal HD or the external HD and you can't transfer the data from one to the other. This means all your recording settings need to be re-entered and you can't go back and forth.Other than that, I've had no issues with the disk and it works great.

$review_text.: I'm a big, thick guy with long arms (36&#34;), so I was concerned that the regular length harness would be too small or short. Well, this one is too long. With the straps set almost as short as they can possibly go, the cameras are barely reachable. I would not recommend this to anyone with a sleeve length of less than 38&#34;.That said, it does the job of making it pretty easy to carry around two cameras. It's no Cotton Carrier, but it's a lot less expensive and bulky.

It does have something  that I was not aware of, Good and Bad the front 2 -key lock 3.5 openings are really HOT SWAP Hard Drive holders
So you can install and remove a Hard drive with out opening the box and while it running, as easily as putting in a CD into you PC
I use this (extremely Fast and easy  interface) instead of an older  external USB 3.0 HD reader to Back UP my off site HD's

BUT it takes up 2 of the 5 front slots.Worst part of this box is you have to SPLIT the fan and water cooler if used and mounted on the top of box
Crazy with all the room inside this box there is none at the top where the water cooler fits, It will work but not as other boxes do it.

It is so compact that I was amazed to hold it in hand


Initially thought there might be more pieces to join :)
Turning and pairing it with my iPhone was a breeze
Decommissioned my old sound dock and achieved 50% more space
The sound quality is comparable with legendary Bose quality
The deep Bass is unforgettably similar to other Bose speakers
The supplied dock tray is the best ! You keep the speaker on it and it charges
Once charged, I am yet to measure the run time on this speaker


Speaker is so small that you can easily take it anywhere without any worry of weight or wires
I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for top of the line speaker with blue tooth and expects portability.

For people on the go and need to recharge anywhere, grabbing this in addition to the Canon OEM charger is great choice, since it is smaller and more portable.

$review_text.: The item I received was ont exactly the one pictured.  Those received appear to be made of high quality materials with stout connectors.  Having a "tight" connection at the RCA jack is important but these are ridiculous.  It's nearly impossible to fully seat them, and when removed they pulled both of the rim pieces off my female RCA jacks on my NAD tuner.  These things are just WAY too tight to be of good use and might damage your equipment.  Some cables are designed to be loosened by twisting the end before inserting, but this does not appear to work for these cables.  Overall VERY disappointed in these things.

$REVIEW.: After ordering a Dell 23" monitor a couple weeks back I had to return it due to a severe case of back light bleed. The monitor was perfect otherwise. This monitor is the replacement because the Dell was out of stock at the time. so I chose the best value/most features. Out of the box this thing is blindingly bright, I never understood why companies ship out monitors and tvs this way, but as usual had to mess with the settings right away. The monitor has 0 dead pixels which makes me a happy guy. The color reproduction and contrast are not top of the line, but its a beautiful screen. I watched 'Wrath of the Titans' on blu for the first time and was very impressed with the monitor. It did have a touch of back light bleed but only in the bottom right corner, but only visible if I was staring at it the whole time. Nothing compared to the Dell. The look of the monitor itself is less than modern/sleek.. It's pretty clunky and cheap looking even for an led/lcd. It's fine for me, I'm not picky about the build, only picky about the screen. I should mention that this monitor feels solid, its just the appearance that looks cheap. One thing I noticed compared to the Dell S2330MX was the over sized base. Tons of people complain about monitors wobbling around, so the size of the base should fix that problem.The flaw as I mentioned in the title is the menu. It's way less than user friendly. I'm a moderate tech junkie and it was frustrating for a few minutes. Once you get the hang of it, its fine. I would say that if you are less technically inclined, have a friend or family member set it up for you who can turn the brightness and contrast down for you.One thing to think about a 22" 1080 tv or 24" 720 tv is they are still much more than the cost of a computer monitor. I purchased it mostly to watch my antenna DVR'd stuff and movies/net.flix and saved about $100 because I chose a monitor over a tv. The big difference is with a tv you get a remote and coax input, but an external DVR for my laptop was $40 solving the coax input problem, and now I can watch my shows whenever I want without shelling out $70 a month to time warner.All in all, this monitor was well worth the $139 I paid. Yet again Amazon comes thorough for me. sending the replacement via 1 day shipping really made it a speedy swap.
$SUMMARY.: Great Monitor, one little flaw..

$REVIEW.: Tested these, side by side with the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks.  Flashy those sticks.  I wanted to justify getting them, but for my kind of music they did not perform NEARLY as well as the JBL Creatures.  Here's why.  If you listen to anything that is fast, with vocals, like acoustic guitar, the creatures are crisp and clear and very well balanced.  They were $129 at the Apple store and about half that on Amazon.  Test them for yourself.  Take a CD to the apple store and be amazed.  Disclaimer: if you like your windows to rattle and your car to sound like it's going to blow up from bass, then you might not want these speakers.

$review_text.: I've only used it as a bluetooth transmitter to get TV audio to a wireless speaker and to my bluetooth hearing aids.  It works very well as long as there's not too much distance to the receiver and nothing solid (wall, etc) in-between.  Haven't used it as a receiver yet.  My only complaint is that it's very lightweight and with 2 wires connected, won't stand up easily.  Also, it's lost right now I think because it's so small, but that's my fault.

$REVIEW.: OK this is an UPDATE to my earlier review
I upped the stars to 3 stars, because at least some of the issue is on our end


 I contacted our cable provider, to say I was having issues, and they must have upped the flow on our street, because now I can watch on this pretty reliably during the week, during the day


I still can't get it reliably at night or on weekends, when everyone else in the neighborhood is home and online, which is why I can't give it more stars.I can see that it is our cable flow that is partly at issue, but since I can watch Netflix without a hitch, anytime, that puts some of the fault at the device, as well.I don't pretend to know the nuances of why Roku works like a charm, but this doesn't, with the same signal strength, but I can't give it more stars than 3 as it stands

I do love being able to watch my shows at my convenience, on my big screen TV, but I have the luxury of being able to watch during the day, when others are at work
If you're getting this for night time viewing, know you may not be pleased with the result


My husband won't even consider it.---------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:I soooo wanted this to work
I LOVE the idea of it, and the ease of it, but unfortunately, it just doesn't work very well.Pros:The unit came with everything I needed to hook it up, including the UPC plug and adapter to plug into a wall outlet, as well as an HDMI extender so if you can't fit it directly, this will give you some wiggle room
I was surprised, but I needed it because my TV curves just below the outlet, and wouldn't let the unit plug straight in

Good thinking on their part, and handy for me.Easy interface, and it walked me right through setup very easily.Easy to cast shows to the TV from the computer
Just get the show going on the computer, click the link, and it shows up on the TV a few seconds later

There is a slight delay, but that's to be expected.Cons:I was easily able to cast shows onto the TV, unfortunately they'd  frequently stutter, and only play for a brief time (1 - 20 minutes) before they stalled completely, and lost the connection

 This despite the show playing perfectly on the computer I cast it off from.I didn't have any issue with the few seconds of lag time between the computer and the TV, but it can be annoying when the voices don't quite match up, which I found more often than not.Overall, great idea, and execution, but it sadly just doesn't work


I have Netflix and Roku for doing basically the same thing, but they work like a charm, so I don't believe it's an issue on our end


 We have a strong enough signal, and sufficient bandwidth, so this should work.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for my desk at work where I wanted to add a second monitor but don't have the room.I had a 15&#34; monitor on a swing arm mounted on the wall in front of my desk but needed to get a little more real estate so that I could monitor a video surveillance system that I maintain.  I had a 22&#8221; monitor sitting at home unused and figure it could be put to use in the office if I could somehow fit it on the desk.Ergotron makes another swing arm mount for side by side monitors, but my desk is mounted to a wall and does not have the clearance for the arms to hang over the front of the desk.  This arm system is intended to position the monitors one above the other, but after reviewing the specifications it appeared that I could make it work for side by side in my application.It works out perfectly for my application.  I had to position the base to one side of the desk, but after manipulating the arms around a bit it fits in the limited space I have perfectly (note: the monitors do not sit perfectly even, but this is not a concern).I am quite pleased with the way that it is build (very sturdy) and the components seem very well put together.  The instructions are good and the allen wrenches for assembly/adjustment are included.I may be getting another for the house (as long as my wife doesn&#8217;t find out until it is installed).

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased this lens, so I don't have a lot of shutter time with it yet, but thus far, I'm very pleased with it.  I use the lens on both a Nikon d300 and a Nikon d700.I was pleasantly surprised to see that the lens is quite sharp wide open, at f/1.8.  Stopped down to f/4 or f/5.6, the lens is very sharp, at least in the center.  I haven't tested edge or corner sharpness yet.The lens is large, typical Sigma style, but good build and finish, also typical of the Sigma EX lenses.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the lens.  It works well on both of my cameras and produces sharp photos with good color and contrast.I have 2 issues with the lens. Autofocus is rather slow and the lens switch for manual/autofocus is the focus ring. The focus ring is very large, taking up most of the lens barrel.  That's a clever design and is nice if you do a lot of switching between manual and autofocus, because you don't have to look at the lens to find the little switch like you do on most lenses.  But, that design is also a problem in that it makes mounting the lens on the camera more difficult to do without moving the focus ring to the Manual position.  Neither of these things are show stoppers, so I think the lens rates 4 stars.

$review_text.: I got three Dell D610 laptops from a client after they were being decommissioned. The laptops needed RAM, a bigger HDD, wireless, and Bluetooth. Everything was installed into the laptop, XP Pro 32bit was installed, and I installed the TP-Link driver for this card. It seems to work fine, until your laptop goes to sleep. Once you wake it up, you will find that the CPU is being used at 50% constantly until you reboot. I tracked the problem to this card and contacted TP-Link. They had me try an alternate driver with the same issue. I then went to the chipset manufacturer (Atheros) and downloaded the driver directly from them, for their chipset. Have not had a problem since.In other words, if you purchase this card do NOT use the TP-Link drivers, even the latest ones from their site. You WILL have problems if your laptop goes to sleep or hibernates. Just download the Atheros 9220X driver from Atheros and you will be very happy with the product.

$review_text.: I have owned this for about a month.  I commute about 45 minutes each way, and I got this to listen to audio books and songs on my iPod.  And it does those things really well.I live in a fairly major city (Portland, OR) and so far I get next to no interference...once I found a station with no existing radio programming.  Finding an unused station in a larger city may be impossible.  But that is not this product's issue, just using a radio transmitter in general.Using the FM dial is easy, but there are no presets.  Not an issues for me, but if you have longer commutes you may need to change stations to reduce interference.  Otherwise I have had no issues with the operation of this unit.Since this plugs into your audio jack, and not the USB jack, you do have some control over the volume from the iPod.  Which I have actually found to be helpful.  The cord is "coiled" so it stays pretty compact when not in use, but stretches to around three feet.The size of the unit is nice.  Not too big, but not that small either.  One "issue" I have with the size is that I feel it's pretty conspicuous, since the screen is attached to the plugin.  It is definitely noticeable if you power plug is up on the dashboard like mine.  I would never want to leave it plugged in an area I thought break-ins where possible.Also note that this unit does not charge your iPod.  So you will either need to buy a separate car charger, or bring it in the house once in a while.  Obviously how long a charge lasts depends on your player, but I typically bring it in my house to charge once a week.Overall a great product, but since it doesn't have a charger I couldn't quite give a 5 star rating.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could.

These speakers can also connect the &#34;normal&#34; way with an 1/8&#34; audio cable (included) and that is what I ended up doing with mine. One advantage of using the wireless connection is that the speakers automatically turn off and on when you shut the computer down and power it back up again. This may be annoying for some people.Overall I think these speakers compare favorably to others in the $100 range, and the wireless feature is probably worth the extra cash if you think it is something you will use. Not having a subwoofer is definitely a bummer, but the low end is acceptable with these speakers so it's not a huge problem.These speakers also work as bluetooth speakers from your phone or other bluetooth device (iPad, etc). With that in mind, they are actually very good quality bluetooth speakers and much cheaper than something like the Big Jawbone Jambox which has smaller speakers and doesn't sound as good at louder volumes in my opinion. Of course, the Jambox is battery powered and more portable, but if you are looking to listen to music in your house and the speakers will be in a place where you don't need to move them, then it's great to be able to just send music from your phone to these speakers and listen while you hang out in your house.

$review_text.: This is my first router and I don't have experiences from previous routers but I'm quite satisfied with this one. It was easily setup without any problem in 5 steps. The speed is great. I have connected a PC through cable and a laptop through wireless networking. The connected speed now is 54 Mps and if you want to have a 108 Mps speed you should use compatible netwok cards. The software has many features like multiple security options. The router reboot takes less than 15 seconds and the range is great.

It's nice that the cord that comes with this is so long. But I actually use the card one because it's magnetic and it hooks to my window without nails. Which I would need with this packet.

$REVIEW.: this 46 - 52 mm adapter is working perfectly. Both ends are machined close enough to screw easily without damaging threads. The finish is perfectly good enough. All the products that i have purchased from digital Goja have been flawless, except the 49 - 55 mm adapter. When I alerted them to flawed threads on one side of this adapter, they immediately credited my account with the price of the adapter. 2 minutes later, they credited my account with the price of the second [flawless] adapter  that i had purchased with that order.I received a very polite and delightful e mail explaining that they had basically given me the non defective adapter for free to make up for any damage that i had caused to my collection of legacy lenses while trying to use the bad one. All this happened within an hour of my return request. To be clear, this company is not one of those faceless and uncaring ones that come and go. they are here to stay, and one can purchase from them mostly flawless items for very low prices if one will take the tiniest amount of time to return their very rare misfire.update: i ordered another adapter in the 49 - 52 mm size, and it screwed in effortlessly. It is good to do business with a company that will allow returns in this manner!

However, after using for a few days I noticed some flaws:  the Bluetooth connects to multiple devices and even in the OFF position the headset would be ON.  I would not get sound from my iPad and saw it was still using the headset while the headset was OFF;  Sound does not lower on some devices, such as my RAZR MAXX smart phone.  I want to listen more quite at work, but the volume does not lower.  It is able to lower on iPad and BlackBerry.

$review_text.: I'm a bit surprised by all the really negative reviews out there
 I'll give my own account


 I got this for use with my PS4


 I've used them both for playing games and for watching movies and tv shows (netflix via Ps4 and straight blu-rays)


 For all these uses they've been terrific

 Certainly the best headset I've owned
 The sound is superb, I find them to be very comfortable (I've worn them for hours at a time and honestly forget that they are even there after awhile)
 The range is also impressive

 I've walked into other rooms to get a snack of whatnot and just kept them on and can hear the sound nicely.I haven't honestly given the mic a workout yet, as I haven't played any games that have needed it
 When I speak I can hear my own voice in the headset though, and it sounds ok.The one complaint I have about it is the setup

 Omg

 If some of the reviews are because people haven't set it up properly I can empathize

 If you bought this to use with the PS4, the instructions it comes with are useless, and their website is a disorganized mess or information

 I can honestly say I spent a couple of hours trying to assimilate all the relevant info and get it installed properly
 It's not really that complicated when it comes down to it


 A couple of pages in the manual would have made it clear as mud, it's pathetic that Turtle Beach doesn't bother to do that


 So I take one star away for that.

$REVIEW.: This amp has a very nice look to it.  It is constructed of mainly aluminum with a really nice looking finish.  It has a lot of controls on it including high and low pass filters, bass boost, and gain control.  It also includes a remote gain control that you can mount in the front of your car for quick and easy control of the gain.  The features of this amp are comparable of much higher-priced amps, and seems very professional.I first connected this amp in bridged mode to two 250w RMS subs, and I was very disappointed with its performance.  I tried changing the gain and bass boost, but I couldn't get the subs to hit hard without the amp going into protection mode (the internal circuit cuts off and will reset once you turn the amp off and back on).  The sound quality was great, but the amp wasn't pushing much power at all.  The amp is rated for 1000w at 4ohms when in bridged mode, and it was not going anywhere close to that.After reading a few reviews online I decided to hook the two subs up in stereo mode instead of bridged.  After doing this I have yet to get the amp to go into protection mode!  It does not push as much power as it did in bridged mode, but it sounds great and can get very loud!  The sound quality of this amp is very close to amps that cost more than 2x its price.I really recommend this amp, but take into consideration that I could not get it to work well in bridged mode.

$REVIEW.: After having owned numerous 'line-doublers' (all the way back to Faroudja upscaling my 480i sources to 480p for my first home theater,) and innumerable HDMI switchers, I have finally found one that takes the alphabet soup of HDMI versions and handles it with aplomb while being the cleanest and most easy to use upscaler to 1080p that I've touched to date.So, after having issues with HDCP handshakes, HDMI versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3a, and 1.3b not playing well with most autoswitching units--this product from DVDO does all of the above with aplomb.Want to take your upscaling DVD player, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, TiVo HD, Wii, and more and mix and match audio inputs to a single optical output? Done.Want them all at true 1080p (including your wee-little wii?) Done.Want to get rid of the "Sugar/Mosquito-Noise/Sparkle issue from compression of your HD inbound signal?  Nicely done.Want to see everything pop better on your HD screen without looking artificially processed? Simply Done.Want power-on priority for various units in your system (the TiVo comes before the Xbox 360, and the Denon 2930ci comes before the PS3?) Again, done and done well.Add a simple remote, ability to tweak at will (should you even want to) and you have a massive winner of a product.My biggest worry was any effect I'd have on speed of play with the game consoles--no issue..


It not only has a game mode but takes Wii-Widescreen 480p and puts it out at a solid 1080p/60 and looks great doing it.Films on Blu-Ray with 1080p/24 are stellar (minus the extra stars in the black sky from compression issues.)All in, I heartily recommend this product--and you'll note that I am fairly even in pans, middling reviews, and OK product discussions, but rarely give a rave.This is a rave and applause to the DVDO crew

Our household has two and counting now.[Consider this a laughter-and applause-filled standing ovation.]

$REVIEW.: Options that is...There are so many inputs, digital, analog..


I have a feeling I am having an issue because I don't have the inputs right


Maybe

I can't turn the unit up past 10 (about 1/6th of the volume) because the unit powers off by itself and won't turn back on (and stay) unless I turn off all the sound inputs (DVR in this case) then turn the RCA back on and turn on the DVR (or whatever source)

I've tried everything


Why don't they make that protection circuit adjustable? Or just take it out and make the unit so a protection circuit isn't needed? Maybe I'll have to go to the 3.1 surround option but I don't really want to! I've got an email in to RCA to see if they can help me but until I update this I suggest you pay a little more and get a Sony (my Sony was awesome (although it's protect circuit gave me trouble at first too))
If I figure this out I'll update this posting.

$REVIEW.: Works like a charm! The MicroSD card really is the size of a fingernail and it really works. My order did come with the adapter. I popped the MicroSD card into the SD adapter, popped that into my Dell laptop, dragged and dropped a bunch of music files into the card, put the card into my Blackberry Curve 8330. The Curve took a little while booting back up and recognizing the media files, but I'm listening to it now, and the quality on the speaker is decent - it sounds better with earphones. Amazing! I could have saved my money and not bought my Sandisk Sansa 4GB. Oh well.Two tiny gripes - it's hard getting the microSD card out of the adapter, and it's kind of a pain having to remove the battery to install the card into the back of the Blackberry. But I can definitely live with that. Incidentally, all my music files are WMA, and the Blackberry has no problems with that file format. I'm assuming it would be fine with AAC and MP3 also.Bottom line - amazing! How do they pack that much storage into that small a card?

$REVIEW.: I bought this as a digital VCR replacement connected to my cablebox, same connections you could connect your old VCR to

I was skeptical from the start so I bought a used one and Im glad I did, I suggest if your unsure, get a used one first before spending full retail on it

Its not as nice as all these glowing reviews would have you believe.1) The main software that does the recording is not available on the manufacture website, when I bought mine used the seller said its easy to download from the manufacture, ITS NOT, its not even available if you go to the Hauppauge website you will notice ONLY the driver is available for download


So just getting this working is a pain if you don't have the disk and prepare to look through endless filibuster forums to find a valid copy of it.2) THERE IS NO PAUSE BUTTON!!!, I doubt im the first to pull out my hair, thinking this will work like a VCR, hit record watch your show and pause during the commercials, resume recording after the commercial ends
Can't do it, NO PAUSE button, Thats why I say keep your VCR, this is a step back from your VCR


You would be better off recording your TV show with your old vcr (with a pause button) to cut the commercials then output your vcr recording to this device to digitally encode to a digital file for your media center.3) There is NO Remote by default, I have no idea why its pictured, its NOT included you must buy that extra, irresponsible photos for this item above
Even if it did, looks like the pause button is just functionless and from what ive read just crashes the software.4) Its default software once you locate it or if you have the disc, has NO CUTTING software to make up for the lack of a pause button so your forced commercials, you can't pause/resume, you can't edit your video file and remove the commercials

It does include some flaky software called cutting room to make DVD recordings
Audio is out of sync after using its own software obliviously nobody quality checked this software.5) The only cutting software for it that works costs you $40-100 there is no supported freeware that "Actually Works" you will spend countless hours searching ancient forums for cutting software that works since this device was created, most of it that is free was abandoned by its creators and obsolete and windows only and dependent on codec installation, DOT NET Framework and extra bloatware nonsense.6) It ONLY works with Windows, I heard it works with Linux, but I see no proof or working examples, Mythtv seems to be outdated and no evidence this works with todays XBMC.7) Settings are overly complex, normally when it comes to digital files, most people want clean correct aspect ratio depending on source, most tv today is 16.9 aspect ratio, old stuff is 4.3 full screen, this software can't automatically detect and record it needs to be manually set


So your widescreen will be trapped in 4.3 box and fullscreen will be stuck in 16.9 widescreen also appears to have no option to deinterlace

So if the show has interlace issues I guess your stuck.In summary, be weary, yeah there is no competition for this product so you really DON'T have a choice, but it works worse then your old vcr and will most likely cost you more to make it work in the end you pay $100 for it another hundred for a tool to remove commercials


Like I said keep your VCR recording to your cable box then play the VCR tape to this device, since commercials are too hard for this technology or pause button.

What to do?BUY A PANDA PAL!a) He is adorable.b) He can be powered by USB. If you happen to own an AC to USB adapter, you can plug him right into a wall outlet and forget about buying batteries.c) The sound is awesome for such a small speaker.There is only one downside -- the intensely blue light on the front.  I suggest covering it with tape if you want to use it in a dark room.  That LED will keep you awake at night!

$REVIEW.: I am a long-time supporter of Logitech, and this is yet another one of their high quality products
 However, my mouse died within 3 months of purchase, so I contacted logitech support

 The thing I've found about Logitech support is that if your product is in warranty, they're great
 If you're even a day out of warranty, however, they will practically completely shut you down and you're stuck buying a new product


 In this case, the mouse was in warranty, and I had a new one delivered to my door within 3 business days, and I didn't have to package up the dead product and mail it back to them - super convenient.


$SUMMARY.: Great product, Logitech has great service IF you're in warranty.

 So I saw the decent reviews, better then about 5 others I looked at, of this BT keyboard and for the price I said..self, order it

 I can always send it back right

 No regrets so far


 Paired up to my Nexus 7 just fine

 I turn it off over night and the next morning I turn it on and it pairs up without a hitch

 All keys, including the TAB key, functions as they should
 Need to get used to typing on the small keyboard again....no I am not typing this review on it
 The clip that is on the front that holds the Nexus to it is not in the best place

 I think if that had been placed in the back and the 2 other ones on the front it would have been more ergonomic as they would have been in the palm of your hand and not where your thumbs are

 With use I will get used to it

 For a BT keyboard under $20 shipped..buy it

So if you want something that will both run your notebook off the AC line and charge your batteries, you need what's called an "AC adapter".  This is the least expensive one and works fine.

However I can only rate them 3 1/2 stars as the Bass is not as tight as I have heard it on other headphones. Also the highs are not sharp - for example, if you listen to sharp clapping, it just is not sharp[ with the Bose. The Bose are also at a disadvantage if you are listening in a noisy environment. In such a case the Altec Lansings - WITH the Comply matching earpads (you must purchase separately) will perform much better.

The video works great, no lagging or chopped moments. The packaging is GREAT. Not only does it protect the card, but it is very simple to open the packaging with no knives or scissors.For an average photographer, this memory card works great. It comes in a small, clear snap case that makes it easier to carry around. I suggest you get a better case if you are more experienced photographer or if you want to protect your card from everything, not just things like dust. Worked great for me.

Before, I could feel my legs cooking to the bottom of the laptop. I would always use a pillow or blanket at home to dissipate the heat but this is a much better option.I agree with one review that it doesn't hold the laptop in place very well and it would be useful to have some rubber to make the laptop stick.

$review_text.: If what you want is a 4-port USB hub with some buttons to push and some glowing lights, this will meet your needs for the most part.  However, it's not a perfect product because of the implementation.  First, the LED lights won't turn on for all devices.  For example, if you have something that is non-interactive that draws power in a static manner (like factory-included edge lights on standard speakers, etc.) the port will power them and the on/off button on the port will work, but the LED light will stay off.  Some other devices don't seem to be fully recognized even if you turn them back on; I had a Griffin multimedia control dial that the hub recognized sometimes but not others.  The power plug connection to the USB hub also did not fit into the power port fully, which resulted in a somewhat unprofessional appearance.  As a result of those and other issues, I returned mine to Amazon and went with Sabrent's 7-port USB hub with switches instead of buttons.  I love that hub and would recommend that you look at Sabrent's other options.

$REVIEW.: This item is simply not worth the money.  I must admit...when I first got this remote, I thought it was very cool.  Lots of people commented about how futuristic it looked with the light-up number pad. It has this motion sensor that the buttons light up to be visible whenever you touch or lift up the remote.  After about a week, I started having problems with the remote lighting all the time.  Whenever someone opened a door, walked through the room, sneezed too hard, the number pad would light up which would quickly drain the batteries.  Yes, there is some sort of motion sensor you are suppose to be able to adjust to make it less sensitive to vibrations in the room... but who has the time or the engineering degree to take the time to figure out how that works? I made one attempt to figure that out and gave up.  I use to work as a computer programmer, but even I have my limits. I was also hoping it would work with my x10 lights infrared controller... but to do that required some complicated method of phoning some automated voice gizmo and doing some complicated programming technique... all of which I had neither the time or will to do.  Now I've had this remote for a little over a year.  When it has new  batteries... it is lit all the time except for the power button which from repeated pressing no longer lights up.  All the other frequently pressed buttons also seem to have faded into unreadable blue blobs.  You sortof have to guess where the button is...so I usually hit the wrong buttons a few times.  After a week with new batteries, the battery that lights up the keys wears out which means you can't see any buttons anymore.  Therefore you have just a blank blue pad that you have to guess what button your hitting.  I gave up replacing batteries on it... and paid too much on it to trash it...so now I just play a guessing game as to what button I am hitting.  If it weren't for the fact that it really is a good idea that looks very neat... I would have given it only a one star.  Save your money, buy a cheapo remote.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera in the red color for my wife.  She fell in love with the color and loved the way the camera felt in her hands.  We also felt the image quality of the pics were good for the most part, although they sometimes seemed to be lacking a bit in contrast.  Even at 42X zoom, we usually got very clear and nicely balanced handheld shots.  They sometimes looked a little "soft", but for hand-held shots at that zoom range we didn't feel that was an issue.  What sent the camera back though was focusing issues.  When taking pictures, the camera struggled too often and took too long to zero in on the target, and sometimes we couldn't get it to focus no matter what we did.  And focusing was even more of an issue when shooting video.  There was also a defect in the lower right quadrant of the LCD.  We would have done an exchange if that had been the only problem, but the focusing issue made it a return.

$review_text.: I will reiterate the same thing that has been said by many before me.First I have a Samsung Tab 2 7.0. This dock will work with this tablet but it must be modified. There are a couple of small plastic ribs on either side that must be removed. I did that and the dock works great. I snaps in firmly, sits solidly on the dock and makes a repeatable electrical connection.Second, it does not have an HTMI output. It has the Samsung connector (same as on the tablet itself) and it has an audio out. That is all.I did not reduce my rating because I knew these things when I purchased it because I read the reviews.The dock is worth the money if you keep the above facts in mind.

$REVIEW.: Since receiving my Chromebook it has become my daily driver
I can no longer stand to sit there and wait for my Windows 7 Gateway to come out of hibernation mode; I get too impatient.The Acer boasts a 8 second startup time, but I would challenge that


It's more like 5-6 seconds.So, once you're started up you absolutely, positively must be connected to the internet

Chromebooks will not operate without the internet


If you have no internet, move along, nothing to see here.Now, in the beginning it connected seamlessly to my WiFi, then went thru one update, then the WiFi suffered tremendously

It was constantly dropping connection on a MediaLink wireless router (read those reviews, those things don't drop connection)


After submitting a complaint to Acer and dropping the Vine card there was an update the next day for the Chromebook which immediately fixed the connection issue


I've not dropped connection since.The Chrome browser imports all of my settings including bookmarks, passwords, etc


from my other Chrome browser on my Windows laptop which saves me so much time from starting from scratch, again.There are no function keys on the Chromebook, like you find in windows

No F1, F2, F3, etc., but you do have Escape, Back, Forward, Refresh, Full Screen, Swap Windows (Alt+Tab for you Windows folks), Dim Brightness, Brighten Brightness, Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up and Power
There is also no 10-key or delete key

It is also a single button mouse, which means you need to use it like a Mac
Ctrl+Click to open in new tab, Alt+Click to right click


Ah! Can't forget about the lack of a CAPS LOCK key
That's probably the one I forget most often


Instead it's a search key.It does have the capability of saving photos to the hard drive for quick retrieval later


I haven't tried saving any documents to the hard drive because I haven't needed to.When you close the lid to the CB it sleeps immediately

When you open it it wakes immediately (I mean IMMEDIATELY, not even 1 second delay).There's a number of Chrome apps you can use, but the lack of Skype is the only thing that has kept me using my laptop from time to time.Also, don't plan on using a real mouse with the CB

Although I have mine set up to the fastest speed it still crawls across the screen
That's probably my biggest complaint.I recommended this computer to two people who only wanted something cheap and could give them access to the internet because they're chronic Facebook users

They both went out and bought it and both have enjoyed it ever since.I love that the battery on this thing REALLY lasts for 9+ hours with the brightness set to it a middle setting and lots and lots of Candy Crush.If I want to take it to work I simply throw it in my purse and off I go
Because it's able to hold a charge so long I have NEVER had to worry about bringing a charging cable with me.If this is the future of internet-only laptops, then the C720 is the standard by which all CB's should be measured

It's a fabulous tool that I recommend to everyone everywhere


It's so budget friendly and does the one thing it promises to do, plus a teensy bit more.Well done, Acer and Google! I'm thoroughly impressed!

$review_text.: (Updated Feb 2011)I've changed the star rating. Not sure if I didn't do it earlier because it wasn't an option. Someone pointed that out. I've given it 3 stars. Although it's easy to use and seems to work well I haven't found the profiles to that are generated to be much better than what I had by default. Over the years I've actually stopped using it.(Updated  3/13/07)I can't change the star rating but if I could I would. I contacted Pantone with the greenish cast issue and they told me that they were aware of a problem with some units. After confirming the serial number I received a replacement and it works! It would be nice to have multiple monitor support but at this price I'm not complaining. The only issue I have is that adjusting for room lighting seems to screw up the colors.Original ReviewI purchased this product based on user reviews but it just doesn't work. It is easy to use but the profiles that it generates are unusable and look much, much worse than the defaults. I've tried it on Windows XP, OS X and on a several different displays. I generally get a greenish cast. This seems to be a common problem and most professional reviews identify this issue and the product is not recommended.I guess you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research before buying my first tablet and eventually settled on this Coby.  It has the hardware that I wanted, the screen resolution I wanted, and the price I wanted.  I got the unit on Wednesday a couple of weeks ago.  When I first turned the unit on I was impressed with the screen quality.  Everything was great except some apps couldn't be downloaded for this tablet from the Play Store.  I was able to manually install these apps and all was good.A couple days later is when things went down hill.  I noticed a considerable amount of dust particles between the top and inner layer of screens.  This is supposed to be a sealed area of the tablet so the only way dust could be in there is if the seal was faulty or the unit had dust in it from the manufacturer. There's no way to clean this out so I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a new unit next day air.Last Monday the new unit arrived.  I pulled it out of the box, pulled off the manufacturer protector over the screen, and before I even turned it on I could see a considerable amount of dust between the screens.  One particle was so big and white that you couldn't ignore it even if you tried.I returned this unit for a refund this time and instead purchased a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for only $30 more which has been amazing and I certainly recommend it over the Coby unit.  The Coby would be a good unit if not for poor, lazy, manufacturing practices.

$review_text.: First, this is an analog camera. It is meant to be used with an analog video recorder that can control the pan tilt through its RS485 port using either Pelco-D or Pelco-P protocol.A few other reviews mentioned the lack of a remote control. I'm not sure if things have changed, but the checklist on my box did not mention a remote control, and indeed none is included. The length of the all-in-one cable is also 60 ft, not 100 ft. If you're expecting the remote and 100 ft of cable, you might be disappointed. Q-See's website also mentioned the remote and 100 ft of cable, so perhaps we were all sent the wrong unit.It does come with two mounting options (ceiling and wall mount), 60 feet of cable (not 100ft as Amazon's description indicated), and a 110-240V power adapter. The output of the adapter is 12V 1.2A. There's even a small flat head screwdriver included. Too bad there's no Philips head screwdriver for opening up the unit if you need to adjust the serial settings (more on this later). The mounts allow you to run cables internally, or alternatively there's a notch to run your cables along the wall or ceiling.When panning, the entire plastic dome will rotate, not just the image sensor and IR LEDs inside. This is probably because the partition between the IR LEDs and the image sensor protrudes out from the plastic dome slightly, to prevent the IR light from being reflected by the dome back to the camera and light sensor. I think that's a well thought out design. I have seen outdoor IR cameras where there's no separation between the IR and the image sensor, causing nighttime image to be pretty washed out. There is a light sensor located below the image sensor. When tilting, only the interior parts move.The camera has DIP switches that allows you to change its address (1 - 16), baud rate (1200, 2400, 4800 or 9600 bps) and protocol (Pelco-D or Pelco-P). You will need different addresses if you have more than one camera with a RS485 control connected to your video recorder.Q-See or Amazon needs to clarify what comes with the package, but assuming what I received is accurate, this is a solidly constructed and well designed camera for outdoor use. It is fairly expensive, however, and I would seriously consider spending an extra $80 (current pricing) for the version with 3x optical zoom.
$review_summary.: Solid construction, pan / tilt feature might be usable with other systems

$review_text.: I bought this case when I did not even have my iPad yet based on reviews here. I actually got it elsewhere at an insanely discounted price. It is professional appearing black leather (slightly dull finish). I was afraid that the constant sliding in and out would rip the seams but 6 months later it is still going strong.It got wet by mistake (a badly closed bottle of water emptied inside my bag - yup my iPad was inside) - what I can say is that my iPad was protected - the leather absorbed much of the water - and the lining was mildly damp. It dried well with only a little crinkling at the corner.Small scuffs are apparent  -but I guess I will just use my leather cleaner on it (will let you know how that goes)Sliding the iPad in and out is a little scary at first (esp on a NY subway)- might fall but I use it as a surface to lay my iPad on - prevents slipping!  Always admiring glances at work and on subway! It is a great product.

$REVIEW.: If you haven't upgraded your computer speakers in a while, this system should do the job very well.  Our first reaction once we turned it on was &#34;man, our other speakers sucked!&#34;.  We have this system hooked up to a kitchen computer and it rocks the house whether we have electronic, dub step or hip hop pop playing.  Although we don't hit the top volumes very often, if you do you may want to buy the next level up (CA-3810) to get the higher wattage.  I could also hear a humming sound when I first hooked up the system, but after adjusting some volume settings on both the computer, and moving some power wires away from the speaker wires, all is good.  The connections in the back of the subwoofer are sensitive and when touched or moved you do get feedback.  For the money, I would definitely buy again.

$REVIEW.: There's really no point to buying theLinksys RE1000unless you've got a portion of your property where you really can't get a wifi signal. Using it to strengthen an existing, usable signal in a remote part of the house is a spotty proposition, at best: for every extra bar of signal you get, you get a commensurate amount of signal drops.In my instance, I have my wifi set up on the first floor and use my PS3 and iPad primarily on the third floor. There's a very low level signal up there, but not so low that it can't connect, and I've never had it outright drop. I set the RE1000 up in an outlet on the third floor and it bumped me up a notch or two in signal strength, but then it dropped signal at least once an hour. Whatever I gained in signal strength, I lost in reliability.On the plus side, it's very, very easy to set-up: plug it into an outlet near your wifi transmitter and run the software on your computer. The software on the included disc said it was incompatible with OS X Lion, so I went to the Web site and downloaded the newest version, which worked immediately.You start the install software and it searches for the RE1000. When your computer finds the extender, it displays all the wifi signals the extender detects and asks which network you'd like to join. Select (and provide your password) and the extender will pair itself to the network in much the same way that Bluetooth devices do. Once the extender is paired, move it to an outlet toward the limits of your wifi range, near the area where you would like to use your devices, then try to connect with your notebook machine, or your tablet, or your game console. If all goes well, you'll see your wifi network just as if you were set up in the same room.I'm in the process of moving, and while my new place has a strong wifi signal, there are places in the house where it's very weak or completely unreliable. I'll try setting up the RE1000 there and then report if it performs better when I'm using it in a manner more appropriate to its design.UPDATE 11/25/11: I've set it up in the new venue and it's performing well. I did discover that I had to restart some devices after setting it up; otherwise, they seemed confused by the choice between the native signal and the extender's wifi.In addition, I had to take my work computer home recently. The wifi hardware switch on it doesn't work, so I had to hook it up with an RJ45 cable run from the computer to the extender. It worked seamlessly, and turned out to be a great feature for me that I never expected I would need.

$REVIEW.: The key to great pictures is having the camera with you when opportunities arise. How many times do you not have the DSLR when a great shot is available. For those of us who don't have time to go looking for photo ops, the key is to have a camera thats always with you.This one takes great shots in every kind of light (has ISO 800, is every bit as versatile as anyone but a pro could possibly need, and is one of the few in this size range to keep an optical viewfinder. That means that a single battery can last through an entire vacation if you use the optical viewfinder for daytime shots. I carry one spare battery, a 1 gig SD card, and can travel anywhere, taking hundreds of perfect shots, because the camera is always in a shirt pocket or on my belt, and I can go days without the need to recharge a battery.  And if you replace your memory card with a high speed memory card you get the pictures taken even faster!

$REVIEW.: Good third-party batteries are probably just as good at storing power. Nikon does not make these Nikon branded EN-EL15 batteries either, but the OEM batteries have the Nikon chip.  The  chip monitors the state of the battery in the camera and when charging, switches from one battery to another seamlessly when you have a second battery in the camera grip.  Third-party MFRs are reverse-engineering the chip, who knows how successfully.The current generation of cameras can shoot all day on one set of batteries and one set of humongous storage cards; I used to have to keep 2 extra batteries charged with my D2x and I was constantly juggling flash cards.  This generation of batteries is just not a big expense in the scheme of things.

$REVIEW.: We bought this a few months ago to protect the screen on our ipad.  It's worked great doing that and has survived several trips to the sea, has been sat on, spilled on, etc. with no impact thanks to the covering.  I'd buy this product again.  I like it because it protects while not causing glare or streaks or causing my finger movement to be impacted.  Those were all concerns I had about using this one and none have caused any problems.

Difficult to get it to work with earlier driver versions but this seems to be a problem with all DisplayLink based products on the market today

The audio works sometimes but other times it crashes the laptop

Since I do not use the audio, I have it disabled now.Update 10/22/2013: The driver issues are now resolved, at least for me


I am not updating the number of stars because the drivers gave me many more problems than I listed in my original review

Sometimes only one of the two external monitors would work
Other times the resolution would change on its own


Sometimes the network connection would lag and this product does not even include a network connection.

$REVIEW.: I have successfully installed four screen protectors (for cell phones) and based on their packaging, I had high hopes for the Armor Suit.First impression:  this is a professional company.  High-quality squeegee and nice presentation of items.The first thing I noticed is that the squirt bottle did not work.  I tried many things, but eventually poured the liquid to another spray bottle so I could continue with the installation.I followed the instructions and thought I had a perfect installation--but the next morning, I find more than 20 air bubbles.  These bubbles are about 1/4" in size (pencil eraser), but two are the size of a dime!  They are far too large to disappear, I believe, and it seems that installing such a large screen protector requires:  a clean room; a bio suit; and 20 years of experience.I now have to decide if I want to try a re-installation or simply remove.  It really looks like trash.I would avoid.

$REVIEW.: I was looking specifically for a 67-72mm step up ring, but the price on this product was so low, that I bought these instead.  This step-up ring set is made of all metal, the threading makes attaching and detaching from the lens / filter fairly effortless.  Storage is very easy, since the rings all screw together, making a tidy little cone.  I have zero complaints about the filter ring set.  One caveat is that you may not be able to use your lens hood while a larger filter is attached; this isn't so much a problem with the ring set, but a configuration that wasn't accounted for by the lens manufacturer.  If a lens hood is an absolute requirement, then there are screw mount lens hoods on the market that will attach to these as well.  With the low cost and high utility of this ring set, I would consider it a "must-have" for any photographer's toolbox.

$review_text.: I thought this was a great item when I got it.  I was able to set it up at my home and then send them out to the Grandparents and it would just work.  It was an easy setup for the grandparents who are 1000's of miles away, this would bring them a little closer to the grandchildren.  It worked great for 6 months until I got the first call that the "screen was all white".  Ok then I tried to trouble shoot it with my parents on the phone, no luck there!  But I'll just send then mine (I bought 3) I had not used it that much since I got it, I mainly used it just to check how things would look on our parents frames.  Well I plugged mine in and guess what another white screen!Two identical Kodak digital frames displaying the exact same issue.  What are the chances of that happening? There is no was that this is a coincidence.  This is has to be a manufacturer defect. So It looks like I am out a few hundred dollars.Not cool, I am just waiting for the next call to come in from the other parents we gave them to.I would not recommend this frame to anyone. ( I would if it had kept working as it was easy for the children to send photos to the grandparent)UPDATE: 1/19/2014  The last one that was working has now died!

The lights are nice and light, energy saving and nice diffusion
I wish there was a starter manual and instructions though, maybe of some basic lighting tips for people who aren't familiar with it and on how to put it together


Also what would be nice is a way to stretch the backdrops a bit, it's tough to iron all the time

$review_text.: There was a strong static field created when I removed the protective cover.  This static electricity attracted lint and tiny bits of dirt that ended up becoming tiny unremovable bubbles.  This happened with both of the original two skins I purchased.  Assuming that I had been careless, I ordered another package of two.  Even though I was very, very careful, my results with the second pair of skins was no better than the first.  I will freely admit that I am very picky but these results were unacceptable to me.  I am going to try another brand.MAJOR UPDATEAfter reading the website of a competing product, I learned the method to eliminate lint from the installation.  I have found that this is a problem that is commonplace in all of these products.  The solution is to install the product and then place a small bit of tape on the outside edge near any lint that needs to be removed.  This piece of tape becomes the "handle" to lift the edge in order to remove lint as follows.  Use the tape "handle" to peel back the skin to expose the lint.  Use another piece of tape curved backwards into a loop exposing the sticky side to touch and remove each piece of lint.  I find that wide packaging clear tape seems to work best for me.  I have been able to successfully remove all pieces of lint and so I am upgrading this review to five stars.

$review_text.: While there's much to love with the Sony A7 mirrorless camera, especially it's value proposition.  The limited selection of accessories such as flashes and the prices they fetch were a bit off putting.  That being said, I still bought this flash, and it holds its own to some of the best from Canon and Nikon.There's much to love, including power, video light, easy enough interface (sadly this isn't the norm with flashes), and the uber cool &#34;cobra&#34; design (seem so obvious now, but no one else ever seemed to do it).  The power simply is immense, and while I don't have guide number handy, it seems noticeably better than my SB-900 (for my Nikon).  Suffice to say it's power is pro level.  I haven't used the built in LCD much for video, but I've wanted such an option in the past, and I'll be putting it use soon enough.  I don't shoot portrait shots much, but this flash's &#34;cobra&#34; pivoting head makes the whole affair (including bouncing off of a ceiling) easier than any other flash I've used (without a $200+ bracket and cord setup).These pros are offset with cons.  Numerous reports of overheating, though my like SB-900, I haven't experienced them myself.  I'm not a &#34;pro&#34; and don't put demands on my gear as much as one might in the press or at weddings, so ymmv.  Likewise, I usually use the big heavy light modifier that is a ceiling, where other devices may restrict airflow for cooling.  Anyway, I certainly don't like worrying about overheating.  Another con is the wireless setup, which still is a bit behind some of the other solutions, and a lack of sync cord socket doesn't help.  It's still very usable with the right mindset (though if going manual for remote flashes, there are WAY cheaper options).  The biggest issue I had is that the high speed sync is limited to the forward facing position exclusively.  I rarely have the flash facing directly at my subjects, and I often use this flash on the camera's body.All in all this is a a bit like Sony's overall story.  Exceptional in some regards (design innovation), solid in most, and misses the mark in a few correctable ways.  I'm rather optimistic, but I'd be more pleased with this current offering at a lower price.

$review_text.: I really like this little device.  Build is first rate with redundant LAN and power connections as well as the best drive mechanism in the class which forgoes caddies while securely locking the drives in place.  You also get a LCD display up front, though honestly I've never used it.  It's all rather quiet, and thus far has offered bullet proof reliability.  My needs have me using this as a storage server, not for real time use.  I've found that I can get 40MB/S writes consistently, which is well below my Synology (8 drive array, so not a fair comparison).  That being said, it's still rather fast, but I wouldn't want to run a database off of it or edit media files stored on it.  Neither really seems to be the intended use.Compared to Synology (I have an 1812+, but others work similarly):Pros* Available with WD Red drives (great drives) or bring your own* Easy drive installation without caddies (best I've seen)* Much faster initial setup* Simpler interface* Redundant power & lan (vs redundant lan only)* Significantly less expensiveCons* Limited extended functionality & apps* Not expandable to additional enclosures* Traditional RAID (0, 1, 10, 5) as opposed to more scalable solutions* No file manager* Much slower (I can use the Synology for my Lightroom files, which I cannot with the WD)note some of these cons can be quite significant for some users and not at all an issue for othersCompared to Seagate Business Storage Windows Server 4-Bay NAS (more of an apples to apples comparison)Pros* Easy drive installation without caddies (best I've seen)* Much faster (and easier) initial setup (Seagate requires a keyboard and monitor)* Simpler interface (Seagate's Windows Storage Server 8 can become quite overwhelming)* Redundant power & lan (vs redundant lan only)* Significantly less expensiveCons* Limited extended functionality & apps* Traditional RAID (0, 1, 10, 5) as opposed to more scalable solutions* No file managerCompared to a two drive array (like the WD My Cloud EX2)Pros* More efficient redundancy of raid 5 (lose 25% of capacity vs 50%)* Faster reads and writes (no scientific testing, but I own and use both)* Redundancy of LAN and power connections* Greater capacityCons* Higher priceI highly recommend that people back up their data and they do so with redundancy (using RAID isn't a backup in itself, but your backup should have redundancy).

I'm sorry that I took the advice.Let me share some pros and cons.PROS:1.  Looks good2.  Decent performance (I can run MS Office on it).3.  Nice bright screenCONS:1.  Asus boasts 8.5 hours in battery life, I'm lucky to get 5.5 hours2.  The little nubs on the bottom of the netbook needed to keep it from sliding around on a hard surface constantly fall out and need to be re-attached, assuming you can find them.  You then need to superglue them back on, which only lasts a week or two.3.  The keys on the keyboard don't have much depth so the feel is very hard and very "plasticky" (is that a word?)4.  The mousepad has no depth and just some little raised brail bumps with no clear separation of the pad and the rest of the keyboard rest.6.  The keyboard freezes up least once a week.If I had a chance to do it over again, I would definitely not buy the ASUS EEPC.

$REVIEW.: With any memory card I buy I always run a couple tests with it before bringing it on any shoot no matter how insignificant the shoot is. First quick format, then low level format, then record video until the entire card is full. Play back video. Then format and record again to make sure everything still works good. If it passes the test with out any corrupt files or weirdness going on, then the card is allowed to come with me to a shoot.I've picked up two of these cards thus far. Both passed my testing, so they've both been used on live event shoots (where a corrupt card could mean the difference between being paid and being sued) and they've done great. Currently looking into a double redundancy system because you never know.Lesson 1: Always test cards before they could potentially lose you money or footage/photos.Lesson 2: Anything can happen.

$review_text.: This 10-port hub lives up to all the hype: superb
 (After two weeks; knock on wood that it lasts.)  It works, and works well


 Aside from that -- and that is, after all, the most important feature of all, which is why I'm giving it so high a rating -- here are some thoughts.What I like: (1) The ports are spaced far apart enough that dongles and cords don't crowd each other out, yet no so far apart that the unit is unwieldy


 (2) The power brick is smaller and less bulky than typical
 Nice

 (3) Ten ports is awesome
 I'm using seven full time, which gives me three for temporary plug-ins, such as flash drives


 (4) The two "pop-up" ports is a nice feature.What I don't like that much: (1) The blue "power on" light is more than a bit much


 Couldn't they have made it a little blue dot, like the size, say, of the volume button on an iphone?  Very obtrusive
 Taping it over, as some have suggested, is ugly -- much, much worse than the annoying light
 (2) The logo, "Pluggable," is absurdly huge, also hideous in aesthetic terms

 Please

 "Pluggable" isn't exactly "Coca Cola" or the Apple apple

 No one cares about "Pluggable."  (3) Unbelievable that the designers -- wait, *were* there designers?  I doubt it -- anyway, unbelievable that the designers didn't make it possible for the unit to stand on end/upright, with the aid of legs of some sort


 We used to do that for cpu's until manufacturers figured out that most people preferred a small footprint
 The footprint of this hub is big -- and it need not have been


 A major, major oversight.In any event, design flaws in a usb hub aren't exactly deal breakers the way they'd be in, say, an MP3 player, or a car, so who cares

 I'm happy with it and happy, per usual, with Amazon's filling of the order and delivery.

First, this bag has many pockets and I can easily pack up all my stuff into it. The large main pocket is huge. The pockets also have nice felt linings to keep things protected.I bike commute to grad school and this holds everything I need. My 15.6 in HP laptop fits in the back pocket. I put the power cord in one of the side pockets. In the main compartment I store my tablet, logitech keyboard, and textbooks (2). The side pockets hold my other chargers and cords that I need. The front small pocket I keep my keys, phone, wallet, and pens/pencils. With all of this stuff there is still plenty of room.The handle on top of the bag is large and sturdy and even when my bag is packed full, it doesn't feel like it's going to break or rip.This bag is also very comfortable to wear whether it's packed light or heavy. I've put all my other bags into storage for now because this is the only bag I want to use.

$review_text.: Seems OK, so far, but no documented warranty and I can't get the GPS to work
 Will try it for the next couple of weeks and see if I keep it or it goes back


 No easy way to contact the vendor, hope they contact me on my issueUpdate one week later:I took the flash drive out and put it in the PC and it works very nicely
 This is not HD and you can't read a license plate on the car in front of you but for the money seems very nice
 GPS is now working fineIt does link just fine with Google maps and shows the exact speed during replay
 would be nice to have once my kids get to driving age and also nice in the event of a speeding or other ticket.It does record audio unless you turn it off, the interior camera is pretty lame but still does film just fine


 Does have a night vision for the interior of the car but only lights a small areaYou can encrypt the flash drive giving you control on the videos.Will do another update in a month

$REVIEW.: First, here's what I like about this Q-See QT5716.1. The cameras are solid, weatherproof, and produce clear, colorful video. It's not HD but it's more than good enough for a security system. The infrared capability is quite good. I'm not sure of the maximum range but it allows the cameras to surveil my driveway, yard, and porches at night. Of course, the infrared makes it possible for an intruder to spot the camera but that's ok. I don't mind having a deterrent.2. Love having 12 cameras.3. Love the remote view. I can start and stop recording and change a myriad of settings using my Google Nexus 5. Very nice.4. Love the 1 tb drive in the DVR. With the various quality modes and bit rates, I can capture many hours of video before overwriting.5. Love that everything I needed to get it up and running was in the box (minus the tools, of course).6. Love the HDMI and VGA ports.Things that need work:1. The UPNP setup for remove viewing failed for me. I have an Actiontec Router with UPNP enabled. Didn't work. That meant I had to configure my router's DMZ and use port forwarding.2. Weak instructions if the UPNP fails. I followed the instructions but they did not work. I enabled remote viewing after doing internet research and some trial and error.3. The interface is a bit clunky and dated. Support for a wireless keyboard would be nice.This is a large system. It takes time to install and set everything up. But it's worth it.

.I would like the 5star reviewer who says he is getting 10MB/s to prove it.I started at 6 and went significantly down from there, averaging about 5/MB per second


.taking over an hour to transfer 29GB from a 3.0 drive to the 2.0 drive, for safekeeping, as these are films


As far as how good it is, or how long it is going to last, I have no idea


The fact that it does not have a traditional white strip, indicating USB 2.0, but a black one, indicating what? may be something


Maybe it is really a 1.1 compatible device

Who knows

I bought 2 and have not opened the second one, as I am seriously considering returning it, as I do not feel it functions as advertised
I'm giving it 2 stars, hoping it continues to function at that level, which is about what I consider it to be
I am used to things going a lot faster.

$review_text.: Great Performance...This card has breathed new life into my aging PC.  I installed this in a PC with a Socket 754 Sempron64 3100+ CPU.  Running Win XP Pro with 1.5GB RAM.  Replaced an NVidia 6200.  This PC is used as an HTPC and is connected to a projection TV via Component Video.  I do not play any games on it, just run SageTV software with multiple TV capture devices.  My old video card was unable to playback 1080i MPEG-2 or any HD-h.264 videos.  This Diamond ATI Radeon HD4650 AGP card plays everything flawlessly (provided I am using codecs that are able to use hardware acceleration) with either Overlay mode or VMR-9 Renderless (Full Screen Exclusive).  Regular VMR-9 works when playing back in windowed mode, but there is some stuttering during full-screen playback of HD MPEG-2 content with plain VMR-9.Using the ATI MPEG codec with DXVA hardware acceleration to play back MPEG-2 content full-screen on a 1080i TV, CPU usage maxes out at about 45% for 1080i content, 40% for 720p, and 20% for 480i.  Using the MPC-HC h.264 codec to play a 720p file required only about 15% CPU.  I am still unable to watch Hulu content at full screen, but this is because there are currently no hardware accelerated codecs for playing back FLASH content, and my Sempron 3100 just doesn't have enough power to handle it.Questionable Specs...The picture shown on the Amazon page is still incorrect.  The installation guide has a diagram that looks like the picture on Amazon's website, but it's wrong too.  The card has 2 DVI connectors and one round S-Video connector.  The package includes 1 DVI to VGA adapter, 1 DVI to HDMI adapter, 1, S-Video to Composite adapter, and 1 S-Video to Component (HDTV) adapter.  The heat-sink and fan look different too.  Oh, and the PCB is green, not red.The Box says 512MB DDR2 on the front, but the side of the box says 512MB DDR3.  Inside the Catalyst Control Panel, it reports the card as having DDR2 memory.  The Diamond website lists it as DDR3.  There are several other manufactures building HD4650 cards, but from what I can tell all the others used DDR2 (though some had 1024MB).The Diamond Website says a 300W power supply is required, but the box says 400W.  All the other manufacturers that make HD4650 cards seem to recommend 400W.  My computer has a 300W supply, and it seems to be OK.Poor Power Connector Design...The card requires more power than the AGP bus can provide, so it has an auxiliary power connector (6-pin, 12V).  It also includes a 6-pin to 4-pin molex adaptor, in case you have an older power supply that doesn't have one of the 6-pin connectors.  The problem is that this connector is on the front of the card (top-left) and sticks straight out.  There is no way to plug power into this card without interfering with the first PCI slot on most ATX or mini-ATX motherboards.  I was fortunate that I could put a half-height card in that first slot, because a full height card not fit next to this video card.  It's a shame they did this, because it is otherwise a nice single-slot card.  There are a couple of other manufactures building these HD4650 cards, but they all appear to have the power connector in the same place.  It would be much better if they rotated the connector 90 degrees or mounted it on the back of the board.This is a medium-sized video card.  Length-wise, this card just barely fits in my Silverstone LC-17 case.  It is a little longer than the old 6200 video card it is replacing.  Even with the fan it does fit in a single slot, but as mentioned above, the power connector is likely to interfere with one of your PCI slots.The fan is super quiet (even with the case open and my head a few inches away, I can't hear it over the LC-17 case fans.One other note, when you first set the card up, you must connect a monitor to one of the DVI connectors (you can use the VGA adaptor).  You cannot get the HDTV output setup correctly the first time if you just connect it straight to the Component HDTV connector.  Once you get it setup, you can disconnect the monitor and everything works great.Bottom line...Although there are some discrepancies between the data published at Amazon's website, Diamond's website, and the product packaging, and the power connector is layed out poorly, I am happy with the performance I am getting with the card.

$REVIEW.: I used to have the linksys version of this router (gigabit, wireless N, single band) a while back but switched to a netgear for dual band. I didn't really like that one and wanted to switch back so I bought this M20 refurbished. The big problem is that reliability is really important to me since some members of my household use VPN to do work at home. This refurbished router kept dropping the connection and restarting so I sent it back and ordered what I thought was another one but I mistakenly bought an M10. Anyway after a while I decided to upgrade to the M20 again because the rest of my network infrastructure is gigabit. I got another refurbished one and it did the same thing so I sent it back. Now I won't buy another refurbished one.

$review_text.: There's a lot of good functionality built into this unit.  It has pretty much the widest variety of connectors that I've seen on any cable tester.  There are two of each connector:  for each pair one is an "output" and one is an "input" connector.  Output connectors transmit a funny digital test signal, and the input connectors detect this signal and display the results (of which pins on one end of the cable are attached to which pins on the other) on the LED matrix.  You attach one end of a cable to any output connector and the other end to any input connector -- so you can have different connectors on each end of the cord.o You can test a cable with different connectors on the ends.o There is a row of "intermittent" LEDs next to the matrix.  You connect a cable, press the reset button, the wiggle the cable.  If any of the wires are intermittent the corresponding LED will light.  You can repeat this at will to track down a problem spot.o There is a built-in tone generator.  It generates a reasonably clean squarewave at either 440 or 1,000 Hz.  There's a slide switch that selects one of three volume levels, but the output levels are not quite correct:  The peak-to-peak output levels are: "-50MIC"=> 280mV (I think about 28mV would be more realistic),  "-10dBV => 3.0V (should be 0.9V), +4dBu => 3.2V (this is about right).o There is a way to test for shorts in a cable.o There is a way to test cables where the far end can't be plugged into the tester:  you short pins on the other end then test for shorts.o The two pins on the side labeled "SPEAKON" are banana jacks, but are not the standard 3/4" apart so can't be used for testing dual banana plugs.o The LED matrix can only test three pins at a time.  So if you are testing a cable with a plug that has more than three pins (e.g a MIDI or an ethernet plug) then there's a workaround:  The mysterious slide switch that is not described in the manual and whose positions are labeled "SW1", "SW2" and "SW3" is used for this.  The first position lets you test the first three pins of a connector, the second position lets you test the second three pins, and the third position lets you test the third set of three pins.o The LED matrix looks identical to the one on the Behringer CT100 cable tester.  The two units look identical except this one has way more connectors.  I can't believe but that they're the same design and made in the same factory, so I'd buy this one because it tests more connector types.o The instructions (which are printed on the box) don't mention that you need to install two AA batteries.o The box is painted steel, made with reasonable precision, with some scuff marks.  The PC boards inside are clean and well-soldered.  There are some mechanical hacks in the construction:  for example some of the connectors have plastic parts crudely trimmed off to fit, and the sliders of the slide switches have been partly clipped off to make them fit through the narrow, short slots through which they protrude.  I get the impression of these being built by a garage-type operation, but none of these things looks like they would affect reliability or longevity.  I'm confident this will be a rugged and long-lasting tool.

Hopefully the next iteration will be slimmer with faster download and upload wireless speeds with increased video codec support.

It definitely more of a slow to trickle charger ( Which is good for most batteries anyway).  If you are in  a frantic rush and need to cycle through batteries fast this might not be for you.  But if every few weeks/months you throw your cells on for a few hours/overnight, you should be fine.I only had a pair of  18650  3.4 mAh cells to charge.

$review_text.: I fell into an amazing deal on this unit (a hair over $200).Had I paid full price, my overall rating would have been lower.This NAS was easy to set up

 No witchcraft required.For some reason when I boot my PS3, it sees the NAS as a Microsoft network storage device, and thus it will not read the data correctly


 My only recourse is to reboot the NAS every time I want to access the files via my PS3


 After rebooting the NAS, the PS3 correctly identifies it


 I'm guessing this is a Sony issue, since every other device I have correctly identifies and reads the NAS
 Streaming movies to the PS3 has been flawless.Reboot time is pretty slow

 I haven't timed it, but I'm guessing it's about 2-3 minutes.File transfer rates are strange
 On my wireless N network, transfers from my laptop to the NAS are acceptable, but when I want to move files from one user folder on the NAS to another, the speed drops to very unacceptable levels
 For instance, this morning I was transferring a 1.2GB CAD file from one user to another


 The first attempt reported it would take an hour!  The second attempt reported 35 minutes


 It is currently transferring with a reported 22 minutes left
 Totally unacceptable.I have connected several different external hard drives and each of them has been detected and connected to without any issues.Others have reported that the unit is noisy


 I wouldn't want to try to sleep in the same room with it, but other than that the noise is acceptable.Overall, it's a fairly decent network storage devices, but I wouldn't pay more than $300 for it.

$review_text.: I already had the Sigma 150-500mm OS zoom, which has proven to be a good performer and given me many great images


The semi-macro shots posted online provided by users of this lens made me curious and I ordered one to see for myself.First up


The finish seems a bit more "professional" than the gritty gray of the 150-500
It seems a bit more tight in movements (yet smooth)as it is a bit more expensive and a bit longer in zoom and a bit closer in minimum focus
All those bits add up to the most universal zoom in my kit
Done with good sharpness and color saturation typical of Sigma
The OS is quieter and the weight is not bad--with a 1D it hangs nicely balanced from the strap pin on the tripod foot.It is now my favorite walkaround lens.

The pair I had before this set cost 3 times as much and were ruined in just 1 months from all the sweat.These have lasted 2 months so far so I'm not complaining.  Good audio quality, they fit inside the ears really good (the funny shape helps) and so far I don't have a single complaint.*update*I own two pairs of these now, one for work, one for home/gym.  Both pairs are still working great, they're comfortable for me, and I actually managed to convert my girlfriend over recently from over-ear headphones to these. They were the first pair she tried that 'worked' for her, stayed in her ear, and felt comfortable.I'm sure you could get better sound quality out of a 20-100 dollar pair, but for the gym (where they can break from sweat or getting pulled) or quick listening while at work (Where they can get lost or stolen) these are ideal in cost and efficiency.

I've tested all three inputs and they all work fine.But if you need all three (or even only two of the three) I would recommend the three in one over individual adapters.

$REVIEW.: I bought the Radtech Procable Shortz Dock Extender to use with my Cleave iPhone 4s case. The standard iPhone charger fits in this case, however due to the cases design I cannot use it in any docks or with my Pioneer stereos fatter ipod cable. The Shortz Dock Extender allows for charging and data transfer without a hitch. Design wise, the quality of the materials would be above average, however I would imagine over time if you were to use it with in a dock the plastic would start getting loose or the actual 30 pin plug would get damaged due to the weight of the phone causing it to flex. I gave it 4/5 stars because it is pretty expensive compared to the cheaper offerings that work exactly the same. I would say the build quality is only slightly better than the Cosmos variation, however you can get 3 for the price of one of the Radtech. Mind you both haven't "failed or cracked open yet" but its my feeling that it would happen over time.Either way, it solved my problem and I'm happy with how the product operates.
$SUMMARY.: Works like a charm but is $$$ compared to other cheaper offerings that work the same

If I were to drop my lens with this attached to the back I probably wouldn't need worry too much .P.S. My sony A550 came with a zoom kit lens 18mm-55mm. For whatever reason they decided to ship the lens with an extremely thin and flimsy rear cap so I ordered this a few days ago.

$REVIEW.: This is a great access point for making the connection between your Iphone or Ipad to a wired internet connection. I carry one with me on all my travels and use it in Hotels that only have a wired connection for the internet. It is small and easy to carry and has excellent range for such a small unit. It was easy to set up and has been very stable over the last eight months I have used it. Highly recomended if you travel with an Ipad and never have to worry about not being able to connect in situations where you only have a wired connection. Also nice that it allows multiple devices to connect at once so you can be updating or Skyping on the Iphone and using your Ipad at the same time.Apple iPad MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)Apple iPad Tablet (64GB, Wifi)Apple iPad Tablet (32GB, Wi-Fi)Apple iPad MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)Apple iPad MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)Apple iPad Tablet (64GB, Wifi)

$review_text.: Having checked out several TV's before Christmas, I only found two really good ones that all the critics were raving about. One was a Sony and the other a Samsung. All the techs I spoke with gave these TV's excellent grades. Simply put, you could get the same excellent picture with this Samnsung model A650 as you would with a high end Sony .... but at a cheaper price. Although the picture quality is excellent, you first have to make some adjustments to see that. Pre set factory default settings can be made better by your own adjustments. This set also has the ability to control sound so it keeps the volume constant when those sometimes annoying commercials come on that raise you out of your seat. There are many great features with this TV that work even better when you compliment it with a matching DVD ( also bought a new Samsung VCR/DVD recorder combo). When the telenet option kicks in, you can use one remote (either TV or dvd) to control both sets. The remote that came with the TV is excellent with larger numbers to see. It also has a button that will light up the remote for use at night ... nice feature!I would have given this set 5 stars but I found some minor problems (this set might still deserve 5 stars and maybe I'm too critical). For one thing, picture quality is the sharpest as long as you do not sit any closer than 6 feet. Any closer and there seems to be some distortion. Farther away than 6 feet (up to 18 feet), the picture quality is outstanding. If you're use to watching your set real close than simply buy a 32inch instead. I also noticed that not all channels come in sharp, however I've found out this is not the fault of the set but of the broadcasting channel. The tv sound system is very good but they could have made the bass sound a little deeper and more powerful. You can make this even better by hooking up a theater sound system which results the viewing in a movie theater atmosphere. This set also has the 120mhgz picture speed (others only 60mghz) which catches any blur and smooths them out. I really didn't notice this much as a problem but those who watch a lot of sports (and watch the baseball fly through the air) might appreciate this TV option to stop any blur in movement. Side angle viewing is also excellent allowing up to 180 degree.One last thing ... don't confuse this model with all models of Samsung. Walmart and many other stores were pushing the model 500 or 550T over the Christmas holiday for about a $1000. Those sets do not have all the options, and plugs jacks that the model 650 has. Further, the picture quality and pixel speed are not as good or as fast as with the 650. Don't simply buy a brand and assume they all look and behave alike. Check them out by model numbers and read reviews and product options before making any choice. Sometimes by just spending a couple hundred dollars more will make a tremendous difference and make your viewing more enjoyable. I was also surprised to find a small note in the shipping box that alerted me to the fact my TV might have screen burn in problems if the same picture doesn't move for two hours. I had thought that LCD's didn't have this problem but apparently they do as the old tube sets. Not really a problem unless you use the set for video games and walk a away for a few hours without turning the set off.All in all, I found this set to be really remarkable. It is worth the price and even more if you can get it at a sale price.(As a side note ... my best price was found at Amazon.com)

$REVIEW.: This is great if you just want to get a clearer picture of something not too far away.  You're not going to be getting a high magnification but the best part with these is due to the wide view and lower magnification you will not get any of the shakiness that you get with normal binoculars.  So you don't need a tripod, this is great for people who just want a closer look and for those who don't have perfectly steady hands (which is most of us).

$review_text.: not all wireless desktop sets are created equal.  For some, you are better off with a wired alternative because the signal transmission is so bad they do not work beyond a few inches.  This desktop set 3000 is one of very few truly wireless ones because  it works perfectly across our living room with a distance well beyond 3 yards.  The transceiver is actually plugged into the back of our computer which is almost backed up against a wall and blocked by the TV, the LCD monitor, the tower itself and a subwoofer, but as you can see, I am able to type this review without any problems.The bluetrack mouse is another amazing thing.  When I first bought it, I didn't care about this blue track technology and thought it was just a marketing buzzword, but soon I began to appreciate its ability to operate on almost any surfaces.One down-side of this desktop set, is that the transceiver is much fatter than the dent under the mouse, so when you are trying to tuck everything away, the transceiver doesn't fit under the mouse, so the mouse doesn't sit flat. kind of awkward, as if the mouse was design to be used with a much thinner transceiver, but for what the reason, they threw in this fatty instead at the last minute.Another down-side is the lack of a physical switch to turn on and off the keyboard and the mouse when not in use to conserve batteries.But as long as it can operate across our living room without any problems, I am happy with it.
$SUMMARY.: a true wireless desktop set

$REVIEW.: Being my first in-ceiling install, I wasn't expecting much from the overall sound quality compared to good old fashion floor standing speakers
 The only reason for going to the ceiling for this project is the room design did not fit for floor speakers, also to some degree the listeners were not as concerned with high fidelity in the room


 Installation of the speakers was straight forward and easy


 Only recommendation for DIY folks is to buy foam"hats" to go over the the back part of the speaker to keep insulation and other debris from falling onto the cone...Parts Express carries them but read my reviews there to make sure you get the right size


 Any case, the sound from these was truly remarkable even to a sound snob like me


 I should mention that I set the base cutoff at 120Hz and used a separate Yamaha YST-FSW150 subwoofer (Crutchfield) so was not using these to drive the lower frequencies


 Nice flat response from 120Hz up to 10KHz (didn't test beyond since the primary listener, age 70+, hearing cut out ~6.5KHz).One of the problems I knew I was going to encounter was mounting these close to the wall (center 16" from wall)...not by choice but due to the ceiling beams


 What I really liked is there is a switch on these that lets you adjust for this situation
 What I found in our case was the wall was solid (insulation me thinks) and by adjusting the base crossover a little higher than normal that I did not need to use this setting.Total config was three Polk Audio TC80i (Amazon - best price by far) in the front, two TC60i (Crutchfield) surround, and the Yamaha subwoofer in a recessed home theatre cabinet
 Most definitely recommend for a good sound at mid-price point.

$SUMMARY.: Awesome sound for the price!

$REVIEW.: Charger-City Exclusive Google Nexus 7 Android Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet 7" eReader Desk Desktop Holder and Dashboard Windshield Suction Mount with 2 way Angle Adjustment.Just received this item. First this mount is made by ARKON. There is nothing exclusive about this mount, just a universal mount. The overall feel of the product gives the impression of cheap plastic. The tabs that hold the tablet slide into a slot on the top and bottom of the main holder. The tabs flex easily and feel like they could break with too much pressure(May be why this unit comes with an extra set of tabs).The bottom tab section is attached to an internal spring. This pulls down and the tension is what holds your tablet in place. The tabs (made at a slight angle) have rubber feet which also helps to hold the tablet. I've held the mount with my Nexus 7 at various angles and positions. So far it held my tablet without any slipage. The base is solid and the plastic feels thicker and stronger. I've pulled on the mount and the suction feels strong.If the tablet holding section had been made as well as the base and a more secure way of holding the tablet I would have gone with 4 stars. But, since this would be holding my "precious" I don't trust this enough to use with my nexus 7.

$review_text.: Not sure I can say enough good things about this router. I'm getting a strong signal, and using the 5Ghz band I'm getting far faster speeds than I did with either my previous router (a 2.4GHz wireless-N) or the 2.4Ghz band on this router. I'm guessing that's not typical I'm using it in a university setting, and am now getting well over 100Mbps).Didn't need the configuraton CD. It did take me a few minutes to figure out how to set it up, as I didn't have a laptop to hook up to it and wanted to place it away from my desktop computer. The quick setup directions only tell you how to configure it by plugging in your computer via an ethernet port, but here's how to do it remotely: Plug in and turn on the router, including the wifi (there's a button on the back). Log onto one of the wifi networks it creates, and use the passwork located on the bottom of the router. Then, type the router's default IP address (which is stated in the user manual available either online or in the provided CD) and you're in. The config menu is straightforward, well designed, and easy to use. Change the name of the networks, update the password to something even more secure, change whether you're broadcasting the SSID, etc... all quite convenient. Tons of advanced features as well, in both the menu settings and the hardware itself. I'll report back once I've had a chance to add a printer to the network, which you can do either via ethernet (if your printer includes networking capabiliy) or USB (if it doesn't). Nice to be able to network a non-network printer. You can also use the USB port to add an external hard drive. I've gotta try that too.Anyway, blazing fast, easy to use, and cheaper than brands that just suck more (I've had trouble with Belkin and D-Link products, for instance). If you're thinking about a new router, this would be a good choice.

$REVIEW.: Memory Stick is a Sony thing
When you buy a non-Sony memory stick product your fear is compatibility


Well, I just bought this 8G memory stick for use in my new Sony Webbie HD Camcorder


It works perfectly.I choose an 8G card expecting the Webbie HD to chew up space like crazy, but, I have found that the MP4 compression and lower bit rate of the Webbie is friendly to memory stick capacity


In fact, for my purposes, I could have used a 2 or 4G stick and been happy.I also like the eco-friendly packaging for this product
Mostly cardboard with only the smallest plastic covering
Nice!

$review_text.: This Cables to Go FlexUSB adapter works as expected for USB devices, and through my USB hub. No issues with speed or connectivity. Where it disappoints is in construction quality. The plastic housing surrounding the portions that permit the adapter to adjust its angle are of a low quality plastic that is neither glued, nor engineered to hold together well. The plastic casing bends readily, and in joint I've already noticed the plastic breaking, despite only having exercised the full range of motion once or twice to get the desired angle I needed. Super Glue seems to have solved that concern though.

$review_text.: It's big, it's bulky, and you can't carry it while you're roller blading, but the GE Superradio has the best AM and FM reception of just about ANY  portable radio on the market, short of a $500 Lowe


It's especially valued  for its sensitive AM reception (it's a favorite of AM broadcast band  &quot;DXers&quot; chasing distant stations) but the FM reception is nearly  as good


Spend some time listening to it in the evening and you'llbe amazed  how many AM stations are out there that you never suspected existed.After I loaned mine to a builder friend working on my house, he ran out  and bought one; his old job site radio just couldn't get his favorite  stations
He listens to it at home now, too

For the money there's just  nothing else that even comes close.

$review_text.: I used this to install a Kenwood Excelon 6990HD into my 2008 Toyota Sienna. The pre-drilled holes lined up perfectly with my head unit. The kit fits into the dash very well. As mentioned before, the finish is just a tad different than the stock dash, but it's not bad enough that it looks out of place. Unlike D. Wu, I used the kit's trim ring rather than the ring that came with the Kenwood. Personal preference.

$review_text.: It advertises that it will take an external USB drive, it will not, with exceptions.  First the hard drive you connect to the front of the machine must be formatted with Fat 32 according to Sony technical support.  Well Fat 32 format has been abandoned and isn't even an option for formatting a drive in windows 7.  If you were able to format in Fat32 it would have a size limit of 32 GB.  Pretty small for a hard drive.  So Sony says it will take a USB drive on the box and in the instruction manual.  It will and it will not.  Pretty cheap sales trick if you ask me.  I put my movies on a small hard drive and this unit won't play them.  So the lesson learned here is the salesman is a liar at least at Sony

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my 10 year old.  He wanted the new ipod nano just so he could see what songs were playing.  I saw this and thought it would be better considering all the things it said it did.  Well it does do those things, but it is a little misleading.  I thought it took pictures, but it doesn't you can load pictures on it.  It says you can rotate pictures so I thought it was like the ipod you just turned the screen, nope you have to manually turn the pictures.  I still haven't learned to add videos because the manual is VERY bad.  I still haven't gotten the radio to pick up a single station.  The only game that is on it is one of those rotate the picture games that will never be played.  The sound is good, that part is correct. So if you have a lot of time to figure out how to download everything I guess this could be as good as the ipod.  I am hoping this will be good enough for him for the time being.  At least he will be able to see what songs are playing!

$REVIEW.: This device does many things well except one, NAVIGATE.It shows pictures very clearly, it plays music quite nicely but 9 out of 10 times it cannot get you from point A to point B without major confusion.Every negative review I have read about this device, I am afraid is true.Slow processor, unacceptably sloooow, poor maps and even worse navigating algorithms


Maps shows all the names of parallel streets but hardly ever the names of intersections (which are the ones that really count, the other stuff is just clutter).I you are looking for a good portable device that plays mP3s and shows good pictures (the display is top notch)then you may consider it, although there many nice players out there and a lot chaper (and smaller to boot).If you are looking for a GPS system, forget it, don't buy yourself a headache.I returned mine to Amazon!

$review_text.: The Plantronics DSP-400 is a good quality USB headset. On Macs there are no drivers to install, they work great right out of the box. The sound quality is excellent and they are terrific for Internet telephony via Skype (see [...]for software). The headset collapses and folds in half to make carrying in a computer bag easier, however, this set of hinges also makes it feel flimsy. I've been using it successfully for over a month with no problems. If I was buying today I'd opt for the slightly more expensive DSP-500 as they seem a bit sturdier than the -400 model as they don't fold and seem to have a more ridgid construction. Aside from that feature, this headset is a good bargain and the sound quality for telephony or just listening to music is terrific. The earphones rest comfortabley on top of the ear and allow for ambient room sound to enter, which is good in an office environment so you can hear your co-workers when they come into your office.

$review_text.: I understand the limitations of buying a 'cheap' speaker set, but I can still always hope for great sound.  These speakers deliver good sound, with sufficient volume and adequate bass.  The biggest problem, as other reviews state, is that the bass can not be adjusted independently of the volume.  This results in a fair amount of songs being too 'boomy'.  However, I use these every day to connect to my tablet and play Pandora in my gym area, and for that they work well.  I'm holding back the 5th star for the lack of bass control.

$review_text.: Was previously using the G500, but after going to the g9x It is almost like walking on water with a mouse. The g9x fix in your hand like a glove and you dont have to worry about odd finger placement. Don't get me wrong, I loved the g500 and for some it is a better mouse, but my right ring finger and pink just didnt sit on the g500 right and it at times felt awkward to use the mouse for gaming periods of time. With the g9x its awesome, and my hand feels like its in some custom fit glove. Reponse time is amazing and i like the different grips. Also, the weights are always a plus as normal mice feel too light at times, but with the weights I feel like the mouse just glids perfectly when gaming and it just feels right. If you are looking for a quality mouse to game with, dont waste your time with other mice, get this bad boy and game it up.

$review_text.: Under $100 gets a mostly comfortable over-the-ear set with okay sound and a very simple setup. I am using this on a PC mostly for listening to music, watching streaming videos, and for use with Skype.Setup went like this: there is no USB cable included so I charged it with a mini-usb (not micro) that I had on hand from an old Blackberry. Once charged I struggled to find the power switch (because I didn't RTFM). I figured it out :)  I plugged the USB stick in to my PC and it was up and running in a few seconds. I'm using Windows 7 and the driver that loaded was built-in to the OS. There was nothing additional to install.The build quality is fair to middling. The volume slide is clumsy as is the virtual surround button. The slide out mic feels really cheap and I wonder how long it will stay in place before it is no longer able to lock.As for sound, really not that great, but it'll do. I have another wireless headset, one I use at work, the Logitech F540 and I feel that the Logitech has much better construction, sound, and comfort. The reason I bought this Sony headset is that I didn't care for the big box that needed to be attached to my laptop. The little usb stick on the Sony headset is so nice for mobility.Bottom line, if you need to be mobile you may prefer this Sony headset. It totally works and I will keep it because for this laptop, mobility is key. I can't rate it higher than 3/5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: decent comfort, easy set up

It's easy to put on and doesn't curl or yellow. And as far as lifetime replacements, they aren't kidding.  I had to send my ipad2 back to Apple for replacement and forgot to remove the cover. It was replaced. Sold my ipad and they replaced the item. Just placed it on my new ipad. I have a Skinomi Techskin on my son's ipad2 and every iphone in the house has it as well.

$REVIEW.: Nice little flash that works perfectly with Canon G15. Not super powerful, but much more power than the little built-in flash and plenty for bouncing off ceiling in small to medium size living room.  The G15 menus allow you to adjust from full power to 1/64th power in 1/3 stop increments in manual mode, and plus or minus 3 stops in program, aperture, and shutter priority modes. In Auto mode you get what you get, which generally seems to work OK, but I don't use Auto mode so YMMV. The built-in diffuser works well for diffusing the light, but it does change the color temperature to somewhat warmer, which doesn't bother me.  The shoe is plastic which is also OK with me, because I'd rather break the flash than the camera if it gets smashed into something. All in all a really nice tiny little flash for the G15.

I would like a little more range, but it is a compact setup, so I don't expect it.  Charge seems to last for at least a week of use at work.  This is turning it on for 4-5 hours a day 5 days a week with power leftover before I plug it into the charger.  Normal charge time is 20-30 minutes from what I have seen, but a little longer on the first full charge.  I would buy this again for its small size and to take outdoors with me.

This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

Anyone who seriously expects to get 20-40 miles range with these radios, knows nothing about radios

You will NEVER get that kind of range without tapping into a repeater station or antenna.However, if you are looking for radio that is clear, comfortable, laid out well, and can talk effectively for a mile or two, then these are the one's you want

The only down side is the abbreviated menu's can be a little confusing at first

$review_text.: Air Mouse Elite (with MotionSense), by GyrationLet's jump right in with an assessment of this gadget, which offers a lot of great features, and only one drawback that I've found so far.What do I like?- It's rechargeable, using an included charging station. I _love_ this feature. No batteries to replace, and I have complete freedom of movement (which is a requirement for the "air" aspect of this mouse).- It has the basic mouse functions I expect. Three primary buttons, including a very smooth and consistent trackwheel.- It fits nicely in my hand, and is designed for either left or right handed people.- It's light, even with integrated rechargeable batteries.- Visual cues. When the mouse is being moved there is a blue LED that lights up to let you know there's activity, and a three tier yellow LED that indicates charging status (when attached to the included charging stand).- Highly customizeable buttons. There are three programmable buttons on the top of the mouse. You can REALLY customize these things, and in fact, they can do different things based on the type of program you're in at the time. Let me spend a bit more on this one because this is a major "extra" in this mouse.There are four levels of customization for the top buttons.General: Buttons are defaulted to "Media". This means opening your primary web browser, your email client, and closing the current window.Internet: Buttons are defaulted to: Open home page, Open favourites, Refresh page.Media Player: Buttons are defaulted to: play/pause, Open playlist, Stop playback.Presentation: Buttons are defaulted to: Highlighter, Pointer, Media stamp.But you can pretty much COMPLETELY customize what they do beyond that. You could reset the buttons to launch a slidehow, change slides, zoom, change volume, open a keyboard on screen, copy/paste, and more - even launching a custom application.- "Air" and Gestures. This is another area I want to spend some time on, because this is where the mouse goes from desk-bound to freedom.AIR Mode: First is just general mouse movement and interaction, with the integrated motion sensor. Basically you can move the mouse and click on things holding the mouse in the air, just like you do when it's on the desk. You push the trigger button (under the mouse) and move the mouse through the air - the cursor follows right along with you. It's not line of sight so you don't have to point it at the screen or anything. You can even hold it under the desk or across the room and it works, because it's motion sensor activated. If you plan to use it in "air" mode for a while, just double click the trigger and it will stay in that mode until you double click it again.Gestures: (which after testing out I disabled because I didn't find it useful). Gestures are when you push the central button (called the gesture button) then make a predefined sweeping motion left/right/up/down. It's basically like running a macro/command based on key press, but this is movement based (on land or air). I didn't find this especially useful but you might. Having three programmable buttons was enough, I didn't need to create yet more quick functions via a gesture. It's easy to disable with a checkbox in the settings screen.- The motion sensor is VERY good. When used in "air" mode, the mouse really does a great job of following my movements. It's not jumpy, and it smoothly moves back and forth / up and down as I rotate the mouse in the air.- Battery lasts a long time. I only charge it every few days and I've never had a problem with the battery running down. One thing that others have mentioned is that the yellow LED doesn't change to something like green when it's done charging. It doesn't, but all three do light up vs. flashing...so you do know when it's done.What just is...(these don't bother me, but your mileage may vary)- The charging station is USB powered. Using this mouse will require TWO open USB ports. First port is for the micro receiver for the mouse; Second port is for the charging station. If you have limitations on your USB ports then this could be an issue for you.What bothers me?- I keep accidentally hitting the first customizeable button and launching my web browser when I don't want to. This is mostly because of how I hold the mouse, and that the custom buttons are right on top of the device. Since I'm right handed and do a lot of clicking, my finger often pushes down enough onto the first button that it activates its custom function. This is a learning curve for me - I have to make sure I watch where my finger is, but this could be a problem for this mouse.And seriously, that's the only thing I've found so far that bothers me.Overall it's a great device that has replaced my old tethered mouse. If you do a lot of on screen presentations, or just want to control the cursor from across the room (great for a media PC in your living room), then having the "air" features is something you'll really enjoy.Have fun!
$SUMMARY.: Versatile, flexible, use it on the desk or in the air, highly customizable

$review_text.: 14 Watts coming out of two little boxes less than 6 inches tall! I hooked them up to my laptop alone first, they sounded great. But when I hooked them to my Desktop, along with my 25 watt speakers, the sound rivals the big speakers I bought back in the 80's. I used a splitter and extension cables to run them across the room, and you really have to find the sound coming from the speakers on the table with my live ferns.

$REVIEW.: I am looking for a low-priced cable lock to leave my netbook at work, but not have "borrowed" without my permission.After digesting all the good/bad reviews, I take the chance to give it a try
My total cost is $3 + $2.49(shipping) + $0.28(tax) = $5.77
I really don't expect a fancy cable lock with this low price.To my surprise, it works nice and fits my need well.The length of this 1/8-diameter cable lock is 43 inches per my measurement


This shorter length and thinner cable makes it easier to carried around in my netbook pouch
It is simple to attach and to remove

It fits easily into my Acer AO532H netbook.Not sure about the smell mentioned by other reviewers

The one I received is very normal and doesn't have any special smell.For high theft areas, don't use this one!!! You sure need a thick heavy-duty cable, but for ordinary security (like library, work place), this one is good.In summary, again, this is "NOT" a heavy duty cable lock
Based on what I have paid for and what I am using this cable for, this cable fits my need well.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this item at Best Buy in Florida during my vacation but the outcome was so dissapointing.  Colors are very washed out, video to a 32 inch LCD TV is so blurry due to low resolution and low light b-day recording is sad as the TV turns dark and you can hear only voices.  I highly recommend that anyone who wants to truely cherish their memories to get a higher grade camera.  I really dont know what to do with this now...  Too light for a door stop... Amazingly i have better results with a Sony Handycam I got as a gift in 1987.  If you only have $250 to spend I suggest getting a used 2000-2002 High end model Sony with Night Shot.

$REVIEW.: I have bough serveral of these mice. The are good mice with accurate movement and everything one could ask for . .. except once extremely important problem: if the ball pops out of the socket, the slightest impact against another object produces a small scratch or dent in the ball. I ask you . . . even though a mouse is supposed to stay on a desk how many times does it fall to the floor buy accident. Well, with this mouse one time is enough to render it almost unusable.This small scratch or dent in the ball catches against the three plastic guides in the socket producing a small hitch to the movement to an incredibly annoying freeze of the ball moving anywhere.Small as this may sound, even one dent in the ball will catch dozens of times and hour if you move the ball a lot as in during game play or heavy editing of a text.Despite the advantages I love in this type of mouse I will never buy it again.

$REVIEW.: I bought two of these fans to supplement my computer's case fans, which are on their last legs

I honestly couldn't hear the difference when I booted up the machine
I admit that I haven't done any scientific testing to determine the precise audio levels, but I'd say that - unless you have very sensitive ears - these will probably get the job done for you.NOTE: Make sure you know that you're buying the 140mm, not the 120mm, and whether your case can support the larger footprint
Mine could, but I had to mount it in a different location than I had planned because I hadn't read the description carefully enough.

$REVIEW.: So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays.I have not read the instructions that came with this unit, yet I and my 11 years old son were able to operate the unit like pros out of the box.I just arrived from a trip that took me from New York to New Jersey, then Bostn, then MAine, then Niagara Falls, then Corning (upstate NY), then to Harrisburg, PA, Hershey Park PA, Washington DC, Philladelphia and back to New Jersey (We live actually in the Dominican Republic, but were on a two week family trip).Of course,and being our native language, we programmed the GPS in Latin American Spanish, and of course, the pronunciation of some street names was a little akward, but nothing you can't manage
One of the main bugs is that when it mentioned a south route or high way it said, for example, to take I-95 seconds instead of south, since S is the abreviation of seconds in spanish and not south

We overcame that and the rest was easy.Maps issue: this unit is not up to date on actual maps in the DC and Alexandria VA area


We were trough streets that seem to have been there for a while and it showed that we were travelling trough grass, of course recalculating, but we got used to this fast and as soon as we arrived to the part of the road it had on the map it recalculated again.Crazy Issue: in NY city or if surrounded by tall buildings, it went a little crazy


I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung
I recomend that if travelling in a city, try to remenber the first route it displyed and follow it even when it redirects you because after a while it realculates and send you on the right track again.Overall, I give this unit a 4.75, because of:1- Ease of use2- Fast satellite adquisition3- Fast perfonmance4- 96% relliability5- Excellent form factor6- Good battery life7- Excellent for pedestrian use (It even guides you through internal walking roads like in the National Mall, Arlington Cementery, Central Park, Niagara Falls Park, Manhattan, etc.8- It took me and my familly in a two week 2000 mile trip with exellent ease of use and only very minor gltchesFinally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends

Don't trust it to take you to the White House, Capitol, Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, because it will guide you to direct streets that are now blocked


Also beware with the sides when you are arriving somewhere.

it sometimes says the finish will be on the opposite side of the street to where it really is.

$REVIEW.: My ears are pretty large. The old baseline iPhone earbuds used to fall out of my ears all the time. Even given that, these gigantic earbuds manage to chafe my ear in all sorts of uncomfortable places. As another reviewer mentioned, these are that odd "not an in-ear phone; not an over-ear headphone" style. If you like that and the previous iPhone earbuds worked for you, though, these may also work for you.On the positive side, though, this is this first set of headphones out of 5 different pairs that I have tried that worked with my Windows Phone 7 on both the microphone and play/pause button front. That's a nice change!

$REVIEW.: A very complete office suite. I'm glad Corel is still around today and making excellent products. I grew up using WordPerfect because Microsoft Word was so expensive. And I'm glad it's still around today this is a fully functioning and very powerful office presentation package. Personally I very reliable Internet and generally for my document creation needs I use Google documents (pros: web based, free cons: web based). But if you're somebody wants to have a document creator and editor on their system WordPerfect is fine.MY ONLY COMPLAINT -  My only complaint with WordPerfect is that when you save a file, it by default saves it as a WordPerfect file. Over the years I've had countless times where somebody would complain about them not being able to open a file because they didn't have WordPerfect. And if you want to save your files in Microsoft Word format you have to download the compatibility pack from their website. It such a bummer that this problem exists, I understand why does; because programs need to write to their own file types. Is just something that really can be rough if you want to send a document to somebody and they don't have WordPerfect.They need to put a few universal file types at the top of the list when you want to save your file. The list now is so ridiculously long with file types even I am confused. Is my one gripe I've always had with WordPerfect and eventually I hope they get it figured out how to incorporate a universal open file type. I uploaded a customer image showing just a portion of the file types you can "save as", and you can see it's pretty confusing.Now the PDF editor is a very nice tool to have. So many times I have needed to edit a pdf file. I want to open them up and grab a little bit of the text so I don't have to retype it. And this WordPerfect version allows you to convert the PDF file to a text document. Let it be known that he doesn't do it perfectly every time but it does work in 50% of my tests. And a 50% success rate is better than a 0% success rate when you're not able to do it all.And doing document creation is very easy with WordPerfect. Being able to import pictures and move them around might be a tad easier than my older version of Microsoft Word. But it does work very well and you can create some nice brochures and flyers if you need to with this software.I have never used Quattro Pro or Excel, or Presentations or PowerPoint (I'd use them a few times through my life but nothing that would make any words I would say here useful) though I did open up Presentations and make a quick little PowerPoint just to test it out and it's simple. I have no real idea how to use Quattro Pro or Excel.Anywhere hope this helps you can go on to their website and download a free trial if you want to play around with some of these programs. I will put a link in the comments to this review.Thanks for reading!PS check the customer images if you want to see how crazy the save file type menu is. I'm pretty amazing on computers and I was still little bit confused.PS2 at the time of writing this review both the digital download version and the CD version a.k.a. the boxed version are the same price (which is something you don't see often on Amazon usually the boxed version is less than the digital version) but be sure to check both as sometimes you can have a big savings with one over the other.
$SUMMARY.: A great office suite and a PDF editor and form builder is cool.

$review_text.: I really, really wanted to love this keyboard/case.  It's quality, solid, the keyboard pairs really well with my iPad Air, and it looks great.  BUT:One of the immediate issues I discovered with this particular case is that when the keyboard part is tucked behind the iPad part using it in tablet mode, the keyboard doesn't have any way to be secured to keep things from flopping around.  While I realize a strap would not have been practical since it would end up going over the keyboard or over the outer part of the top of the case, it would be really nice to not have to worry about holding everything stable when used in this fashion.  I don't always need the keyboard part.  I use my iPad Air for a lot of audits and such on the road.  I need to be able to tuck the keyboard back/away until needed for typing on various forms.  There's no convenient way to do this.  Big issue for me.The only other issue I really have with this keyboard case is that there is no place to store a stylus.  I use one CONSTANTLY.  It would be nice to not have to keep the stylus in my pocket or pull it out of my briefcase every time I need it, which again is very, very often.  Again I know this would have affected the aesthetics somehow, but as a matter of convenience, it would still be nice to be able to keep my stylus with the iPad itself.Another item of small note is the fact that some of the keys are located in odd places.  For example, I often find myself hitting the "Enter" button when I'm in fact trying to press the '/" or ;/: button.  Also, the semicolon/colon button are located somewhere totally dissimilar to a standard keyboard.  I know why this was done (to save space and still give almost full-size keys), but it's taking me some time to get used to the layout.  The microphone button is handy, as is the Lock/App switching button.  The Function keys also appear as though they will come in handy at some point.All in all, I'm happy with the case.  It offers excellent protection, it looks high-end, the keyboard is responsive, I don't have any issues whatsoever with weak magnets as other reviewers have complained of, etc.  I just wish this was/is the "be all, end all case" I was hoping it was going to be - especially considering I paid $95 for it (it bears mentioning that the price of this thing fluctuates every single day...as I write this review, the price dropped $20 only 24 hours after I received mine.  Nature of the game here on Amazon.).Would I order it again?  Probably.  Am I 100% thrilled with it?  No.***UPDATE***One more thing my review should have mentioned: the description on Amazon says the case is black.  However, in full light, it's actually DARK BLUE.  The back is black, yes.  But who determines the color of something by the BACK of it?

$review_text.: The D-link router is very easy to set up and if you have a router older than 5 years, this is a great upgrade

The strength of signal and speed increase has been very welcomed in our household
We have 4 laptops going at times in addition to two smart phones, we have not experienced any degradation in signal when we are all working

Setting up the password for the router, linking our Xbox, Wii, and printers to the router was a snap
I would recommend this router for anyone needing an upgrade.

But eventually I knew I would need to replace it.This was a pack of four fans (there are two sizes you can get, this is a box of the larger size). It was easy enough to replace two fans in my CPU, especially at this price. I had to look up which way they should face to keep the airflow moving correctly in the case.Works great and I don't have to hit my computer anymore!

 My three year old player is already obsolete

I would think a simple software upgrade would handle this, but rather than support their product they force you to buy a new one for the newest channels.I'm not a fan of these tactics and thus the 1 star rating


 Additionally my player &#34;freezes&#34; quite frequently

$REVIEW.: As far as the drive goes, this drive is very fast and I highly recommend it. I spent nearly $200 on this almost a year ago, but you can now get it for under $100. The enclosure is great for swapping out laptop harddrives and I have used it on many occasions since purchasing this for other times when I needed to get information off of a 2.5" drive. The screwdriver is really nice for working on phillips and flathead screws if you do not already own a magnetic screw driver. Never used the mount or the drive copy software.I personally use this drive in my desktop and have Windows and all programs installed on it.Since the prices have been dropping, if I was making this purchase today I would probably be looking at a 180GB+ drive, but this one will still do.edit:Though I have owned this drive for a long time I just recently used the software that comes with it to transfer a harddrive to a new SSD. Neither of the drives were Kingston and neither were the exact same size drives, but the software worked great. When booting from the SSD afterwards it was just like before with all the same programs loading properly, just much faster.

$REVIEW.: I bought this keyboard as a replacement on a two-year old Inspiron 1525 that I use a lot
 Installation was pretty straight forward, there are plenty of places on the web that have detailed instructions for installing a new keyboard on Dell computers
 Be sure to read through those instructions because disconnection of the old keyboard is a bit tricky if you don't know what you are doing.Pros: The keyboard response is good, stiffer than I am use to but I think that is because my old keyboard was so worn

 Installation was pretty simple and only took about 10 minutes total.Cons: There are no ridges on the F and J keys to guide your hands to the proper position for touch-typing

 The keys on this keyboard are not interchangeable with the OEM keyboard so you cannot cannibalize your old keyboard keys


 This is a bit of an inconvenience if you touch type.Overall a good and cost effective way to keep your laptop going.

$review_text.: This is by far the best headphones you can buy for the price.  I tested the headphones against the Monster Beats by Dr. Dre.The sound in these are more dynamic. The highs are cleaner and the base is also cleaner. Someone said that he Beats headphones are bassy.  I don't agree.  The Beats headphones are louder at low volume due to buit in amplifier but if you turn up volume in HD-555 you will hear deeper base and higher highs without loss of clariy as you do in the Beats.When I first heard the Beats I thought they were the best headphones I ever heard.  They were much better than some of the other Sennheiser headphones i havee heard.  These came in the mail a week later and with the beats at volume 3 and Sennheiser at voulme 6 Sennheiser takes the crown and you don't need batteries for them to work.For the price get the HD-555's and you will be happy or get both and compare for yourself.Don't forget the HD-555 are open air and Beats are noise cancelling so if you need noise canceling the Beats is better in this case and Beats is also better than other Sennheiser noise canceling i have heard.Other people have touched on otheer qualities and other models so no need to repeat.Thank you Amazon for fast shipment.

$review_text.: Much of it has been said, so I won't repeat everything that is being said and done on the Intertubes. I have the WRT54G v2, which is the same of the WRT54GL. It's a valid point I guess.- Stability:What I must add to the crowd of 5-star rating is that it is dependable and is rock solid. It just goes running 24/7, and keeps going with no stability issues, no lock-ups, nothing. And most important (and common with other routers): no wireless drop outs. I once ran it for 2 or 3 months I guess, only to be stopped by an energy blackout.Mine is 5 years old (and a few months), and I still use it for routing my home network. I have 3 computers, 1 media player, 1 media server and 1 wireless extender, all together sharing a broadband connection. It handles the load just fine, streaming high bitrate content on wired is perfect. True, the router is very outdated by today's standards (think wifi range and speed), but the fact that I still use it --- if only for routing and handling load --- tells how dependable the box is. You "set and forget", no checking, no rebooting, nothing. The fame is due.I bought other routers, and some with the same or similar platform (Buffalo WHR-HP-G54), but they were not as stable as this one. No wonder those always find a way being just an AP, while the WRT keeps routing and doing the hard work.- Features:Granted, I have a 3rd party firmware on it (have used OpenWrt and DD-WRT, now on Tomato), but that's what is good about it. QoS, "access restriction" (on/off schedule for wifi), dynamic DNS, time server or any other custom task (if you have the Linux skills) you can imagine. People run everything on them. What I do here is just the "surface" of what can be "scratched".- Cons:The outdated specs. No N, of course, range and speed seems to be on the bad side.- Support:Years ago, when I didn't know about 3rd party firmwares (that was 2005), I was having a problem with dropped Internet connection. The Linksys support on the web was quick and solved the problem (config). Mind you, after that I never used the support again, so I don't know if Linksys support is still good (or if it ever was and I was just lucky). Not knowing is, of course, a good thing in this case, and speaks favorably for the router.- Final thoughts:That's about it. Buying many things that promise more and deliver less, I'm rarely enthusiastic with electronics, but this one is a winner. Also, not trying other firmwares on this does not do it justice. Installing a 3rd party firmware is also much easier than it used to be, so anyone with reasonable knowledge and the ability to read instructions exactly as written can do it. I didn't search much lately, so I don't think if we have a comparable, proven and trusted 11n kit like the WRT was with 11g.I give it 5 stars, period. No footnotes, no asterisks, no nonsense.

$review_text.: I bought this item after shopping in the stores and being disappointed by the cost for flat-panel TV mounts. Went onto Amazon and researched around and this Cheetah Mount had good reviews and the price was reasonable. Had to do a little tightening of the screws on the arm to keep the TV at a straight-on angle, but that's to be expected. Recommended if you need a quality, inexpensive mount.

$REVIEW.: I bought the polyurethane version of this case for my HDX 7 and liked it okay. It wasn't great and I preferred the HD-style standing case (not Origami), but it was acceptable. (Please, Amazon, bring the original Standing Case back. It was simple, lightweight, sturdy, and effective. Sometimes less is more!)I bought the leather version of this Standing Origami Case for my HDX 8.9 and ended up sending it back. What works on the HDX 7 does not work on the HDX 8.9.PROS:1) Leather. However pure or not, this looks and feels like leather. Great coloring on the red one I received.2) Turns the Kindle on and off automatically. Yes!3) Nice openings for all buttons and speakers. Very easy to access.4) Doesn't make the rear-facing camera malfunction like most other magnetic cases.CONS:1) Doesn't work with the rear-facing camera; you have to slide the case down, which doesn't really work. You usually end up dropping the case (hopefully not the Kindle).2) Doesn't hold the Kindle securely. A slight bump makes the Kindle just fall out. This happened to me multiple times. Even adjusting the stand sometimes made my Kindle fall out. The magnets are not strong enough for the large Kindle. (Conversely, the HDX 7 actually takes quite a bit of force to separate it from its magnets and release it from the case.)3) Weighs a LOT - I think I weighed it in at almost 14 ounces, which defeated the purpose of buying the sleeker, lighter Kindle. The case alone was about double the weight of the Kindle.4) The origami shape, which offers some protection to the HDX 7, doesn't give the same protection to the HDX 8.9. Due to the larger size and the fold of the origami shape being at the center of the screen, this case allows pressure on the case to translate to pressure on the screen and this is *not* good. It made me feel that my Kindle would not be protected if I put it anywhere where it might get pressure against the case (in a briefcase, purse, or whatever). For this reason alone, I would not keep this case.5) It doesn't stand up securely on an uneven surface. I can't testify to hard, even surfaces, but I got this to use in bed so I could watch videos and read and not disturb my spousal unit. Somehow getting hit in the face with this when it tipped or having the case magnets all SNAP when it collapsed on itself was not conducive to me being relaxed or the spousal unit sleeping.I sent this case back and bought the Minisuit Orbit 360 Stand Case with Auto Wake/Sleep for Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GCPQ40W/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).  It was only $11 and in many ways was better than this case (see my review there).Well, I had high hopes for this case. I had really despised the idea of the original HD (not HDX) standing leather case, but when it showed up, I was so glad that I bought it. In contrast, I had high hopes for this case, but ended up disliking and mistrusting it and sent it back.

Older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out. Not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount.

Only thing is that the wires are not labelled 1,2,3,4 so you simply match them 1 for 1 on inputs and outputs. I tried to ring them for continuity but the induction circuitry caused it not to read continuity properly. Left wire in = left wire out and so on.

 I just bought a paair of AW-650s for my home patio but was afraid they would be too big on the boat
 These are just the right size and have a very good sound

 I mounted them on the back deck so they face where we are in the water


 Everyone was very impressed by the difference from my old speakers


 Good strong base and overall sound

 Good efficiency


 If you have the room pay the extra $100 for the 650s, if not these are almost as good and 1/2 the space.

This will charge most smartphones 3 times over!I was very impressed with the build quality of this device. Nothing is loose or rattles when moving. This thing is solid. I wish it came with more adapter pieces (lightning adapter for iPhone5, tablet power adapters). But works well. Remember, this thing can take a long time to charge. I recommend leaving it charger over night the day before you plan to travel. I've noticed even when not charging for a long time it holds it charge wonderfully.I took this product with me to a trip to NYC. I had the battery in my back pocket, a cable running from it to my side front pocket where my phone lived. My phone stayed full all day and I only lost about 35% of the battery capacity. Works well!

$review_text.: I have owned the original nexus 7 2012 model for over 1 year and had to send it in to the repair center at least 3 times.  I was not charged however i did have to pay to ship it there so it did cost me.  I was hoping that the &#34;new improved&#34; nexus 7 fhd 2013 model would be one that did not require I send it in to get it to work.  Sadly, that was not the case. I had the most recent firmware as of Dec 2013, but I don't remember the build number and after a week and a half of issues have already returned it.Here are the issues i had:-Touchscreen:  Not registering touches, especially in the middle of the screen.  I even tried to remove my screen protector.-Wifi Connection:  I would lose my connection easily and frequently.  No connection issues with the older nexus.-Wifi Speed:  despite having dualband netgear R6300, it was still slower than the original nexus at times.-YouTube app:  I couldn't get videos to play.  YouTube worked fine on the old nexus and on an ipad.  Other streaming apps such as netflix and vimeo worked decently (as long as the connection wasn't dropping)-Sound:  There was a slight buzzing/static sound when the volume was muted or on the lowest 2 or 3 levels.  Not a big deal, but it might bother some.The Nexus 7 FHD was still under warranty and I could have sent it in for free repairs, however given my experience with the previous model, I decided to return it instead.  I shouldn't have to pay to mail my brand new tablet in for repairs, then have to wait 2-3 weeks to get it back.  I think Google/Asus should focus on quality control.  Maybe I just got unlucky 2 times in a row but I think I'll stay away from the next Nexus 7.Btw- As a Galaxy S4 user, I decided to give the  Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 a try.  On paper, the specs don't look as good but everything worked perfectly out of the box.  I honestly can't tell that much of a difference between the video quality and at least I can stream YouTube now.  While not as &#34;blazing fast&#34; as the nexus 7 FHD, the fact that it is reliably fast makes it a better value to me.

$review_text.: I received the packaging for the Airbender, opened it up and found a simple instruction guide, a usb recharging cable, and the case itself.  Without the iPad Air in the case, the case feels a bit flimsy.  But once the iPad Air is attached, it feels a bit more sturdy.  The cover is held on by an aluminum hinge.  It moves pretty freely which I found to be annoying.  I wish that the hinges were tighter and required a bit more effort to move just because I don't like having my iPad swinging around if I ever dropped it.  I do like how i am able to rotate the iPad to be horizontal or vertical.  The cover also pulls out so that it can rest on the keyboard, which is great.  The cover also has auto wake/sleep functionality which is essential.  Another nice feature is that the keyboard has a built in li-ion battery that is charged via USB.  I was able to charge via USB with the powerpak Xtreme, also produced by NewTrent.  They both use the same connectors (micro-usb).The keyboard is easy to setup.  Simply turn on the power switch, and sync the keyboard with your iPad.  Enter the password shown on the screen to connect and you're set.  The feel of the keyboard is a little off in my opinion.  They keys should be more sturdy.  The keys, which are squares, feel like they are resting on a ball and can be shifted around.  If that makes sense.  But, overall, they do the job.  I also like the additional shortcut keys where the F keys are.  For example, you can increase/decrease the volume or brightness.  You can also control the iPod/Videos.I recommend this product to those who need to take notes on their iPad.  Students and professionals should consider this product.  I took this case to a meeting at work and was able to easily and quickly jot down important points.  I also used this in my business class to take notes.  It is nice to be able to quickly switch from typing to hand written notes.

$REVIEW.: 'Piping hot' is how we want pizza (amongst other things), but NOT our laptops. Yet all 4 of our family's 17-inch notebooks get piping hot after hours of usage. We've tried the Antec as well as several other 'cool pads' or 'chill pads' (all more expensive than this one) but none controlled the problem adequately. In part,others had fans that were centrally located and they just didn't have enough juice to cool the areas where the battery and other hot bits are located on our laptops. This product--with it's movable fans SOLVES the problem!I purchased one,hooked it up immediately out of the box.First, the fans are easily attached to the back of the aluminum mesh of the cooler. WHEREVER YOU DEEM NECESSARY! What a great concept!Second, the fans lock into the mesh securely--in seconds!Third, the fans run very quietly, considering they are not inside a case (like in other cool/chill pads), rendering noise a non-issue.Fourth, the power cord--USB--is also a pass-through, so you don't even lose your USB port!Last, but by NO means least, IT WORKS! Wonderfully! The worst offender, a 17" DV7, actually burned my husband's flesh--branded him, so I hooked the Cooler Master Notepal U2 up to it, while it was HOT...came back 2 hours later and it was COOL AS A CUCUMBER. AMAZING.The product is inexpensive, yet well-constructed. The design is attractive and made so that you can pop the fans off, slide your laptop in the back portion (that elevates the aluminum mesh cooler) and place the whole thing in your laptop bag. They even provide a strap for securing the whole shebang when you carry it thusly.This item actually works just as stated, with 2 re-positionable fans that YOU can configure to best suit you and your hot little laptop's needs. Inexpensive nursing for all your feverish notebooks! For around $20, you, and your laptop NEED THIS Notebook Cooler!PS. I just ordered 2 more, the best recommendation of all!

$review_text.: I absolutely love the look & feel of this case. It is SO attractive and feels like a quality product. It holds up well; and I got a multitude of compliments on it. It's stylish ... but not too stylish for a man to carry. (There are other versions of the case that only a woman could pull off; but this one is OK for men as well.)Nevertheless, it has one fatal flaw. Instead of deep ridges for the iPad to rest in, this case has little squiggly raised areas for the iPad's edges to rest on. The decorative lines, like everything else about the case, are attractive and eye-catching. Unfortunately they do not serve their purpose well. Sometimes the iPad falls off them and slides down ... especially during times when you are touching the screen or navigating an app.I've had to purchase another case. Even though I will miss the look & feel of this one, in the final analysis I need something that behaves more usefully.

$REVIEW.: I followed the installation instructions recommended in one of the other reviews and have to say that it works well for me. It lets me hook my usb Canon aio into my router so it can then be installed on any of my network computers. I won't say it's easy to configure if you haven't played around with router setups, network printers etc., but I'm not sure any other products can get around that needed knowledge either.

$review_text.: The Panasonic DMC-LX7: Its Own Class of CameraThe notion of compact and "pocketable" form factor cameras is a matter of perspective. Just like an "affordable" camera has a lot to do with what you personally feel is an appropriate price bracket, if a camera is pocketable or not depends on how big your pockets are. The Lumix LX7 retails for about $500, is one of the flagship fixed lens cameras from Panasonic, yet has already been discounted in various spots to forty percent less than retail. At $300 street price, it is less dollars than some small-sensor long zoom cameras, yet is still about double the price of some very competent point and shoot cameras. If you are interested in optional (but pricey) features, the hot shoe of the LX-7 lets you instantly add the Panasonic DMW-LVF2 1,440,000-dot equivalent electronic viewfinder (about $200) or your choice of a few external flash units as well.The LX-7 is the latest incarnation of the LX-3 / LX-5 series of more or less compact cameras that have featured a bit larger sensors and brighter lenses than the run of the mill compact cameras, along with the ability to save images in RAW format. Compared to its well-received predecessor, the LX-5 has a sharper 3-inch LCD with 920,000 dots, a faster F1.4-2.3, 3.8X lens, faster shooting performance, and comparatively spectacular video capability. It records at up to Full HD video at 1080/60p and additionally offers high speed 720p video recording at 120 frames/second. Compared to the LX-5 this is a substantial upgrade, as far as I'm concerned, in most all key areas. Its CIPA standard battery life is reduced to 330 images from 400 in the LX-5, likely due to its improved resolution LCD. It is a bit heavy (0.66 lb / 10.51 oz.) and bulky (4.37 x 2.68 x 1.81 in.) compared to the shirt pocket type cameras, but similar to the LX5. It does fits the platform of pocket camera, but a coat-pocket camera rather than a shirt or pants pocket camera.LX7 Basic SpecificationsResolution: 10.10 MegapixelsLens: 3.80x zoom (24-90mm eq.)Viewfinder: LCD 920kLCD Size: 3.0 inchISO: 80-12800Shutter: 250-1/4000Max Aperture: 1.4Dimensions: 4.4 x 2.6 x 1.8 in. (111 x 67 x 46 mm)Weight: 10.5 oz (297 g) incl. batteryMSRP: $500100% crop image quality at ISO 1600 betters the upscale long zoom cameras, such as the generally impressive DMC-FZ200. Its faster lens and slightly larger sensor (1/1.7 inch) combine to make this came a low-light superstar, bettering the similar sensor size equipped Canon S100 and S110.Let's say you are considering moving up to the LX7 from a compact long zoom travel camera, such my current favorite in that class, the Lumix ZS-15 or the generally excellent Canon SX260. Now, you net the sharper LCD, a bigger sensor, and the LX7 lens is far, far faster than the ZS-15's F3.3 - F5.9 array. You'll also appreciate the included external charger, the hot shoe of the LX-7, and the obvious superior low-light capabilities. By low light, I mean the indoors version of low-light, without using the flash. If you accustomed to post-processing, the RAW images of the LX7 will be another appreciated advantage.On the flipside, the LX-7 is around twice the price, you might miss the 16x optical zoom, and you'll notice right away that the LX-7 is noticeably bigger and heavier by comparison. You'll also notice right away that there is no integral lens cover on the LX7 and the lens cap is removed manually (an aftermarket solution is readily available). If your focus (pun int.) is primarily on convenience and economy, the ZS-15 is most assuredly easier to have with you all the time, easier to quickly just throw into a pocket and go.The reasons there is so little consensus in the preferred camera is that we all have divergent notions of what a camera is supposed to do. Naturally, image quality defines a desirable camera, but there is the snapshot level of quality image and then the "I want to make posters" level. Satisfying snapshots are the most common output of a camera to no one's great surprise. Yet, if your camera has wondrous image quality, but turtle-slow shooting performance, it is easy to forego image softness only discernible if you hold an 8 x 10 a few inches from your nose in favor of a faster camera that is less hassle to use.Video capabilities get better and better in "still cameras," one of those things not important to you . . .  unless of course it is. This camera delivers strongly in the video department. The same goes with time lapse, high-speed video, creative effects, and so forth. The technically "best" image-capturing unit may not at all be the best choice for you if the image stabilization is poor, you can't see the LCD, the batteries are perpetually dead, and some of the specialty features you really want don't exist. In all of these areas, the LX-7 is either very good to class-leading.The LX-7 aspect ratio selector means you can shoot 3:2 images at 9.5 Megapixels. That completely fills the 3:2 aspect ratio screen and is where I've found myself doing most of my shooting. The image stabilization is excellent, the Panasonic "iA" (intelligent auto mode) yields impressive results if you aren't inclined to experiment with the program or scene modes.CONCLUSIONThis camera reads like a compilation of everything most people claim they want improved from their economy, compact, point and shoot. It has a better LCD, a bigger sensor, first-rate video capabilities, a hot shoe, JPEG, JPEG+RAW, and RAW capability, and includes the fastest lens in this category of camera today: F1.4-2.3. It includes an external charger as opposed to "USB only" charging, its 330 CIPA battery life is better than most compacts, and it has enough manual controls and scene modes to keep people experimenting for a very, very long time. This unit captures truly excellent video with a wondrous high speed video mode as well, 720p @ 120 fps.Time lapse, high speed video, an external charger, and a built-in neutral density filter might seem old hat by now, but it actually is ***anything but***. The next step up the food chain, the larger sensored $650 Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX100 lacks not just one or two of these features: it lacks all of them. Yet, the RX100 is lighter in weight, if not on the wallet, something than cannot be said for some others in the category. The RX100 actually offers very little over this camera, its diminutive size and higher resolution are the two areas that cannot be denied. What closes the gap is the extremely fast lens of the LX-7.It is hard to fault this camera. In many ways, this is a one-stop compact personal imaging center for both still images and video. The only video consideration is not the video quality, but the inability to plug in an external mic. The only thing you might miss as a still camera is the lack of a long optical zoom if you feel that cramps your personal creative juices. The overall speedy focus and shooting performance is immensely satisfying; as you won't find yourself waiting for this camera to respond. If there is such thing as a bullseye in the price / performance ratio, this camera seems to nail it.In somewhat of rare and pleasant happenstance, this camera does everything it promises to do. Not everything always works as described, but the Panasonic DMC-LX7 actually does. Those looking to upgrade from the LX5 won't have to go past the faster lens, sharper LCD, and vastly improved video to find the LX7 an appealing successor. This is simply an all-around excellent piece of equipment.It scores top-of-chart in image quality and video quality in its class. Its shooting performance makes many cameras seem turtle-slow shot-to-shot. Finally, can be considered a screamingly strong value as well. Nothing competes with it at a $300 street price that I'm aware of and I mean ***nothing***. For many, many folks this is the only camera you'll need or want . . . and it leaves scant little lacking in a non-system reasonably compact package beyond what comes in the box.I did addProgo DMW-BCJ13e Power Pack (Two Li-Ion Rechargeable Batteries and Pocket Travel AC/DC Wall Charger with Car Adapter & US to European plug) for Panasonic DMW-BCJ13, DMW-BCJ13E, DMW-BCJ13PP. Works with Lumix DMC-LX5, DMC-LX7 Digital Camera. Fully Compati...that is really quite a bargain in battery-land, and aLowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag. The Lowepro Rezo 50 works particularly well if you go with a standard lanyard on the side of the camera rather than the dual strap supplied array. My final addition was theAuto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX7 LX-7, LEICA D-LUX 6 + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth.The Progo batteries are excellent, no loss of functionality vs. OEM batteries, slightly better life, and a fraction of the rip-off priced Panasonic branded batteries. With the Auto lens cap, everything goes neatly into the Rezo 50 bag including the two extra batteries. This is where it reaches, but does not exceed, my own personal limit of an easily portable camera array.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman.All Rights Reserved.If you are on a budget, and want a better than standard compact camera that is a bit smaller, consider:Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)for $249. Poor video compared to the LX7, a slower lens, weak low-light ability, but significantly smaller in size.For longer zoom, economical compacts thePanasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 12.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom (Black)is a screaming deal at $149 and theCanon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black)is now (finally) at a competitive $200 price point.If you want a RAW capable long zoom fixed lens camera,Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Blackis a top choice, but still at a salty $500 price point, and it is too bulky to be considered compact by most.For image quality, though, this LX-7 betters them all, and in low light or for video, it makes them all looks embarrassingly weak.

 Even though I already have a full sized camera bag for all of my gear, occasionally a medium sized camera bag comes in handy.Likes:*Less bulky and easier to tote around than my full sized camera bag.*Fits my Canon Eos Rebel T3i with the 18-55mm zoom lens attached

 Great when traveling light.

$REVIEW.: I just installed this ssd yesterday and I am loving it's performance. I upgraded from a 60gb OCZ Agility 2 and that was also a fast, worthwhile product. The reason for my upgrade is that I wanted the ability to comfortably dual-boot Win. 7 & Linux Mint 10 without having to constantly move programs and media around. I took my time with the partitioning and did plenty of research to assure proper alignment, which turned out to be fairly easy w/ Win. 7 (It automatically senses and adjusts for SSDs during install). The resulting performance is very impressive and yields me a 7.8 for primary hard disk performance in WEI. Things are even quicker w/ Linux and I simply have never used another computer with the same level of tactile speed and response. I was considering just buying another 60gb Agility 2 to run in RAID 0, but I elected to go the single, high quality drive route for stability sake. This drive also feels a bit quicker and gives me plenty of space, as I it loaded w/ Win.7 OS & speed sensitive applications on one partition (~95gb) and Linux /boot and / on the other (~15gb). My Win. 7 User files and non-speed sensitive programs are on a 465gb partition of a Caviar Black 1tb HDD with the remaining 465gb partitioned for swap and /home for Linux Mint. All of my movies, music, and backups are on another Caviar Black 1tb formatted to a single NTFS partition. Gparted running off a Linux live disc turned out to be a great tool for partitioning all of the drives after the initial offset and partition was done by the Win. 7 advanced drive options utility on the install disk. Time will tell if this drive holds up well, but the features (SandForce controler & TRIM) seem to indicate I will get great use out of it. Additionally, from what I understand, OCZ has done a nice job of providing firmware updates, though they lack a comprehensive utility for monitoring the drive. I love this drive and I have found adding an SSD to be one of the single most effective upgrades, in terms of speed, that one could make to a computer. I would buy another one of these drives if my finances allowed. GREAT PRODUCT!

$REVIEW.: I wanted something to replace my Sharp YO-520 data organizer w/ 1 MB that was suffering from a screen going bad, without resorting to buying a smart phone and paying the $30/mo subscription fee
 I have almost 2,000 names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, anniversaries, and passwords in my Sharp, so I pretty much can't live without this information


 After three weeks of research, I decided on the nine-year-od technology of the Palm m500 to replace the Sharp


 It avoids many of the problems with later Palm models, especially color versions, such as frequent battery recharge intervals, difficulty viewing the screen in sunlight, unreliable performance, etc

 This thing will go for weeks w/out recharging
 If the battery runs all the way down, it'll keep the data for several days after

 When the warranty period of one year expires, you can use a third-party kit to replace your own battery, as well.Overall, I have been quite pleased with my new Palm m500

 It took a couple of weeks to standardize the data from my Sharp in comma delimted format to import to the new Palm, but having to reenter 2,000 items would have been too overwhelming to contemplate.The CD with the Palm software was useless on Windows XP and Windows7, but the downloadable software versions from Palm work fine for both these versions of Microsoft's operating systems


 The manual is available in pdf format on the internet, as well


 Data sync up nicely with the computer, which is essential for downloading the free and purchasable third-party software apps available, as well as having your essential data backed up on the computer

 This "old" technology prevents email syncing w/ Outlook 2003 or 2007, but this was not a great loss for me, as I don't intend to use this device for accessing email

 Forget about surfing the internet, too, as the technology is based on infrared through a modem or cellphone, which is pretty outmoded now
 However, the infrared port can be used to beam data to another Palm, if you have a second device or someone else has one.If used strictly as a hand-held PDA, this is a great solution, with 8 MB internal memory and the capability of adding additional memory with a memory card

 There's a downloadable application that will enable this device to use the newer high-capacity memory cards, if you so desire


 Screen is quite clear and responds well to the stylus, which fits nicely in the side of the device

 (The reset tool unscrews from the top of the stylus.) The alarm feature is nice for remembering appointments and anniversaries.I would recommend getting the Kensington hard platinum case (~ $4) to fully protect the device and to be able to carry it safely in one's pocket


 I was worried from the picture if it was too large to fit in a pocket, but it has turned out not to be a problem.I've seen some pretty high prices in 2010 for a new Palm m500 ($150+) but you should be able to find one for $39.99 or less if you look around
 I bought two just to ensure not having to migrate to a new data platform anytime soon.

$REVIEW.: I feel that this kit is a definite must buy when buying the Freestyle keyboard.  With a split keyboard design, unless you buy 2 mouse sized rests, you're going to have a hard time finding wristrests that properly support your hands.  And proper hand support means supporting the heel of your hand, not your wrists themselves.  Putting pressure on your wrists will put pressure on the carpal tunnel and will actually aggravate the tendons and nerves in the tunnel, making your symptoms worse.  You want to support the heel of your hand on the squishy part.  This kit does a good job of that w/ built in wrist supports and a stick on soft layer.I do have some issues with the kit though.First off, it's way expensive for what it is.  I feel like it should be $25 or so.  It's just a prop-up kit, and wrist rests made of plastic.  But I understand that they probably don't move as much inventory as Microsoft and other companies, thus the price.Another issue is that the stick on soft layer is sort of like a neoprene layer, so I imagine it'll get dirty, and probably harbor lots of bacteria if you have sweaty hands.  I don't have sweaty hands, so it's not much of an issue, but I can imagine it getting pretty funky if you do.  I think it would've been better to have a non-porous soft material that could be cleaned by wiping it off.The feet on this kit aren't very grippy either, so the keyboard has a tendency to move day to day.  Not too big of an issue, but for the price, it should grip better.All in all, I think the keyboard needs this kit with it, but I gave it 4 stars because of the stuff mentioned above.

$review_text.: I got this NAS because I wanted something I could back up a few files to and serve my movie collection to my PCs and Raspberry Pis running XBMC

I was torn between a consumer solution like this and a prosumer from Synloogy

I opted to go for this because I found one for $170, roughly the cost of the hard drive itself
This way I could just open up the NAS and just use the bare hard drive and I wouldn't be out any money if the My Cloud ended up sucking
I don't think I'll be doing that, because I've been pleasantly surprised - when writing to the NAS, I got an average speed of 55 - 65mb/s (440 - 520mbps), with read speeds of 70 - 80mb/s (560 - 640mbps)
I was expecting quite a bit less from an underpowered CPU and a skimpy amount of memory, but WD really gets the most out of these limited resources
I was also impressed with the web interface

There isn't too much to actually do besides adding users and shares and performing a few maintenance tasks, but it's easy to use and very responsive

The device itself is very clean, with a gigabit Ethernet port, USB 3.0 port for backups (but not printer sharing), and power jack

 The only hitch I ran into was when I first fired it up, it didn't recognize the drive
I ended up having to do a full reset and it's been fine ever since, but it's still very strange to have to do that for a brand new product.I've had this for a day and a half, and so far I love it
Unless you're a video editor and you're copying raw, uncompressed video back and forth or something like that, the WD My Cloud will probably be fine (but if you are that heavy user, go with the a Synology NAS or the like)


It can serve very high bitrate blu ray rips just fine and backing up even a few hundred gigabytes of data only takes a little over an hour (assuming you're using a gigabit switch)

If your usage is similar to mine, go for it.

$REVIEW.: For starters, I love Tivo.  I have three of them now, generation one, two, and now the HD Tivo.  So you've got someone who loves them, Tivo is basically the Macintosh of TV to the cable company's PC.My Tivo is slow as dirt.  So unbelievably slow that I keep calling customer service because I can't see what's wrong with it.  It often does not respond to remote commands until you press it for the thousanth time.  I rebooted, I change remotes, I got the latest software, and the thing is still slow.  It seems like trying to run a modern game program on a 286 PC.I just have no idea what is wrong with this thing.  I am going to give Tivo one more shot then I'm done with it.  Seems I'm a minority here but I had to say something.- Updated Dec 2007:  They sent me a replacement unit and I'm good now.  Took four visits from Comcast to get the cards running but I'm online now.  The HD Tivo is a hair slower than the regular Tivo but still worth buying.

$REVIEW.: This is a well constructed, well padded camera case.  It is a bit smaller inside than the dimensions on Case Logic's web site, so it gets four stars instead of five.  My wife just ordered a Case Logic case for her Samsung tablet (actually it is described as a netbook case) that is equally well constructed and well padded.  It appears that Case Logic makes pretty good cases for a reasonable cost.

$REVIEW.: at first, i thought this was a coup: 4 TB under $300

however, this is definitely "you get what you pay for." while i do think this device can be produced in "non-buggy" form (and it appears to have it's proponents), it is just too dicey a thing to leave to chance
let's look at my experience with it.in the first 8 hours of usage, i was trying to copy about 500 gb from one external drive to this drive


in that period of time, it must have dismounted about 8 times

"fine", i thought, "maybe there is a problem with just copying stuff." so i decided to use chronosync to copy the files

in 2 attempts to copy the entire folder structure, it dismounted both times and took about 4 hours to do it


and i thought raid 0 (striping) would be fast.i threw in the towel and reformatted and zeroed the drive (took two tries at 14 hours per attempt, but i got the job done)

returned it and purchased a 2 tb glyph gpt50 (no raid, just a single large disc)
using chronosync, not only did it successfully stay mounted (is this really what we need to worry about?), but it completed the job in about 2.5 hours

amazing.if the glyph can stay mounted and performs this much better than the g-tech raid, then it's the hand's down winner.

$review_text.: I have no complaints about this product. It is well built, easy to understand and install and could easily hold a tv the weight it claims. My only suggestion would be is measure 3 times and drill once because there is no way to adjust for a few degrees off from left to right. Meaning if you make one side slightly taller than the other your tv will be at an angle and the only correction is to pull it off and redrill all the holes at another height.

$REVIEW.: I own a Speck Case for mine and love it.  And would not trade it for anything. (the one Target sells.)  I had looked at this case for myself but didn't like because the outside of the case sits on surface and where I would read at times it could get wet. The case is awesome and fine product but the, I want to use a cuss word here, but the light is crap.  I bought this as a gift for someone else and put mine in it to kind of break it in because two of the strapes are leather.  Do not buy for the light throw that away as soon you get it but the case is perfect but not for me,but whom the gift is for, she will love it. I only gave them four stars for the crappy light they try to sell as a feature. My advice to Acase keep selling the case for the same price and drop the light. It makes your product look cheap, and it is not, or get a decent light like the kandle or something close to it and do a package deal.  The crap you are giving away does not add value to your product at all, I fell for it and I know better.

I love that it provides a layer of protection for my device. It's comfortable to wear and doesn't irritate my wrist when I run, (ran eight miles in it this weekend, forgot I was wearing it). The only down side it that the material will collect a lot of lint, but if you are wearing it strictly for workouts you won't even notice. I also noticed that the black seemed to pick up more debris than the pink one. It's not just the color either, it literally collects more, and you can tell the difference. Either way it goes, I would recommend the product and I plan on purchasing at least two more before they are impossible to find.

$REVIEW.: I think the performance of these types of antenna would vary depending on each location and proximity to the towers, so keep in mind that I live on the 2nd flr in the city of Chicago.This spaceship-like HDTV antenna does a pretty decent job at picking up the digital channels, the only one it doesn't get is 2-1. I would not recommend using this for the analog channels, although it may not matter as this will be phasing out in the next 2 years. There is also an additional power adapter, which I suppose, boost signal quality, but have not noticed any changes when it is used or tuned. For under $25, it's ok, I would like to try out the Terk and compare the performance and wonder about the design of the "plate" vs "prongs" type, maybe someone can comment about this. For the most part, it's priced and performance is fine, but not great - there will be instances of the hiccup effect where the audio may go away or the picture may pixelate occassionally for a few secs but this is the nature of a weak or break in digital reception. And btw, the size of this thing wouldn't be deemed small, estimate maybe 12".

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a 7" Tablet. I was between this and an Acer that was $100 cheaper. I figured you get what you pay for. The other tablet hah HDMI out, but they were sold out of them, and this was an impulse buy. This Tablet has expandable memory and you can buy the cable to hook up to HDMI. Also when you plug USB into your computer, it recognizes it immediately for transfering files onto the microSd in the tablet or into the tablets memory.Pros:-Customizable-Very Good Speed, ie Browser and Opening Apps-Amazing Picture Quality by Samsung as usual.-Comes with a program similar to office already preloaded for documents, spreadsheets, etc.-Unlike Apple, when you transfer files, you rarely have to convert them to other formats. I have AVI files that go right onto the tablet and I can play through a downloaded app from Android market. It has all necessary codecs.-Using DoubleTwist you can set your tablet up with an Itunes similar program.-Slightly smaller than Ipad so easier to carry around.Cons:-There are a lot less apps on here than on an Apple. ie. Scrabble with Friends.-Using Optimum app on Android, you cannot watch live TV, where as I can watch TV on my iphone with the same app.-Peel app is pretty bad. I got it to hook up to my TV, but the IR capabilities aren't easy to work with. It makes a poor universal remote. If they did not put so much other stuff into the app and made it solely a remote it probably would have worked better. You shouldn't buy a tablet if you want a universal remote though. I thought I could tweak it being an engineer, fix it a little, but its a pretty poor app. Only one really.Basically, I love this tablet. It does everything I need it too.

I simply put my media files on a USB stick plug it into the unit and then watch on my tube TV.The unit is quite small which is great if you need to bring it somewhere or take it on the road.The only real issue I have with the unit is that the USB devices do not power down when the unit is turned off

$REVIEW.: I bought the 120 inch with 16:9 aspect ratio and Tripod. The screen quality is good (thick material) and the gain ratio is good so colors are looking great.Easy to setup the screen and there are couple of locks to hold in a position.One of the best feature I like is, you can adjust the height of the tripod, this helps to have the right eye-to-screen line of sight and doesn't bother your eyes even if you're little closer to the screen.Draw back I see is, it is too heavy. Instead of aluminum casing it appears this one has metal or steal casing adding pretty good weight to the unit.Then the spring tension seems to be very high, so when you want to stretch the screen fully, it is bit too tight (could have been better).The plastic covers at the sides of the screen easily fell-off (it is not screwed or glued).The top of the screen where a metal loop is attached to put in the hook when stretched is attached to a thin metal bar. This seems to flimsy, but so far it is holding. ES, could have attached the loop to the primary bar.Even after several usage (its been few months since I bought) I see the screen waves but not too much and it is not interrupting the movies (if you focus on the wave you still can see it when movie is running).When stretched, the screen sides are curving inwards, I guess that is common for any non-fixed frame screens.For future improvement:1) Please reduce the weight, this a portable screen.2) using Aluminium casing and provide handle support on the casing as well.3) need little more easy when pulling the screen out, too much tension (causing problem while packing also).4) Instead of turn lock of the tripod extension, please provide lock similar to the base (helps to lock it quickly and doesn't get hurt due to high tension on the screen rolling spring).5) Provide velcroe or some kind of belt to hold the stand & Screen together (as it is, the screen/tripod turns when packed, causing trouble to move)This is good size portable screen, with improvements, this could be the best.Over all I like it.

$REVIEW.: A few years ago, I purchased a Sansa Clip.  I used it frequently and then it disappeared.  It turns out my son took (stole) it and was using it for his own listening enjoyment.  I purchased an Apple iPod Nano and felt I had made up for my loss.  I loaded the iPod with songs (for which it performs well) and podcasts and audio books.  The podcasts and audio books play well, but are out of sequence.  I tried to modify my playlists but to no avail; playback was out of sequence and it drove me crazy.  I recalled my Sansa Clip and how it played my podcasts back in correct order so I asked my son to return my Clip.  It turns out that he cannot find it in his messy room.  I went online to see what Sansa had been up to since my first encounter with them several years before.  I tust the name and never thought of looking anywhere else for an mp3 player.I was pleasantly surprised in what Sansa had created.  The Clip+ really caught my eye.  I considered teh 8GB model that was expandable to 16GB with the additional purchase of an 8GB mini SD card.  I promptly purchased the Clip+ and the card.  I couldn't be happier.  For over $50 less than what I paid for my iPod Nano, I have a player with equal capacity.  But its the features and the performance that I'm particularly fond of.  I will elaborate on a couple.First is loading content.  Unlike iPod, all I need to do is drag and drop my files.  I create my playlists on my computer then install it complete onto the Clip+. This is so much simpler than the Apple method of synching through iTunes.  The mini SD card is treated as a separate storage device (which it is) so I can segregate between the two devices.  This Clip+ is also much easier to afix to my belt.  The rugged large clip easily slides through a belt loop where the Nano seems to be awkward whenever I attempt to install it.  The Clip+ uses simple buttons to access my playlists.  The Nano's touch screen is tricky to navigate once it is on my belt loop.  When I am in motion the Nano is even more difficult to readily access specific content.  True, it is best to remove the Clip+ from my belt for quick navigation, but with audio books the need for accessing is less common than with music.I truly love my Clip+.  Videos online comparing the Clip+ with the Nano tend to agree that the Clip+ beats its Apple rival hands down.  The Clip+ is more affordable and an all around easier device to load and use.  If you are in the market for an mp3 player, I strongly recommend the Clip+ as your first choice.  If you are like me and already have the iPod Nano, still consider the Clip+ to come through where the Nano falls short.

Believe it or not, I put the 855 into the case (VERY difficult), then worked for about 15 minutes trying to get the darn thing OUT of the case!  I assumed that, being new, it just required some "stretching" to accommodate the device.  WRONG - after 2 days in the case, I still couldn't get it out.  Finally went to Best Buy and bought a zippered Lowepro case for the device, and threw the Garmin case in the trash.  I think this case might work with the newer version of Nuvis, which are thinner than the 8XX series Nuvi.  If you buy an older model Garmin Nuvi, pass on this case and get something different.

I initially purchased the Toshiba P755-S5265. Great all around laptop but just wasn't happy with the sound. I'm very detailed especially with my PC's. Saw this on sale the following week. Always heard good/bad things about HP but this model just had more options to offer for the money so I decided to go for it and try it out. Just want to say....I'm glad I made the exchange. Its a really stylish laptop, one thing HP always had on their side. The extra options this one had that the Toshiba didn't....blu ray player, 2 USB 3.0, fingerprint reader, silver aluminum body, bluetooth, beats audio, and a better graphics processor with the AMD A8. The Toshiba was an I5, which was pretty fast, but for me this time around I wanted graphics over speed. With an AMD processor you always have the option of overclocking the processor if your a techy. No matter how much I have running the laptop just still seems to run cool. Very Good!Overall....Excellent! I've been so used to 17" screens, the 15.6" is something I need to get used to but it is alot more portable.One thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars.....when the screen turns off there is a white shadow on the bottom right corner. I've read several complaints about this but it looks like to me its because of the HP Logo that is lite up while the laptop is on. Not sure if there is anyway to turn it off but thats whats causing the issue. Overall though its nothing to make me dislike this laptop.

$review_text.: There isn't much to say about an SD card. Either it works or it doesn't. This one works just fine for me in my Sanyo Xacti CG6 hybrid video/digicam. No problems for me. I should note that the CG6 is NOT an HD resolution camera - 640 x 480 only.One point to keep in mind, and I knew this before I bought it but didn't think about it until after, is that these high capacity (>2mb) SD cards are not readable using older card readers. I can't use it in my portable card reader or in the built-in card reader on my 3 year old computer. I must connect the camera to a USB port in order to copy files from this card to my computer.

$review_text.: The player is quite slim and works fine except I'm having issues with Windows 8
It found it the first time I plugged it in and worked perfectly

The next time I plugged it in, it found the unit but I was unable to read or access any files on it
I have tried a half dozen different disks, all commercial grade, and none have worked

I ended up plugging the unit into another computer that runs Windows 7 and it works perfectly there
There is NO driver update for Win 8 so make sure what operating system you have before ordering

If I discover a solution for the Win 8 problems, I'll come back and update this post.

$REVIEW.: I bought this a couple years ago to replace my x-10 powermid remote extender that died. This one has worked much better for me than that ever did!The thing I like best about it is that the transmitter part goes in your remote. That means a couple good things - no need to have a transmitter plugged in somewhere, and no need to aim the remote in any particular direction. This makes it work a lot better for me. You can also use it in multiple rooms.The downside of that is that it only works in one remote at a time. If you use a universal remote, no problem. If you need to use multiple remotes you can buy additional transmitters.The fact that this works at all is kind of amazing - I guess it senses the increased current draw from the LED emitter. Which means it might not work with all remotes.I like that this comes with an adapter so it works in place of either a AAA or AA battery, and comes with two batteries; one is always charging inside the receiver so you never are caught with a dead battery. The battery lasts a long time for me though - I may have changed it out a total of 3 times so far.Another feature I like is the LED that flashes visibly when IR is being sent. That's a good way to verify communication between the transmitter and receiver is working.

$REVIEW.: this mcover is definitely cheaper than the speck case, but i wasn't expecting the bottom case to have 2 large holes plus ventilation holes. I guess this is done to help with heat issues. But the amount of holes in this will cause a lot of dust to enter and possible scratches. On the otherhand, the speck case has small ventilation holes and it thoroughly covers the bottom of the macbook pro. If overheating is really an issue, which really shouldn't since it is a macbook pro, then this mcover is perfect. I will use this mcover for now since I use my macbook pro mainly at home. but as soon as i take my macbook pro out with me, I will be buying the speck cover for extra bottom protection.

$REVIEW.: Like most camera owners, we have what seems like tons of 35mm negatives boxed up hiding on the top shelf of the closet


A surprisingly good, low cost alternative to sending out those treasured negatives to be processed is the Wolverine F2D Film to Digital Scanner


Make no mistake, this product is not going to revive what time took away
What it does do is provide above average (5 mega pixels) scans of negatives/slides without downloading software or linking to a computer.Out of the box, the Wolverine F2D is outfitted with a built in 1.5" color LCD screen

Power, flip, mirror and OK/Scan buttons are located on the top of the unit


This model comes with both a film negative and slide trays


The trays holds up to six images

Both trays are mounted with an easy to close magnetic latch

A 1gb SD card, cleaning brush, USB cable, USB power adapter and users manual are all included in the box


Buyers beware, my associate purchased the same unit from a third party Amazon vendor and found that both the SD card and USB cable missing.After reading the instruction manual, I opted to power up the F2D via my computer's USB port

Remember, it can also be plugged into an AC outlet


Start up was a breeze
Just insert the SD card (card contacts facing up) until you hear a click


Press the orange power button to power up
Once I inserted the tray viewing my negatives was instant

Press the OK/Copy button to scan


Press the button again to save images to the SD card


An hour glass will appear on the screen when scanning

A blinking red dot shows up when the unit is ready for the next scan


Just slide the tray into position and the next image is ready to be scanned
I was surprised with the clarity of each image viewed via the LCD screen.For better scanning results, I recommend cleaning the scanner with the enclosed brush before inserting the next negative strip


Also spraying both the film tray and negatives/slides with canned air can sometimes make all the difference
After scanning, I uploaded the images onto my computer via the SD card
With the exception of water spotting and scratches my scanned photographs were surprisingly crisp

Instead of using Photoshop, I opted to utilize Google's Picasa 3 photo software to try and correct the imperfections
I was happy with the end result.With the exception of keeping the unit safe from dust, heat and water, maintenance on this product is a no brainer


There are no bulbs or parts to remove and replace


The light source is powered by 3 White LEDs

Besides the aforementioned enclosed tools, the Wolverine F2D Scanner comes with the standard one year limited warranty

The manufacturer provides a surprisingly responsive customer support number which is available Monday through Friday 9am-5pm PST.Contrary to older reviews, I found no real problems with the Wolverine F2D 100 Film to Digital Scanner


Paired with the right retouching software, it is a good working companion that covers the basics

It goes without saying, this model is a low cost alternative to professional photo retouching services.After a couple of issues with product quality and returns policy via third party Amazon partners/vendors, I now make every effort to ensure a safe purchase directly from Amazon

Sometimes I may pay a few more dollars, but its money well spent

If Amazon doesn't have it in stock I don't buy it from one of its partners/vendors
Amazon goes out of its way with providing outstanding customer service and a 30 day money back guarantee

That said, I do recommend this product.

$REVIEW.: How it looks: The silver version of this drive has a brushed aluminum front with rough etched Seagate logo, rest of the drive case is plastic.  It is the same silver as a macbook but since it is brushed instead of powder coated it catches a lot more light.  Not unattractive.  Thankfully the LED light is white and pulses rather than WD's annoying blue led flicker, the thin white light goes off when not used for awhile.Sizing: Compared to an iPhone 5 the Seagate Slim USB3 500GB drive is a little bit thicker (~2-3mm), shorter length wise (~1cm) and wider width wise (~2cm).Speed: This drive uses a standard blue USB 3 cable (included) that is backwards compatible to USB2 meaning that you can plug it into any Mac or PC.  Thunderbolt drives are the fastest, but this drive isn't compatible with Seagate's Thunderbolt adapter.  USB 3 is fast, but if you connect it to a Mac that doesn't have USB 3 support it will run at the very slow USB 2 speed (ie long file copy times).  Unlike PCs which use a blue USB port to indicate USB 3 compatibility a Mac doesn't easily tell you if it is USB 3 or USB 2.  You'll have to look up your model specs by going to the Apple icon, choosing about this Mac, more info and then googling your model number for details (surprising this isn't made easier, but any Mac model made earlier than mid 2012 probably doesn't have USB 3 support).It shows up in the Mac finder as &#34;Seagate Slim Drive&#34; with an Orange USB icon drive.  It contains a Mac and Windows installer and 400mb of videos (why they couldn't ship a single higher quality MPEG4 with multiple audio tracks is beyond me).  The list of files on the drive are at the bottom of this review.Drive is formatted NTFS and has no support for SMART drive sensors or hardware encryption.  If you want to optimize it for a Mac only environment or plan on using Time Machine for backups you will need to launch Disk Utility on your Mac to erase the drive.  I chose Mac OS extended (Journaled, Encrypted) because I plan on using it to backup my MacBook Air via Time Machine and don't want anyone finding my drive to be able to access the contents (uses software encryption which is slower than WD's version).  It should just take a minute to format.If you get the error message: Disk Encryption. Disk Erase failed with the error: Couldn&#8217;t unmount disk, then you should make sure to dismount the disk image (drag drive to trash) and try again.  You can't be accessing the drive while trying to format it.If you go into Time Machine's preferences you can now add the Seagate drive as a replacement or as an addition.  I use my Airport Time Capsule at home and wanted to add this drive as a backup at work so I added both.  In the time it has taken me to write this review Time Machine has backed up 7GB of the 72GB needed.  Wishing Seagate had a slim thunderbolt drive, but Apple is already onto thunderbolt 2 so I'm feeling a bit behind on this USB 2 only Mid 2011 MacBook Air!Files on the drive are:Seagate Dashboard Installer.dmgSeagate Dashboard Installer.exeSlimIcon.icoVideo (folder)en-US (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4fr-FR (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4it-IT (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4ko-KR (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4ru-RU (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4sv-SE (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4zh-CN (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4zh-TW (folder)Introducing Seagate Backup Plus Video.mp4Protecting Your Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Saving Social Media Files With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4Sharing To Social Media Sites With Seagate Dashboard Tutorial.mp4

$review_text.: I waited to review this lens until I returned from our Hawaiian vacation, but I was very pleased with my purchase from the start.I have a gallery of the test shots I did with this lens, and perhaps that would be sufficient to answer any questions anyone would have about the lens.[...]The light was not too great for a number of the shots, but they are still usable for examining the performance of the lens.I had some misgivings about buying the lens because of reports Sigma sufferes from inconsistent quality (some users having to exchange the lens a few times), however, I did not encounter any of the described problems.  I am not a pro, but perhaps qualify as experienced amateur.  Still, I can't readily quote all of the lens-related lingo.  What concerns me is if I like the shot after I take it, and so far I've been very happy with the lens.This is the first non-Nikon lens I have ever purchased in the 30+ years of Nikon shooting, but it's not likely to be the last. The cost was about half of a comparable Nikon product, and the performance according to many reviews is better.  I cannot offer a direct comparison to other products as I don't have a similar Nikon lens, but I can say this lens is always with me, and I actually look for opportunities to use it.

$REVIEW.: This cable works just as well as any other cable


There are only two problems
First of all, the cable is unshielded which screws up the signal when near other power cords


I use my PS3 with this cable, and because the cable is close to the power cord, the signal gets interrupted which leads to lost audio and lag


Overall, i would not buy this cable again, because even though the price is so low, i would just get the same problems


It's best to get a Category 2 certified HDMI cable, and even those aren't too pricy, I am buying the MediaBridge one for $10.


$SUMMARY.: Good cable, but not shielded.

$review_text.: This little 30 pin extender works. By using this extender a Blue Mikey microphone can be attached to an iPod Touch high enough to allow a right angle connector for headphones to also be attached. NOTE: this extender doesn't raise the microphone high enough to allow a straight 3.5 mm headphone plug but does raise the microphone high enough for a right angle 3.5 mm headphone plug.Be aware that Apple's 30 pin connector was a dumb idea. The slot collects dirt and pocket lint that then prevents our iPods  from being recharged or connected to accessories. The connector should have at least had a snap connector so that accessories would stay connected. Apple will be rejoining the rest of the world with an industry compatible connector on their future devices. But we still need connectors that snap together like old telephone connectors so that our devices and their accessories can't easily fall away from each other.NOTE: I use my iPod Touch v3 with an app called soundAMP-R and the Blue Mikey mic/with extender as a hearing aid. Yes, it is large and yes the headphone wire is a nuisance but damn it works good.

$REVIEW.: I love this TV.  It's big and the picture is outstanding, particularly when using HD sources.  When using non-HD sources, the picture is alright, nothing special, but really that is to be expected in any tv, especially one of this size.  The worst thing I can say about this television is that it does have a lot more glare than my other 57" television, and it can be annoying.  Any light shining from behind you will be very noticeable on the screen.  Fix?  Shut off the light.  I rated this TV at 4 stars instead of 5 because of this glare.All in all an outstanding product.  I have owned many televisions over the years, RCA's, Toshiba's, Panasonic, Hitachi, and by far the best televisions have been the Panasonics.  Boy did I love my Tau :)ABOUT DELIVERY SERVICES:I purchased this television through Amazon from Electronics Expo.  They used a delivery service called Manna Distribution Services.  A single delivery man came and brought the TV into the house - a 'threshhold' delivery, just inside the door. I signed for it and off he went.  I then took the cardboard cover off the top and discovered the TV screen was shattered.  I immediately contacted Electronics Expo, who asked me to provide some pictures of the TV, which I did.  He asked if I wanted to cancel the order or a new TV, I wanted a new TV.  He took care of the arrangements.  Ten days later Manna Distrubtion Services again came, took the broken TV and delivered the new one.  Before I would sign I undid the box and had a look at the screen and this TV was in apparent good shape.  I signed and off he went.The moral of this is do not be timid about inspecting any product that is delivered to you.  For myself I am uncomfortable with doing it, but for a high cost item such as this, and the amount of time (ten days) I had to have it in my house (my house is small so this was a major imposition - and also I had no TV in the livingroom for this whole period of time), it is well worth the effort to examine the product before signing.  If broken, refuse delivery.All in all I feel Electronics Expo did a good job, as well as Manna Distribution Services regarding delivery.  I only wish I had been less timid and thoroughly examined the TV before I signed for it.  I am pointing this out for the rest of you so that you don't make the same mistake I did.SOUND:I am not rating the sound portion of this TV.  I have not even turned on the TV speakers to be honest, as I have it connected to a Marantz SR6003 a/v receiver via HDMI and listen to the sound through Acoustic Research AR1 Hi-Res speakers.  Most reviews I've read rate the sound as of good quality, but many people will prefer listening to the sound via a/v receivers and chosen speaker system.CONCLUSION:The new TV is just terrific, beautiful picture, and apparently well made.  I surely would recommend this product.  The recent price drops have made it even more attractive because Panasonic has now discontinued it and come out with their new models.  If you are looking for a large screen TV at a reasonable price you cannot go wrong with this one.I hope you find this review helpful.

$REVIEW.: The FM transmitter on this device is super weak
 Picking multiple blank FM channels in two different cars and you can barely hear the music, even with the mp3 players (I tried two different ones) set to MAX volume


 Very static ridden sound and low volume, you have to crank it on your radio to hear it, and it sounds horrible.That aside, does this thing work?  Technically yes, it will play music from a USB drive or hooked up to a mp3 player

 Beware the mp3 cord is very short which is a hassle


 The device is very cheaply constructed

 It barely fits in the cigarette lighter, the slightest nudge will power it off


 This is a problem if you are trying to push the buttons on top.The remote control that came with mine barely worked, but perhaps the battery it came with was dead, I did not try another.This is cheap junk from China, pure and simple, spend another 10 bucks and get something that works, like the Coby FM transmitter (works well).

Can't imagine just using this by itself. The picture is good and the little lines do help. I wish you could expand them to where they are the size of my condo parking spot. Even then I'd still probably use the side mirrors. The Pioneer has an option to turn the camera on when driving forward.

$REVIEW.: This remote control is one of the most inexpensive remotes in the Logitech Harmony line. It has a bright color screen unlike the black & white lower models, but no touch-screen as compared to their more expensive models. You have up to 6 devices that you can programmed with the 700. Easy to program as long as you are not afraid to sit in front of a PC or Mac. You will have to connect to Logitech's Harmony website first to register before you can start programming the remote.It comes with low discharge batteries - applause! It also comes with an AC adapter for charging the remote. It can be recharged by connecting it to a USB PC port. But I will just use my regular battery charger and swap batteries which I found more convenient than plugging and decommissioning the remote during charging..Everything went smoothly until I hit a roadblock with my Western Digital WDTV. First, it is categorized vaguely as a computer media player. Then it does not have an "OK" button. It took me about 30 minutes doing research on forums and FAQs to make it work.Once you have a successfully functioning remote, try to avoid using your other remotes from now on. The Harmony works with combination of devices. Generally you only need to push one button to turn on everything that you need to turn on. If you want to watch a DVD; your DVD player, TV and receiver will turn on at the same time. It will also choose the correct input for your TV. But once you use another remote, the program sequence will be disrupted. If you go back to your Harmony, you can no longer use a single button operation and now you need some fixing. That's where to Help button comes in.The help button is very useful as it can walk you through when you encountered any problems, like when a device is off when it is supposed to be on and vice versa. The help button can fix most basic functions and operations. (Is your TV on? Is it set to HDMI? and so on; but it may not help you for more complex operation.)Personally, I do not like the shape of the remote. It seems to lack the coolness factor as compared to its other siblings. The remote also is imbalanced, having most of the weight concentrated where the battery compartment is located.Pros:+ Powerful signals+ Can start your TV, DVD, Amps, etc., with a single button+ Comes with low discharge batteries.Cons:- Not the best looking remote- No Bluetooth. Will not work with your Wii or PS3 without additional accessory.

I only have 100 Mbps nic cards so i don't know if they really deliver full speed but I do get 100 Mbps. Now that I have this kit set up I may buy some more of these. I might give some to my in-laws because their house has real problems with wireless.
$SUMMARY.: Works fine for me

$REVIEW.: If I purchased this TV based on the current information available, both on Amazon and LG's website, I might give this TV a better review. That being said, I am extremely disappointed that I researched and reviewed and came to the conclusion that this TV was the best purchase for me based on advertised features. Those features that were advertised, but not really available were the TruBlack filter as well as Skype availability and being 'wireless internet ready'. When I contacted LG about the false information available, all they told me was 'sorry'. Both Amazon and LG's websites have been updated to include only the correct information.Besides those facts, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised at the picture quality. I am now into approximately hour 120 or so and the quality is very impressive. I spent time with the picture 'display' menu to tweak the picture and I LOVE it.The menu is very easy to use. Set up was simple. The TV looks very impressive. We do not have it wall mounted. It is so sleek and slim that it takes up much less room on my stand than our previous TV. Haven't used the internet connection yet, because I'm waiting on the required LG only wi-fi dongle. (big disappointment there)Wished I could give it rave reviews. I wanted to love this TV. I spent lots of time researching, pouring over reviews, specs, etc. only to find that this isn't the TV I thought I was getting.Bottom line, GREAT price for a good picture, very large screen, and lots of features.Update....Received the LG wi-fi dongle. Not very easy to set that thing up. I couldn't get it to connect to my network that was security enabled. I was able to enter the network key, but it wouldn't connect unless I disabled the security.After disabling the security temporarily to utilize the NetCast features, we loved them!VUDU movies were unbelievable!!! We watched several HD movies through VUDU instantly. The picture and sound was UNBELIEVABLE. No waiting. Movies played with no 'stopping' to catch up. Picture was PERFECT.My only complaint about Netflix was the fact that you couldn't browse the Netflix available movies. The only thing available (unlike when you use Wii or Playstation to view Netflix) is your Now Playing Queue.NetCast was easy to use and our favorite was VUDU. LOVE that feature.Disappointed about the lack of Pandora. Disappointed about the difficulty in setting up the wireless dongle.Still overall pleased with this purchase!!!Update (2/16/11)....Now that I'm connected to the internet via the WiFi Dongle, I have updated the streaming features and love the connection.I can connect to Netflix (great new interface), VuDu, CinemaNow, YouTube, and Yahoo widgets.Had a Super Bowl XLV party and guests loved the picture quality and wanted specifics about the brand/model of TV.Very pleased with the purchase!

$review_text.: Through a confluence of events, I've not had much time to really sit back, relax, and enjoy my new home theater setup yet.  However, what time I have been able to spend with it has been great.In addition to this receiver, I currently have a 46" LCD 60hz Toshiba Regza, a PS3, a Wii, and a Charter HD Motorola Cable box (no DVR).  I bought two Mica In-Ceiling 8" speakers to use as side surround sound speakers with my current 5.1 setup, which are the full-size speakers that came with my 2001 Kenwood HTIB receiver package.  I look forward to replacing the old speakers after upgrading my TV to something larger.However, using the auto-calibration function with the receiver, so far my speaker setup sounds great.  Very full and warm, even with digital music.  Movies so far sound fantastic.  The PS3 and this receiver shake hands perfectly.  The Toshiba TV has Regza Link, which handles some functions automatically, like input switching.No, the GUI on the receiver is not the greatest.  The TV is at least a 2008 model, if not older, but its menus are much more intuitive and prettier.  But it's sufficient to get to the settings you want to tweak during your inital setup.  If you are an audiophile who must tweak more than just the soundfields and such during normal use, which are all accessable using the remote and front of the receiver without the GUI, this receiver will be a pain for you.It also took a bit to get the receiver working with my internet connection, but after troubleshooting, I got it up and running so it could download a firmware update, which it installed no problem.  Since I have a PS3 for netflix and mp3s and streaming digital music available through my cable box, I have not used the built-in internet apps for Pandora and such on this receiver much, beyond just trying them out.  That said, the GUI again doesn't encourage you to make extensive use of the built-in apps unless they're your only option.  While not pretty, the apps are serviceable and you will be able to listen to your own Pandora stations and the like.  I'd have to ask, though, how much you really need your Pandora to look pretty, if you're anything like me and only put music on when you're either in the car or wanting background noise for some other activity that doesn't involve sitting in front of the TV.I've not used the Wii much with this, as it's the wife's gaming system.  However, to keep things simple for the wife and visiting nieces, I wanted the Wii to be able to be used without the home theater being turned on, so the Wii is connected directly to the TV anyway, with the TV using an optical output to get the sound back to the receiver when necessary.Overall, I wanted a 7.1 home theater that would sound great to my non-audiophile ears when I want to watch an action or sci-fi movie, that also had some bells and whistles and some future proofing via updateable firmware.  I feel I got that, at a great price.

The lamps could have been of a higher output, and a small (3rd) umbrella added to the smaller of the three &#34;stands&#34; would have been nice

$REVIEW.: I am disappointed in this product, which is unexpected because I love the IM600 that preceded it


 I decided to give this one a try because it looked like it would have better sound with the 4 speakers, and I wanted something that I could use with my iPhone (the IM600 only works with iPods).Maybe I was spoiled by the IM600, but I was disappointed with the inMotion Max IMT702 from the beginning


 I still would have kept it, but the unit turned out to be defective (explained below).I will try to give information to help readers decide whether to buy this based on features
 The first thing that I didn't like is that rather than have physical buttons to press, there are touch sensitive areas on the top
 I prefer, as on the previous model, to have physical buttons for the tactile feedback they offer.I have the unit on a table next to where I sit


 Because I am on the same level, I can't see the top of the radio, so it is awkward to use the buttons.The cradle area where the iPod / iPhone goes initially didn't want to pop out for me but after some use it does so, but not "convincingly"
 Rather than a nice click, it has a mushy feeling, it comes out just a bit, and then I pull it out the rest of the way.The sound at low volume is not as good IMO as the IM600


 However, this unit can go louder without distortion, so for me it was a wash


 There is not much bass, so I use the equalizer of my iPod / iPhone to obtain more bass


 It would be nice if the unit were designed for more bass -- I know this is possible because I have other kinds of audio devices that are smaller and put out more bass.Even when I first got the unit there were very infrequent "glitches" or pauses in the music

 It concerned me, but they were so infrequent that I didn't worry too much about it.Tonight though, the unit has been having major problems

 While playing, it all of a sudden cut out
 I turned it back on, and it worked for a very short period, then it started making popping noises (on low volume) about every second


 I turned it off and on several times to try to fix it, and I made sure that there was a long interval between some of the times
 Then two other problems happened


 One, occasionally the unit would say "Reset?" in the display, and all of the lights flickered
 I didn't know how to reset it (there doesnt appear to be a reset button) so I tried the buttons on the top and it seemed to reset, and then the messages "Region 1..
Region 2 ..


4" came up.Then, the volume would increase by itself

 I had it low, around 15, and it would go up to 40, and make the popping noises.I treated the unit very well, it never fell or anything

 Right now it is unusable


 Even with the design IMO not as good as the IM600, and sound quality not as good as I think it should be, I was willing to keep it


 Now I will need to return it to Amazon for a refund.Oh, one last thing
 The FM antenna on the IM600 pulled out and it was a metal telescoping antenna

 The FM antenna on this unit is a wire that is loose that needs to be attached when the antenna is used (or kept on, but if you use it portably, you would want to detach when carrying around).I rarely give 1 star to an item, I wanted this to be a great item, but regrettably this unit gets one star.Update:About a week ago I contacted the company's support line and received a voice prompt to leave a message


 I offered to send my defective unit to them with a detailed description of the problems to aid in their diagnosis of the problem and product development

 I did not get a response


 A proactive company, in my opinion, should use such opportunities, especially when my defective unit does not appear to be an isolated case based on other reviews here and elsewhere on the Internet.Update:Amazon processed the return and refunded the entire amount of my purchase
 Because the unit was defective, I was able to print out a mailing label for the return and I didn't have to pay for return shipping


 This is one of the reasons I feel comfortable buying from Amazon.


$SUMMARY.: Defective unit, poor quality, placement of controls, antenna

$REVIEW.: My Kindle Fire travels with me on a transit bus every weekday to work and back and I feel it's very secure in this leather case.  I love that I can rotate the viewing angle from portrait to landscape as I don't have a lot of room on the bus and this helps without the need to hold it all the time.  Plus I use it to watch movies when I'm in my craft room.  It's not real light and the strap is uncomfortable.  I'm left handed so use the strap over my right hand--but not often since it's tight.  It's fastened in snuggly and I like that opening and shutting the case turns it on and off.  The strap that goes over the front keeps it turned off.  There is easy access to the ports so I never take it out of the case.  I can recommend this one and I've had 3 cases so far.

$review_text.: No, they are not as good as the OEM products.  But the OEM is so expensive.  I can carry one of these around a backup.To take full advantage of this, consider1) Charge it in full before you take it with you as backup.  It does not seem to hold the charge very well if you charge and leave it for weeks.2) Do not leave in the camera, leave the OEM in the camera and this as a backup.  This runs out without insufficient (inaccurate) warning.But a fully and freshly charged one will go for quite a while.

$review_text.: This Verso Prologue Case Cover is tastefully designed, and meant to replicate the beautiful, old leather book covers of an earlier era


 Although this is a man-made leather, it's as pleasing as the animal skin version
 It has the fine graining and shading found in very expensive leathers
 Embossed with gold, it's every bit as convincing as the costlier products


 While the color is red, this is really more of a very light burgundy and its spine is a contrasting tobacco color


 The micro suede, dark charcoal interior is soft and will provide good protection for your device


 (After using my Second Generation Kindle for two-and-one-half years, with its leather cover, this one is just as pretty and I believe the construction is equally as good.)The gentle (and hidden) magnetic closure makes it easy to keep the cover securely protecting your e-reader/tablet

 It's held in place by the elastic bands at each of the four corners inside the cover


 The bands are wider than those of the earlier Kindle
 While I never had a problem keeping them on my Kindle, this wider band can only make it even easier to secure it.A second feature I like is the pocket on the inside cover's left side


 There is just enough space to slip in a couple of business or index cards.While you won't be turning any pages the old-fashioned way, this cover makes you feel you've got a fabulous 'leather' book in your hands.

$REVIEW.: I live in a market with all major networks broadcasting in HDTV - and don't watch much except PBS  (ok, and The Simpsons) - so a set-top receiver should be the perfect solution.I purchased a Samsung SIR-T150 soon after it came on the market, and later a DTB-H260F on the promise that it was much improved over the older model.Both provide a fantastic signal to my plasma monitor (no built-in tuner).... but only when they actually work.Both have the same problem:  turn it on ... the signal is sharp, the audio fantastic .... and usually within 10 minutes the signal craps out with a 'weak or no signal' legend on the screen for all channels.Turn off the units ... wait an hour, and you get another 10 minutes of broadcast.I've tried a variety of antennae, indoors and out  (nothing on the roof ... hate ladders)Some have suggested that these earlier models don't do well at handling multi-path signals (distinguishing between the direct broadcast, and the additional signals bouncing off of anything in the neighborhood)I'm not really ready to drop another couple hundred on the 'next generation' box ... and accepting the cheap boxes that only convert to 480i seems a waste.I guess come February, I'll be reading more books ...

$REVIEW.: Lately, I've been bringing my notebook computer to a local bookstore/cafe to do some writing. It's a cozy place but pretty noisy. The selection of music over the speakers wasn't the greatest either. I decided that I would make my own mix of MP3 music files and bring them along so I could listen to them through my headphones. Since I'm working on my notebook computer, I didn't want to run the files off of my hard drive, which would run down my battery. My solution was to load all the MP3 files on a Flash Drive - no moving parts, a much smaller drain on battery power. I purchased the SD 512 Flash drive. The following is my experience with this device:The unit itself is a pretty small device. (See product details above for size, etc) and has a total capacity of 512mb. The actual usable memory is closer to 487mb or so. This is due to the software/operating/security program that is preloaded onto the drive. I run Windows XP on my notebook, and the SanDisk booted up immediately without any problems. You can &#34;lock out&#34; anyone from viewing your files by running the security program. Be careful not to quick click through the prompts as you may miss entering the password. You can also download the latest encrption software for free. According to Sandisk, the new lock/encrption program is fourteen times more secure and is a much better program.Performance was smooth as silk. There were no drivers to install and the plug and play feature worked the very first time. I &#34;mix&#34; my MP3's on my desktop computer which runs Windows ME and transfer them on the Sandisk to my notebook which runs Windows XP. There were no problems in switching back and forth between systems. I've heard that you need to download drivers if you run Windows 98. I do not know how well this drive works under '98' but it seems to work great with ME or XP. I loaded and ran my MP3 files from the Sandisk and was able to play back my music files without a hitch. Since this is a flash drive, you can load practically any type of file you want on it, be it photo files, documents etc. I decided this particular drive would be used just for music files. There is a green light at the end of the drive which flashes rapidly whenever the drive is being used. Which brings me to the next point...If you have not used one of these devices before, it is extrememly important to *disconnect the device properly* before you physically remove it. You must first click on the &#34;remove device&#34; icon. The operating system will disconnect and will then tell you that removal is safe. If you just *unplug the device* without proper shut down procedures, sooner or later, you will most likely either fry your unit or corrupt the data. This is not a defect with the unit, you must remove all flash devices in this manner. Those of you who are familiar with the Sony Playstation know that if you pull out the memory card before it is finished saving, you will end up with corrupt data or a damaged card. The same holds true for flash disk devices.There have been reliability issues associated with this unit, but I am either a very lucky guy or the reports of failure are due to user error, i.e. unpluging the unit before shutting down properly. Perhaps their was a bad batch of them. I don't know. What I do know is that the unit has performed great, (so far), and I am very pleased with the performance and price. There are promotional discounts given my some vendors, so if you can snag one with a rebate, you'll be paying only a few dollars more for this 512mb over a 256mb.As far as the music that's loaded onto my Sandisk Cruzer, I've got a good selection of trance, new age, classical and eurodance.Just in case you wanted to know. &#60;grin&#62;
$SUMMARY.: So far, so good.

$REVIEW.: I found this on Amazon while we were in Hawaii and my friend was taking photos with his Olympus SW camera underwater.  I ordered it and it arrived when we got home.  I've been using my Vado and really enjoy it but so wanted to take snorkeling with me... This seems to be the solution and I will be taking it to Hawaii when we return next year.  I've also put my digital camera in it and tested it and it seems to work just fine so I can use it for both video and still photography.

$review_text.: I am mounting this in my RV... just haven't affixed the TV yet - or drove with it attached... but I am impressed by the quality of the product.  I am confident it'll serve my needs.  The only con is the documentation was a little weak, but I guess it's fairly self-explanitory once you pull the parts out and think about it.  The hardware seems high-grade/heavy-duty, that is mostly what I wanted to share.  That, and I think the value is excellent.  A good product, read the specs ... if it fits your needs, get it.

$review_text.: In case anyone is interested in this device, please be advised that it has serveral shortcomings that make it a white elephant.  First the CPU alarm is dead set to 120 deg F.  Since most CPUs are good up to 150 deg F, this is an annoyance.  BTW-you can't select C or F.  That swoopy fan speed indicator?  It's only a facade that displays the largest digit, the other 3 digits are fixed to 0. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but the limited documentation does not show how to select other alarm temperatures.In all this panel was designed for pimple faced teeny-booper that want bling in their case to show everyone how cool and sophisticated they are.

$review_text.: I've tried and owned lots of headphones, both inexpensive and costly, and I was amazed when I tried these out. The bass is rich and thick and heavy, and it hits all the high notes clearly, and they blend together without any muddle. The dual dynamic drivers (6.8 mm "woofers" & 9mm "tweeters") hit all the notes, and unlike many other in-ear phones I've tried, it doesn't feel like the sounds lay on top of one another, but they are articulated, expansive, and clear. This is true, whether I'm listening to hip-hop, alternative, electronic, jazz, or classical.If you go from a standard pair of headphones -- say the kind they give you when you buy a new phone -- and try these you'll be astonished by how much better your music can sound. If you go from these to, say, a much more expensive pair of in-ear phones billed as audiophile quality, you may not be able to tell the difference. For the price, these are hands down the best value best sounding headphones I've tried. (I was offered a chance to try these out by the manufacturer, for the purpose of testing and review.)In addition to sound quality the build feels solid, and looks good. The earpieces are made of a solid two tone plastic (deep dark red and black). The cable (1.2 m = roughly 4 feet) doesn't deliver any noise or interference that I can detect. The plug is a standard 3.5mm gold plated jack, and it comes with a 1/4" adapter as well as one of the two-pronged airplane adapters. You also get several extra silicone tips and a foam tip for extra insulation against external noise. As with most Brainwavz headphones, this also comes with a hard-shell case that you can use to keep the headphones from getting banged up, and also to store the additional plugs and spare earpieces.One thing I was happily surprised by is that the earphone shape -- which consists of a flattened egg shaped base, from which the earplugs extend -- does a much better job securing these in place in my ear than any in-ear phone I've tried. I think that the design is primarily there to house the dual drivers, responsible for the deeper range of sound. Still, it serves a secondary purpose of fitting my ears perfectly. I can run with these in and they don't even wobble.These are a great value pair of earphones that deliver audiophile quality sound for a fraction of the cost. They offer an astonishing and easily noticeable improvement on the kind of standard low range earphones that I used to buy before I'd realized how much better it can get.One last thing: they come in a very handsome package, and would make an ideal gift for anyone who likes to listen to music. That's nice for when I throw them into my bag, or even in my pocket so I can have them ready for when I want to plug them into my phone or laptop and enjoy the sounds.
$SUMMARY.: Heavy bass, wide ranging unmuffled sound, make these dual driver headphones a fantastic, low-cost choice for quality listening

$review_text.: I had no problem installing or using this drive. It is as quiet as the original drive if not quieter. While some users have complained about noise and vibration I have to wonder if that may have been due to not tightening the screws sufficiently when installing the drive. I did notice this but once the screws were tightened with a decent screwdriver everything was and still is fine after using the drive for about a month. I do notice that my start up time is reduced. Everything is running more smoothly as well but that could be due to the fact that I reinstalled windows and then copied files from my old drive rather than cloning my old drive so I basically started off with a clean install of the operating system.This install was in an HP dv6500 Notebook 64 bit system running Windows Vista which was originally purchased in Dec. 2007.Update on March 2, 2012Still no problem with this drive since it was installed.UPDATE FEBRUARY 10, 2013This product failed in November of 2012 and I had to get it replaced. No problem with the manufacturer replacing it but still I downgraded my review from 5 stars to 3.

On our QT528 system this camera does not show any significant improvement  over theVideoSecu Outdoor Day Night Security Camera Infrared Weatherproof CCTV Home 1/3" CCD 420 TV Lines 28 IR LEDs Wide View Angle Lens with Free Power Supply A71that I purchased for half the price


Night vision is poorer and even with the higher resolution it does not seem to focus any better on objects more than 10 feet away


I think I will go back to using the cheaper VideoSec model

$review_text.: I have had good luck in the past with ZyXEL products so when I saw this on Woot, I figured it was worth a shot and was hoping to use it as a travel router.This does a lot of neat things well, for instance the failover/failback from wired to 3g is smooth and it seems to maintain a good connection on both. There are a lot of options like monitoring 3g minutes etc.The problem is, every time I turn it off, it goes back to the default config (ZyXEL SSID, default password, open wifi), this would be a huge security risk if I had it connected to my lan on the copper. This is the biggest reason for 1 star, no device should ever default to wide open network access.To fix this, I log in, restore the backup, it reboots and it works great again. I tried the latest firmware as of this writing, V1.00(MWB.1.53) 5/19/2011, but that does not help.For support there is this [...] but it is more pre-sales than support. The website also claims knowledge base support but it is all "coming soon", next I'll try email support, we'll see how that goes but I am not holding my breath.Update:I was contacted by ZyXEL about this and they recommended I return it to the seller. I then contacted Woot, CC'ing the ZyXEL rep and after a few more emails, I received a replacement and shipping label in an Amazon box. I applied my backup to the new unit and it worked just fine even though I have not updated the firmware yet.This unit was great on a recent trip to PA where my Sprint coverage was "roaming" everywhere I went and the hotel wireless was a mess. I popped in my Verizon 3g card and had a solid signal whenever I needed one.I left this at 4 stars because I still think the default config should not allow a wide open network.

$REVIEW.: I purchased these because I have a hard time finding the "Marshmallow" headphones that I like at local stores.  These weren't quite the same as I'm used to buying (the back end is quite noticeably rounded) but they fit just as well as I wanted them to, which is what I wanted.The cord doesn't come with that little piece in the center that you can pull up and down to hold the L and R sides together - I use them at night in bed (so that I'm only using either the L or R side), so this particular pair doesn't work for that.However the sound quality seems to be similar to those that I used to be able to purchase in the store for around $10.  (I've bought the $20 sets and could see no improvement in quality.)EDIT MAY 2013They've had a year of daily use now and are still working great.

$REVIEW.: This is a nice looking camera but has lots of issues.  Streaming live is free as long as you are on their app or site.  Connection to the app is slow to connect and streaming has at least a 5-10 second delay.  Night video is bad, not what was claimed.  All these 5 star reviews have me noticed that they are fake as I found out the way to check is to look at the person's profile who is posting and you will see only one post for that product.  IF you want to hear from a real person who buys and review a lot of products, you will see numerous reviews.  I'm very disappointed in this camera, but at least I can say I gave it a fair shot.  I will be sticking to my Foscam F18910W, cheap and does the job well.

$REVIEW.: For me, I am very picky about USB 4 or more port accessories and being the techie I am, I love to test products and see if I can get them to work and work even beyond the scope of the device! And I have tried several 4 port ones in the past and they were good,and worked OK in my laptop or desktop USB port to extend the USB devices I could use. But most of them a little slow to read the USB Flash drive or other things plugged into it.Below I will share with you WHY this is the one I suggest to you to over the other brands...+ In my laptop and desktop - i just plugged it in and it played as the computer picked up the driver and I was good to go. So I plugged in 4 devices: External Hard Drive, 2 Flash drives (both 32 gb), I SD card reader with an adapter in it with a micro SD plugged into the adapter.Results: This port read everything well and very fast.+ In my Samsung Tab 3 8.0 Tablet (with OTG capabilties) - This is how I got this 4 port to work in my tablet:1) I plugged in 3 USB Flash Drives and then one Card reader with an adapter in it and a micro SD in the adapter. I plugged this FIRST into the 4 port adapter before I went to the next step...2) I plugged in this 4 port into my OTG (On the go) USB Micro Adapter.3) Then I plugged it into my tablet.4) The tablet saw that I plugged in USB and brought me to MyFiles where all of my USB devices showed up as: 1) USB A, USB B, USB C and lastly USB D.Note that on MOST tablets with OTG they will NOT read a portable hard drive due to power limitations on the tablet. My gut tells me in future tablets, this will be fixed and one will be able to plug in a Hard Drive (portable) with the USB OTG or regular USB port because of the popularity of tablets these days and as for me, I use mine like a mini laptop!Hope that this review has helped you and thank you for reading it.

I got tired of seeing it on my tablet and I did some research to see if i connect my Nexus (2013) table to my Samsung HD TV. Did some search and this cable is the first item that comes up when I searched Amazon. I read about 30 reviews to see if this little device will work, 90% of the reviews I read people loved it all the way and it worked with no issues. The other 10% mention something about DOA. I got this cable in a timely matter and it worked right out of the box with no issues. I was impressed with everything from the design, feel and packaging of the item I love that I am able to see my NetFlix, Hulu, YouTube and now HBO Go on my HDTV. This cable is worth it, I would also recommed buying BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D cable as well with this item.

$REVIEW.: I like these walkies, they are small and comfortable, easy to find if lost and have a lot of handy features.In my experience using these on a road trip driving from the west coast of Florida to San Antonio, Texas; the sound quality would grow fuzzy within a few miles of separation.So I don't really believe the descriptions claim of 23 miles, but it was more than sufficient for my needs.The battery life is VERY GOOD, we used the provided rechargeable batteries; charged them for the first time as per instructions and never came close to running them low after 12+ hour days of driving
The included battery charge station is very nice, but these walkies can also work on three standard alkaline AA batteries which is not very clear from the description.All in all I am happy with these, and would recommend them for road trips where people are taking separate vehicles, or hiking/camping trips where you'll likely not be separated by more then a mile or so from your party members.

(I bought 2 pair) so I could keep one  pair at work to help cut down on the amount of wear on the cords getting tangled & wear and tear,  I am very pleased with them for the money, However  if you are wanting top grade stuff you will need to dig deeper into your wallet to get the next level of earbuds, but at this price grab then and go, I found the sound to have good balance of bass mid-vocal and high end frequency, I am using these with my Creative ZEN, and the combination is working very well for me, you get a better appreciation for Music when the reference is better - I prefer 320kbps & nothing less than 192kbps also the volume you get with these as compared to the ones shipped with your player these will be a big improvement, for some the brand name of Sennheiser my not ring a bell but it's a well trusted name in the headphone industry from way back, and yes I have always liked Sennheiser, And I have owned a pair of there open air headphones in the past, so to try the Sennheiser CX300's at a good price was not a big stretch for me , I believe the CX300's are the first in-ear design from Sennheiser and they may not be their best model!  But if you are looking to get a budget ear buds with solid sound quality, significant isolation from outside noise, then these are for you.Last note: you might want to try the new Zen X-Fi has better sound, features, headphones, and storage options than the Apple iPod Touch--and for a lower price, too.

$review_text.: Order arrived on 2nd day (Prime) as expected. Upon opening the carton I found all of the advertised parts & pieces in good physical condition. There was a problem however. Out of the box the blue power lamp was already on, even without ever being turned on! It tuned out that in spite of the cute blue power light, the camera/dvr was actually dead. The light remained on continuously, even while I boxed it up and returned it.Too bad mine was defective. Regardless of the defect the camera is small, light weight and all parts are quite nicely finished. I'll just re-order another one.

It is small enough to keep in your wallet permanently, and is cheap enough to have as many as you may need. The design is absolutely beautiful. And have I mentioned that it is waterproof? Very streamlined with a nice shine to it, and I believe that new models even include a leather lanyard. As far as speeds, read speeds are virtually as good as it gets for a usb 2.0, and the write speeds are above most. Sadly, even today I find 5MB/s write speeds to be average, but this is almost double. For better speeds USB 3.0 drives are a much better option, albeit at a high price.In conclusion, it's a great drive and I have a few. I just like keeping one or two in my wallet permanently.

$review_text.: This thing is awesome. It is very flexible and looks fantastic. There is a notice on the packaging that says if the mount leaves a residue, just wipe it clean with a cloth. I was worried about this "residue", based on the other reviews. But after using it in two cars, I have not seen any residue. It is a very sticky material, and provides a high friction surface, but I saw no residue left behind.This is simply the best Garmin mount available. Better than the bulky bean-bag, and better than suction cups that leave marks and is a hassle to adjust.EDIT: After using this for over a year, I have occasionally noticed a slight residue from time to time. This only occurs on my Mazda 3, which has a very smooth dashboard, where the residue really stands out. It is actually kind of a pain to get rid of, so I now use the beanbag mount in my car, and I use this mount in my wife's car which doesn't have such a smooth dashboard. The residue is a pain, so I'm knocking this down to 3 stars.

$review_text.: I bought & tested this antenna next to the TV.  It worked great so I placed it in a plastic pail with a lid, weighed it down a bit inside & put it up out of the way on the roof, pointed toward the mountain where the broadcast antennas are here.  The programming I receive is almost as good as what I was getting from the cable company and the picture & sound is perfect on each of the many channels.  :-))This little blue guy is sold on Amazon by various vendors with a variety of names & decorative streaks on it.  I have bought several more now for friends & found that it pays to compare each time for the lowest delivered price on that day, so I suggest the same.If you're within range of your local broadcast towers you'll love this antenna no matter what "brand" it says it is!

$review_text.: Since the are already so many reviews on here for this item I thought I would add a specific angle. One that focuses on the use of the tablet as a graphics design tool mostly.I will also spend a moment discussing my other uses for the tablets I own and tell you what my experience is.Background you can skipI am not necessarily an Apple fan. As a matter of fact, I was always the type of guy building PC's, creating FreeNAS servers, experimenting with software etc. more Microsoft than Apple.The adoption of Apple into my household came when I started to buy computers for my Dad, nephews and nieces and MIL. Due to distance it became aggravating to get the calls where they were stuck with a blue screen or something else after downloading some virus or upgrading some driver. It was always something. So I decided that I would buy a tablet to see if my dad would be able to use that. That was e first Apple device into my home.I liked the usability, simplicity of the interface and the Apple-typical lack of buttons. All in all, I was pleased with how fast my 80+ year old dad was able to use it. No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them. I was a believer.I stuck with the iPads and am currently on the 4th gen. Since iPads are invading my workspace I find myself using it mostly and running into some of the limitations.How I use the tabletsI mostly use my tablet work wise for the development of graphics for presentations that outline complex solutions. We do not use standard PowerPoint stuff but have a philosophy of custom and hand drawn pictures that can, if necessary, be Peter live on a whiteboard.Since the ipad does not have any native pressure sensitivity I had to wait until someone came out with a pressure sensitive stylus. At this point there are a few on the market and after looking at reviews I settled for the Jot Not Touch. I mainly use it with Sketchbook Pro, Touchdraw and so on.Here are the limitations I have found:- the disk tip that is needed for precision on the ipad is still somewhat inaccurate and hard to handle. I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.- the pressure sensitivity seems to go off and on. Sometimes I find myself pressuring harder and harder to get the same results. This makes for lots of time spent handling the stylus and ipad combo rather than thinking about the quality of my graphics design- the styluses for the ipad that have reassure sensitivity either have weird tips or are bulky to handle. I am 5'11&#34;.I also use the ipad to communicate via iMessage with all my family all over the world. iMessage is so simple and effective and I get it everywhere.without ads and other nonsense.Finally,and this is quite important once your have the Apple drug in your house: I have connected my home with a series of Airports and time machines. The airports connect to various stereo systems and apple TV's and I can simply control. Everything from my ipad, or my wife from hers.it is supremely easy and connected at a fraction of the cost I would have had if I bought the Sony or Bose solutions for this.Now about the GN10.1I bought it because I was working on another graphics project and got fed up with the clumsy stylus and ipad combo. I even paid overnight rush shipping to get it. And you know what, the Samsung embedded pressure sensitive stylus is so much better than the solution needed with the ipad. The tip is precise, the stylus is the right size, perhaps a little too light and thin but better than what I had for the ipad.I have spent less time messing with the hardware and more time on my work, so great kudosto Samsung.Also, the GN is fast, there is nothing to complain about with the 1.4 quad core compared to the ipad.The screen, however, on the ipad, is visibly better when. Drawing thin lines. It doesn't brother me too much since I can simply zoom in and the pixelation disappears but I can't wait for the next GN gen to see if samsung is going to up the ante and increase screen resultion.I also noted that the battery of the GN seems to notably outlast the ipad battery. My guess is that it outlasts my ipad battery by an extra 30% or so. Maybe because the Bluetooth stylus on the ipad hogs battery? I dunno, but again, Samsung gets it right-er, erer...So conclusion: as a graphics tablet solution the Samsung is hands down the winner. Ipad should not even be considered as a mature solution. The retina display is the only redeeming quality.When it comes to messaging etc... It's criminal what junk sits in the Google Play store. Everything seems invested with adware and when you buy versions with no ads you are looking at tons of different solutions... Which nes will your friends be willing to use? Now your friends have to start adding software to message you if you do not make the right pick. Especially when you have your friends and family spread over the globe.That is what I feel is really needed: a native android version of iMessage that works between any and all androids. Bridging into iMessage is not androids responsibility but for crying out loud, I don't want to download and pay for tons of crappy messaging software that does not let me reach my friends and family.  Apple wins.I am using Skype on both,  but find myself more on the ipad with iMessage to stay in touch.Finally, the integration into my household with the airports and stereo links. Luckily my synology audio android software can speak.  Airport, so there is a solution albeit a little bit jerryrigged. This android audio app streams and controls music on any synology diskstation and can feed it into your apple network if need be.  Apple, since they have a vertical solution that you can expand with, is very well integrated. Apple wins.I love both tablets, am deeply impressed with the Samsung solution since its not a simple copy and steal solution and love the ipad for its simplicity. However, for what I use them for work wise I would part with my ipad and stick with the Samsung given the graphics execution. Apple needs to step up in that area or they will lose out in schools, hospitals etc as the stylus model for note taking comes way more natural than thumbing your comments and notes.Sorry, for the avalanche of words. Hope there is some wisdom in here someone can still use.Ps: the apple soft keyboard is nicer than that on the Samsung BUT the wider screen on the Samsung makes it more convenient and natural. hope Swype makes me a convert.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this player based on the reviews here and on CNET.  I have to say this is the best DVD player I have owned yet.  Now I must clarify that the last player we owned we purchased 5 years ago; so it has been a while and some of the features I found unique may actually be quite common.I love the up-converting technology. Our family watches very little network TV.  For the most part we watch DVDs.  Since we have little kids we are usually watching Disney DVDs or older sitcoms.  Our kids love Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island.  Let me tell you neither show has ever looked this good.  It is not HD, but it is much better than the quality we were getting from our old player.  It becomes obvious when we watch an episode of the Brady Bunch that has been partially remastered.  The scenes that were remastered become brighter than those not remastered.I like the sleek black appearance of the box and I like that I can control whether the lights on the display stay on (they are very bright in a dark room).One feature I like is that the player will remember where you left off watching several movies.  Almost all DVD players will remember the where you left off with the last DVD you were watching; this one seems to remember 3 or 4 DVD's.I can't say enough about this player.  Like they say in the review at CNET, if you don't want to plunk down several hundred dollars for a Blu-Ray then get this machine.  I bought mine directly from OPPO.  They were courteous and ship FedEx by default.  I had my player in 2 days.  Also, the OPPO if fully compatible with all the Logitech remotes.

It always needs to pause.  This is not the case with my external USB 3 hard drive.  Wasn't expecting it to be as fast as the hard drive, but was hoping it would perform better than it has.  It also gets pretty hot and so I would recommend letting it cool off every couple of hours.Nonetheless, it does work pretty much as advertised and it's extremely convenient to have 256GB in such a small package.Updated:Reduced by another star.

$review_text.: I've bought a few of these cables and they all work fine after months of use
 I should note that the quality, although fine, is not the same as the Apple cables, yet the price and added length make this an unbeatable deal
 You should remember that part of the reason Apple cables are so expensive is that they are made with top notch materials, like the nice slim and very flexible cable sheath
 The tiny plug head and the overall look and feel are NOT features on this cable, but like I said, it works fine and has even outlasted the original cable that came with my iPhone (the originals have an issue sometimes where the plug head separates from the rest of the cable partially and has trouble transferring power and data


 To be fair, Apple gave me a new one with no questions asked)


 An important tip for most of us who use cases:  make sure your case is not made to only accommodate the tiny plug head on the original cable only
 The amazon plug head is slightly wider.

$REVIEW.: I've had my Canon SX40 camera for almost a year
The original battery proved so insufficient that within a week of getting the camera, I ordered two Extended Replacement (1200Mah) NB-10L Batteries
The Canon battery was good at high definition settings for about 400 photos

However, if you used the flash or took video, you could expect about half that.The NB-10L Battery did considerably better at about 650 photos though I've noticed a drop-off lately to about 500


I don't know whether the NB-10Ls have a memory, but I suspect that they do.My wife just got an SX40, and I saw that the Photive Original NB-10L Ultra High Capacity was about $10 (half the first replacements and 20% of what Canon still wants for a 750maH battery

I also saw that they are memory free which means that I can either let them run down or recharge after every day of shooting


That's the biggest plus.I bought two
So far, we've both gotten 650-700 photos per battery charge


Now, if I can only remember to bring the spares with us when we're off
I would love to find a battery holder that would fit on the camera strap.Btw, while the original Canon battery had a plastic cap that fit over the end with the connectors, none of the replacements do


I haven't noticed a problem, but I do take a lens cleaning cloth to them before every charge.


$SUMMARY.: Outlasts the original Canon battery by 55% and even the Extended Replacement (1200Mah) NB-10L Battery by 10%

amazon has great customer service


i instantly got an email for replacement.Keep it up amazon

and hopefully nikon would fix this issues i've been loyal with nikon ever since.*updatei recieved my new d600 thanks for the speedy amazon replacement..unfortunately same old story
the sensor has oil.and to top it off it has a slight flaking on the bottom..this is a new camera i just took 10 shots with it to test the problem..i'm returning it for refund and wait for a couple months more until this is resolved

$REVIEW.: Doing this review was a little difficult because the basic functionality of most external hard drives is the same, which is storing and backing up data from one or multiple computers
 External hard drives have become a commodity, so you need to think about what makes this drive different and what factors make an external hard drive better or worse

 The answer will typically depend on these factors:1) how much data do you need to store on the external drive?2) how often and in what quantities do you add or remove data?3) do you need to access the data over a home or work network or will you connect the external hard drive to your home or laptop computer?I own three external hard drives


 Two are USB (including this model) and one is eSATA


 If you are frequently transferring large quantities of data then you should buy an eSATA external hard drive because the data transfer speed is at least 5x faster than USB
 For example, I can copy/paste 40,000 photos and 2,000 MP3s at a blistering rate with eSATA
 I can still perform the same procedure with USB but it will take longer

 If you are not in a big rush, then don't bother with eSATA..


the USB will work fine.PROS- very easy to use- quiet- smallCONS- none notedCOMPARING (to other related devices)- Not as fast as eSATA, but this point is irrelevant if you don't need to have the faster transfer speeds.- Not a NAS (Network Attached Storage) which simply means an external hard drive with expanded functionality
 This feature is really cool if you want todump all of your media (songs, pictures) and hook the external hard drive up to a wireless router
 NAS allows for file sharing and storage over a network.Bottom line: this hard drive does a terrific job for what it is designed to do: storage and backup.NOTE: an eSATA hard drive requires an eSATA connection on your computer


 I had to buy an eSATA card for my home computer ($20 at local electronics store) so I could use my eSATA drive.

$REVIEW.: When I first purchased my iPad Mini, I spent days surfing case options and debating what I wanted.  For my phone, I'm a longtime devotee of Otterbox Defenders...which have saved my having to replace many a dropped phone...but I wasn't sure that I wanted something that bulky for the Mini.  I ended up with a Speck Candyshell grip, which is a very nice case when holding / using the Mini, but which left me needing additional protection for it before I could toss it in my bag, since the screen was unprotected.  The Airbender Mini was an attractive alternative, offering protection similar to that of the Defender with the added benefit of a bluetooth keyboard.  Having tried it out, I have to say, I'm very impressed.Things I like:- Case design - 2-layer protection, similar to the Otterbox; very nice coverage of all buttons/access points to the device, keeping everything fully accessible but keeping them well protected; nice materials, solid feel (without adding too much weight).  It's not the easiest thing to get on, but I can't quibble with the end result, and in the grand scheme of things, it's far from the most challenging case I've tried to get an electronic device into.  It's also a very nice looking case, both when separated from the keyboard and when combined as a clamshell.- The case mount arm - easy snap on/snap off ability to attach/release the case to the arm.  Arm secures into the keyboard to create a clamshell arrangement, but also slides out so that you have a free-standing stand to hold the Mini separate from the keyboard- Keyboard bluetooth pairing was quick and easy- Keyboard quick button controls to iPad functionality are very convenient- Good keyboard battery life, good charge time of keyboard battery- Keys are very responsive, and I like the chicklet design/feel- Powers the screen on when I open the clamshellThings I would like to see improved:- While I like the free-standing stand, it feels less than stable, and depending on the angle that you set the device at, can topple over.  It takes a little getting used to- While I like that the stand slides out, I'd like a &#34;stop&#34; that keeps me from sliding it fully out when I don't intend to.  It's a minor annoyance, but still an annoyance when your one-piece case is suddenly two pieces when it's not what you intendedThe keys are (naturally, given the size of the Mini) smaller than standard, as is the spacing, so this is not a keyboard that I think I could ever touch type on.  That's not specific to this keyboard - I have never been able to &#34;adjust&#34; mentally to a smaller than standard keyboard, which is my personal failing, since I know others are able to.  Since it's not specific to this keyboard, I don't consider it a pro or con of the keyboard itself, but still worth mentioning - if you're someone who struggles with small keyboards...this is a small keyboard (it's a Mini, for heaven's sake!!).  This is not a keyboard that I would attempt to type war and peace on...but no keyboard that is sized comparable to the Mini would be.  Given the size constraints, this keyboard significantly increases my ability to do quick, short entries into my Mini, while offering an easy way to disengage from the keyboard and simply have a nice, protective case in settings in which I don't anticipate any need for typing.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent flexibility and functionality - love the case/keyboard combination

$REVIEW.: Got the Shark MSDHRS6160A with IR remote, SD card slot and USB port

 Cable hook up with IPOD works however you must tune volume up and down on the IPOD as volume controls on the unit will not work with IPOD wired in


 This proves to be hazardous if not impossible when riding your motorcycle


 Also the IR remote does little except change modes

 The SD slot and USB port do not work


 I inserted an SD card with music on it and nothing happens
 I inserted a flash drive with music and nothing happens

 Neither the manual bottons on the unit nor the remote had any effect
 I hope others have had better luck

$REVIEW.: For all those people who are concerned about space restrictions and want a powerhouse computer that will not need a large footprint, the Mac Mini is the perfect solution. Packing a boatload of power into a computer yay bigger than a coaster, there is no better power/space combination in the entire computing world!For all the Windows users who don't want to make the switch to the Mac, with the newest Mac OS you will not look back once you get used to the ways that Apple does things the way they are SUPPOSED to be done.As per usual Apple, the design of the Mac Mini is perfect, and it's so quiet that your own heartbeat will no doubt be louder than this quiet monster.If you need a solid family computer that will allow you to surf the net, work with spreadsheets, check e-mail, or just do 99% of the things that you would like to be doing (I don't say 100% because it's not a gaming machine), pick up a Mac Mini for your home office, kitchen, ANYWHERE and you will NOT be disappointed!!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

$review_text.: I am still using this mouse, got it like 1 year ago. I think it's okay, here is why:Pros:1. It's small and fits easily into my computer bag's side pocket.2. The wireless usb wireless adapter is really small and really does justice to the motto of &#34;fix once and forget about it&#34;3. The design of the where the usb adapter and battery is kept is smart and the spring action is lasting, still working 1 year later.4. For such a tiny mouse, it's weighty and it feels good to grab it in my hand.5. I like the feel of the wheel and the button clicks.Cons:1. It's really a bit too small for my hands and on prolong usage my hands tend to ache.2. Battery compartment is just right and a tight fit for a normal AA cell. It will go in, but then you have to try a bit.At the end of the day, what made me take the most points from this device is the fact that my hand aches after prolong usage.3 out of 5

$review_text.: Had this a few weeks now and it is still working fine. It replaced a pansonic which only lasted for about a dozen recordings, unfortunately it died after the warrenty. Seldom used the panasonic and never put "library" dish in it. The Toshiba makes it so much easier to label segments that I am glad that I had to replace the panasonic. I only miss being able to change the clip index image (and the wasted money for the panasonic).I thought that I would replace the panasonic with JVC or Sony but was surprised with all their negative reviews and the positive reviews for this Toshiba. It is important to read the manual carefully because it is poorly written and those tiny DVD icons are worthless and need to be annotated with a magic marker.Also wonder why equipment designers use no common sense and insist on making equipment with tiny buttons and then making them black on a black panel but then having chrome trim where it is least needed.

$review_text.: In over 20 years of computing, I've had only one WD drive fail on me. That drive was admittedly abused and it's a miracle it lasted as long as it did.This one is relatively quick for a green drive, but don't expect mind blowing performance. I've been running it for about a year or so and it's my main &#34;bulk storage&#34; drive. However, if you're going to use this for an OS drive or something, I'd recommend investing in an SSD at this point.SSDs are reliable and just insanely fast, making any hardware feel much more responsive. The only reason at this point to get a traditional 3.5&#34; drive is for massive storage demands (such as a video/raw photo gallery storage center).That being said, I will be replacing this drive with a few RED WD drives in a RAID array soon which is becoming my preferred way to store important data that can't realistically be backed up in the cloud.

The earphone jack is loose when fitted into the player AND does not go all the way into the mp3 player (same for the USB cable). As a result, the music stops everytime the jack is touched. The case is cheap and flimsy and makes a "clicking" noise when using the directional keys. I feel duped. I am never buying this type of product from COBY in the future. Also, looking at the reviews, I am  not going to bother trying customer service either. A lesson learnt.

$review_text.: I wanted the best for my Acer Iconia A100, and I certainly got it with these GreatShield screen protectors.  They are, as they claim, a perfect fit for the Acer - all the holes and notches in all the right spots.It was relatively easy to apply - pull down the first layer to reveal the side that goes against your screen, slowly press it down, rub out the air bubbles, take off the back layer and finalize by squeegeeing out any remaining bubbles.  I always apply my screen protectors in a steamy bathroom because the lint is weighted to the floor by the steam, therefore, not as much lint tends to land between the screen and screen protector.I did have to re-position the screen protector once I had it on, but it went on just as smoothly the second time.  These screen protectors really are crystal clear; with my case on my Acer, it is difficult to tell that a screen protector is actually installed.The reason I only gave this product 4 stars is because, first, it tends to show fingerprints more than I had anticipated. Second, it is like static electricity - every little particle attaches to the screen protector, so I'm constantly wiping it off with a lint-free cloth.  I have a dog, and her hair is always drawn to this screen protector.  But for all the other pluses, these are small trade-offs.

The button is small but on my device it was slightly raised and easily accessible.Blackberry account set up was a tad confusing. I had to Google why I was getting a server error until I learned that your password cannot exactly match the answer to your password question hint!!WTF? I just added two * after my password and that did the trick.Anyway, now an update is downloading which is taking longer than I anticipated.About the device. It is a tiny bit bigger than the Amazon Kindle Fire and not as thick. It feels solidly built and screen resolution is incredible.

$REVIEW.: When given the chance to use the new version of PaintShop Pro, PaintShop X6, I jumped on it right away

 The last time I used this venerable program was well over ten years ago and I never could quite get the hang of it because of its workspace and its controls
 I am happy to say that time and evolution have caught up to this program, and it much easier to use than before.While not a true Photoshop equal, this version of PaintShop Pro does let you edit photos with ease

 For comparison sake, if we look at PhotoImpact v.13, which I would say a competitor of PaintShop Pro X6, PaintShop loads quicker than PhotoImpact, and the workspace is more practical and intuitive in its design.I like the 3 work areas: Manage, Adjust and EditManage Area makes it easy to go through folders of pictures and tag people and places and rate photos
 You can also set up specific folders under `Collections' so they are always available.Adjust Area has many tools to make some quick fixes to photos such as a `Smart photo Fix' for one click fixes, or you can adjust each item yourself, contrast, brightness, white level and digital noise


 The Digital Noise adjustment works well on older scanned photos I've found.Edit Area has all the standard editing tools and, as with the other areas, the response time of the program is extremely fast when applying one or many edits.A nice item is the Learning Center which appears on all three screens
 It gives a brief description of the tool you have selected and what it does

 If you need more info on an item, there is a link to take you to the Help content


 It doesn't take up too much room when working with photos, and is easily removed if not needed.With a learning curve that isn't very steep at all, I have to say that PaintShop Pro X6 is a product I would recommend to friends for use in their homes.

$review_text.: I bought two of these thinking about using them to carry around a couple 32GB MicroSDs I had.First thing I do is put the memory in the device, plug it to my laptop, and I see all the contents. Which I decide I'm going to remove (luckily I have it backed up). It starts deleting, suddenly the time increases until it sounds like the device is disconnected.I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in. Again, I see the contents of the root directory, but I cannot open any directory or file.So I think it's just a problem with this adapter and move the microSD into the SD adapter I always use.. the same thing. I cannot read this memory anymore. Other devices (cameras, etc) I've tried take a long time, finally give up and tell me the memory is unusable. I try to format it from the devices, and same errors. No device I have can read that 32GB micro sd card anymore.So, I guess the moral of my review is, some people may have found it worked for them. To me is worse than junk.

$review_text.: In short, this cannon works as advertised. The little foam missiles launch about 10-15 feet and the canon rotation/elevation/firing is all controlled from a simple program you load on your computer.I would suggest you YouTube this cannon. that is, before a foam dart is fired, you can hear the canon whirring/grinding for about 3-5 seconds. It's not a big deal, but if you are hoping to use this for some sort of sneak attack you may want to consider a different option.Also, if the cannon style is not your cup of tea, you can unscrew two screws (and pop off a plastic ring) to remove the cannon facade. Once the cannon "cover" is removed, it looks like a red version of those green-ish USB missile launchers you've seen before.Finally, I took my apart to "supercharge" it. The cannon uses springs to "poof" air to shoot the darts. The springs can be stretched some to increase the dart launch distance by 5-10 feet, although that's not too dramatic of an increase.Anyways, that's my $0.02. It works as advertised, it's fun, but eventually the novelty wears off some.

It wasn't damaged at all, either functionally or it's good-looking blue case.I've had zero problems over the last year with this drive on a Win7 x64bit laptop and pc. It's always recognized. That's more than I can say for other usb devices, including the WD Passport I have and a good many thumb drives.And it's fast. I work in computer graphics on video editing and 3d animation directly off this drive. The drive feels fast and I don't notice a lag even working with these type of large files.My only con is I wish they made a 2 TB version.

The sales person at my local camera shop asked what camera(s) I would be using and recommended this Manfrotto 234RC monopod head.  I have a Nikon D7000 and D40 DSLR and typically use a fixed lens or my 18-200mm lens.This monopod head works great.  Loosen the front knob and I'm able to quickly tilt my camera sideways.The quick/rapid release system is wonderful to use.  This is my first experience with using a quick release system let alone a monopod.  I have an all-in-one SLIK tripod where I have to screw the camera on and off the tripod.  I think you get the picture.I noticed that the quick/rapid release plate is the same plate this is used on my recently purchased Manfrotto 498RC2 ball head.  Nice!  Now I can mount the plates to each of my DSLRs and switch between my monopod and my recently purchased Manfrotto tripod.This is a simple and easy to use monopod head.

If you are getting this for an ebook reader and you want to read outside, it might not be the best choice. The tablet hardware is great. It is a very solid built unit. A little heavier than the newer ones as other reviewers stated, but not too heavy by any means. The main problem with the tablet is that Android 4.0 (ics) isn't really ready for prime time. There are a lot of glitches and some apps don't like the OS. If you receive the tablet with a previous version, I recommend not updating for now. I like to be on the bleeding edge so I did, and it has caused some instability. It's still a great device for web browsing, email, games, etc.

$review_text.: In world where tracking the awesomeness of your run seem to be more and more imperative - actually, I don't even know what that means.The Nike + technology includes this little device that fits in a little hollowed out area beneath the insert of your favorite Nike shoe.  The device is essentially a pedometer that is pretty darn accurate.  It transmits information to either a Nike armband/wrist band or an iPod nano and helps runners or walkers track their distance, time, and speed.First, you won't feel the device in your shoe.  I read a review on another website in which a nice lady was complaining bitterly about how she could feel it in her shoe.  Chances are, she failed to remove the little foam patch that currently occupies the little area where the Nike + sensor is supposed to go.  Once removed, the sensor will fit in that hole and is flush with the bottom of the inside of the shoe.  Once you put the insert back in over the sensor, you'll never know it's there.  I also read someone else indicate that they could feel a weight difference once it was in the shoe.  This is, in a word, absurd.  If your body is so finely tuned that you can detect a weight difference between the shoe with the device and the shoe without it, you are truly an amazing human being, and I suspect you have x-ray vision and can run faster than a speeding bullet.The reason the product gets 4 stars and not 5 is this:  The website is less than impressive.  The sensor transmits information to your wristband or iPod and can then be used to track your performance on Nike's website.  It's nice that you can do this.  The device comes, right out of the box, essentially "accurate" for the average runner, but it can be fine tuned for those that want even more accurate results.  Where the website fails though, is its inability to provide some fairly basic information about a run.  It can tell you your pace at a number of graphed points on your run, but it doesn't tell you - and this is really sort of nuts - how fast you ran each mile.  Rather, when you click on the point on the graph at each mile marker, it tells you your pace at that moment in your run.There are alternative websites that apparently can provide the "rest of the story" and give you the information you are seeking, and a simple internet search will provide you with their names.... but it is rather odd that Nike hasn't fixed this aspect of the site.The Nike+ community is, overall, very supportive and pleasant.  The site is useful to track your runs, set goals, participate in challenges, etc.I've compared the accuracy to a gps running watch and I believe that the accuracy is essentially the same.  I found that I could access some of the information on the gps watch a little easuer than Nike + but, I found the gps watch to be a bit bulky.  I do like how with Nike Plus, you have the option of wearing a wrist band or an iPod Nano, in your pocket or strapped to your arm.  This allows users to select an option that is best for their comfort.  There are adaptors available that will allow you to use Nike + with other shoe brands.  I have NOT tested those.Another helpful tip.... Nike has finally gotten with the program and made running shoes in a variety of widths.  Accordingly, if you, like me, could "never own a pair of Nike running shoes" because they were "too narrow and I have Fred Flinstone feet" take another look.  Now that shoes come in different widths, you will be pleasantly surprised.  This means the Nike + technology can appeal to a wider clientele - like those of us that are not built like sleek, running machines.One final note.... I took the Nike + on a hike and found that in steep sections, the device could not be accurrate.  This is because you must move at a certain pace with a reasonable stride for the device to work.  When hiking a mountain, you often take short steps and move slower than the device can record (or, coming down, longer strides, etc) so don't expect the device to accurately capture that kind of a hike.  As for gps technology on mountain hikes, it's a mixed bag by the time you factor in tree cover, pace, stride, etc.  Just FYI.I recommend Nike +  I use it, and I like it, and I've been using it for about 5 months now.  As a beginning runner, it's accurate enough for me, it's motivating, in a sense, and well worth the investment.  With website improvements, this is a 5 star device.If you have questions, post them in the comment section and I'll answer....  Thanks.

$REVIEW.: I never got to try them so I'll stay neutral. They shipped them in a bag in side of a large box with another large and heavy box without much protection. More than half the cases were damaged so I returned them for a full refund and I am afraid to order more if they  are going to be shipped that way again.

$review_text.: The drive arrived on time as promised.  It was easy to set up and operated as specified.  I did not install the retrospect express software.  Purchased full Retrospect 7 instead.  It took a little work to get one button working, otherwise all went well.  The drive is now functioning as planed and expected.  Very pleased with this item.

$review_text.: I purchased this speaker recently to use it at a number of small gatherings / parties as the end of my senior year of high school approaches. I chose it over other similarly-priced competitors based off of its looks, overall reputation for sounding great, and name-brand backing.Long story short, it deserves the hype that it gets from pretty much every major electronics reviewer out there. It's built amazingly well, sounds unbelievable for such a tiny little speaker, and is loud enough for outdoor gatherings. Here's a brief list of pros and cons that I've encountered over my 2 or 3 weeks of usage:PROS:- Great sound quality (great bass, VERY crisp mid and upper levels, never distorts at higher volumes)- Loud (loud enough to easily fill a bedroom/dorm room with uncomfortably loud sound, also loud enough to suffice as a sound source for outdoor pool parties / gatherings)- Great battery life (I used it once for a 5-hour outdoor party and there was no perceptible drop in volume or sound quality)- Long range (works great outdoors - 30+ foot Bluetooth range, and the sound quality doesn't drop within its range)- Can pair with lots of devices (I use an iPad, HTC One, MacBook Pro, and Xbox with bluetooth transceiver)- Nice charging station is included and can be used as a dock even while the speaker is playingCONS:- Pricey- HEAVY. You do not expect this speaker to weigh as much as it does. Not a problem for me, because I don't mind lugging around a heavy backpack, but it still has quite a bit of heft.- No &#34;easy&#34; way to switch between Bluetooth inputs. I often switch between my HTC and MacBook, which involves pressing the little bluetooth button on the speaker and manually connecting it on my desired device, which is a little cumbersome. Thankfully it only requires about 10 seconds of fuddling to get it to work.Things to note, neither bad nor good:- Some people claim that the speaker's bass sounds better when it's several inches from a wall. I don't disagree, but it's often a little tricky to find the optimal distance when you're in a hurry to get the music going for a party.- Can't be charged by Micro-USB. This wasn't a problem for me, because the battery life is easily good enough for my uses and I just set it on the dock at night, but for VERY mobile users this could be a bit troublesome.I can heartily recommend this speaker to just about anyone. It works perfectly for my requirements - bedroom listening to classical music and top Spotify charts, and outdoor party music - and sounds great to me even though I'm very picky about my sound equipment. I would NOT purchase this speaker if you need something ultra-portable because it's so heavy (one of Logitech's tiny speakers might serve you better), but for anybody else, this thing is flawless. There's a reason it's the #1 seller for Bluetooth speakers right now on Amazon. Enjoy!
$review_summary.: Excellent little speaker! Perfect for gatherings/bedroom use

$review_text.: Adding the SW210BL powered Subwoofer to the LFE (.1) channel greatly improved the Low Frequency Effects response of the system to a point where is it sounds very much like the audio in an actual theater


 The upright design construction and small size makes it easier to place this unit than many similarly performing larger units while not sacrificing performance
 I was somewhat apprehensive when ordering the SW201 but was very favorably surprised at the excellent effects this relatively small unit delivers; and all at at very reasonable cost.

$REVIEW.: Been looking around to connect a SD-Compact flash reader to my IMac. This model (USB2, there is also a slightly more expensive USB3 version) is one of the best looking around, I like the design protecting the ports when not in use. Definitively good value for money. Works with all my extreme Compact flash cards (which I was afraid some of the cheaper models would not). You cannot get wrong with this one.

$REVIEW.: I have two 120MM fans on the side of my HAF 922 case, and at first I was going to buy two of the Silverstone filters to cover each fan.  Then, I accidentally tripped over this option.  It's cheaper than buying two, and it covers both of them perfectly.  Since the case is made out of steel, the magnets work great. Also note that I bought the 140MM cover to go over the fan I have installed in the bottom of the case...it also works great.  Very simple solution to keep dust out of  your case...I highly recommend it!

$review_text.: This is the best BD player for your dollar, One update from some of the older reviews I've read here is... "THE NEW SOFTWARE PACKAGE COMES WITH BD PLAYER, SO NO LONGER NEEDING 3RD PARTY PLAYER" it was a snap and easy SATA install. Its slick and quiet operation, The BD player is simple and easy to operate. and you simply can't beat the price. By far its the best dollar I've spent for a BD player.
