$review_text.: Every Other Day hooked me. It had an interesting premise: its lead heroine, Kali D'Angelo is a normal sixteen-year-old girl...but only EVERY OTHER DAY. EVERY OTHER DAy, she becomes something more than human, something predatory that hunts all kinds of supernatural creatures. That means that every other day, she is as vulnerable as the humans she is trying to protect. And she has no idea what she is or why she came to be the way she is.As you can imagine, Kali starts the book as a loner. Much like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, she feels she can't connect to those around them...especially since she'd have to lie about what she does and who she is every other day. But when a popular girl at school is marked for death and Kali must save her in the twenty-four hours when she is human, she acquires her own Buffy-like Scooby gang.The story is fast-paced. The characters are well-fleshed out so that you fear for Kali's death as much as you fear for that of those around them who are always human and nothing more. In the back, there is always the question about what Kali is and why and if she will ever find out if there others like her, if she is some kind of "chosen one," mutant, whatever and if so why her abilities leave her every other day vulnerable and defenseless.It seems like this is a stand-alone book but it feels like just the beginning. I finished it hungering for more of Kali and her new friends and their terrifying new lives and future. Kali is a heroine in the vein of Katniss and Buffy, she kicks ass...but she is her own singular creation and Barnes is to be applauded for creating such an amazing character with an incredible story.

$REVIEW.: REVIEW: So impressed after reading this book! I have to say book 2 in the Darwin's Children series was great. I cannot imagine how hard it was writing these books. There is so much detail and things happening, yet you can easily follow it. Super impressed! This book was so exciting all the way through. The characters were still amazing, and I loved that Matt was brought into the story more. I really liked how there were several things going on at once that all tied into each other. Jaycie is trying to keep her powers in line after her surge, Haylee is learning about her ability, Allison is trying to figure out what is going on with herself lately, and Matt is the key to everyone's problems. There is also a few new characters in the story as well. Alonzo, a medium, was one that I really enjoyed. I can't say much more without spoiling. I read this book it two days. I seriously couldn't put it down. I loved this world that was created and its such a great, exciting, adventurous story!!! I was left begging for more! Natasha Larry, please tell me there will be more! Pretty please!!!!

$REVIEW.: Sue Patton Thoele has done it again! I am a big fan of Sue's and have read nearly every book she's written over the years
Her work is always beautifully crafted, insightful, funny, and just plain practical

This book, in particular, may just be my favorite.If you are a woman like me who often finds herself harried and hurried, this book can be a soothing balm in a very hectic day
Once you learn how valuable it is to live mindfully, rather than mindlessly (which Sue relates very well), any one of the practice sessions she presents will predictably deliver you to a more peaceful state of mind and heart


Mindfulness does take practice and commitment, but it is not difficult to engage at all, as the author demonstrates through delightful vignettes from her own life


Once you get the hang of mindfulness, life takes on a whole new hue

There is so much more joy and appreciation to be found--not to mention fewer stress-filled days!I really loved this book


I would recommend it to women of all ages, lifestyles, and spiritualities

It has the word "classic" written all over it


I know I will read it myself again and again

I am so glad Sue wrote this for all of us.

$REVIEW.: First, my pet peeve, no pictures - I really prefer a cookbook with pictures
 That said, I found most of the recipes in this cookbook sounded like ones I would enjoy, nothing to exotic, but nice rich comfort food and most of them I hadn't seen before


 Many of the recipes contain butter and sour cream - this is definitely not a low cholesterol cookbook (although it notes you could substitute yogurt for sour cream)
 I think my husband and I would enjoy many of the recipes
 I can't wait to try the chicken stew recipe as I have only ever had beef stew

 Unfortunately I think my picky eater children would like very few of the dishes as many of them contain spinach and green vegetables mixed in with their food is a no go.I recently took an herb cooking class, which explained all the health benefits of herbs and how to preserve and use them - I was really glad to see many of the recipes included thyme, rosemary, parsley, etc

 I've been looking for a way to introduce them into my diet and these recipes look great.Should also be noted that some of the recipes have multiple steps and you may need more than one crockpot or the stove - only noted this because I tend to think of crockpot meals as dump and go - but I suppose if I want more options out of my crockpot, I have to think of using it differently.The cookbook starts out with a section on beverages - the cider sounds amazing, but I was confused about the hot coco - that is just something I never would make in a crockpot - but maybe if you were having a sledding party it would come in handy.Final item - the author includes several side bars with additional information about how to get the best performance out of your crockpot - for example when making soup - make sure all vegetables are cut approximately the same size so they cook uniformly


 I found these to be very helpful tidbits

There is of course more to Christ and that is what this book is all about.  This book discusses 31 different reasons why Christ was on this earth for us, not just the Christmas story.This is definitely a book that is for all Christians, but I would certainly recommend it for new Christians.

$REVIEW.: How do you end up in a psycho ward, and not know how or why? All I can say is "Drazen", need I say more. Well we've read about Jonathan, Theresa and Fiona, they all seem to be a little crazy. Do you think Fiona will end up with Deacon or Elliott? I'm hoping with Deacon, I think he understands her better, he knows what she wants and needs. Elliott discovers something about himself that he would like to explore more, it might stem from his youth. I wonder what will happen with Karen ? and with Warren, I don't like him. C.D., not only knows how to write but she also knows how to pull us in and keep us on edge. We were all upset when Amazon was taking so long to publish, we were ready to boycott.

$review_text.: With Tunnels in the Briar Patch, Blaine Coleman has created a work which makes him one of the most distinctive, talented, indie writes of our time. Told in a lyrical style through the wondered eyes of an eight year old child that makes the realistic life events feel like a fairy tale of a more respectful time but no less violent or judgmental time in the US South. At points, little caveats of the judgmental reality seep through like the grandma Adelaide not liking Mr. Genetti because he is foreign but as with most cultural and moral training, it is barely noticed by the character Roland like his uncle being in the KKK and being a preacher to dodge taxes.  Still the same chapter presents a good story on how being greedy can cost you.  A true treasure of growing up in America with its tales of everyday of like riding a bike, flying a kite and tragedies like a girl getting badly burned and having no hair, this is unforgettable story of a time much less rushed then today. It shares experiences we can all relate to from our own childhoods like playing in a cemetery or deciding whether or not to release a butterfly.  Ultimately, the story of Roland is mature, reflective, and riveting.  It sucks you in with tales of a child's reaction to his surroundings from hearing of a civil war battle of Petersburg, Virginia and relating it to Vietnam to his hearing the story of Noah and his surprise over a wrathful God, so different from a loving Jesus to finding a dead dog and coming home to be with the dog he grew to love, before you know it, you as the reader are swept into a colorful, dramatic, and ultimately satisfying emotional truth.

$review_text.: Destiny Unchained is the third book in the Shadows of Destiny series by Leia Shaw.  This is by far my favorite of the series.  Once I started reading, I didn't want to put it down.  I know I lost a few hours of sleep reading Destiny Unchained, but it was worth it.Destiny Unchained is the story of Cristian, the Alpha werewolf and pack leader for several states, and Natalia, the Huntress Vampire who tracks and kills rogue werewolves.  If you have read Destiny United, you know that Natalia is the wife of Marcelo.  Cristian and Natalia's paths cross as Natalia is hunting The Slayer, a rogue werewolf who has been kidnapping and killing children.  Natalia is extremely head strong and persistent in tracking The Slayer which leads her into Cristian's territory.  Since Cristian knows of Natalia's reputation, he captures her in hopes of finding out why she has ventured into his territory.  Thus our story begins and Cristian and Natalia's relationship starts off with some kick ass action.Destiny Unchained was definitely one kick ass story.  The past experiences of Cristian and Natalia provide great conflict as their relationship develops and changes.  Both Cristian and Natalia have emotional pain and grief to overcome and find that they need each other to do so, Natalia more so than Cristian.  Cristian proves to be the undoing of Natalia as he does not let her run from him and uses his Alpha status any way he can in his pursuit.  Natalia is definitely the strong, hard heroine that Cristian needs to balance his Alpha maleness.In addition to the development of the relationship of Cristian and Natalia, they must pursue The Slayer.  The Slayer not only kidnaps and kills children, he also toys with Natalia.  He knows how to manipulate and string her along.  He seems to enjoy the game as much as the end result.  It takes both Cristian and Natalia to pursue The Slayer.Destiny Unchained has a great story line, steamy sex with meaning, not gratuitous, lots of emotional demons to overcome, and action, action, action.  Destiny Unchained is a good paranormal story with two very strong characters.  In addition to the action, there are also some very tender, touching moments between Cristian and Natalia as they connect.  I even teared up a few times.  I could definitely read Cristian and Natalia's story again.There are more characters introduced in Destiny Unchained which provide a lead in to the next couple of books in the series.  There are witches, sorcerers, fae, more vampires and werewolves, and dragons to be seen. Sorin, the Beta Wolf, has a story, For the Love of Harmony (book 2.5) which is also tied into Destiny Unchained.  I am anxious to start book four, Destiny Bewitched.  I can't wait to see what action will be next.

$review_text.: I received a free ebook of this book for an unbiased, honest review but I would have been more than happy to buy it.Having just self-published my third crime novel, exploring new marketing opportunities is high on my current list of priorities. I must admit marketing has always been a minefield for me as an author, but Ms Penn's book has cleared up a lot of questions and made the process feel much less intimidating.How to Market A Book takes the reader on a long journey, for ease split into five sub-headings, starting with Marketing Principals right through to Launching Your Book, with everything else in between to appeal to both short term and long term writing plans and ambitions. It's ideal for both an In-depth examination of every option available to authors or for dipping in at relevant sections as and when needed. The author goes into detailed advice which could prove invaluable for novices trying something new - eg podcasts or book trailers. There really is something for everyone here.Ms Penn spends time explaining how many writers will first need to alter their mindset from seeing marketing as something tacky and embarrassing into the positive idea of 'sharing what you love with people who will appreciate hearing about it' and uses her own story and experiences of how to achieve your goals. In this section, I was particularly impressed with her time management advice.By the end of the book many of my perceived marketing myths had been wiped out and I felt so much more confident about a range of topics which previously would have meant nothing to me at all! Metadata, keywords, author platforms, paid advertising, email lists. Fair to say, I already have a long list of my own of things I need to be doing! And luckily I now have the perfect guide to refer to along the way.So, if you want to know more about 'social karma and relationship serendipity' or find the answer to questions like 'So, what exactly is an author platform?' I'd advise this book should be top of your reading list. I've no doubt I shall be referring to it time and again, and believe it will be an invaluable asset on any author's virtual bookshelf.

I have been sick for a few weeks and it's been hard to feel I have not been doing what I had been wanting and planning to do for Lent. At least I can read, meditate, and pray with this e-booklet as a guide each day, if nothing else. This is easy to fit into your day. Each day is very short and can be read through within a few minutes. Yet you can spend as much time as you want pondering or journaling about it and praying.
$review_summary.: Great for Lent

$REVIEW.: 3.5 starsThis book was good. Katherine and Timber knew each other from school. She was picked on mercilessly by Timbers &#34;in&#34;crowd. One day he felt bad for her and apologized but she told him his apology didn't mean anything because he sat back and watched his friends bully others.Years later and Timber is out of the army, after four years and tours in Afghanistan. He's experienced great loss from the war and it has left deep rooted scars. He takes a job in a small town working in the oil fields. Trying to find a way to cope with his demons and nightmares that plague him. He never expects to run into a tattooed, hazel eyed brunette that looks a bit familiar.High school was tough for Katherine. She dealt with being picked on. But it was the sexual assault that sent her over the edge. She moved away from her hometown to a small town where her uncle worked. She was too damaged to go off to college and instead got a job at 18 tending bar. Being in a small town was good for her. She re-created herself into Kat. Kat was a hottie with tats,  but still wounded. She has a couple friends and everyone who knew her cared for her.The night of her 21st birthday she never expected the boy from her past to walk in the door. She knew exactly who Timber was. But since Kat looked so different, he didn't recognize her at first.Initially Kat gives him the cold shoulder. But Timber likes Kat and has had a soft spot since high school.Both of them are carrying secrets that hold them back. But eventually they open up to each other and begin to unknowingly help each other heal.But Kats demon isn't only in her past. Her attacker has haunted her for years and has finally come back in the flesh. It's a shock to everyone to learn who it is. The reader is aware from the beginning.Timber and Kat were great together. He was alpha male hot. Demanding, bossy yet gentle. Kat was a fighter. But she could fight timber from sneaking in her heart. I liked their gentleness in helping heal from their pasts. I also liked their sexiness. He was HOT!.
$SUMMARY.: Hot alpha male!

$review_text.: Okay I waited so long for Part 3 and thought it would be the end, only to get to the end of the book and find there will be a Part 4..WTF!!! I get it the authors write books for a living but I'm so tired of all the sequels and honestly am tired of both Leah & YaYa. YaYa made some of the dumbest decisions in this book (Lying about Chase, sending a young girl to jail to do her work for her) I mean one thing I see in all these urban books is the main characters claim to be so street smart and all that but they do the stupidest things. At this point I'm not even looking forward to Part 4 which doesn't come out til 2014, because I'm sure there will be a Part 5, 6,7,etc etc....

I love a book that tells where it's going and how it is getting there. You want love, action, drama, suspense, secrets, lies, and most importantly swoon worthy guys well this is the book for you! If you have not read the first book Atonement you need to. This is such a great follow up to it that it really did amaze me. I just have to say if you are not a fan of surprise endings then you might not like the ending. Sorry I had to say that because a lot of people might not like the ending I did because it makes me need to read the next book and I need it like I need air to breathe!Deidre has fled Seattle after finding out a big secret that involved her beloved Colin. Lord after the shit hit the fan and the dust settled she decided she had no other choice but to run. What is running from.... her heart or the one person that could destroy everything for her? It doesn't matter because she ran and she decided she would go to La Jolla and start a new life free of Colin. Is she broken hearted yes. Can she survive on her own, who knows but she is willing to try it.While in La Jolla Deidre meets Drake O'Connell who is a sexy as hell chef and owns his own restaurant. They start building a friendship when something happens to Drake and Deidre has to decide whether she is willing to let the past be the past and move on with Drake or will she let Colin rule her heart? Deidre has some serious decisions and choices to make and yes they will be hard because love knows no boundaries but in the end can she move on or will she stay stuck with a broken heart?

$review_text.: This collection of poems, though relatively short, is full of dynamic power in the images and several implied narratives. The collection expands on the themes of Caplin's Confessions of a Prodigal Daughter, and should certainly appeal to anyone who has read it or other similar memoirs (Lauren Winner's Girl Meets God; Jennifer Traig's Devil in the Details, etc).This collection also stands on its own, and is especially attractive to the reader who enjoys thick, descriptive imagery, the overlapping metaphors of classical Chinese or American imagist poetry. Frequently, feminist, religious and personal themes come together in stark images: &#34;prevent her from becoming// an atheist// in the religion of relationships.&#34; Or &#34;Season after season, all living things sleep// before coming back to life.// Faith, too,// must hibernate.&#34;In short, these are poems I am glad to have read, and glad to have with me to read over again and mine for layers that escape attention on a first reading.

$REVIEW.: Miranda Charles does it again with Secret Designs creating a fun romantic story with some unexpected twists along the way. Ari and Dylan had a one-night stand which seems innocent enough but as they keep spending time together, both start to realize that they want something more. This isn't easy for either of them because they both have past relationships that have definitely forced them to be cautious. At the same time, Ari is struggling, having just lost her job. Designing dresses for Jasmine's wedding is keeping her afloat but she needs something more consistent since she also supports her sister and nephew. I really love Ari's independence and determination to handle her problems herself without being dependent on anyone. Of course, some of Dylan's well-meaning friends create a situation that forces Ari to walk away. Can Dylan earn back Ari's trust? Will Ari be able to really let Dylan in? Fun, quick weekend read that was a great escape giving wonderful romance and steamy sex scenes.

$REVIEW.: I love short stories, and knowing a thing or two about Betty Dravis and some of her writing, I was a little shocked at the subject matter and execution of her three contributions to this solid, yet macabre collection of horror shorts.  The first thing that struck me about these short stories is how every word counts.  I really enjoyed her other works, but I especially appreciate her wordsmith capabilities here.  Betty, you're not getting older, you're getting better.I really loved the Dante-esque deliberations of "The Collector," a mafia horror-parable, which she executed in the sparest amount of words.  "V.O.," however, is a unique descent into hell, so deep, yet touching our modern tendencies in a familiar way.  "Heavy Metal" takes a funny, former work and gives it a horrible new twist.  Behind all the sordid scariness, there are some core beliefs she hasn't left behind.Co-author, Barbara Watkins isn't a stranger to horror, and her contributions are no small shakes either.  Her short story "Passageway to Hell," one of the collection's very best, envelopes the surreal and real in a way that blurs the difference between the two with a literary effect akin to David Lynch movies.  "The Jester" reminded me of a candidate for a "Twilight Zone" or "Night Gallery" episode.  Although quite original, it particularly reminded me of "The Nutcracker" segment from the latter show with some terrifying differences.With all six stories an easy read, it should go down just as easily--not unlike a six-pack.

$REVIEW.: If you are interested in and love to eat rice, you should seriously consider this book


 The authors have written several cook books--almost travelogues--about the food found in the Far East


 I've not confirmed it, but I think this was their first
 I somehow missed seeing this when it was new, and I now consider it an oversight on my part
 While it is an older book, it still has a lot of pertinent information in it.It focuses mainly on the countries in the Far East, but there are chapters on rice in the U.S


and Europe


 It does a lousy job of covering rice in the U.S


and Europe and that is why I knocked my rating down a star


 On the other hand, the recipes in the other chapters are very nice and you will easily find some &#34;keepers&#34;.You may need to visit an Asian market to find some of the ingredients, but, hey, if you really like to eat rice, you really need to get acquainted with an Asian market in your area


 Asian greens and aisles of condiments will turn you into a rice fanatic, and you'll soon be growing Asian greens in your garden.I highly recommend this book


 It is less a travelogue than their other books and the authors incorporate their family life and practices into the narrative, which makes it very personable besides informative

 Check out the availability of used copies--you can't go wrong with this book.

$REVIEW.: This fourth volume shows Peanuts keeping the stride it slowly established over the first six years of its existence

Here the characters pretty much look as they will look for decades to come
The cast also becomes more solidified with Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, Pig Pen, and of course Snoopy
Shermy, Violet, and Patty show up far less frequently than earlier
Schulz would add more characters later (most notably Woodstock, Peppermint Patty, and Marcie), but here he established his core cast.Snoopy completely comes into his own here, and his image on the cover couldn't be more appropriate

He appears with startingly more frequency throughout 1957 and 1958

By the end of this volume his top spot gets nearly set in stone
And it's not hard to see why


Here the long transformation from the "real" pet dog of the early 1950s to an almost surreal fantasm of a dog nears fruition (he still hasn't put on his WWI goggles or quaffed root beer yet, though)


The imitations that began in the last volume continue inexorably here


He becomes a polar bear, a pouncing wild animal, a sea monster, he imitates Lucy, he gets called "ol' Dime a Dozen" and "Fuzzy Face", he imitates a penguin, and, best of all, a vulture

He also begins to really appreciate classical music (he even accompanies Schroeder on violin), sleeps with his head in his dog dish, and violently whips Linus around by his blanket

The extent of his transformation shows on the January 7th, 1958 strip where Charlie Brown says "The teacher told us to make a drawing of a real dog." Snoopy has truly come into his own

And later on, he became the most recognizable character of the Twentieth Century apart from Mickey Mouse.Charlie Brown continues his quest for something meaningful and positive


But, as usual, some snags occur


He singlehandedly loses the baseball championship, is absent for his team's first win, gets tangled up in a truss of kite strings, and says "rats!" an awful lot
The strip on September 4th, 1957 shows Charlie Brown acquiesing in the very depths of his misery
Linus asks him "Doesn't looking at all these stars make you feel sort of insignificant, Charlie Brown?" He answers, "No, I'm so insignificant already it doesn't bother me." Like most of Peanuts, Schulz brilliantly mixes the sad with the funny.Some of Schulz's legacy also shows in this volume

At least two cartoons appear here that must have provided some inspiration for Bill Watterson, creator of the incredible "Calvin And Hobbes"
A Sunday strip from Jaunary 26, 1958 shows Linus vengefully sculpting a hideous snow monster to devour Lucy's "snow bunnies".And, on January 18th, 1958 Linus and Charlie Brown wax historical while wiping out on a snowsled


These remind us that Schulz had great influence on more or less all late twentieth century comic strip art


No one yet has emerged from the enormous shadow that "Peanuts" cast on the medium.One of the volume's absolute highlights is the Feburary 23rd, 1959 Sunday strip

Charlie Brown walks through the neighborhood while the other children scorn, mock, and laugh at him

when he finally arrives home he switches on a radio to hear "...and what, in this world, is more delightful than the gay wonderful laughter of little children?" He gives the radio a good boot


This masterpiece of a strip encapsulates the entire story of Charlie Brown

And this volume helps encapsulate the legacy left by one of the greatest comic strips ever created
Not only that, "Peanuts" not only influenced its own medium, but in the 1960s it influenced television, music, Broadway, and humor in general (especially of the self-deprecating sort)
As each volume of this great series by Fantagraphics appears, that influence becomes easier and easier to appreciate.

$review_text.: I must begin by saying that I think this story is better being read after reading the first in the series. The first book is entitled Beyond All Measure. There are many references in Beauty for Ashes to the first book in the series and I just think it would be more enjoyable to read them in order.I enjoyed the storyline and the setting, but my favorite thing was the depth that the author gave her characters. She did a great job capturing the dynamics between family members. The tension between Carrie and Mary was very well written.The end of the book was satisfying yet it left you with just enough of a cliffhanger to make you look forward to book three in the series. The note from the author in the back of the book said that the next book will be out a year from now. The note also gave interesting information on what parts of the book were based on facts and what parts were fictitious. This book also included discussion questions.This is a series worth picking up especially if you enjoy Civil War era fiction.I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion.

$review_text.: I've heard people saying "she's a regular typhoid Mary" all my life, but really had no knowledge of the woman behind the phrase.  Joan Meijer's "Relentless: The Search For Typhoid Mary " introduced me to Mary Mallon, who was blamed for 52 cases of typhoid and three deaths during her tenure as a cook for wealthy families in New York.  The story is set in the early 1900s, when well-to-do families vacationed on the shores of Long Island, and had servants who did their laundry, cooking and cleaning.Most of the domestic work was done by poor Irish immigrants, who worked long hours and barely earned enough to survive.  Mary was one of these immigrants, and she spent years building up her reputation as a very good cook.  She was unfortunately also infected with a-symptomatic typhoid.  In the days before antibiotics and before the causes for disease were widely understood, typhoid was a common illness which killed 10% of its victims.  Even those who survived were deathly ill for a long time.  Because Mary didn't have symptoms of the disease she carried, she unknowingly infected the families she worked for and the other hired help.Dr. George Soper, a typhoid expert from the NY Department of Health, identifies Mary as the source of the outbreaks, after many months of painstaking investigation.  For a long time, Mary stayed one step ahead of him by leaving her employers as soon as the first case of typhoid broke out.  Eventually she was captured and spent the rest of her life in isolation at a sanitarium on North Brother Island in NY.I enjoyed the well-rounded characters in this book, the medical terminology and glimpses into the fashion, living standards, labor issues and social customs of early 1900s New York. I also shared the author's sympathy for Mary, whose life was ruined by her arrest and incarceration for the "crime" of having a disease.I felt the sex scenes between Mary and her boyfriend Hal were a little gratuitous, but didn't take away from the book as a whole.  I Googled Mary Mallon after I finished reading the book, and was surprised to see photos showing her as a normal sized woman and not unattractive.  The author described her as mannish, horse-faced and large throughout the book.Overall this is a well written book with a little thriller/mystery mixed into the historical fiction.  I received a complimentary copy of this book directly from the author in exchange for writing an honest review, and I give this book 4 stars.

I liked the flawed and real characters and the ideas in this book.  Without putting out any spoilers, this book had some ideas about religion that can expand ones view of religion.  Though the book has a thriller/mystery vibe it at the end leaves you wondering could the author be onto something much bigger?There is a bit of the Da Vinci Code feel to this with the pacing and religious aspects, but it is also unique and offers some new insight and perspectives.  This was an enjoyable read and well worth the 4.99 I paid for the book.

$review_text.: I'm not afraid to admit that the moral of the story is probably a lot deeper than what I got out of it. I felt the story's purpose was to teach us that we are all born with special gifts and we should recognize those gifts in ourselves and others. The author suggests picking up stones and carrying them around to remind us of those gifts. It points out that a rough stone will only become smooth as a result of friction. Similarly, we become stronger through trials and tribulations. I appreciate the lesson learned from the story and I love the illustration of the stone, but the story itself was lacking.

$REVIEW.: This series is a spin off from the Vampire Academy series, and focuses more on the human point of view than the vampires. It's full of surprises and shocks, just like the Vampire Academy books...and that includes unexpected deaths. There are three other books already out in this series, and the fifth is due out this summer, with the final story due out next year. Can't wait to see how all this turns out!

$review_text.: The follow-up to Dinesh D'Souza's 2008 bestseller, What's So Great About Christianity, is a book that deals with the same broad issue but tackles it in a completely different way.  Life After Death: The Evidence attempts to establish a scientific, moral, and philosophic basis for the immortal soul and the afterlife.  D'Souza does his best to argue from a general theistic vantage-point, not advocating for Christianity specifically until the very last chapter.  Overall, he does an admirable job at building his case and if nothing else, he gives the atheist, agnostic, and apathetic a number of well-thought-out and well-reasoned arguments to mull over.  For the believer, the choir-preaching makes for a pleasant experience that reinforces much of the faith he already holds dear.D'Souza writes well.  He has a vast amount of knowledge about a variety of subjects and he nimbly moves from nineteenth-century German philosophy to twentieth-century scientific discoveries in quantum physics to the Biblical text without breaking a sweat.  And through it all, he breaks the information down in such a way that most chapters are lucid and easy to read, even for the layperson who doesn't know his Hegel from his Heidegger.The first three chapters lay the foundation for the rest of the book by arguing that the afterlife is an issue that needs to be considered.  Near the beginning of the book, he tells a story about a friend who simply doesn't care one way or another whether there even is an afterlife.  &#34;Why should I?&#34; the man asks D'Souza incredulously.  This seems to be the question that D'Souza wants to answer with this book.  It's written to fence-sitters and agnostics: people who haven't made up their mind about the issue and don't seem to want to.  And D'Souza does his best to pique the interest of just this sort of person.Since D'Souza puts his Christianity in a box throughout most of the book, it could potentially be enjoyed by people of various religious stripes.  Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and others will find areas of agreement with D'Souza and he quotes from various sources and traditions including all of the above religions.  For the Christian who comes to this book merely looking for 235 pages of reinforcement, it could be disappointing.  Young earth creationists and other biblical literalists may disagree with his chapter on evolution and various other comments sprinkled throughout.  In fact, when chapter nine ends he seems to point to the idea that the Buddhist and Hindu religious ideas of the afterlife could be correct and he doesn't get around to even talking about Jesus in any meaningful way until the very last chapter where he gives an unfortunately abbreviated gospel message.Nevertheless, I believe D'Souza's purpose in writing this book was to encourage nonbelievers to rethink some of the foundational ideas that they hold and with that goal in mind, I believe he does well.  Even if the book doesn't convert anyone, it will hopefully get them thinking.  On the other hand, I believe he misses a out on a great opportunity.  The fact is, although most every religion has some idea of an afterlife in mind, they are widely different.  By trying to write objectively, he lumps every religious view into the 'afterlife' category and pits it against the 'secular-materialist' category.  But, as his other book's title implies, Christianity is great.  In fact, as a Christian, I believe (and I'm sure D'Souza would agree with me on this point) it is the greatest religion and worldview there is.  It's not merely one among a variety of theistic views.  It is the embodiment of Truth himself.  That's my only real issue with the book.  A Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim could pick this up, read all but the last chapter, walk away, and never have been challenged about his beliefs.  In fact, there are some places where he might nod in agreement while the Christian shakes his head.The chapter exploring NDEs is interesting as is the chapter that covers many of the discoveries in modern physics.  Chapters ten and eleven are especially good in how they pull the curtain back on materialism's shaky foundations (although almost every chapter has quality arguments and ideas in it with only chapter nine maybe being a little too obtuse for the average reader).  This is one of the things that makes the book so enjoyable, every chapter approaches the topic from a completely different angle so it never gets boring.  Something new and interesting is always just around the corner.  As a whole, Life After Death is definitely worth a read no matter your theological beliefs (or lack thereof).  I just wish D'Souza would've used the opportunity to advocate more clearly for the gospel.

It's not a 'Savage Worlds GM screen' - It's essentially a two-fold binder with sleeves to put self-printed pages.  There is no art, no SW tables, nothing - it's just a two-fold vinyl binder.  I had to download/print any of the insert separately.  To do it 'right' you'd have to print on card stock, maybe even take it to a professional print shop.I can't recommend.

$REVIEW.: My son pulled this book off the shelf at the library two weeks ago and we've been reading it every night since. My son is 2 1/2 and really responds to Anh's experience of getting upset and frustrated and also to the 'monster' that is Anh's anger. As we all know, there are plenty of kids books that kids love and we do not. This is not the case with this book. It's pleasant to read and the artwork is great. After two weeks of reading it every day, I still don't cringe when he pulls it off the bookshelf.

$REVIEW.: The hero in the book acted more like a lustful teenager than a British duke in his early thirties

 He was constantly kissing the 19 year old governess in his employ


There was little other interaction, certainly not enough to justify their falling in love with each other


There were writing errors - misplaced commas, &#34;to&#34; instead of &#34;too&#34;, mispelled words - that should have been picked up and corrected during editing


Overall I'd give this 2 1/2 stars

It was light entertainment but not worth rereading.

$REVIEW.: Ever fantasized about a man in uniform? Or maybe had a little bedroom play with a uniform? Or even just thought it was sexy as all get out?! Then Down on Her Knees is the book for you!Detective Rafe Davenport and Courtney DeLollis may seem like they can't stand the company of each other. But underneath all that antagonism is a sizzling attraction that cannot be denied. Though Courtney tries...oh does she try. She knows from experience what it is like to be with a man that tries to control every aspect of herself. Ever since she found out about Rafe's dominant side though, instead of scaring her off further, she can't stop thinking about giving him that hard won control. And Rafe is not making it any easier for her to deny him. He has been intrigued by the feisty woman with a fetish for killer heels since the moment he met her. So Rafe offers her a deal and dares her to take it. Four scenes, his choice, her submission...and her pleasure.Christine Bell is one of my must-read authors, especially in the steamy contemporary romance genre. Down on Her Knees is the third book in the Dare Me series, and these ladies can't say no to a dare. A little kink, a lot of romance, this was a hot and exciting enemies to lovers story. Between Rafe and Courtney's sexy banter and toe-curling sex scenes, there was a depth and a history to each of these characters that was masterfully peeled away as the story unfolded. Their friends and past series characters also play big roles in the story, so it was a joy to revisit with them. There were times though that I wanted to smack Rafe around...but maybe he'd like that too much. ;) All in all, Down on Her Knees was a fun and sexy story that I really enjoyed!***A copy of this book was provided courtesy of the publisher in exchange for an honest review

$REVIEW.: Wood's Wall by Steven Becker is a very good novel set in the Florida Keys.  This is the second in a series of novels about Mac Travis.  An easy going part-time fisherman.  He has been a former contractor and ex-military.  The cast of characters from the first novel is back.  They are characters from his lawyer girl friend, Mel, in D.C. to Trufante an easy going beach bum with a nose for trouble.This story starts out with three buddies on a vacation fishing trip coming across a square grouper.  A square group is package of drugs dropped by smugglers to be picked up by a boat.  The buddies are trying to decide what to do with millions that the drugs are worth.  A couple of the buddies party on the drugs that night with their wives while the bachelor goes out to a bar to drink.  He meets up with Tru who convinces the safe thing to do is offer the drugs to the dealer for a reward.  This is the start of the trouble.The package also contains one brick that is not drugs but nuclear material being smuggled in.  The resident terrorist from the first novel is involved again with attempting to set off a nuclear weapon.  He is a bungling idiot.The story revolves around the drug dealer, the terrorist, the buddies, Tru, Mac, Mel, and whole cast of characters.I enjoyed the story and can't wait for another novel in this series.  It is a good read for the commute or vacation.  You are not getting a great work of fiction, you are getting an entertaining novel.

$review_text.: 5++++(WARNING: if you haven't read Collide, may contain spoilers. If you haven't, stop reading this review and go pick up Collide, like NOW)If I hadn't waited until Pulse was released, the ending of Collide may have been hazardous to my health.  Finally, Emily figured out Dillon was, as her best friend Olivia so eloquently and repeatedly referred to him as, a douche (her word not mine) and that the love she had with Gavin was more important than anything else. As Pulse begins, Emily goes after Gavin, but he wasn't so accessible, and she can see that getting him back was going to be quite the fight.If you loved Gavin Blake in Collide, you will fall hopelessly and head over heels in love with him in Collide. His words and his actions will make you melt. (little spoiler here) Emily and Gavin do find their way back to each other, but they don't have it easy - at all. Once you think they're so strong nothing can break them apart, something happens, that you kind of thought would in the back of your mind, but you are still shocked as hell as complications from it unfold. Then is when we truly see how much of a man Gavin Blake is. On the same note, if you hated Dillon, you'll despise him now - although not with Emily anymore he's still around to make things as hard as he can for both Emily and Gavin. We also learn how cruel he really was during his relationship with Emily.As with any sequel, it has double the angst and double the sex. Pulse is an emotional roller coaster. You want the happy ending so badly for Gavin and Emily but are very afraid for their future.  You laugh at Gavin's playfulness, swoon at his devotion to Emily, and cry wishing they both would just get a break.I'm sad to say goodbye, but great end to a great series.

$REVIEW.: This review is from: Asmodeus: Demon of Lust---Part One (Princes of Hell) by Sara Humphreys.I am enjoying reading about Kai Kelly who is a Fae, Aaron Miles who is really Asmodeus sent by Lucifer and Ben Flaherty who claimed to be an attorney in Idaho


 Aaron and Ben are more interested in the ring that Kai has inherited from her grandfathers house and believes it belonged to her grandmother

 But Aaron and Ben want it BAD and I can't wait for part 2 to see how far they will go to get what they want
 And I know that Aaron/Asmodeus is wanting a lot more from Kai then just that ring, as they have a clash of chemistry.I anxiously await the creative words of Sara Humphreys for the rest of this story.

$REVIEW.: How to memorize the entire bible in no time flat is a very attractive title. A good number of people who try to memorize the Bible will download it with the expectation that it would give them some kind of technique to memorize the "Entire Bible" in "No Time" as per the title of the book.The Amazon introduction to the book says "Have you ever struggled in your meditation time? Would you like to know a real working method for memorizing the entire bible? In this short book you'll learn the 5 simple secrets you need to memorize any book in the bible". Again this would seem to indicate to people that this book will give you some technique to memorize the Bible in "No Time" as the title implies.However, this is a totally different kind of book, and a hint to the exact nature of the book comes in the second part of the Amazon introduction to the book which says, "You will discover exactly how God can help you memorize the scriptures, and apply them daily. It is a real working method that will propel your knowledge in the Word of God beyond anything you could ever imagine. After applying these easy principles you'll find yourself growing in ways you never thought possible".The author then goes on to explain the "Spiritual Approach" to internalize and visualize the passage that you wish to memorize.Observations:*** The book is not related to conventional techniques of memorization*** It contains a "spiritual" approach which the author finds useful*** Memorizing "The Entire Bible" in "No Time" is to be taken figurativelyRecommendations:*** The book is not for those who are looking for conventional approaches to quick memorization of Bible verses*** It is meant for those who are willing to give a try to the "Spiritual" approach of the author

I liked it but it's hard to build characters in a short story and I didn't truly like the h. I found her to be a bit shallow and a little too overt with the H. Like one of the other reviewers said, she was going to try for the H regardless of whether he was involved with someone else or not. Fortunately the H wasn't and so that was left alone. i preferred the second half of the book where the H worked a little harder to get the h. Call me old fashioned but it's what I like. Anyway I was intrigued enough to buy one of the other books in the series.

$review_text.: I was very excited when I saw this series was offered for free.  Unfortunately, while I found the photos exquisite, I found the captions to be blah.  Granted this is a level 2 reader, but the captions read in a staccato manner.There were also inconsistencies in the writing style.  For the most part they are just facts.  Then occasionally there would be statements of admiration.  Then a question would be thrown in.  If this is to be a "fact" or "trivia" based book then statements like "Lions are called "King of the Jungle" because they are strong, brave and noble." , don't fit.One of the main things that irked me is throwing in a single question into the book.  If you are going to ask questions and have the pictures give answer, then do that.  I personally think if the whole book had been done in that manner it would have been better.  However, having just 1 question in an entire book doesn't make sense.So while I can recommend this book for small children because the photos are well worth the price.  I found the captioning to be lacking in style and for some content.

$REVIEW.: What can I say about this wonderful novel?  Ms. Berry and I exchanged  books with each other while actually doing a book signing tour in New  Orleans together.  On the plane, returning home, I couldn't put this book  down, even when I started getting sleepy!  Ms. Berry writes a novel of  intrigue and suspense that had my mind and heart racing through the very  streets of New Orleans we had just left with this fictitious character,  Detective Symone Rawlins.  I agonized with her over the death of her  beloved brother and felt vengence in my heart for catching the person who  killed him.  Ms. Berry makes you fall in love with handsome Josiah La'Mon,  an FBI agent, who at first seems like he might not be a good guy.  I loved  the roller coaster ride of mystery Ms. Berry puts the reader on and was  sufficiently surprised when she revealed the killer and the connection  between the two.  This is more a thriller than a romance and I loved the  ride.  What's next Ms. Berry?

$REVIEW.: As the author has stated that she has rectified the main issue I had with the last version of this book, (proper credit was not given to Clement C. Moore writer of "Twas the Night Before Christmas" and Robert L. May writer of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer", I thought I would update my review.When I read a children's book, I look at originality, theme (and did they keep to it), lesson (would a child learn the intended lesson), for pre elementary I look for large bold illustrations. Easy to read and recite language.As for originality, this has none.  Most of the "story" has been "borrowed" from "Twas the Night Before Christmas", and "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer". The author herself said in a comment "Of course, I didn't want to confuse children who might have read other stories. I simply retold the story in my own words, inventing a lot of new "facts" I knew children would love.".  I have seen several books where stories have been "retold", but then the publisher or illustrator would usually bring in something new and unique.Which brings me to theme.  As far as the writing is concerned she stays on theme for the story, however the illustrations are of such variety of styles that it does not create a cohesive feel.  Some are elaborate, some are simple, some color, some black and white, some outlined, some silhouette.  Even when it came to the reindeer she did not select illustrations of a particular style or color pallette.  Cupid truly threw me as the illustration is an outline filled in with a pink sparkly pattern with no discernible features.  The author had commented  "I found these lovely old pictures and wanted to use them to tell the Santa stories all in one place.".  That sentiment would have been fine if she was writing a book on various art on a Christmas theme and organized into styles.  However, I feel if she is illustrating a story, then the art should be similar in nature.The cover of the book says this is interactive.  The interactive portions consist of a question at the bottom of some of the pages. Questions such as "Where are the chimneys?", "Where is the snow?".  There are also two pages that list the reindeer names, no questions just names.  One is titled Special Reindeer" and the other "Position of Reindeer", both pages' links lead back to the individual reindeer pages.  If you read the book by page forward you see these pages anyway.As this book is part of a series, it leads to other problems as well.  At one point the author says,"Once Santa was in the North Pole and he had his magical abilities, he created his elves and they were busy making the toys." If you have read one of the previous books this is fine.  However, she makes a statement of Santa getting his abilities, but does not tell how he gets them.  Which means this is not actually a stand alone book as some pertinent information can only be found in other books of this series.  This book also ends in the statement "This is the history of Santa's Reindeer.  Let's see how Santa looks today and how all these traditions are celebrated each year." , which means instead of a proper ending to a story the reader is left with a sales pitch.I realize that not everyone would take issue with the thing I have.  If the above items won't bother you buy the book.  However, if you want something original and consistent, then give it a miss.

$REVIEW.: My opinion is solely on the Kindle version of this text and has nothing to do with the actual content of the book. I am an avid reader.  I made the change to e-readers back when the first generation b&w; Kindle came on the scene.  It was a difficult transition then but all these years later, I do 95% of my reading on some type of electronic device.  I only purchase "real" books when the electronic version of the text is not available. I was really excited to find out that this book, required for one of my MSN classes, was available as an e-text.  It meant that I could study on the go and not worry about lugging around a big text.  Well.... I am less than satisfied with the quality of this e-text for the following reasons.  (1)Illustrations crucial to identifying important landmarks and disorders are frequently mislabeled.  I noticed when the font is changed the subheading switch around to different pictures.  (2)There are no references to the actual page numbers in the book, so if you are assigned certain pages to read or if your instructor references a "real" page number, you have no clue where to go.  (3) It did not come with an access code for the online content.  I had to go back and forth with the publishers to get an access code for the coveted online material which leads to (4) The only complaint about the actual content of this text is that they reference the online material as though it is really helpful but there are no case scenarios or practice test that would be really helpful to  prepare for exams.  (5) the e-text utilizes way too may links as apposed to just including the information/ text close to the illustrations.I don't usually write reviews but I really had to write this one in hopes of saving some people the trouble I'm having right now.  If you need this text DO NOT GET THE E-BOOK.

$REVIEW.: **ARC given for an honest review**First, even this cover deserves 5 freaking stars because it's hot, extremely hot and I couldn't stop staring at it. Second, if that wasn't enough, this cover totally represents Axel and after reading/realizing it I was hooked. Totally, so hooked, my first read ended at 5:30am!! Yup, I had it bad for Axel and his crew ;)How would you react seeing the only man you ever loved after 12yrs again? Thinking for awefully long 12yrs that he died and you wouldn't see his face again. Only memories of him left; memories of their once cherrished love, plans and hopes. Well,welcome in Isabelle (Izzy) West's life!After realizing she lost him forever she was in a deep,and very dark hole. Her life endured a constant loss so that Izzy truly believed Karma hates her and she is its favorite toy to mess with.After finally 'escaping' her terrible marriage, thanks to her best friend Dee she tries to get her own life back- even though it's not easy. She can't shake of all the horrible moments of her abusive husband and is scared endless.Two years later on her 30th birthday Izzy's friends convince her to take her out celebrating her birthday. But this birthday changed her life completely. She never thought she would look in those green eyes again -boy was she wrong ;)Axel never thought he would see her again. After being in the Marines for years, convincing himself she left him without a glance back, breaking up all their ties, anger boiled for years deep inside of him. But when he saw her, sitting on this barstool,sexy as never before, all the air in his lunges left him. She was sitting right in front of him, mouth wide open, shocked - so beautiful . An that's the moment where both of their lives change.This story was filled with passion, hate, angst and love, lots of love. I loved reading every single page of it. A big plus was that Harper Sloan added short Axel POVs in it, it gave me a better idea what's going on in his head. It was sad to know who was responsable that their two paths never crossed again in the last 12yrs. Wow, can you believe it, thinking your only love, the only person that lets you feel whole is dead for 12 years?!!? Poor Izzy!!When all the anger got pulled aside and their lips touched, true sparks were flying and the beast of passion and love got unleashed all over again. So much that I kept fanning myself -two words: freaking hot!!Axel is alpha, in evey single way, and he lets Izzy feel that too. He makes it very clear he won't let her go ever again. Yep, he's possessive, not in a creepy way though, more in an extremely hot way!! But it won't be so easy for him and Izzy to enjoy their second chance love. As mentioned earlier, Izzy just could escape her abusive husband (man did I hate this BASTARD!!); he's doing everything to keep Axel and Izzy apart - to keep Izzy as his. He is sick, real sick.Overall, I loved this story very much, it has no cliffhanger and a great ending; I can't wait to read Cage. Harper wrote some blow-your-mind debut novel. Hands down!!

$REVIEW.: I like this new series. Dylan Kane & Chris Leroux make a good team. This time they're fighting a killer, designer virus. Interesting concept. They win. The bad guy loses. Plenty of action which is expected in a J. Robert Kennedy book.I like Chris Leroux better when he was shy and half afraid of girls. He was the comic relief in the last book. I missed that.Big Dog and gang make an appearance. If your only exposure to Kennedy is the two Dylan Kane books, you need to read the James Acton thrillers to really get to know Big Dog. The James Acton books and the Dylan Kane books are loosely related. You'll see characters from both books popping in and out of each others books.Bottom line. This is an entertaining book.

$review_text.: I finally had a chance to read the book Soulprint: Discovering Your Divine Destiny by Mark Batterson, and from the beginning to the end, I devoured it. The book is terrific. At first, when Batterson started using the word "destiny" I had a negative reaction and recalled several new-age philosophies based on this word. As I continued reading I saw Batterson define a spiritual destiny based on our past. He used scripture to explain his soulprint theory, citing from the life of King David and his many trials mixed with blessings. In each segment of the book, the author focuses on David's soulprint, then applies the scripture to modern life. He compares David's soulprint to David's destiny, then challenges the reader to examine her own soulprint. I especially enjoyed the chapter on lifesymbols, as Batterson shared many of his personal symbols for inspiration.Mark Batterson Quotes From Soulprint* You were conceived by God long before you were conceived by your parents.* God is crafting your character through the circumstances of your life.* All of us start out as one-of-a-kind originals but too many of us end up as carbon copies of someone else.* We sacrifice our soulprints on the alter of conformity.* If you give God a chance, He will redeem your disappointments. Let God engineer.* It's my footprints, where I've been and what I've done, that reveal my soulprint.This is the first book I've read by author Mark Batterson, and I found the author to be sincere, positive, encouraging and inspiring. My only disappoint in the book was the way scripture verses were quoted without reference. I had to look in the end notes to see what verses were being referenced. As an avid bible study leader, I prefer the reference and translation beside the verse so I can memorize them or identify them as life verses to remember. The end of the book also includes a study guide for small groups, and I found the questions to be meaningful to the segments of there book. The book is not divided by chapters, it is divided by "scenes" identified as: Holy Confidence, Lifesymbols, The Crags of Wild Goats, Alter Ego, The Devil's Workshop and The White Stone. I recommend this book for small group study and discussion or for a Christian Book Club selection. As an individual reader, I found Soulprint: Discovering Your Divine Destiny by Mark Batterson to be educational and inspiring, and will keep this in my library of favorite books. I received a complimentary copy of the book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for my honest review.
$SUMMARY.: Great Book of Self-Examination and Discovery

$REVIEW.: Lunatic is a book that takes a while to get into, and then it starts to make sense and to be worth caring about. It is an unpleasant world, but our characters remember it when it was better, and they have a quest. This is not the first book in the series; the friends have found some important books, but they can't use them yet. Things have gone very badly in their home world while they searched our Earth in the last book. In the end, we have a hint that things will be better, that the quest will resume, and that the world will be redeemed.When the sequel comes out, I'll read it, but it's not one of my big favorites.

$REVIEW.: This book is an excellent resource for becoming a magnetic personality, who others respect and admire.  The author discusses several factors to address, including developing an irresistible personality.  I liked the author&#8217;s approach that you need to be genuine, rather than putting on an act that others will see right through.  He discusses the importance of being interested in people, being giving, and humble.  Also important is being confident and assertive, as well as having a sense of vision and conviction.  These traits will allow charisma to develop, and will allow personal influence and persuasion to develop.The author discusses the factors that get in the way of charisma, including self-limiting beliefs and a lack of confidence.  He gives specific recommendations to counter these factors, including redefining failures and practicing positive affirmations.  Proper body language is also addressed as an important component in communicating magnetism and influence.  The book is inspiring and motivating, with practical guidance for becoming charismatic and influential individuals and leaders.

Series needs to stay with the main events related to the Horus saga.  Looks like the publishers are trying to maximize the number of books in the series rather than maintain the high quality of the initial few books.  I love the idea of telling the Horus Hersey, but need to target an end to the series, get to the final critical battles.  Quit producing "potboilers".

I have a particular gift in teaching as well and I understand the work involved in peeling back the layers of the deep meaning of facts as they are.  In order to teach, one must be able to provide a visual for words that alone cannot or may not bring.  Then, this visual must be brought to a level where it can get into the viewers heart and be felt.  This is what Gloria provides in this resource for really digging into the Riches that truly are found in the book of Proverbs.

$review_text.: When my son told me, in 2004, that there was strong evidence that explosives had demolished the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001, I reacted reacted in a similar way to most others -- with derision


He then waved a copy of The New Pearl Harbor under my nose, and said: "Read that!"I did so, and it stood my previously held view of the world on its head

Even after ten years, I find it difficult to get my head round the enormity of this crime but one has to follow the evidence -- no matter how painful the destination.Since then, David Ray Griffin has published numerous books on 911, each piling on evidence as more comes to light
By the time he had published The New Pearl Harbor Revisited, the evidence that the government account of the events of 911 was so overwhelming that anyone with an open mind, who was prepared to examine the evidence, could not fail to realize that 911 was a monstrous inside job.When David Griffin was taken seriously ill, it seemed that his 911 role as one of the leading intellectual advocates against the official conspiracy theory was in jeopardy

However, he has not only recovered, but has bounced back with yet another tour de force.As previous reviewers have written so eloquently on the contents of the book, I'm left with my overall impressions.The early chapters summarize some of the most powerful evidence that the official account is false in every respect
His ability to marshal evidence in a systematic and compelling way is simply brilliant


Though he does, necessarily, revisit some well-trodden arguments, he often brings in details that were new to me.I believe his treatment of the Pentagon issue to be particularly useful

Discussing the diversity of opinion on the precise details of how the U.S
military pulled the wool over people's eyes, he wisely counsels a conservative approach, as division of opinion within the 911 Truth Movement is potentially useful to detractors

Better, then, to stick to what we all agree on -- that the Pentagon was not attacked by AA77 piloted by al Qaeda fanatics


The evidence for this is overwhelming, and in a genuine democracy would be sufficient of itself to prompt a genuine inquiry into the events of 911.Why, after ten years, are people so incapable of bringing themselves to look at the evidence before expressing their `opinions'? Griffin's penultimate chapter deals with this, explaining how the majority of Americans put their country before all else, including their belief in God


The threat to the comfortable view of America as a benign force for good in the world is so great that most simply cannot contemplate the ghastly alternative.Even to non-Americans, the threat posed by the 911 Truth movement to the conventional, comfortable, worldview is enormous, for it implies a terrible truth about our own governments and media

One is forced to the conclusion that many other `democratic' governments, for reasons we can only speculate on, are also complicit in the cover-up of mass murder


One is forced to the view that the U.K, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and most other `democracies' are little more than vassal states in the American Empire.

Be warned though, a general unpleasantness lingers from start to finish with its cast of unsympathetic characters and scenes and back-stories that border on awkward and dour.  If you can tolerate such elements there are rewards to be discovered mostly by way of Christopher Hacker's frequent and (sometimes) brilliant ruminations on the meaning of 'art' as well as the vivid internal strife proffered from the narrator.

$REVIEW.: I actually want to give this book 4.5 stars. It would've been a 5 stars had the story gave us more of the h's perspective, we only had a small glimpse of it, and it was mainly towards the end.I'm not too fond of reading a book where there's next to nothing of dialogues between characters as I find it tiresome and boring. Plus, I don't care much for pre-historical romances. I stumble on this novel after seeing so many good reviews, and thought I'll give it a try. I must say, even after 1 week of completing this book I'm still thinking about the story and characters. For me, it was that memorable, and it prompted me to write this review!Shay Savage, is a talented and crafty writer. To write a romance story through a pre-historic alpha male is not an easy task, and to write it in a way where readers can vividly picture the events, as well as appreciate the characters is what Shay has succeeded.The story has a lot of steam, and of course sweet romance (sigh). I must admit I nearly gave up on the book after 30% into reading it because there were no dialogues, and I wasn't sure if there would be a strong storyline. However, I urge you to continue reading till the very end as it is a beautiful story and very memorable!

$review_text.: Ever since I read Dark Horse earlier this year, I have become a big fan of Josh Lanyon's writing. He is as author who writes incredible and realistic stories, with a romance thrown in between two strong men who seem to live on the edges of society. So is the case with his latest, Mexican Heat. Josh co-wrote Mexican heat with author Laura Baumbach, owner of the on-line publisher Man Love Romance Press. These two are a great writing duo and I can't wait to see what else they have in store. If their future books are anything like Mexican Heat, I will be there to read it.Gabriel Sandalini is the self tortured hero of this story. He is an undercover SFPD Detective who has infiltrated the West Coast crime syndicate as a gunman. One night, while he is at a gay club, he catches the eye of one of the club goers. Gabriel doesn't think much of it, even though the stranger is quite the looker. Gabriel has other things on his mind such as helping take down the boss of the Mexican Mafia. As Gabriel makes his way around the club, he finds an empty office where he needs a moment of quiet, and is caught. The stranger who catches him, bends him over the office desk, and even though Gabriel tries to escape, he can't because the stranger has incapacitated him. One thing leads to another, and Gabriel is forced to have some hot and sweaty sex with the stranger. (Some may think this is a forced seduction scene. But we do see, that Gabriel could at any point stop everything that is happening to him. The stranger may hold him down and have his wicked way with Gabriel, but Gabriel has the strength and power to stop this man. The stranger even asks if Gabriel wants it, and Gabriel is very vocal in his answer, which is a very loud, yes.) This is one hot, HOT sex scene, especially because Gabriel doesn't know what this guy, who basically ravishes him, looks like. It is the best sex Gabriel ever has, because he likes to be dominated, and his one-night stand lover does that very well.Gabriel is in for quite a shock when he comes face to face with this stranger again. Miguel Ortega is the second in command to a Mexican drug lord. He also still has a very deep interest in Gabriel, but Gabriel tries his hardest to stay away from Ortega because they don't have any chance of a future with one another. But since both of the crime families they work for will become business associates, Gabriel has no choice but to be around Ortega.Ortega must go down to Mexico to meet some drug runners and Gabriel goes with him. These two have such incredible sexual tension between them, that they know that this business trip will end up with both of them in bed together. And when they arrive in Mexico, and Gabriel is almost blown up, Ortega is there to protect him. Gabriel can't help but give into Ortega's seductive techniques, and they spend a passionate night together in bed. This is another wonderful, hot sex scene between these two men. Alcohol is used in a playful way. Ortega has a way with his hands and mouth, and wants everything from Gabriel. He may want his body, but most importantly he wants his love. The reason Ortega is so protective over Gabriel is a bit twist to this story that I had no clue was coming till more than half way through reading.Gabriel can't see how special he has become to Ortega. He denies his feelings for Ortega because he thinks that Ortega is his enemy. These two are surrounded by the possibility of death wherever they go and the fact that they may not have a future with one another, makes their relationship very poignant and emotional. You will be on the edge of your seat wondering if Gabriel and Ortega will be safe and happy. Something does happen to Gabriel, that I think went a bit too far, as if to cement what Gabriel and Ortega have between each other is very real. Other than that, I really could find no other complaints.Mexican Heat is an excellent and suspenseful action pack story, as well as a romance that singes the pages with its heat. The attraction both Gabriel and Ortega have for one another is smoking hot, and one of the best romances I have read this year.Katiebabs

$REVIEW.: Are You Really Listening? (2005) is a self-therapy work on interpersonal communications.  It has three parts, each with several chapters.* Part One: Is Anybody Listening? illustrates the various ways that we do not listen to other people.  In it, you learn that you have been too self-centered to really listen to others.* Part Two: So Many Ways Not to Listen shows us how we avoid listening to our families, friends, and acquaintances.* Part Three: So How Do You Listen? points out ways to hear what other people are saying.This work is not really a self-help book.  The authors apparently admire Carl Rogers, who pioneered a method in which the therapist only echoes what the patient has said.  But the book spends so much time on the problems that it only belatedly gets around to ways of improving your listening.In Chapter Thirteen, the authors state that you should be focused on the other person.  Since such concentration is difficult, they suggest that you paraphrase the words you have heard.  This Rogerian technique works, but why spend twelve chapters convincing yourself that you have a problem?A self-help book should provide you with a way to immediately improve your listening.  Most people who read this book have been told -- or recognize by themselves -- that they have troubles with listening.  The previous twelve chapters may be worth reading, but you might just drop the book before getting to the thirteenth chapter.Look for a book that concentrates on the techniques, not the psychology of listening (for example,Rule#1: Stop Talking!).  Once you have found that such techniques work, this book might be worthwhile reading.  But it really is a form of self-therapy.Not recommended for anyone who wants to fix a current problem right now.  Later you might want to learn why such listening techniques work.-Bill Jordin

$REVIEW.: This may throw some of the fans out there but Angel of Death is probably my favorite Battle Angel Alita book, maybe even including the Last Order books.  I know that doesn't seem to be the consensus but let me explain why.*Spoilers ahead so head's up*In book 5 of the series, everything Alita held dear is either killed or burned and she is made into a sacrificial lamb by the very people she tried so hard to protect.  And when she ultimately wins against the berserker bodied Zapan, those same people sentence her to death.  That's how this book starts.Now my review.  A lot of people are likening this book to the Motorball books 3 and 4.  That seems kinda unfair.  In this book the very character of Alita has been destroyed.  The only thing about her that is still Alita is the desire to see Edo again, and that is buried deep.  So when Alita is portrayed as a blood hungry berserker, I understand where she is coming from.  Its the only thing that even makes her sane anymore, to totally forget the horrors of her past.Sure, it seems as though the love intrest Figure 4 is a throw away character.  He does kinda disappear after this book.  But his role in this story, basically giving Alita a reason to live and feel, is immeasurable.  So even though the love story between them is rushed and clich&eacute;d, seeing Alita feel again is too precious to pass up.Sure, there is a lot of fighting in this book.  So much that it seems to completely bury the story.  But the fighting IS pretty much the story.  It's what Alita has become, a war machine.  But to hold that against the book ignores the story in the fighting, which is really a dissertation on difficult choices and how both sides of any conflict can be right AND wrong.  Besides, as amazing choreography goes, this book if filled with awesome action that, in any other Manga, would be heralded in spite of lack of story... Kishiro just pampered us all too much with past books.So, now that I digress, I will wrap up.  My opinion, which seems in conflict with the majority, is that this book, while maybe not the deepest or most epic, is easily worthy of the name BAA.  And, if a reader, like me, enjoys seeing characters who revel in violence to avoid the pain of life or attachment, then this book is gold.

We first heard of and met Nate in Come Away with Me, when Jules is telling Nat about how she slept with her boss.So in the beginning, we start out 8 months after they hook up. We learn that neither one of them have moved on from what they had between them. But they have obsticles to get over, like Nate's past or the fact that they could get fired if anyone finds out.But let me tell you, Nate is the most beautiful, sexy, romantic man on the planet. Now, I'm not into the long hair, so he could cut it but other then that, he's the perfect man. We learn that he's a former UFC fighter, rides a motorcycle, is a killer business man and just the sweetest thing ever. He knows what he wants and he's not afraid to go after it, and keep going after it until it's his. Fudge, they don't make real men like this. He is clearly a fictional man and damn he couldn't have been written any better.We also get to know a little bit more about Jules' brothers since we will be seeing them in the upcoming With Me in Seattle books. They seem like really awesome brothers and I'm looking forward Caleb's story, which is the 5th in the series. Caleb is a SUPER over protective brother, and my guess, total Alpha male.

$review_text.: Having read both Brodie'sNo Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smithand Bushman'sJoseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, I was not terribly excited to read yet another biography of Joseph Smith other than the fact this one appeared to be a middle of the road rendition and not biased (heavily) in one direction or the other.The result is a very good effort. Donna Hill is a believing member of Smith's following, and as such, does a commendable effort in presenting this history. But as a believer, Hill does not cover EVERYTHING that could be covered. But she nonetheless does a good job.For example, the book neglects covering topics that were a big influence in Joseph Smith's life, like his involvement in treasure seeking or "money digging" which is today recognised and accepted by ALL Mormon historians, and in my opinion is a key topic in understanding Joseph Smith's cultural history. Another exclusion is Joseph's (and the church's) involvement in Freemasonry, again an important influence in the activities of the early Church.Some noted passages:"The evidence so far accumulated suggests that Joseph Smith had no need of the Egyptian papyri to produce "The Book of Abraham", but he found them stimulating. Feeling in direct communion with the Lord, through the workings of his mind, he believed he had done a translation." (p.194)I loved this statement, not because it was the best reasoning the author could come up with to explain why the papyri found does not translate (by modern means) into the work Joseph Smith produced, but because it aptly describes the SAME translation process that occurred in producing the Book of Mormon (Joseph Smith had no need for the plates - which he rarely referred to , as he didn't perform a "translation" but instead relied on revelation to produce the Book of Mormon).pp. 188-190 raises the beginnings of polygamy as early as 1835, with the prophet's first plural wife, the 17 yr old Fanny Alger. The Church's official policy from that point onwards (included in the Doctrine & Covenants until 1876) was "we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again". From 1835 onwards, Joseph Smith was married to many women including some who were already married to living husbands, somewhat contrary to the public official belief.The topic of polygamy continues on in Nauvoo (pp 358-359) where the doctrine is becoming public knowledge via the actions of soon to be apostate John C. Bennett. The Church issues a statement that they are neither aware of such activities and condemn any that exist, while in reality the practise was being taught and sanctioned. Later, in 1886, the Deseret News issues a statement to explain that the Almighty (and hence his servants) are justified in denying [lying about] doctrines "not intended for the world".The book includes a chapter on Joseph Smith's intention to establish a literal kingdom of God on the earth complete with a revelation directed to rulers of the world to accept the restored gospel or else, they will fall in glory.Lastly, of the MANY books I have read on Joseph Smith's life, this is by far the best one in regards to covering the events leading up to the prophet's imprisonment at Carthage, the charges, the men involved in prosecuting him and those meant to protect him, and even more rare, the events that took place after his murder in dealing with those accused and responsible for the crime. It covers much in regards to the political side of things in the state of Illinois at that time, and the players involved in dealing out justice.Overall, I highly recommend this book. Like most on the subject, it is not a definitive, "complete" biography, but it certainly worthy of attention.
$SUMMARY.: A respectable biography. As with most on this subject, NOT the complete picture.

$review_text.: I always hesitate to buy books that are categorized as &#34;Christian&#34; since you never know what kind of use the Christian theme is going to be--preachy, weepy, too holy, irreverent, etc


This one is just right.The main character, Amanda, is a widow of a very thorough police detective


He shared his police detecting skills with her all their married life to the point that she can almost hear his voice when she remembers how he spoke to her with lessons on investigating.For some reason, she keeps finding dead bodies on her doorstep

She doesn't know why but it has happened three times

She moves them to the police station door if possible so their deaths will be investigated officially by the police, but she also feels a responsibility to do some investigating on her own to help those who were left to her care.This book is about the third time it happens and she finds a young man on her front porch
The story gets more interesting when she fails to find a safe place to put the body and has to drive around with it in her back seat under daffodil bulbs most of the night and into next morning.In the process of solving the case she runs into gunmen, people running her off the road, getting shot at with rifles--in other words--a great time is had by all.What I like best is that when she has a problem she prays about it; she prays when sirens go by for the people involved and the workers who will be faced with emergency situations


(I do that too!) She knows the Lord's voice and follows it worrying if she really heard it correctly (me too!) and comes out safely in the end
That is real life to me--no thundering voice from above or great miracles--just help with daily problems and healing of the heart.I hope there are more Amanda stories and maybe her and her new gentleman friend can solve lots of crimes together.

$review_text.: (I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for a review).(This review may contain spoilers).Ideally, I would give this book 3.5 stars


It seemed to pick up more as the story progressed, but I did find it a little difficult to get into at first.The blurb of this book didn&#8217;t actually give much of the story away


I did know before I started reading that this was the second in a series, but I still found this book fairly easy to read.I did waver a bit about how I felt in regards to Ali

There were times I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of her

The other characters were fairly interesting, but there were one or two occasions where Ali came across as fairly self-centred


Some of the really minor characters were intriguing, but apart from the unnamed cheerleader, there seemed to be very few students at the school.The idea about Essence was a really unique one and I would have liked to know more about how it all worked
The Weres and Fangs were also interesting twists and, again, something that intrigued me.I think some of the supporting characters could have been a bit better developed &#8211; in particular the fledglings


When it came to the battles, it was difficult to care about the loss of characters I hadn&#8217;t really met.I did like Krysta and Sammael as characters


They were both ones I&#8217;d like to see more of in other books


I did like Ali and Kian&#8217;s relationship


It was nice to see there were some conflicts, which made their relationship more realistic.I did feel some sympathy towards Dumah, though she creeps me out a lot
I was absorbed by the end of the book and I would be interested in reading other books in this series at some point in the future.

I'm really glad I did give it a try--I loved the paranormal idea behind the book and Graves does a great job putting the reader in Lilly's shoes.  She has a way with her words and the first person point of view really works well.  There was only one thing I wasn't too sure about at the end, but I found out the author is planning two more books in the series and sincerely hope my question is answered.  Great job Lisa Graves!

$review_text.: In this #0.7 novella in the Original Sinners series, Charlotte's acclimation to the BDSM lifestyle is abrupt, but believable. From the beginning, her motivations are transparent, and Kingsley's proposal is too mouth-watering tempting to pass up. My only gripe is Kingsley's woodenness. Written in third person, I don't remember spending a moment in his head, and while in Charlotte's viewpoint, he seemed to lack emotion. Even a tightly controlled Dom--especially a tightly controlled Dom--will portray an expression of feeling, through his eyes, his voice, his actions. I didn't perceive this depth as much as I would've liked, which took some of the conviction out of the romance. Nevertheless, the short story was full and satisfying, inciting me to continue the series.

$review_text.: This is the story of fifteen-year-old Rutka, a Polish girl orphaned by the Holocaust.  Virtually all of her tight-knit Jewish family has been murdered.  The tale begins at the end of the Holocaust, shortly after Rutka and her fellow concentration camp prisoners were released by German soldiers fleeing from the encroaching Allied armies.  The narrative carries Rutka forward, with periodic recollection of her past, italicized for frame of reference.An emaciated Rutka wakes up shivering one cold morning in a barn.  A Russian soldier points towards a nearby town.  Left on her own, with her family murdered, Rutka must venture forth into the world on her own, with no home, direction, plan, aid or insight.  She was a 15-year old girl left alone in a dark and mendacious world.Rutka's story unfolds as she recalls her early life in Warsaw.  Descriptions of her warm family life are well formed and the narrative unfolds descriptively.  In order to escape from the Warsaw ghetto, her family traveled to Krakow, where they lived until Nazis incarcerated the Jewish population.  Like her Warsaw home, this home in Krakow also holds a place in Rutka's heart.Rutka and a girl named Rachel explore the remains of a destroyed Polish town, bereft of inhabitants.  They discover a few meager scraps of food and find shelter in a deserted house, where Rutka takes a warm bath, for the first time in ages.  Such pittances of pleasure seem to be heaven-sent to the adolescent refugees.  In the tub, Rutka attempts to scrub away the vestiges of an unspeakable horror.  Yet, sharp memories of terror and the death of her loved ones cannot be washed away.  They inhabit a stabbing place deep within her heart.Rutka travels to Krakow, where she hopes to find any member of her family at home.  Tormented by images of Nazi brutality, she struggles to adapt to her new freedom.  Like so many other Holocaust survivors, she discovers someone else living in her home, a woman who sneers displeasure upon discovering that the Jewish girl whose family lived there had returned.  For the first time, Rutka understands that almost everyone she has known and loved is dead and that she has nowhere to live.  Rutka has been orphaned by the Holocaust.Rutka's parents had placed her and her younger sister, Haniushka, with a Catholic convent, when all seemed lost.  Unfortunately, this surreptitious salvation was not long lasting.  The Gestapo rewarded members of the community who turned in Jews.  Alas, Rutka and her little sister, "Hanni" were captured and sent to a concentration camp.  In that camp, little Hanni is torn from Rutka's hands and sent to the gas chamber.  Rutka's soul is deeply stained with guilt over this.After her Krakow experience, Rutka is reunited with her aunt Genia, her mother's sister.  Painfully, she begins to accept that the rest of her family is dead.  She has only her aunt and a few friends she had met at the convent.  Through Aunt Genia, Rutka is taken to a "kibbutz" (communal farm) for surviving Jewish children.  Here, Rutka explores a deeper sense of Judaism and she becomes a Zionist.  With no country willing to take her in, Rutka prepares to enter the Palestinian territories illegally.  She is resolute in her desire to help create a nascent Jewish state.  Gradually, Rutka, Genia and the other Holocaust survivors learn Hebrew, take on Hebrew names and prepare for their entry into the Holy Land.Shortly before departing for Palestine, Rutka learns that she can immigrate to America.  She was sponsored by a Jewish family in Detroit, who had just lost their teenage daughter.  On the way, in New York, Rutka meets the only other surviving member of her family, her grandfather, who arrived in America before the Holocaust.  Yet, he is too old and frail to care for Rutka.  So, she moves to Detroit and begins a new life in a new country.  Forced to live with strangers and learn a new language, Rutka struggles to adapt.America opened her arms to Rutka in the shape Naomi and Irving Silverstein.  Detroit held something that she desperately needed - stability.  The Silversteins made Rutka feel at home and loved.  In Michigan, she found the strength of will to focus on surviving and creating her future.Rutka's adjustment to America continued, with school, jobs and boyfriends.  She learned how to fluently speak and write English and to adopt the customs of America.  Eventually she moved to New York, where she settles into life, work and a devotion to writing.Despite many powerful factors that should have resulted in her death in a Nazi concentration camp, Rutka survives and prospers.  As with so many other Jewish families during the Holocaust, she is the lone survivor.  Yet, being a survivor means victory.  It means that Hitler's goal of a world bereft of Jews would not occur.  Within this victory is the sum total of Rutka's young life, robust and filled with so much love.  It is a life torn away by the fabric of intolerance.  Smeared by the blood of blind hatred, Rutka discovers the strength of spirit necessary to ensure her survival.  And, in doing so, she fulfills her part in the everlasting link of the survival of the Hebrew people.The depth of brutality explored in The Long Walk is pale in comparison to other Holocaust novels.  Although the book explores Rutka's "long walk" after the end of the war, the reader is left wondering about details of life inside the Nazi concentration camp.  Perhaps this book was designed for the young adult audience, in which case we can excuse the less than graphic depiction of life in a Nazi camp.Treeson's novel is filled with descriptive language and excellent dialog.  The character of her protagonist is well developed.  However, depth of character development in the surrounding individuals is not as well defined.  This might be in keeping with the desired length of a contemporary memoir.  Yet, the reader is left to wonder who these people that she loved really were.  The rest of the book is marred only by the occasional typo, indentation failure or conversation disconnect.Repugnance, despair and darkness exist within human nature.  We learn nothing about ourselves if we do not examine this dark part of our psyche.  Holocaust victims experienced incomprehensible brutality.  Rutka's "long walk" helps us overcome the evil of persecution and genocide, revealing the triumphant spirit of humankind.Charles S. WeinblattAuthor, Jacob's Courage: A Holocaust Love Story

$REVIEW.: Sekret is a story that creeps forward slowly rather than leaping from the gate with a great deal of speed and intensity, the intricacies of the mind a focal point that forces us to pay close attention and stay sharp even as our attention sometimes wants to wander. It's a tale that's clearly well-researched and well-thought out, but some of the Russian names and plot intricacies&#8211;particularly those that focus on historically significant events like the space race between Russia and the US&#8211;do occasionally trip us up as we try to figure out how they tie into Yulia's ability. The various missions she and the other young men and women like her execute can also be a touch confusing, the gifts each of them possesses at times muddying the waters given how tricky it is to tell whose psychic eyes we're seeing through as events unfold.Yulia has the ability to touch people or objects and see events and conversations linked to them, something she's only recently come into when we meet her. We're therefore almost as out of sorts as she is from the beginning and have the pleasure of asking questions and figuring things out right along with her, ensuring we're connected to her throughout. She's clever and knows to keep her guard up even around those who appear to be friends, and while that doesn't always keep her from being hurt when someone manages to slip past her defenses, we can't help but admire her sense of self-preservation.The romance is an extraordinarily minor element and one that's very low on the drama scale, something we're certainly grateful for but at the same time it's hard not to wish for a touch more. It's almost so minor an element as to be unnecessary to the overall plot, though having said that, there's no instant attraction or angst that makes it feel as though it was an element simply tossed into the story to appease those of us who crave love in their young adult fiction. In fact there's no mention of love at all, it's much more of a quiet friendship that eventually leads to more, and though it is undoubtedly a beautiful relationship full of music and hope, it doesn't strike that emotional chord that has us flipping the pages with added speed just to get to the next scene between them.Overall, Sekret will be hugely appealing to those who love historical fiction, especially the politics and the power games between the United States and Russia in the 1960's. The added supernatural element provides an extra layer of tension, but at the same time it can be difficult to sort through all the contrasting psychic inputs to figure out which pieces of information are ones we need to take careful note of, slowing the pacing down overall. We're certainly left with questions, but they're not of the tear-your-hair-out variety, rather we're content with where Yulia is and hopeful that those questions will find answers in the next installment.Rating: 3.5/5

While this fear has grown more intense, I have a strange urge to buy all of Tom Cruise's movies on DVD including "Legend" in order that I might play them backwards to reveal a secret message.  The message being L. Ron Hubbard's address, so I will know where to mail my check.  Speaking of which, I think BattleField Earth with John Travolta got a bum rap.  It was slightly more painful than placing one's testicle in a garlic press and squeezing.  So just ask homeschoolmum, L. Ron Hubbard is in fact our savior.  On Easter we celebrate his birth and best works of fiction like Dianetics.  On Christmas, we spend lots of money on his products and give them to fellow pagans.  It's not like any of us would dare give "Blue Lagoon" on DVD to another scientologist.  So do you think Brooke Shields turned Tom Cruise down?

$REVIEW.: The Vegan Cookbook is based on living healthy and living longer, the reality of having a better life through eating raw foods and maintaining a healthy diet
 Like most diets it is all based on your beginning, when you cook your food you are &#8220;burning the nutrients&#8221; within the food that might help you live longer

 One of the main reason I loved the book was the power to prevent sickness, cure my physical pain when necessary and an increase in energy as well.Science has proven that if you prepare your food properly you will live longer; the key is having an effective diet that you can maintain over a long period of time

 Within the material there are over 65 meals to prepare and this gives you as much creativity as you need to fully enjoy yourself during your dieting process and integrating healthy food into your lifestyle.Lastly living the Vegan lifestyle is all about family, commitment and living longer so you can get more out of your current situation

 This book has helped me beyond any average dieting program.

$review_text.: Along with the architecture found in PUMA PUNKU, the Egyptian Pyramids and select sculptures at the site, are among the most persuasive evidence for alien visitation in the distant past. Or at least the proof for the much more sophisticated, prehistoric influence of a &#34;lost&#34; civilization. The pyramids are examined very closely, and exhaustively, by engineer Chris Dunn in this very careful and scholarly book, including many photos and diagrams.For me personally, his &#34;Ramses Challenge&#34; was the most remarkable example of a potential outside influence. He shows the reader the astonishing symmetry of this colossal face and the evidence of tool work in its fabrication. Of course, there is much more space given to the exploration of the Great Pyramid itself, again explaining in minute detail why Mr. Dunn regards this enormous structure as much more than merely a &#34;tomb&#34;.I strongly recommend this book as one of the more scholarly and scientific additions to the proponents of the Ancient Aliens argument.

$REVIEW.: Creatively Written!This is such a fantastic read and Mandy Roth has created a world where forms of bird-like shifters exist on a planet called Hafoca where the shifters are known as the Avistaurus of Braluse, creatures who are part human, part shifter, and immortal.  However, the male species mainly shifts into half Eagle and half Bull which I find totally interesting and sexy as hell during the sex scenes, I mean come on, it excites me knowing that the pe-nis enlarges as the character shifts during the act - totally HOT!As in most fantasy worlds, a king must claim a bride for his Queen, but in this case Jakov must claim his bride (Dijana) and fill her with his seed to produce a new heir on the night of the full Red Moon that only comes around once every 100 years.I really enjoyed this fantastic read because it had futuristic elements, sexy men who were very dominant, and a priestess named Dijana with awesome powers who is definitely kickass and doesn't put up with any crap from any man.  The erotic scenes were very intriguing in the beginning and explodingly hot when the king and his advisor/brother share Dijana at the same time.  Double entry erotic scene was done perfect and will definitely have you curving your toes.The story's plot was very interesting and ends with a happy ending of love and bliss of twin babies, but at the same time leaves the story open for the second book.  I am totally hooked and now I need to go get the second book "The Advisor's Apprentice".Fantastic Read!
$SUMMARY.: Creatively Written! HOT!

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ll start out by saying that a copy of this book was gifted to me by the author and the timing of it was perfect as that morning, I had been researching different types of fasts

What prompted the research was a weekend article in HuffPost ([...]) that caught my attention
I had done a basic juice fast 15+ years ago (3-5 days, don&#8217;t recall how long) and felt energized
Now that I&#8217;m older and battling with some chronic conditions (fibromyalgia, chronic migraines), as well as completely stumping two gastroenterologists on something going on, I am spreading my search out beyond the tried and true to see if I can&#8217;t get some of these issues under control
So once again, thank you for the opportunity to read your book, your timing was spot on.Ok, so if you are looking for a book that simply tells you how to fast and what to do, you will find that here
But then again, you can also find that information free on the interwebs

This book takes it up a notch or three

You&#8217;ll find that as you read through it, and I recommend that you do so from start to finish, it&#8217;s short, won&#8217;t hurt you, that this book is more about taking 3 days to do something for yourself

And I don&#8217;t mean go out with some friends for a mani/pedi, it&#8217;s about taking 3 days off (from most everything) and focusing on you
Swann&#8217;s recommendations aren&#8217;t simply what juicers to buy, when to drink what and what to expect


She offers a range of suggestions on how to treat yourself, spend time with yourself, focus on yourself in order to regroup and re-energize
Points
Did you notice the emphasis on YOURSELF?I really like the section on how to prepare yourself physically for a fast

While I found the same information elsewhere, Swann&#8217;s breakdown is informative and presented in a way that should click with most readers


And I will admit that when I did my first juice fast, I didn&#8217;t prep for it
At the time, I was already mostly a vegetarian and when I did my fast, I was working full-time


Since my job was predominantly a desk job, I wasn&#8217;t concerned about potential for low energy as I sat most of the day
Moreover, at least for me, when I was swamped at work, I often didn&#8217;t take the time to eat right let alone get up and stretch

So choosing this time period forced me to take breaks and to care about what I was putting in my mouth.She has a hefty grocery list for you, but if you follow the recipes, having the list/quantities already there for you was a great timesaver at the grocery store, but be sure to check the recipes and compare it to your shopping list before you head out, as lettuce, broccoli, berries and some other items in the recipes listed weren&#8217;t included in the original suggested list


And I also added cabbage as I&#8217;m trying to heal a resistant ulcer

And I liked the addition of personal things to get together to help you focus on your me time

And her list at the end on what size to chop/prep certain veggies/fruits is really helpful

I did add some cayenne and/or garlic paste at times
Overdid it the first couple of times and could have kept vampires at bay.One of the current fads is juicing for weight loss and while yes, that is one very real possibility, it won&#8217;t happen from juicing unless you are doing this long-term (several weeks/months AND under the care of a doctor)


Why? Because juicing is NOT the solution if you return to your old tired ways when you aren&#8217;t on a fast
And this is the hard part
Ok, if you are trying to drop a couple pounds for a specific event, then yes, this may work


BUT&#8230;if you are looking at long-term weight loss goals and feeling better about yourself (physically, mentally, spiritually), this is only one tool in a hefty toolbox that you will need
And what goes into that toolbox is up to you.Ok, so what did I dislike about the book


Taking care of myself is hard work


Seriously
And while Swann doesn&#8217;t say that in the book, reading it is evident

So is living it
Does that count as a dislike? Ok, ok, my one true dislike is that I think the cover/book description is a bit of a misnomer
Because so many of us eat poorly, even when we think that we are making the right decisions, juice fasting, the right way, can have long-term benefits that go way beyond weight loss with the potential to optimize your health, boost your immune system and with all those nutrients, you will look better.Likes: I do like her writing style

She&#8217;s warm and engaging
And she does seek to cover the entire person

As I said in the beginning, this book is not simply about juicing


And completing a juice fast, for me, is less about weight loss and more about a system reboot and a boost to my immune system
And I will add this, if you check out the HuffPost article and do some of your own research on the benefits of fasts, you&#8217;ll find that it, when done right, has potential for anti-aging benefits.And if you do an internet search, you&#8217;ll find a couple different types of &#8220;fasting fads&#8221; right now


The original was the 4:3


Eat whatever you want for 4 days in a week and fast for 3 (kind of an every other day kind of thing)

The problem with that is you don&#8217;t maintain good eating habits on the days you aren&#8217;t juicing

The one in the HuffPost article is a 5:2
And it also cautions the need to learn and maintain better habits

Following Swann&#8217;s advice will set you on a better path
And for those who fear being hungry, not eating solid food for 3 days won&#8217;t kill you


Also, to point out, if you follow her plan, you will be consuming sufficient liquid that you won&#8217;t feel hungry.So who should consider this book? I think that if you are looking to make lifestyle changes to improve your health, then this is a good place to start


For those of us who have chronic health conditions, we may find that this book will be a helpful tool in our toolbox
Caregivers, those who work many hours, parents, students, basically anyone who needs to slow down and take some personal time (and yes, those looking to lose weight)


Note of caution, if you are on medication or have certain health conditions, then you may want to consult your doctor first
If for some reason that isn&#8217;t possible and you are on medication, consult your pharmacist (advice is free)
They can at least let you know if they think there may be potential for complications based on your particular disease and/or medication list.

$REVIEW.: With extensive non-profit experience ranging from general volunteerism, management of non-profit outreach and assistance programs as well as board member roles, The One Page Business Plan for Non-Profit Organizations is one of the best tools I've seen
While serving as board chairperson for the non profit organization Willow Center for Grieving Children, I was able to triple the income in three years by utilizing my own POWER Planning Process expertise coupled with the precision of One Page Business Plan techniques


We've recently hired our first ever, paid Executive Director who will receive a copy of The One Page Business Plan for Non-Profit Organizations to take our organization to greater levels of success

I have no doubt that the assessment and accountability tools will serve as a vital roadmap to future accomplishments.Horan includes solid techniques and tactics that effectively marry heart-based and business-minded volunteers and non-profit paid employees, alike


Plus, his one-page format is much more user friendly than the traditional SWOT analysis marketing/business plan that can be overwhelming to people who don't work with marketing and business planning on a regular basis.Put simply, the one-page format keeps the entire organization on the same page (no pun intended) so that goals and objectives are met.Lisa Manyon

It was just a good, wholesome saga of a young man struggling to make something of his life


I was surprised by my reaction because I'm mostly a blood and guts guy


When the second book gave me the same happy buzz,I knew there was something special about this story line


Now, we have reached the end of Ishmael's saga and I regret that there won't be any more

I feel as though I have lost an old friend.Thank you, Nathan, for a delightful series

$review_text.: Occasionally I find stated facts that do not match the reality as reported by countless people; never the less, the thought exercise presented within is well worth the read. I do not accept this as channeled, but rather an invention of a clever human mind. That being said, it is much more coherent and intelligent than most of the channeled or hypnosis recovered data that I have read. There are many points made which I wholly agree with. If humanity and planet Earth at the time of ET contact are to fair better than the indigenous cultures of the Americas did when encountering the technologically more advanced European cultures (as only one example), then this book is a vital read and step in our preparation. A thought provoking read. A more clear understanding of a potential scenario for our current condition than that which is presented in many books.

$review_text.: Leaving Carolina by Tamara Leigh is the first book in a series about Piper Wick. Piper is a member of the "leading" family in Pickwick, NC. Not that she's proud of that. The family has quite a few members who are a bit, um, unique. In her desire to separate herself from her family she drops the "Pick" from her last name of Pickwick and uses just Wick, works hard to lose her Southern drawl and works her way into a high-powered position as a public relations consultant and finds herself engaged to be engaged to a US Congressman.And then in the midst of her "new" life she gets a call from her Uncle's attorney. Uncle Obidiah has had some health issues and has decided to "mend his ways and make amends" for the family's misdeeds while he still has the chance.So Piper returns to Pickwick to put out the fires and save the family name and fortune.A wonderful cast of characters awaits her - Uncle Obe, attorney Artemis, garden Axel, cousin Maggie, her daughter Devyn, Luc, Bart.What follows is romance, revelations, and redemption. It's small town life with close family at it's best. Ms. Leigh writes the characters so well that you feel like you could walk out your front door and meet one of them on the street.And the best news of all is that it is a series. I can't wait for the next book so I can go back to Pickwick, NC and catch up with my newest friends.

$REVIEW.: A sweet conclusion...After reading Remember When 2, which ended on a cliffhanger, I was dying to read this book and get the so anticipated happy ending that Layla and Trip's story deserve. And I got it!Their story has been a tough one with the many years wasted, the misunderstandings, regrets, and longing for a future together. That's why in Remember When 3 when they reunite again by a tragic occurrence (after four years following the ending of Remember When 2) Layla and Trip decide to not waist any more time and finally fight for their love.The wittiness and banters between them continued in this book and they were funnier than ever! I really enjoyed all their interactions aside from being so hilarious, they truly showed how perfect they were for each other. And that's what's so magical about this story, I think, because no matter the years, the time, or the struggles Layla and Trip were always soul mates and so meant to be together.However, they never thought that being in the relationship they always yearned for would be so challenging. Their past regrets, resentments, and choices get in their way again. Moreover, Trip's Hollywood world really puts their love and resistance to the test. But no relationship is easy so they'd have to learn to let go and and simply fight harder for each other.I loved Trip in this final book. He proved himself to Layla like never before with both words and actions. He was a total sexy Romeo in my book! I was so happy to see Layla more mature and determined this time which at the end it totally paid off.Now the ending I thought it was sweet and promising, it gave me the warm peace I needed. Now I know that Layla and Trip are finally happy and are going to be happier in their beautiful foreseeing future.This trilogy has really been for me about learning how to truly love someone, how to let go of the past, embrace the present, and celebrate the future. It was a beautiful and super funny series, I recommend it! :)

$review_text.: Revenge? Hate crime? Terrorist attack?Opening with murder by mail, Hand of Fate grips the reader in a quickly paced story that revolves around the death of radio talk show host, Jim Fate.  Three women, Prosecutor Allison, Special Agent Nicole and Crime Reporter Cassidy - previously united in Face of Betrayal - work together to unravel the mystery. But could one of them be holding back critical information?I confess to being skeptical of the endorsements on the cover. Pulse-pounding? Major twists? Delivers big? We'll see.I'm glad to report that it's true. Wiehl's second Triple Threat Novel does deliver big. From the first, I was never quite able to form an opinion on "Whodunit?" I would decide who had not done it, only to revise that opinion further into the story. With a well developed plot carried through with great writing, Hand of Fate definitely goes on the shelf to be read again. Highly recommended.I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review.

He continues to go through rough times, but does finally get some good things as well.The title of the book is definitely accurate and was not something I expected.  I wasn't sure about this series when I read the first chapter of the first book, but I assumed (correctly) that if I liked other P.S. Power books, I would like this one as well.  It certainly didn't disappoint.  I really loved this book and highly recommend it to others.If you liked other P.S. Power books, you should definitely give this series a try.

$REVIEW.: The &#34;suspense&#34; was contrived (every chapter ending on a supposed cliffhanger, then rather predictably resolved or explained approximately two chapters later), the dialogue ridiculously cliche, and the grammar within the narrative ATROCIOUS!  The author makes mistakes in subject-verb agreement (compound subjects need the plural verb!), in the use of compound personal pronouns, in the basic sentence structure (i.e., sentences should not end with 'at', or any other preposition, unless it's in the dialogue, perhaps), and in using an exceedingly passive (hence, not engaging) voice

 Note to author:  I volunteer to do a grammar check for you in the future, if you'd like


 You might be a good storyteller

 I don't know, however, because I was so distracted by the 4th grade level grammar that I couldn't really follow your story

$REVIEW.: I have been a huge fan of this series from day 1.  I thought the volumes were well written, character development were great and story line kept you hooked the entire time.  I have been patiently waiting for this last volume and see what would happen to Paul and Emily.  I have to say that the ending was good, but I will have to agree with other reviewers here.  The last volume could have been expanded on.  It seemed like while the other volumes had a lot of development, sequence of events, this last volume simply flew by and left me with a few unaswered questions and wanting to see more from this couple.Overall, this story was amazing.  I was completely emotionally invested in this couple.  I was happy for them, I felt their pain and their anguish.  It was a very emotional and romantic series.  I will definitely read it over and over.  It is a bittersweet moment for me, I loved that everything worked out in the end, but I am sad to see this series end.  I also wish this last volume would have been a bit longer and just as detailed as the previous volumes.  But it was definitely worth reading!  I can't wait to see what is next in store from Ms. Adams.

$review_text.: I'm new to J. Gunnar Grey's books, but this one was a top of my list.  I have a good friend who is a K9 Handler in the Air Force.  He's served in Iraq and the middles east more times than one could imagine.  He's always sharing pictures of his dogs, and when I saw SHAKEDOWN I knew I had to give this a try.First I was often spellbound by the descriptive style of writing.  I love authors who really try to perfect their craft, and well she does it.  At times I felt as if I was right there in the backdrop of this National Park.Gunnar clearly has done her homework or has some inside information because her writing style although fiction has many believable parts.  I never once came away saying this is just not believable.  That is very refreshing as you thumb through.  The story of this amazing dog Pojo and his new female owner is inspiring.  Although, they are both no longer in active duty in the armed forces they both still have some amazing skill sets.  During moments of crisis they both reley on training and experience to make a bad situation really good.  Sure, as in every book there are a few moments of some dry salty filler, but this book makes you feel warm and fuzzy but in an American Apple Pie kind of way.  I enjoy books that aren't over the top, and I also like books that give you some extra details at the end this earns high marks on both accounts.  Pojo the retired bomb sniffing dog, and his new owner a highly skilled electronic intelligence officer have an unusual start together, but in the end they would make their old units very proud. Shakedown was very well written, and fun too.
$SUMMARY.: Two Seasoned Veterans Get It done certainly a feel nice book!

$REVIEW.: I was given a copy by the author in exchange for an honest review.Characters: The two main characters are Allison, told in her point of view, and her best friend Delaney. They are both around 16 years old with average lives and attend high school in a small town in Ohio. Allison is very shy and closed off, and quick to assume the worst about people. This can be a little off-putting, but once I read about her parents, I could understand why she jumped to conclusions so quickly. With her witty remarks and impulsivity, I immediately took a great liking to Delaney that lasted through the entire novel. The other characters include Allison's mom, a typical, loving, stressed-out single mother, and 3 boys that go to Allison's high school: Ryan, Jeremy, and Nate. All of them seemed like cool, average high school guys except for Ryan. I shared Allison's viewpoint when she scorned him for treating his girlfriend so carelessly in the beginning.Plot: These 5 high school teens are part of The Elect, a group of people who inherited special talents such as mind-bending(called &#34;pushing&#34;), fire manipulation, and being able to see other's memories. Allison finds out she has all of these special powers plus more, which was evidently unheard of and dangerous since she didn't know how to control them. The book mostly tells about how Allison found out about her powers and how she copes with having them, until she loses control and must face the consequences of unleashing too much power at once. The events flowed smoothly and the plot remained interesting throughout the entire novel. I was surprised and heartbroken about the ending, but there is a sequel so I'm hoping my spirits will be lifted after reading that.Writing: Todd has a way with words, to put it simply. The descriptions, sentence structure, and plot development are on point. The novel caught and kept my attention from beginning to end. Her characters were likeable and easily related to, with believable flaws and quirks. With paranormal, the ideas come completely from the author's mind and sometimes aren't conveyed well enough to make sense. There was no such issue in this novel. The complexity of The Elect was explained clearly and easily understood.I would absolutely recommend this to any lover of YA novels, paranormal or contemporary. The paranormal element stood out but there were enough realistic situations to make the whole story believable. All in all, a well-written, interesting read.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed Plan B.It was a very straight forward story line.Where you know the heartbreak is imminent, still you keep reading hoping for the best.Danny, I absolutely love. His humor, his wit, flamboyant personality and that knowing who he is and not risking it for the sake of anyone.The falling in love with the straight guy, has been done over and over, so I think is Danny's attitude what's makes this book different.He absolutely rocks his fem side, another reason to love him.Insert Lance, the alpha male, jock extraordinaire and you have a great mix of UST and angst that will keep you hoping for either great declarations of love or someone to kick his ass.Sweet, funny, sexy...what else can you ask for?

$REVIEW.: Materials covered in the book are what can be found on the internet. Was very unimpressed with the book. I'm really not sure how it got such good reviews. My OBGYN told me to stop doing a couple of the things that were mentioned in this book (like peroxide douching). The author does go on a trip about not douching, but then recommends hydrogen peroxide and water douche for symptom relief. So, it's a little confusing. The take probiotics talk and the cut out bad fats and sugars are a given. Like I said, nothing special contained here!As far as the writting style:It was easy to read and it was a short book.

$review_text.: A sequel to Lemon Tart, this is the second in the Sadie Hoffmiller Culinary Mystery series. And, this novel is just as much fun! Sadie Hoffmiller returns and manages to find death and mayhem in upper crust England.Sadie and her daughter Breanna are off to visit England with Breanna's boyfriend, Liam, who is heir to an English title and a fancy English estate, complete with servants and a dead body in the living room.The body disappears, the staff have secrets and the British police are inept. In true Hoffmiller fashion, Sadie decides that she is better equipped to find the murderer than any British inspectors. And if she can learn how to make crumpets along the way, so much the better!Like Lemon Tart, this one is laugh out loud funny in places. Sadie is funny and forthright and determined to find out the truth. Like an English Trifle dessert, she uncovers layer after layer of secrets as she works her way through the manor, the staff, Liam's family history and the kitchen!A fun, easy read, Josi has also included lots of fun recipes, including some authentic English ones. While I had a hard time following all the details of how titles are passed on, and who was who, it didn't detract from the story at all. Definitely recommended!

$REVIEW.: The fourth installment in the Dragon Lords series centers around Pia Korbin and Zoran of Draig.  Pia is an assassin with burns covering most of her body.  Forced on the run for killing in self defense, she goes to the Galaxy Brides Corporation for free surgery in exchange for being a bride.  After intensive surgery that removes her scars she participates in the Breeding Festival on planet Qurilixen where women are few and warrior men abound.  She is chosen as a bride by Zoran of Draig, the second son of the King and Captain of the guard.This has been my favorite couple to this point.  I loved how Pia is so humble about her appearance to the point she vehemently denies being attractive (although that did get a little old after 200 pages of people telling her she was attractive but I do understand her perspective).  She is very self assured in her combat skills but she feels useless to Zoran because he doesn't seem to value her skills or opinion.  Also, Zoran is so ready to lay the world at Pia's feet but she is so unsure of herself and Zoran that she doesn't trust her feelings for him and constantly pushes him away.This book has some really great sexual tension and verbal sparring between the main characters.  I really enjoyed seeing how Pia and Zoran circled each other before finally opening up their feelings.As with the other books in the series, it follows the same series of events leading to the conclusion, however, we are again given a new perspective. We also get a little epilogue at the end to catch up with all four brothers and their wives.

$REVIEW.: The advertising said it was built on following logical arguments, then taking them out to the extreme ending Protestant claims would end up at. I love a good logical argument. Sadly, it didn't have many.Instead, a pro-Catholic view was stated, unexamined, to start all arguments. for example, the papacy and church councils.It was assumed that because Peter was a bishop in Rome that all popes were the head of the church. Not true. Rome didn't become head of anything outside the city limits until the Western Roman Empire fell apart (the Eastern stayed intact until the Muslim invasion). And actually took over in several centuries. Rome in fact is still not in charge of much in the old Eastern Empire.None of the 7 first Ecumenical Councils were called by a pope, and some were ignored at the time, not even sending a papal representative, all were however 'ratified' later.I quit less than halfway through the book, as it was so blatantly one sided. The author really needs, like most Americans educated after the 50's, to take a course in logic. Oh, and one in general church history, not single denominational history.

$review_text.: I wasn't sure what to expect with this book but was intrigued by the title so I gave it try - I mean you can't go wrong with a $0.99 price point! Honestly, I was really surprised with the cogent and compelling content - it was like a pocket version of Neal Stephenson's "Snow Crash" about cryptography, science and philosophy - only this book was not fiction.Author Blaine Pratt's book builds a provocative argument around the power of language (using examples ranging from quantum physics to magic theory) to "infect" others with ideas.His tactical use of "verbal voodoo dolls" is a novel twist on the "straw man" argument taught in old school debate class. I could see him writing a slew of other titles on complementary rhetoric and logic topics. This was a good refresh on the dying art of argumentation.

(Shrugs) Definitely not thought provoking seeing as the only thought that came to mind when reading was "isn't this the plot of 9 1/2 Weeks?" **SPOILER COMING** This story should have ended like the movie, her growing a pair and walking away, having realized that he was one martini short of a party and relationships need more than sexual dominance in the bedroom to make them work. A lot of repetitive dialogue and question asking had me skimming through sex scenes.

$review_text.: In this Regency love story that is set in the countryside, instead of London, we meet Lady Lissa, who has just entered society after her year of mourning her father's death, only to be beset by nearly every eligible  bachelor of London's high society, who have all come to her Derbyshire doorstep. Sure that they are more interested in her inheritance than in her, Lady Lissa refuses all suitors. However, Lord Langford is more persistent, claiming suit by fastening a locket around her neck. He tells her that if she does not return the necklace by the end of the summer season, he will know she has accepted his suit.Lissa is not one bit interested in marrying anyone. She prefers spending her time sketching insects and other wildlife along the Dove river, and comes up with a plan to create the illusion that she has had a liaison with her neighbor, the infamous and reclusive Lord Wylde. If she connects her name to a man that polite society has labeled a heartless and cruel man, perhaps the other suitors will tuck tail and run.Of course the plan backfires. If it worked perfectly right away, there would be no story. What neither Lissa or Gabriel Gordon, the Sixth Earl of Wylde, considers is that they could possibly fall in love. Nor does Lissa know just how troublesome Lord Langford is going to be, especially since she is not able to return the necklace in a timely manner.The characters are well-defined and very likeable people. Well, except for Langford. I truly enjoyed them all, including the delightful, gossipy Tilley. Aunt Pru, who loves and supports her niece, and the charming boy, Harry, son of Lord Wylde.Being a nature lover myself, I really enjoyed the scenes by the river and all the details about fly fishing, as Lord Wylde attempts to catch the trout that swallowed the necklace after it fell into the river. The narrative was so well done; it was like the reader could be there with the swarms of insects and hear the rush of the water over rocks. It was in those scenes that the characters really came to life, and of course, the tension between Wylde and Lissa was kept pulled very tightly.For me, there were some problems with the plotting toward the end. I don't want to give anything away, so I can't detail what those problems were, but some incidents and some character behaviors seemed to be forced in order to fit a plot twist. The final resolution, however, was the perfect happy-ever-after, and getting to there from the beginning is an enjoyable read.

$REVIEW.: This young lady brutally murdered by an Israeli soldier, was very aware of what was truly going on in "The Palestinian Holocaust" that still is ongoing today. This book is a book of a true "American Hero." Her heroic death must not be in vain, but give courage to all to stand up to the racist atrocities being perpetrated in the world today. The brutal savagery and humiliation against the women, children and men of Palestine is one such, present day "Holocaust." Rachel Corrie had incredible foresight for someone so young. Her cause is now proven and backed by some of the greatest human beings and scholars on this earth: Former President Jimmy Carter has gotten the same message Rachel was getting out to the world in his present best-seller: "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." In another new best-seller "THE ISRAEL LOBBY, AND U.S. FOREIGN POLICY," by John J. Mearsheimer (of U. of Chicago) and Stephan M. Walt (Harvard), clearly shared young Rachel's view that the savage and horrific treatment of the Palestinian People and "their" lands, was not good for Palestinians, Israeli's, and Especially for America's Safety and Reputation to the World. The list seems endless, especially today, proving and backing Rachel's heroic mission. May she rest in peace. Her parents must be so proud that Rachel tried to help the oppressed and brutally occupied people of Palestine. Rachel Corrie, be proud as your message of justice is being carried on by the great authors mentioned and many more.Just something to think about readers: Be careful or take great caution with amateur reviews that try to distort Rachel's pure and humane message. Whose words do you give more weight to, a reckless, insensitive, amateur reviewer, or some of the notable icons and scholars mentioned. Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion,(that's what makes AMAZON the best) but some spend years researching specialty topics and are more up to speed - weigh everything. Do Former President, and probably todays greatest humanitarian, Jimmy Carter's words have weight and substance? What about other great and acclaimed scholars such as Professor John J. Mearsheimer, who is the Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science and the co-director of the Program on International Security Policy at the Univ. of Chicago. Add, Professor Stephen M. Walt, who is the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of International Affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Who do you believe? I leave that rhetorical question to you.Rachel Corrie and her beautiful messages in her writings, this book, and her heroic and tragic death keep her lagacy and message of justice alive. Now, more than ever, notable people and scholarly authors are writing an array of necessary books supporting Rachels cause and, important message. A message that, finally, is getting to Americans,i.e., The horrific plight of the Palestinian peoples. Rachel, the world will not forget that you died for the justice of the Palestinians. Rachel's life should be a academic course in and of itself. Rachel was a true martyr. Read Rachel and be inspired and moved forever....

These days it can be touch and go for what you are going to get when it comes to the writing. Normally in my reviews I concentrate only on the story, but I think it's worth mentioning when the writing is good.Another thing I liked about this story is that it was that you are right there with Kyle in not knowing who to trust or what is real. In many books that you read, you will know what is going on even when the main character does not. This story also has tons of room to be continued and I, for one, am very anxious to see what happens to Kyle next.Michelle L.

$REVIEW.: Ten years ago, the aliens arrived and started bringing benefits to mankind.  But one man has felt they were silent colonial invaders.  He wrote a book about it and has been labeled crazy.  His nephew, Hoichi, thinks he could still be right, but has had to bear the brunt of bullies (and is now an excellent fighter).But on the tenth anniversary of the alien arrival, the aliens make their move.  They almost immediately destroy the UN forces and take control of the globe.  Hoichi has been selected by his uncle to be a hero.  He is to be the pilot for a super, giant robot.An excellent story that unfolds nicely.  Hoichi is a good hero character and at first really gets into his role.  But the power he wields can cause collateral damage and he begins to have doubts.One of the more intelligent Mecca stories out there.  Good characters and character development joined the intricate plot and background makes for a very enjoyable story.

$review_text.: Dan DeCarlo's Jetta comic book, which ran for three issues, first appeared in 1952. It takes place in 2052, when there's "a new kind of teen-age talk". It's everything good about Archie comics shot into the future, combining the best features of '50s comic art: the stylized design, teen slang, and zany slapstick. Jetta is the cosmic cousin of Betty and Veronica, and Arky's space ship has "Atom and Eve" doodled on it, not unlike Archie's slogan-scrawled jalopy. The big news is who's taking Jetta or Hilaria to the Prom at Neutron High School, not unlike the sock hop at Riverdale. Jetta, "Teen-Age Sweetheart of the 21st Century" which began at issue #5 (a ploy to suggest a track record for new comic titles) and ran through issue #7, was published by Standard Comics (Pine's).With such a winning formula, no wonder Archie's artists spun off so many likable teen tales, including Sabrina, Josie, and my favorite, Archie's Mad House (later called Mad House). I wouldn't be surprised if DeCarlo did those also, because he did Sabrina comics, and she became a regular in the retooled Mad House title starting in the '60s. Despite the rarity of this comic trio, one might yet find the price a bit steep, but this is a Craig Yoe book, which means that's only the beginning.Besides the three full color comic books in this 115 page, full-color, (about) 9 X 12 inch hardback coffee table book, there's a twelve page introduction (more or less, depending if you count the art), and 37 pin-ups of Jetta in a myriad of diverse styles by a roster of contemporary artists. This would not attract me to the book, as I am not a fan of the constant revisioning of comic and cartoon characters: I don't think there should be a live-action Popeye or a CGI Garfield merely because some studio has bought the property; I would not be a fan of a reimaged Jetta comic book, for instance, merely because the original Dan DeCarlo ones are so amazingly great. To give another example, I don't think the new Dan Dare comics have anything on Frank Hampson's originals, and see no reason to make new ones.That said, this is volume one in "The Good Girl Art Library" from IDW/ Yoe Books. The pin-ups are meant to be viewed in a light-hearted way as part of the '50s culture, as opposed to the Playboy-style nudes also prevalent at the time. The phrase was Don DeCarlo's, and I think of the sort of "pin-up" art associated with Vargas, Frazetta, and Vaughn Bode. The pin-ups are in three sections, dropped in between the three comic books. I think the book remains OK for kids who read Archie comics, and as I have had cause to say many times before, cheers to Craig Yoe, who is doing for comics what Jerry Beck is doing for animation: making really great stuff almost as available and affordable a half century later as when it first appeared. As Jetta would say, "Now we're cooking with super-atomic radiation!"

$review_text.: I like medical thrillers and I like conspiracy theories.  This book looked like a perfect for for me.  All in all, the story was not a bad concept although not all that original an idea.  The writing style, grammatical errors and misspellings stopped me from really enjoying the book. A little editing or at least proof reading would have gone a long way.  The writing was really at a much lower level than most authors I have read, even the free ones on Amazon.  The sentences were all very simple sentences that did little to paint a scene or develop a character.  To simply call a villain "The Mexican" or "The Albino" and do little beyond that for development leaves a lot to be desired.Although the story idea was good enough, it was quite predictable with only one twist that I can think of.  At least it was free.

$review_text.: Jen, the "h" is foul mouthed, loud, gets in your business because she loves you and knows better...and these are the best qualities for this character as she fills out the role of strong female character perfectly! Bing's character was equally as awesome. I normally don't like way cocky men, but Bing just totally pulled it off with his hilarious descriptions of himself whenever talking to Jen. I really liked the first book, Never Forget, but whereas the first book was uber sweet, this book was downright crass (in a great way if you aren't easily offended by profanity), had lots of awesome sex, had me practically rolling on the floor LMAO and had an awesome HEA.I will say aside from the usual grammatical errors, which I can overlook from this author because I really loved her writing style, but one part sort of irked me when they had their hardship 2/3 of the way through the book. A bit of a spoiler, but I'll try to minimize it as much as possible. There was a moment early on when you knew they would be presented with this "situation" caused by someone else (similar to many YA novels), then there was nothing more at least that the heroin was aware of at that 2/3 of the way mark. The hero is caught in a compromising position which the heroin could totally see and admitted that he WAS put in this compromising position and that caused her to flee complaining she couldn't do it anymore. There could have been more angst leading up to this where the three parties were concerned because it came out of left field and had me saying "what just happened." Other than that, awesome read and I reallllly liked this book!

The chemistry between Grace and Nick was amusing, hot, exasperating and thoroughly enjoyable.  The dogs added so much fun and personality to the story that I can easily see dog lovers going for this book in a big way. The "investigation" kept me guessing and the situations Grace managed to land herself in kept the story interesting and engaging.  My favorite character was dear, crazy Aunt Beth.

$REVIEW.: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.A Major Seduction by Marie Harte was a sweet story about finally winning the love you have been wanting for years. Maria Thompson has been in love with Major Mike Cava since she was a child. There is just one big problem &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t feel the same about her.Mike is her best friend&#8217;s older brother so Maria has grown up as a part of the Cava family. Mike sees Maria has another little sister and is oblivious to her longing. That is until now. It&#8217;s been two years since he has last seen Maria and she has grown up beautifully. Mike begins to look at her in a different way but he worries that it may be too late.Maria is so excited to have Mike home but realizes that her past attempts at throwing herself at him just didn&#8217;t work. So she tries a different strategy and pretends to no longer be interested in being more than friends. When it begins to work, the two embark on a relationship that is full of highs and lows.Ms. Harte included a lot of humor in this book and I found myself laughing out loud as Mike tried to figure out what was going on. The more confused Mike was, the more I giggled. I loved seeing how excited Maria was when she finally won him over.A Major Seduction had it all &#8211; drama, humor, passion and more. Ms. Harte ensured her characters&#8217; believability by making them human and made mistakes that I would expect from a newly formed couple.  The story flows so naturally that you will be done reading before you realize it. It&#8217;s a great way to pass an afternoon.

And with "Turn Your Content into a Book in Only 3 Days," she validates her book premise by practicing what she preaches. Kristen is a voice of integrity in the publishing realm. She not only talks the talk, she walks the walk.She leads you step-by-step through the process she herself used, plus offers a balanced view of traditional vs vanity vs indie publishing, so you can make an informed choice about how the route you want to take to publication.Up to the challenge yourself? Kristen is throwing down the gauntlet. Will you accept? Buy the book. Read the book. Join the challenge. Write a book in 3 days. Get published. Voila!If you have a hard drive full of content (video, audio, blog posts, articles, books) and what writer doesn't these days, then this book is for you.

However, its turning to be a bit  of a love story which is just not my thing, but I can't stop reading now.

$review_text.: 4.5 stars.I consider Tim Curran to be among the best at writing compelling, novella-length horror


 He is able to give us the insight we need to get right into the midst of the action, without bombarding us with hundreds of extra pages of essentially trivial information.In Leviathan, we have Johnny Horowitz, a much-detested member of the paparazzi known for his compromising photos of celebrities
 The characterization here is completely believable

 Johnny harbors no illusions about his status or self-worth
 He does, however, have a sense of a story brewing as he passes by a deserted beach in a small tourist town, just before a hurricane is about to strike
 Relying on his instinct, he uncovers MUCH more than he had ever expected


 At one point, an inner dialog that he has within his own mind about settling down and making a "decent" living catering to tourists, wars with his visions of greed and controversy--that of being known for something truly remarkable
 Curran sets this up so well, that you can actually FEEL the conversation coursing through his brain.Enter the monsters--of course

 And this is Curran at his finest
 He is able to conjure up images of creatures that most of us would never think to envision


 This story has everything I've come to expect  in a well-written novella:  characterization, atmosphere of dread that just keeps on building, and your vicious threat to humanity.Recommended!


$review_summary.: Curran is a master at novella-length horror!

$REVIEW.: "What's A Disorganized Person To Do?" by Stacey Platt has a subtitle of "317 Ideas, Tips, Projects, and Lists to Unclutter Your Home and Streamline Your Life."  That's pretty much exactly what this book is, a book of tips, ideas and strategies to organize your home, and thus your life.  The book is easy to read and is well organized (I would hope so!) to find the areas you need help with.  It can be a good book to quickly read through once, and then use as a reference when you need help with certain areas of your home.There is a short introduction to the book, and then a section on general principles. These principles are shared, like everything in this book, with short tips or lessons.  Things such as Three habits of highly organized people (Consume consciously, spend your clutter, and live within your space means), lessons from the silverware drawer (forks kept with forks, single consistent home, etc.), and ten steps to organizing anything, which I won't list here.The book then goes into sections regarding each area of a person's home.  These include: The entry, kitchen, bedrooms and closets, bathrooms, living rooms and dens, home office, utility and storage areas, kid clutter, and finally a section on trips and moving.  None of the tips are that long or complicated, and the book has many photographs of well organized areas of the home to motivate you with your organizing.  Some tips, like how to fold a fitted sheet are accompanied by photographs to teach you the method.There are 267 topics in the book.  I'm guessing the 317 from the title is because some of the tips contain more than one.  Such as topic 4 mentioned above that includes ten steps to organizing anything.  Regardless of the number, the book is packed full of tips, suggestions and ideas on organizing.  Most likely, you won't like or use them all.  However, I bet you do find things in this book that can help you become more organized.  It's an easy to read book and an attractive one with the layout and quality photographs.  (Even though some remind me of some model home in some showcase and not one that is actually lived in)There are many books on organizing and getting rid of clutter.  Some of my favorites are those by Don Aslett, just because I like his style of writing and attitude about the topic.  I think this book by Stacey Platt is good for those that need some tips and suggestions on getting organized.  It does not have the motivation that Aslett's books have, but that is his style.  I'd recommend this as a good reference for organizational tips and suggestions.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.

$review_text.: The middle of the road rating on this book is not a reflection on the author, who is obviously an incredibly smart and thoughtful man and a very interesting writer, but on the fact that I am very obviously not the target audience for this book and am honestly not sure how this book would rate when compared to others written in a smiliar vein.That said, this is the heaviest 150 page book I've ever opened. By page 24 my list of people and words to double check on included Gerard Manly Hopkins, Columbanas, John Scotus Eriugena, Meister Eckhart, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Julian of Norwich, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Heraclitus, pantheism, panentheism, scotean sacramental Incarnation and Jansenism and I was overwhelmed by the depth to which Raymo has considered his religious and scientific beliefs. If you know any of these, or are that type of contemplative thinker, this might be the book for you.In all fairness, although the book opened quite intimidatingly, by chapter four I was getting at least the gist of the author's point. Each chapter builds on those before it giving the book a cohesiveness however they also stand alone in a broad sense as each one brings to the front an aspect of the science vs. religion controversy that adds to the difficulties we have as humans, and biological creatures, in marrying the two. Raymo's point, overall, seems to be that he is willing to give both credence and to take the best of both to create a whole new world order of religious naturalism.I have to say that to some extent, I think I am on board.Just for arguments sake, I'd again like to share with you a bit of the writing style. This sentence occurs fairly late in the book (after I thought I'd figured out how to get through without a dictionary and Wikipedia by my side). It doesn't matter what the documents are but for clarity's sake Raymo is referring to Pascendi Dominici Gregis and Syllabus Condemning the Errors of the Modernists (yeah, I never heard of 'em either)."The oppressive influence of these documents, together with the stultifying doctrine of papal infallibility promulgated in 1870, rendered serious discussion of the intrinsic conflict of science and Catholic faith-based cosmology mute throughout the twentieth century."If you get this on the first read, this is DEFINITELY the book for you.Also to Raymo's credit (and so that I don't sound like an utter and totally un-introspective idiot) When God is Gone Everything is Holy has had me thinking quite a bit and as a jumping off point for me, it will pave the way for further research into the ideas he has presented.If you are at all interested in modern thinking about the dichotomies of our daily literal lives and our inner spiritual ones, give this book a look - just don't expect it to be light reading.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this story. The author's take on werewolves was fascinating and complex but extremely easy to read.  I picked it up intending to read for a short time and found myself finishing the book before I knew it!15 year old Bryn has been adopted by Callum the alpha of the werewolf pack. But Bryn is not a werewolf; she is 1 of only 2 humans in the pack.  And as such she has been is at a disadvantage in strength and senses.  As a result Callum has pushed Bryn to train harder to protect herself.  Although no one in the pack would dare hurt her of else incur the wrath of Callum.  Callus wants Bryn to be as safe as possible because many the werewolves merely tolerate her.  And some hate her.  But Bryn is no mousy human being.  Liveing with werewolves has taught he to stand up against them or be overwhelmed.  So Bryn revels/lives for the small skirmishes of power between Callum and the other werewolves.  For now her life has settled into school and trying to carve a place for herself that is separate from the rest of the wolves.But all of this changes when a sudden tension in the pack makes Bryn curious.  She is now under curfew a strict curfew and it seems everyone knows what this big secret is except her.  Bryn is determined to find out what it is.  As she deviously tricks her way in to Callum's stronghold she finds a caged teenager about her age.  His name is Chase and he is a werewolf.  But what is special about him is that he has been bitten!  Humans are not supposed to be able to change into werewolves from a bite because the change is too traumatic for their system to heal.  Bryn wants to know more about him and why she can't be around him.  She understands he is dangerous since he is newly turned but Bryn feel the werewolves are hiding something more important about him from her.And Bryn is shocked to discover that Chase was bitten by the same werewolf that murdered her family.  The same werewolf that she thought was dead...I loved the fresh and edgy feel the book.  This was a quick read that drew me in immediately.  The story is clever and the author slowly reveals secrets that make it very exciting.  I only planned to read a bit and couldn't stop myself from finishing it!  Although events in the story are dramatic the characters and their gutsy courage never make it feel dark or depressing even in the more challenging circumstance.The heroine is not the whiny type and although she is human she makes up for her lack of 'super' abilities by having a super attitude that was a pleasure to read.  Bryn was a fun and spunky character and I enjoyed her unique views and straightforward and no nonsense attitude.  Bryn was surprisingly mature and never became whiny or had the `why me?' moments.  She just charged forward and got things done.  I loved her determination and grit and I think it would be hard not to like Bryn.Raised by Wolves is a solid and fascinating take on werewolves.  Most werewolf stories revolve around lone werewolves but because Bryn is part of a pack the complexity and hierarchy of the werewolf society was fascinating to read.  I will certainly looking forward to her next (?) book in the series.I was surprised at how quickly I was able to finish this book. The writing is very clear and easy to read but the twists in the plot make it hard to put down.  An irresistible combination!!  Spunky and fascinating heroine devious plot and clear writing made this book one I really enjoyed!

$REVIEW.: Teen suicide is one of those topics that we all want to avoid discussing, but the statistics seem to be increasing with time.  Melody Carlson has written an honest portrayal of teen thoughts, feelings, and circumstances that lead teens to make this horrific and permanent decision.  Though it is fiction, it also addresses the ways that families, friends and even schools can intervene.  Carlson is an excellent YA author.  She tackles the issues that are pertinent to teens and shows them ways that they can find God in the midst of their struggles.  I highly recommend her books for the YA reader and even for parents or teachers who are wanting to see the issues from the perspective of their teens.

I love reading and I want to love everything but everyone has a different opinion on what they like in a book
I am a simple kind of person


I want romance and I want an easy read where I can sit back, relax and let the words just flow through my brain

I read because I love it and to relax!!I was asked by Elle to read her book, Only Love, for an honest review and I agreed without hesitation because it looked like something that would interest me
And the plot did interest me at first

It is a love triangle with all kinds of crazy twists to it but because of writing preferences, I unfortunately could not connect with the characters and could not enjoy reading it :( She writes very descriptive and wordy and for those who like that, this is the book for you!!! I do not want my opinions to sway anyone from this story at all

$REVIEW.: This novel provides a delicious, racy, personality-filled read, and offers another take on this infamous prostitute-turned-empress.Penned by a monk, Fabianus, who is a childhood friend of Theodora's, the novel is split between covering her life, from circus child to prostitute to consort of the Emperor; and detailing how Justinian, the son of a pig herder from a rural province, became Emperor.The narrative style is wonderfully playfully: our scribe, Fabianus, shares his apprehensions in doing justice to Theodora's story (and the ways she still affects him); Theodora is brassy and bold and bombastic, always in motion, theatrical.  The cadre of men involved with the Emperor are selfish and weak-willed or clever and grasping.  There's drama in spades, ranging from court intrigue to the various tribulations Theodora faces on her way to becoming Justinian's beloved.The story shifts from the present -- Theodora telling her story to Fabianus -- to the past, as Fabianus fills in the empty spaces to help the reader along.  Sometimes this can be jarring and disruptive, but in this case, I found the shifts smooth and unobtrusive, and they helped build up tension.The historical landscape is effectively evoked -- Strickland's experience in writing about art and architecture can be seen in the descriptions of things -- and I loved every grimy, grandiose minute in 6th century Constantinople.

$REVIEW.: I was fortunate enough to read Steven's Twelve Months book last year of which I loved and included in my top 10 reads of 2012. With that being the case, I was so excited to hear that he had written another book.Goodnight, Brian is all about a family, in particular a Grandmothers love for a young boy that didn't have the perfect `normal' start in life. The book followed the unconditional love that Grandma (Mama) had for the boy and how she would not rest until she helped him to his fulfil his potential whilst other said there was no chance.Steven's written style is very easy to read and enjoy. He fills his characters with huge amounts of emotion and therefore you connect with them with ease. Always amazing family connections and depth to his leads.A very good story which I enjoyed but I felt the frequent religious references were a little too much for me. Whilst many were totally appropriate to the American/Italian family and theme of the book I would have loved the story a little more with fewer included (but that is just personal preference).

$review_text.: Working for Heat features three nano short stories about the oddities of the office environment.The first story is about Jenny who has too much work to do since no one else seems to do any.  But, the hospital she works for needs to cut a position.  Since Jenny has the cheapest severance package, she's the one to go.  Of the three stories, I enjoyed this one the most because I found it the most realistic and somewhat comical, in a morbid way.The next story features Sean and his creative desperation to either 1) get a raise, or 2) get fired.  Unfortunately, I found Sean's prank so unbelievable and silly that I did not like it.The last nano short is about the OCD Peter and his first day as an intern at Lloyd, Osmond, and Lockwood.  For a six-page story, Peter's character has some dimension since his obsessive/compulsive nature is detailed.  Although I personally did not care of Peter's story, I can appreciate the author's satiric plot about the life of an intern.Generally, I did not like Working for Heat mainly because the stories are a bit too silly for my personal taste, which I do not hold that against the book.  Unfortunately, I would be remiss to not discuss the horrific editing.  I felt the entire book read like a draft with the inordinate amount of incorrect punctuation - at least every page, if not more - and the lack of content editing/clarification.  Hence, my lasting impression is that this book lacks professional editing, which I believe is a grave mistake by any self-publishing author.  Honestly, I would have given this anthology a B, but cannot because of the editing issues.BookingIt Grade:  D

$REVIEW.: No doubt about it
Saddam Hussein is one of the major problem in the middle east.This book is written by Unscom's Head Richard Butler
It shows how the Iraqi Govermnet lies or refuses to coperate with the UN resolutions


If they had, then the sanctions would have been lifted many years ago
Hence as sad as it is
Saddam bears heavy responsibility for the suffering of his own people.The book tragicaly tells us how Saddam was able to divide the UN on the sanction issues, with Russia France and China on one side wanting to end the sanctions (and to have economic relationship and to have there own interests) and the US and UK on the other who wants the sanctions to be in place until UNSCOM does it job (However US and UK action's would seem "genocidle" which the State run Iraqi Media plays over and over).The book also tell's us of the author's fustrations in dealing with the Iraqi Goverment
He was also villified to the Extreme by the Iraqi media that even the Russian Ambassador believed in the hype

As a result of this and many other things
UNSCOM was forced to leave in December 1998 and to this day never returned.As the situaton unfolds in the Middle East (Israel and Palestinian territory)
Saddam is indeed fueling the conflict by giving money to Families of suicide bombers (Hence encouraging more violence on both sides)

He is doing it so that the US cannot take him out (the US is tied up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).Enjoy reading this book
It will give you a lot of insight.

$REVIEW.: Eevie Lawson is living on her own for the first time. She has has to put her own life on hold to help her mother and brothers during the years she should have been finishing college. She loves a good romance novel and wants nothing more than a healthy happy sex life and someone to love. Eevie doesn't have much real-life experience, but she knows that she is ready. Unfortunately, it can be tough to find someone who matches up to the perfect book boyfriends that live in her novels.Eevie is hard-working, smart, kind, and loyal. It is really tough to watch her go through some rough attempts at a relationship before finding one that is worth everything she has to offer. Her friends are a supportive and wonderful, and they are all deserving of the love and care they offer to each other. When Aidan enters the picture and Eevie realizes what sexual chemistry really feels like things start to get interesting. When Eevie and Aidan realize that they both have even more to offer each other besides an incredible physical connection, it is something fantastic to experience. These are characters that it is easy to care about and even though there are some serious challenges ahead, it is easy to see how they can get through anything together. I will be looking forward to the next book in this series!*A copy of this book was provided in exchange for an honest review

$REVIEW.: 3.5This was a pretty good read
I really liked some aspects of it--Marissa's family & friends, her work ethic, Wolf's self-inforced control issues, the writing

I especially liked the way Wolf's slightly crazed, desperate behaviour countered the traditional masculine role without making him feel wimpy and the fact that Chuck may not have gotten his comeuppance, but he didn't get off scott-free either if you look at the karma of his life


However some things irked me.Brandenburg doesn't seem to be bound by her own rules


One of the first things Marissa learns about being a Kundigerin is that she isn't allowed to talk about it

However, throughout the book she seems to speak fairly freely about it
Granted she avoids the actual word, but she still reveals herself on more than one occasion


Additionally, it is quite explicitly explained that females are Kundigerin and males are Secret Keepers, but Wolf seems to have Kundigerin powers of his own
Plus, since Marissa doesn't seem to know much about her abilities the reader doesn't know much and as a direct consequence there were times (the final confrontation for example) where I only had a hazy understanding of what actually happened.A more personalised dislike was the fact that I thought that the whole misunderstanding with the ex-girlfriend was pat and trite

I could have done without all of the resulting self-doubt


She knew how he felt about her, so why feel so insecure? And lastly, After the mystery wrapped up (a little too nicely if you ask me) and everyone who deserved saving was saved there were still several chapters of just plain mush

No romantic trope was missed


Wolf systematically worked through every 'awww' moment possible
So much for everything in moderation.Having laid my irritants on the table, let me reiterate that I enjoyed the read despite them


Brandenburg is a talented writer who sculpts believable characters that readers can easily relate to

I think the plot escaped the bounds of the story a little bit, but there is still a gem in here that is worth looking at.

$REVIEW.: I waited a bit to read this until after all the hype had died down, but did not read one single review
To be honest, everyone could hate it and that would not change my mind as I tend to always love Ms


Mead's books.The Golden Lily did not disappoint me in any way

I admit to being a bit confused at times, but that was because I didn't read Bloodlines again...I wanted to experience this book as I went along without thinking back to things that happened "last time".Sydney and Hermione are tied as my favorite brainiacs


While I found Sydney abrasive when we first met her in The Vampire Academy series, I have grown to love her and think she may be my favorite character of all.Sorry, Rose! I still love you, though.While the Dhampirs and Moroi aren't really the total focus of TGL, you still know what's going on with them at all times

Adrian captured my heart the very first time he was introduced and has never disappointed me


I did feel a bit bad for him at certain times, but he always bounced back thanks to Sydney.Dimitri is mentioned a lot in this book, which I also liked

He has long been a favorite character of mine since VA


Sonya, oh how happy I was to see her name!Okay, so really, I love nearly all the characters

I am so tempted to push aside my huge TBR pile and read the Vampire Academy books all over again, but I must stay strong and wait until my pile is decreased by at least four books.Fine, at least ten but not anymore than that!I expected the cliffhanger ending and even welcomed it
The ending of this book I LOVED
Maybe not Sydney's reaction, but what happened...*sigh*If you haven't read it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!GO! READ!

$REVIEW.: A shade, different realms at play, and a passion strong enough to risk eternal damnation for. That's what can be found within the pages of Tara S. Wood's The Shade.Wood does a beautiful job of setting up the world in which Everly dreams. The descriptions threw me right into the story running along side by side with the MC. I felt what she felt, I feared what she feared. The real world settings were also just as descriptive, painting a picture just as beautiful but still allowing the reader to feel there was a difference in mood between the dream realm and the real world realm. The third realm that shows up in this novella is just as well written. This is the one in which The Sandman and Cillian dwell. It's not a nice place.The passion The Shade, Cillian, has for the human Everly is what drives this story. While there are more aspects of this story than the romance, they aren't as played out for the reader to grasp onto. It's a non-stop journey through the different realms as Cillian attempts to work his way into Everly's world and Everly tries to figure out who this mysterious man of her dreams is.Don't worry, there's conflict worth reading about as well. Aside from Everly being utterly confused by the mysterious Cillian, the fear from her dreams reaches its way into her ever day life making it difficult for her to function. She's a writer. Even writers need some sleep to work better. I thoroughly enjoyed the reveal of what the embodiment of this fear was. And what takes place after that....well I can't tell that here.With the great settings and enjoyable characters, this book was a great read. The ending left me a little on edge, and it was great. I hope Tara plans on putting out some more novellas. She worked well in this short form of writing.

$REVIEW.: She's not your standard sleuth; a middle-aged woman with five daughters and a husband out of the picture, yet Nell had me gripped from the first page. Ilsa Evans is one of those rare writers who, with a few swift sure strokes, draws a person you feel you immediately know, like and are rooting for (Australian expression) from the word go. All the characters are in this book are perfect, Nell, her irascible mother Yen, her slightly smug and nosey sister Petra.....every person is instantly recognisable and enjoyable. I really like the way we are introduced to the characters' personalities through their actions. So many authors miss this very important point and simply tell the reader - this person is kind hearted, generous, stingy etc; a lazy writing style in my opinion.The storyline is a little far fetched but it's excellent escapism and I devoured it in one sitting. You know those books you enjoy so much you start checking how far through you are and are torn between racing through to the end and trying to slow down to make it last? This is one of those books. Yes the culprit is obvious fairly early on but I think Ilsa did that on purpose so the reader would enjoy the anticipation of Nell slowly coming to the same conclusion....Halfway through this book I came back to Amazon and pre-ordered the next book in the series. It arrived today and I'm about to sit down and get stuck in. Looking forward to lots more Nell books very soon. Thank you Ilsa.

$review_text.: "Losing you was the worst experience of my life and now I'm living it all over again. Except this time I'm not quitting. I love you too much."My heart broke for Danny and Liv at the end of Just Human. Since the book was narrated in alternating perspectives, I knew Danny had done nothing wrong. Liv just couldn't face her insecurities because of their past. I wanted to scream and shake her. Danny was amazing. I knew she was making a huge mistake and I wanted to tell her. But, alas, they split up, she went home and severed all communications. It was devastated. I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next installment of their story.This book picks up shortly after the end of Just Human. Liv still won't listen, won't admit she may have overreacted. Danny is broken. Liv is a mess. It's obvious how badly they need each other. Danny was making every effort to tell Liv what really happened that night, but she wasn't having any part of it. With a little intervention from fate and Liv's best friend Max, the two are put face-to-face again and Danny's determined to fix things for good this time. He's in this for the long haul.The first half of this book was frustrating to me. Liv was driving me up a wall. I understand she was hurt and scared to let Danny back in for fear of things going awry for the third time, but give a guy a break. His intentions were clear. It was obvious how much he loved her, how sorry he was for the misunderstand that she blew *totally* out of proportion and how badly he needed her back in his life."Like this tree, we stumbled and fell, but something so strong cannot be wiped out in one moment. I'm always rooted here with you and together we are too strong to fade away. I promise we will continue to grow together even if there are more storms to come."Danny is the king of the swoony grand gesture. There were some really special scenes in this book. I read a good portion of it with a big, goofy smile on my face. By the midpoint of the book, I was back to loving Liv like I did in the first. They grew as individuals and as a couple in this book. It felt real. Honest.Danny and Liv's friends Jen and Max play such a big part in this book, too. Without the help of their friends, I'm not sure what would have come of Danny and Liv. Whether it was support or a (not-so-gentle) kick in the pants, Jen and Max gave them what they needed. Everyone should have friends like them. I love when books focus nearly as much on the friendships as the romantic relationships. This book does it all -- and very well.If you're a fan of a new adult contemporary with a bit of angst, some drama, smoking hot sexy scenes and completely swoon-worthy love between two strong characters, this book is a must-read. There's something very satisfying about watching a couple you love finally get things right. There were a lot of bumps in the road for Danny and Liv, but this book was executed beautifully and left me completely satisfied.  I'm completely impressed with Kerry Heavens' writing and can't wait to read more.***I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.***

$review_text.: Have you ever had an author that just keeps get better and better the longer he/she writes?  Well Heather Rainier is one one of those authors that you can not miss one book or you will hate yourself.  This book is about Seth and Jayne (she is Grace cousin from Divine Grace) also you can go to Heather's website : [...] and see the 4th of July story in the Insider's Guide on how they meet.  This story has it all in it from tears to laugh out loud moments.  One thing I love about Heather Rainier books is that each story drags you into it from page one to the end.  This book is even more special because it involves a cross over with Cara Covington's "Love under 2 cowboys" (lusty, tx series).  Jayne has over come so much in her life that she decides to "seize the day" and go get a tatto and Seth is the best in the business so of course she has to walk into his life.

Jessica recently moved back to San Diego with her two children, her husband left her and she is emotionally messed up because of this


She doesn't want anything series so when she meets the hot cop Mick, she decides to have a post divorce fling

When things start to get series she has to decide if she is willing to open up and possibly be hurt again
Jessica was a smart, responsible, loving and a wonderful mother
Mick was a hot cop, who never let anyone get close
He always put the job first, when he meets Jessica his thinking begins to change


I liked the beginning of this book and the close friendship Jessica shares with Heather
I did want to see more interactions between Jessica and her other friends though
Jessica earned my respect when she decided not to mix her fling and her kids; she didn't want her kids to have another person leave them
I was disappointed when the relationship started to get series and Jessica still refused to let Mick interact with her kids

The sex scenes were mild/hot, a few of the scenes were more telling instead of showing

 I enjoyed the simplicity of this book, it was a straight forward love story.

$REVIEW.: The path to Heaven starts in Hell - or so Jared McTavish found out!Fighting for his country was never going to be easy, but it was Jared's life plan, so when he gets shot to bits and finds himself crippled and relying on others to tend his every need, he's not sure he wants to carry on with his miserable existence. Except through the darkness there is one small glimmer of light, Ninia, his strong, capable and completely alluring nurse. But what's a Dom to do when he's bedbound, has a life changing injury and isn't sure if he'll ever be able to go back into the BDSM scene and be the Master he was before?Roped is the start of a series, and I am certainly keen to read more. The writing is elegant despite the at times difficult subject matter, the characters believable and the sex scenes frequent and explosive. I enjoyed seeing how Jared and Ninia came together and how the title, Roped, was part of that fun. The growing love between the couple was tender without being sappy and Ninia's support of Jared the right balance of nurture without pandering or fussing. There was a slightly non-starter of a storyline with Jared's sister and I wonder if there is more about her in the subsequent books, I hope so!Roped is steamy and sultry, ticks all the boxes of an erotic romance and has some extra elements in it that makes it a real page-turning read. I would definitely recommend it to a friend who enjoys spicy reading material.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews

$REVIEW.: In "Are You Listening?" the author explains his beliefs about God. Placed in the Christian context and of Bible quotes, arguments for or against specific beliefs are developed respectfully, with courage and consideration. As evidenced by daily news, religion doesn't always come in this thoughtful and rational way. At the opposite end of the spectrum, cowards are asking the "Are You Listening?" question with a gun pointed to your head. Sadly, the gun happy are unlikely to pick up a copy of Carl's book ... but if reviews of Carl's book over the next hundred years moves just one of them to pick up a copy anyway, I say let's review like crazy. It's a great book for anyone looking to develop their spiritual muscle.

$REVIEW.: A great book.  Easy to read, passionately stated, intelligent, sympathetic and clear.I myself have a teenage son, and one of the difficulties I have is the lack of comfortable male role models, on TV or in modern fiction.  I'll be specific.  Before writing this review, I looked at the Amazon kindle ebook list of "Popular Fiction for Teens".  It's a horizontal display of covers of teen books that I found half-way down on the Teen and Young Adult section.  There were three screens of books listed, a total of 20 books.  On the first page, 8 of the 9 books were told from a female's perspective.  These nine included Sanctum, Angelfall, Kiss & Make Up, Vertigo, Kiss the Morning Star, Torn, The Good Braider, Summer Storm and (the last one listed) This Brave Balance, which focuses on a male protagonist.  It got better on the second page, where three of nine books were told from a male perspective.  On the third page, both books (Memento Nora and The Other Life) were both written about young women.  So, all in- 16 of 20 books on the Amazon list of Popular fiction for teens were from a female perspective.Dr. Smith, thanks so much for your book.  Amazon editors, I suggest you read it!

And probably you as well.I think A Paz should do a Wang follow up book and make it the size of ...oh ...say... a really, REALLY big Wang!  Yeah! A BIGGER Wang!!! With more ways even than 69. !!!All kidding aside, this is NOT a dirty book. It is simply a fun little book which is entertaining to read. You get to enjoy a number of innocuous double entendres. Nothing you would blanch at. And don't call me Blanch.Actually, the Wang computer has a very important place in computer history. I invite you not only to enjoy this cute and fun book and its photos, some of which are quite entertaining,  but also to look up the history of Wang online. Try using your...SEARCH ENGINE! Does that sound risque or is it just me at this point?  I am going to go around all day thinking of double meanings now.Thanks!!!, Mr. A Paz, for the fun! We could all use some of that right now!  :)Everyone: try this Wang oriented tale--it'll take you to YOUR happy place!
$SUMMARY.: We girls just would LOVE to have Wangs of our own, so this is the next best thing!

$review_text.: God bless you, Jim Rogan.  You were a profile in courage in so many ways in standing up for the truth and the Constitution in making Bill Clinton accountable for his disgraceful conduct that should have ended in his resignation or removal from office, and in the end unfairly paying the price for it.  What makes Rogan's book even more important is not just that he finally provides for the record a necessary corrective to the phony orthodox interpretation of the impeachment battle, he also makes us realize sadly that the Obama Administration has learned the same techniques from Clinton to cover up the same level of unethical conduct.  (1) Endless demonization of opponents and hack partisanship to discredit all legitimate areas of Congressional inquiry (2) Perpetual reliance on the liberal press to be cheerleaders who will not treat allegations seriously no matter what the evidence says (3) Depending also on feckless and spineless members of the GOP to give them cover.  I was the least surprised person for instance, to read of how in the end it was cowardly Senate Republicans like Trent Lott and Orrin Hatch who did as much to undermine the House GOP managers as the partisan Democrats.  If only there'd been a few Ted Cruz's back then!I can at least take comfort in one thing.  Had Bill Clinton resigned (as he should have), then Al Gore likely would have won the White House in 2000 with the power of incumbency (no, he did NOT win the actual election.  Enough with that phony story about the stolen election) and the idea of that flake in charge at the time of 9/11 (which was hatched under Clinton's watch, incidentally.  Clinton spent so much time lying about his misdeeds and smearing his opponents, and putting our trooops in harm's way by orderding a pointless attack on Iraq to purposefully stall the impeachment proceedings that he managed to totally miss where the real danger was) is too frightening to consider.  Given how ultimately things worked out better for the country in that respect despite the failure to make Bill Clinton accountable for his misdeeds, I can still have some hope that the same will hold true once we put the nightmare of this current President behind us.

$REVIEW.: Kind of an insubstantial book; I think it might not be worth the cover price, but the Amazon discount price is almost fair

 I got this book with specific questions in mind and I feel they have not been answered

 The authors presuppose a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader

 I would have liked to see more solid information on the theory and practice behind this particular branch of the Occult Arts

 The authors seem to be followers of the Chaos mentality of "use whatever works for you" which is fine, but somebody with my mentality needs some solid & trustworthy tradition to use as a starting point
 Most of the information in this book had a sort of "well DUH" quality that felt like I already knew it, but just hadn't thought of it that way ..
which is where this book's real (and only) value lies


 The authors have collected what little information they could scrape together into a single volume to remind you of all the little details you need to consider when creating an entity


 But they fall short when it comes to explaining just HOW to make your entity


 It seems that creating an entity is exactly like making a sigil, with a few extra steps, but several of the examples provided by the authors involved the use of an entity to do a job that might have been better accomplished with a sigil


 If there is indeed a difference between an entity and a sigil, then there's a choice to be made between the two
 This book contains no discussion of what criteria determine when to use which technique; this kind of information would be very useful.The writing style feels like an undergraduate college term paper:  easy to understand but hard to pay attention to


 The book is jam-packed with typographical errors; spell-checking is not the same as proofreading
 I lost count of how many times I encountered the correctly-spelled but completely WRONG word in a sentence
 These kinds of mistakes tend to distract from one's message

 After a while it got hard to take this book seriously.The final 1/3 of the book is filled with "appendices" that are short accounts of the authors' own workings with entities

 They are entertaining and instructive, but they only document the authors' successful experiments
 It may be embarrassing (no more so than at least one of the intimately candid accounts) but showing us a few of your failures, and WHY you think they didn't work, could also be very instructive to your readers


 These stories also illustrate another somewhat disturbing point; the authors' motivations seem to be rather (how should I put this?) _petty_, and their behavior reckless


 Sending a malicious entity to harry the tenants of a house where you used to live?  Creating an entity to help you avoid the legal consequences of your own actions?  What sort of behavior are we encouraging here?  These stories, coupled with the collegiate style of the writing, ooze an atmosphere of immaturity that absolutely does not encourage trust or confidence.In short, buy this book IF you already know what you're doing and you just need a handy checklist for entity creation

 If you're just starting out & trying to learn, I would advise you to stay away from this one

 Seek a better teacher


 There are other resources available.

It also has a section for drawing character props and how to place them in scenes with characters, and it even has manga symbols that are seen in manga books or tv shows to depict action, a must have book for any aspiring artist even tough it says how to draw manga.

$REVIEW.: Having a fairly decent command line knowledge, I didn't expect to learn much from this book.  I was definitely surprised by how well this book was written.  It is laid out in a simple, straight forward, and easy to understand way.Many of the O'Reilly books I have, or have read, always make me feel like I don't have enough initial knowledge to understand the basics.  Then when I finally do grasp the basics, I feel like they leave me hanging on advanced concepts.  Often they feel like a college level teacher teaching you, and if you don't get it, they move on.  The Linux Command Line is definitely the opposite of this, and reading through it made me feel as if a friend were helping me understand each command.  The language used made this much more pleasurable to read than any other book of the same subjects.  This book always helps you feel comfortable with a program or concept before moving on, much like a tutor instead of a stern instructor.This has become my new go to book for Linux command line, and scripting.  It has been heavily borrowed at work, and a second copy will soon be ordered so I can have it all to myself.

$REVIEW.: The AR-15, a firearm that in its basics is over half a century old, has had a fair share of controversy attached to it.  Virtually forced upon the US Army, in the form of the M16, the Army reluctant to adopt it because of its non-military ordnance origins, the rifle was first thought only suitable for the small-statured troops of the US's client states in Asia.  Then the original AR design was "militarized" into what was for some time considered a near disaster by US ground troops.  Yet the efficiency and improvement of the "platform" has only grown with the years, and seen its highly successful use, by US troops alone, in at least half-a-dozen theaters of war.  More interesting is the groundswell of popularity the rifle has enjoyed among the shooting public, and not just among those attracted to the martial concept of "black guns" but to target and competitive shooters, varmint shooters, plinkers, and even big-game hunters.  Now Doug Howlett has produced the single-most comprehensive guide to this now-classic firearm.  In all he presents many hundreds of detailed and informative "variations on the theme" of the AR, from those built by the usual suspects such as Colt and Bushmaster to some of the least-known, but not uninteresting, manufacturers and customizers, along with ammunition and optics for this specialized class of weapon.  It is likely that the AR will be around, in one form or another another, for another fifty years, with even more interesting refinements to come; and Howlett's book is here not only to chronicle the present but to point the way to the future.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 StarsDebbie @ I Heart YA Books shared a tease from Beautiful Broken Rules and I just had to get it because it sounded so good


And I wasn't disappointed at all!! We have two characters that are perfect for one another, but because of the rules that Em has set for herself, she doesn't let anyone in

When you discover her past, you can understand why she does it
Jaxon also has some issues in his past that he has been running from, but things changed when he sets his sights on Em.Em is a fun character, right from the start she labels herself as a sl*t and almost gets away with her walk of shame&#8230; and runs into her BF Cole, his friend Mason and a new guy on a motorbike


She straightens her shoulders and powers on anyway&#8230; She doesn't let things affect her like most people would


Hell, I would've died of shame for sure!! I noticed though that Em doesn&#8217;t like to develop feelings for people
Things happened when she was younger, so she has decided to avoid attachment at all cost so she doesn&#8217;t have to feel that kind of hurt again

So to avoid that, she has three rules that she has set for her sexual life that she must abide by to avoid conflict and attachment&#8230; And they will be her biggest undoing!&#34;I have three rules: never sleep with someone that a friend has feelings for, never sleep with someone who is in a known relationship (when this isn't disclosed to me, it is not my fault), and finally, never sleep with someone more than three times.&#34;Jaxon I liked from the beginning&#8230; He is very cheeky and I love that kind of spunk in a guy

He is willing to dish it out, flirt and everything, but takes it all in his stride when it is turned on him


He is the first person that has really challenged Em in a long while and they were definitely entertaining to watch together
They have fun, make a few bets and totally enjoy one another's company
But life always throws new challenges and doesn't always run smoothly&#8230;The only real fault I had about this book is the lack of detail in the bedroom scenes
I have read a lot of NA books and most are quite descriptive when it comes to the sexual fun
The ones in this book were glossed over, but I was still able to imagine them a bit.I loved how the author wrote this book, it is all from Em's POV (except for the epilogue) and I could see what Em struggled with along the way


I really liked how the plot played out, too

People deal with tragedy and emotions in their own way and it is interesting to see what they do
I connected well with the characters and the relationship was believable as things don't always run smoothly

I am looking forward to more stories from this world for sure&#8230;&#8230; Jaxon's brother, Jace, is next&#8230; More yummy!!

Brian has lost his band


Everyone died in a plane crash but him

When he finds Pandy again, after 10 years, he's struck by how right they are together

She wants a fling and he wants so much more.I loved this book

It was full of struggle, a man who loved a woman who didn't know how to love him back


When in all actuality she did love him and showed him all the time

A crazed ex

There is so much drama in this book


I couldn't put it down

I am so glad Pandy finally gave them a chance


Maybe she will see that she is worthy of him really soon

All I kept asking is what is wrong with this woman? Vinni cheats on her left and right and lied to her and basically gives her crumbs and instead of a potential happy, healthy relationship with Graham, she still chose the crumbs Vinni threw her. I hate women like this and I hate reading about women like this. Have some backbone and have some self worth. I seriously think the lead female in the book had self esteem issues. I did not even like Vinni and thought he was a total jerk. I wish the book was actually about Graham and some other female. This is a book to skip.

It was tough to read parts of it but I devoured it and could not put it down. I am working on only about 2 hours of sleep and it is completely worth it!!All the characters are back. It goes back in time to when Deuce and Eva are trying to get thru their issues after the Frankie ordeal. I was back to wanting to kill Deuce and his jerk ways but understood where he was coming from. It just takes time.LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Kami and Cox!! I want more about them. They will have you laughing at the perfect times that you need a laugh!Cage and Tegan... We get a preview of their story to come with their history and I can not wait.. I LOVED Tegan and have a feeling she won't take any crap from Cage...Jase and Dorothy are back too. I have loved this couple from the beginning even though they only played a minor role in Undeniable and I have wanted/wished for more, more, more. .. Be careful what you wish for!!!!So many twists and turns I DID NOT see coming....The last 15-20% I was on pins and needles and not breathing....More Hawk please.... :)But finally... Danny and Ripper... Their story IS beautiful.. I felt it and loved them.. Ripper is my new man!! He is funny (who knew), tortured, and a real man who loves his woman without a doubt.. He was amazing... Can I say I love him more than Deuce and not get killed????!!!Thank you Madeline for a wonderful book.. get busy with Cage and Tegan!! I need their book like yesterday.

Dad collects rare eggs, mom cannot cope with the world, brother is trying to live life as a wealthy gentleman in London.Starts with the family visiting the Lake District where brother steals money from his sister. She slaps him, which is seen by a noble (and wealthy) couple - both of whom are dying. It progresses to the family lumbering back home where they discover that the son has  a wife and child - both of whom are noisy and obnoxious.Now forward to the daughter inheriting the estate of the wealthy couple. A bunch of issues arise from this. She moves to the Lake District to claim her inheritance (which her brother tried to steal earlier). She arrives and things go down hill from there.We get to read about others claiming the inheritance and watch our lead character turn into an idiot. She has an ulcer, a magistrate who is the male lead, a former maid who is now her companion, and a village full of ridiculous characters.I have read another Regency by this author which was thoroughly wonderful!

$REVIEW.: A futuristic approach to the old fashioned Cinderfella story, Redemption is the story of Jason, a young man who has an immediate need for money and the fastest way to find it is to sold himself into a bondmate contract for 20 years


Even if the term "bondmate" can suggest something more romantic, the bondmate contract is basically the modern way to be a slave: accepting the contract Jason accepts to become a property of someone else, man or woman is the same, if they have the money to buy his contract.In a way, Jason is lucky since the one to buy the contract is Devin, an handsome man in his thirties who is basically a workaholic without time for a private life

Buying a bondmate is a perfect solution, during the day Jason will be Devin's personal assistant, during the night he will share his bed, if Devin is in the mood, or otherwise he will stay in his room, without risk to hear recrimination


Devin's former wife was a society butterfly and she left when she realized Devin was not her personal escort, but he had actually a job he had to do.I liked the contrast between Jason's expected role and his physical appearance: Jason is strong and young, not at all weak, and if not for the urgent need of money, he had also perspective on the future, he was a post-graduate student with excellent credentials
When Devin takes him home, I had the feeling Jason felt like an elephant in a glass shop, and I think also Devin was questioning if he had done the right choice.Another interesting point is how homosexuality in this futuristic society is no more a taboo, basically everyone is bisexual, and indeed Jason had only one previous homosexual experience, but he has no issue at all at being bought by a man, while instead Devin, from what I understood, had his same share of women and men in the past, and I think he has picked a man now since he is still burned by the bad experience with his ex-wife.

$review_text.: I received this ebook from Netgalley and Claire Kent in exchange for an honest review.I liked "Escorted". My main complaint, in that story, was that I wanted to hear more from Ander's point of view. Some of what he and Lori when through was difficult to read and frustrated me because I didn't know what he was thinking and/or feeling.Having Ander's voice is what I liked best about "Breaking". I very much enjoyed seeing them together and happy. I am always glad to revisit my couplesOn the other hand, I did not feel there was much depth or point to this Novella. It was mostly erotica. For me, it was missing something. So I was a little disappointed.

$review_text.: Yes I do own the Zombie Combat Handbook, for the impending Zombie apocalypse. I am an avid fan of the Walking Dead series on AMC, I think it is a quality series. I do have a Zombie action plan ready to go, just in case. I am a George Romero fan, but I think Danny Boyle's 28 Days later is amazing. If I had to choose though I am a purest, slow moving Zombies are the best Zombie movies.So when I saw this book I was a little excited, a Christian Zombie Book.....oh yeah!Jeff Kinley actually does something quite cool he interweaves a story of Ben Forman, no relation to George, who in this fictional story comes under Zombie attack. Alternate Chapters are the conversation about Sin, Grace and Salvation. Sin really representing the Zombie within all of us that lies waiting to take over. The two stories start to overlap and you get a sense that we can combat the Zombie within through the power of Christ.I read this book and instantly thought of some students in my ministry that could enjoy a decent Zombie story interwoven with some lessons about Sin, Grace and Salvation. The Zombie story is a pretty good attempt, although I kinda wanted a little more character development. The theology is sound, his points are simple and his takeaways are clear. The best thing about the book is that it really is two mini-books in one. I would recommend this book to my Zombie movie fans in my Student Ministry (High School) and to any interested avid Zombie fan. It is a good read, I wasn't amazed or awe inspired, but it was a great reminder and a fresh take on the idea of sin.Always love a author who backs up his points with a bunch of scripture! A Novel fresh take on a Zombie/Theology mash-up.

Two classic hollywood legends with strong personalities that thought they had nothing in common
The back and forth style shows how alike and different they were and contains so much rich history

Ariel is not the kind of person to stand back and let the man take the lead but still has a sexy, feminine quality that lends her strength and intellect to Matt, a man of strength and character who will let his woman stand by his side not to hold him up higher but so they can hold each other higher.

$review_text.: Because Of Ellison by M.S. Willis took me no time at all to read.  I really liked this story and didn&#8217;t want to put it down.  Mostly due to the prologue which took place well into the future.  I have read about every book from this author and I enjoy her writing.  This book was a great read for me because the characters were so likable and real.  While reading they changed my perception of the other.  I almost felt like I got to really get to know these characters and be a part of their lives.  It was a beautiful and inspiring story.  I truly fell hard for this book!Hunter is nineteen and over privileged.  He is going down a scary road filled with drugs and sex.  Then one night his parents have enough and decide he needs to change.  They send him to Florida to spend the summer with his uncle and cousin.  They aren&#8217;t wealthy and Hunter has never had to work for anything.  There is where he meets Ellison.  There first meeting is less than friendly, but Ellison is like no one he&#8217;s ever met.  He is challenged by her and her honesty surprises him.  He wants to get to know Ellison.  He works for her friendship.  It pays off because she is the most wonderful woman he has ever met.  He sees her beauty inside and out.  When Ellison is faced with a devastating blow Hunter realizes what it&#8217;s like to want and need someone.  For the first time in his life he puts his needs before his own.  Will Ellison accept what he&#8217;s offering or push him back into a world he&#8217;s not sure he&#8217;s a part of anymore?This book wasn&#8217;t a typical and overused story.  It was very original and the issues these characters faced hit close to home.  It made me feel hopeful.  This was fiction obviously but I so wish it wasn&#8217;t.  It wasn&#8217;t just a story about young love and finding yourself, but also about change and searching for the beauty within you.  I guess I connected with this story on a more important level.I loved meeting and watching these characters grow.  I loved the selflessness and their amazing journey.  I would recommend you give it a try.  The writing is really good and the story might make you weep with happiness.

$REVIEW.: While this book promises to tell the story of a healer and share her methods, it fails to deliver

 Portions of it are interesting but most of it is mired in quasi scientific ramblings and entity removal and exorcism
 As a young girl, the author's openess and awareness of her healing gifts are squelched by misguided family members and teachers

 As an adult, she gradually rediscovers her gifts and channels guides from other dimensions to become a talented healer
 In the process, she fails to appreciate boundaries and eventually becomes exhausted and afflicted with Stage three breast cancer

 After seeking traditional medical treatment, she resumes her healing practice with limits and fees


 In this book she shares her perceptions of reality, creation,  etheric anatomy,chakras along with her healing technique and some exercies


As the books veers from interesting to boring, the overall result is frustrating and confused.Her personal stories are generally the best part of the book except when she whines (which is often)
 Her description of reality and the energetic systems of humans is boring and photos are totally useless in a kindle edition

 Her descriptions of aliens, demonsand other assorted entities is so campy it should be featured on the SYFY channel

 Her healing method is confui sng at best and unneccessarily complex
Overall, I thought this bok was poorly organized and unfocused

To say I was disappointed is an understatement.

$REVIEW.: The author of this book makes some great analogies about the development of willpower and self discipline.  This book reinforces the idea that any lack of willpower and self disciple is my own fault, and I cannot blame it on any external circumstance. Following the steps in this book will definitely lead to a healthier, happier, and more productive lifestyle. Self discipline and willpower will lead to me controlling my circumstances, instead of my circumstances controlling me. l would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take control of their own life and accomplish their priorities and dreams. I really enjoyed reading it and hope I can put some of the ideas into practice.

$REVIEW.: Kate Evangelista blew me away with this book. If you know me, you now I am a huge zombie fan. But after a while you sort of feel like you've seen it all when it comes to the walking dead. That was not the case with this book. This was such a fresh take on zombies that I am still jumping up and down over how much I adored this book.Phoenix is thrown into a situation that would leave most human's terrified. She stumbles into a world of flesh eaters. I was so pleased Phoenix as a female lead. She was strong, brave, witty, and just fun. The guys in this book might be hot, but she was a great character all on her own.  While in this civilization, trying to blend in as one of their own, she finds herself drawn to and torn between Demitri and Luka. Two incredibly different but equally hot characters. And I loved them both so much!  This book had action, mystery, and the romance was HOT! So my recommendation? Read this book! If you are a fan of paranormal romance you'll want to pick this one up asap. I can't wait to see what Kate has in store for us next.

$review_text.: This volume was amazing.  I mean you really get to see that humanity is desperate and scared of what Eren has become.  Also a huge counterattack is happening at the end of the volume, thus leaving a huge cliffhanger.  Anyways this is great series with lots of horror and action :).Story:  Well the story is definitely did a 180 twist on us.  I wasn't expecting the author to do this kind of change up on us.  The story is definitely evolving and some interesting points are made in the story.  Eren is definitely becoming the main protagonist of the story, but Armin who is Eren best friend is definitely changing in a more positive way. 4/4Character development: Eren is now a shaper basically.  He can shape into a titan and basically kick all other titan's butts.  Armin is the star of this volume.  He is becoming much braver, and he also extremely intelligent. 3/3.Artwork: The artwork is always amazing, and it's basically a pleasure to view it. 3/3Overall, another solid volume and I hope more people begin to read this series because it's awesome.  This manga has potential to be the best I have read in years.10/10.

$review_text.: Kyrsten Sinema has been a powerhouse in the Arizona Legislature even as a member of the minority party, winning friends and trust on both sides of the aisle.  She calls herself Progressive and indeed she is.  This book however is not just for progressives:  Conservatives and Independents will benefit from reading Unite and Conquer and enjoy it at the same time, for she not above telling amusing stories about herself.  And her ideas benefit all.It is not just political types who could enjoy and benefit from this page-turning book for it includes guidelines in how to talk to any individual or group where openness and acceptance are not a given.  It talks about careful listening and avoiding the trap of challenging others while they are still forming their thoughts.  It talks about finding common values and common ground.  We don't have to be elected officials to need these skills.  Home and office give us many opportunities.She has seen and lived the frustration that gridlocking politicians have caused and is saying we can do better and here's how we can do better.  She has a proven record of getting things done.  The immovability of some politicians - yes they can be on both sides of the aisle - often reflect the intransigence of voters.If you like political gridlock get another book; but if you think it's time for things to loosen up and start moving again, read this book.  It'll be a start.

$REVIEW.: Secondhand Smoke by Patty Friedmann is a novel of complex and sometimes toxic figures, blame, and the search for redemption. Jerusha Bailey is a harsh, cigarette-addicted mother whose chain-smoking habit may have been responsible for the death of her husband Woodrow. Jerusha also has two estranged children, who cannot flee far away enough from her and her scornful ways - yet when she meets ten-year-old boy living next door to here and who has an abrasive mother, she and the boy come to share a special bond in this twisted yet surprising and all-too-human tale. Secondhand Smoke is a compelling read from beginning to end. Also highly recommended is Patty Friedman's earlier books, Eleanor Rushing (1582430772,[$$]), and Odds (1582431809, [$$]).

Be prepared to fall in love with these characters.  This group...loyalty and love is what defines them.  The story will evoke all sorts of emotions within.  You have two best friends who have been in love and known they were meant to be from day one, but...didn't want to risk their friendship and let the other person know.  They part ways to med school and a career at a magazine and finally admit their love.  They build a relationship and then TRAGEDY strikes.  I was in tears!!  I can't recall the last time I cried while reading a book.  You will be happy, sad, frustrated, angry, etc. while reading so be prepared.  The second book is even better!

$REVIEW.: Cindy Sheehan is leaving the anti-war movement to which she gave so much life, energy, and focus. She will be back, no doubt, in some form. I wish her well in restoring herself and renewing her own life. But I firmly disagree (and this is a blue-moon moment) with William R. Pitt that "Anyone glad for her departure from activism is celebrating a disaster."While I doubt I'd use the word "glad" to describe my own feelings, certainly "relieved" qualifies. At any rate, in no way does "disaster" describe this moment. Quite the contrary: this woman endured everything from divorce to death threats to arrest to public taunting and ridicule from the mass media; it is time she retreated and renewed.There is also a broader theme to this, which I am going to explain with a book review. Yes, a book review. The book is The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations. The authors are Ori Brafman and Rod A. Beckstrom, and they have written one of the most crystalline gems of social insight that I have seen in any non-fiction these past 20 years. In a mere 200 pages of text, these two Stanford grads provide more clarity of perspective on our society, its group psychologies and cultural transformations, than you are likely to get from a shelf full of punditry or a year's worth of television. I do not think I am overstating the case for this book: it is the most important and clarion piece of non-fiction to arise in this first decade of the 21st century. It is a book made for, and by, its era.The metaphor of the title is a comparison of "top-down", hierarchically-structured groups and organizations, such as we are all familiar with in corporate America and government (that's the spider, who can be made lame from the loss of its legs and dead from decapitation); and the fresh wave of decentralized, leaderless, or non-hierarchical organizations that have become such a force in society over the past decade of the Internet (this is the "starfish," which can be chopped up into numerous pieces, each of which will respond by growing a new organism or member).The book opens with a heady analysis of how a starfish phenomenon evolved in one particular category: the P2P file sharing services in the Napster/Grokster model. The authors show how the early versions of these spontaneous organizations got stuck in "spider" mode, and were therefore eventually trapped and killed by big corporate media and its legal juggernaut. But these Napster-type experiments benefited from such attacks by a response of ever-increasing differentiation, diversification, and "starfish"-style regrowth. Brafman and Beckstrom finally lead the reader to the eMule service, which took decentralization to the point of anonymity and total leaderlessness. Big Media cannot attack an entity like eMule, because it has no head, no governance, no bank accounts: there is nothing for a legal or corporate machine to assault, except for individual users of the service, who, aside from being virtually innumerable, are mostly children and rarely wealthy.The authors go on to reveal both the beauty and the danger inherent in the starfish-mode of organizational being, drawing examples as diverse as Wikipedia and al Qaeda. Along the way, they present portraits of environmental groups, activist organizations, online merchants, and Internet services. But if this book stopped with mere sketches of eBay, Alcoholics Anonymous, Apache, craigslist, Goodwill Industries, and IBM, then it would be merely an interesting intellectual snack for the MBA crowd.The Starfish and the Spider becomes a banquet of cultural insight because it digs past the surface that so many pundits and social commentators stop to admire. Brafman and Beckstrom turn the starfish on its back, examine it in varying light, carry it into vastly disparate environments, and constantly ask questions of it. In doing so, they discover some principles and characteristics common to starfish organizations and the people who inspire and influence their growth.One of their most fascinating discoveries is in the figure of what they term "the catalyst." It is here that we are brought back to Cindy Sheehan (this is my own connection, so if you think it's a stupid association, don't blame the authors of the book). The catalyst is the person who founds a starfish group, the one who gives it form, ideas, value, focus, and meaning. Examples of catalysts that Brafman and Beckstrom offer are:# Granville Sharp, leader of the abolitionist movement against slavery in England# Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who founded the women's suffrage movement that Susan B. Anthony later took up with still greater energy# Craig Newmark of craigslist# Bill Wilson of AAOne thing the authors point out is thata catalyst is like the architect of a house: he's essential to the long-term structural integrity, but he doesn't move in. In fact, when the catalyst stays around too long and becomes absorbed in his creation, the whole structure becomes more centralized.So one common feature to the life and health of a growing decentralized movement or organization is that the catalyst almost always leaves or at least recedes into the mesh of the whole, once the group has matured enough to work autonomously and to withstand assault. Whenever a catalyst attempts to assume a traditional, CEO-type of leadership role, the organization loses its dynamism, its life as a starfish, and becomes a centralized, hierarchical spider--much easier to mark, and then suppress or assimilate.For a corporate entity, this may not necessarily be a bad thing: growth-as-profit, after all, can be nurtured in a traditional corporate management structure. But growth-as-message can become stilled or silenced when there's a top dog in place, approving this, denying that; or simply being a figurehead in a particular place as the focus of activism or just attention.The anti-war movement has benefited enormously from Cindy Sheehan's presence, personality, experience, and energy. We have admired her from afar for some two years now: I first wrote about her here (note also that the fractiousness and in-fighting that Sheehan noted in her parting statement existed way back then, too).Since then, however, the movement has grown, thanks largely to Sheehan's example and leadership. But I agree with Brafman and Beckstrom, that a time inevitably comes for every starfish organization when its formative human force must retreat. In our own democracy's formative stage, George Washington had to decline the crown that his followers attempted to place on his head. Other catalysts have had to spurn a crown or a corner office, and always for the good of the whole, for the sake of the movement's continued growth.Since Sheehan first camped out in George Bush's backyard, Code Pink, IVAW, and hundreds of other "starfish arms and legs" have formed around her and taken on their own life in the anti-war sea. It is time that these organisms were allowed to share in both the light and the tribulation, the accolades and the calumny.The blogosphere--itself a starfish organization--has benefited from Sheehan's influence and example. I think she recognizes this as well, and thus chose Daily Kos as the forum for her parting message. It is perhaps only seemingly ironic that the world wide web is perhaps the least "spidery" vehicle of communication on earth today. Only on the Internet, for example, could you find a science writer for a stodgy paper like the New York Times writing a scathing indictment of the Bush administration--it happened today.As Brafman and Beckstrom point out in their book, this kind of seeming chaos is unique to a starfish-style organization: "When you give people freedom, you get chaos, but you also get incredible creativity." Even on the website of a spider organization like the New York Times.Clearly, we probably need more chaos; and we certainly need more creativity. Congress has failed to carry out the will of the people, because it cannot respond to the fluid movement of the starfish; it is too mired in its own iron-stranded matrix of excess, corruption, deceit, and self-indulgence. As the authors of The Starfish and the Spider indicate, we can only overcome the turgid inertia of Washington politics by redoubling the starfish energy of the anti-war movement. In other words, it is time for a catalyst to step into the background, so that the whole is given renewed life. And so that a long-suffering and heroic Mom can once more feel the quiet joys of private life that the rest of us so often take for granted.posted by Brian Donohue @ 5/31/2007

$review_text.: It is a book full of erotic scenes with romantic and great plot. I like the book on the fact that Desiree who is less exposed to world of sex and adventure because of her marriage to a non-outgoing husband fully walks into the path of rejuvenating and rediscovering herself. The story development on how Desiree meets Marcus in a friend&#8217;s wedding unravels slowly as Marcus who is hot, aggressive and bold is ready to leave her panting helplessly in his arms at all costs. The author has developed social life with erotic, flirting and romance without explicitly overemphasizing it. It is a book worth recommending to anyone.

$review_text.: I found myself caught up again in mystery and intrigue as Christine Smith, with her search and rescue dog Chief, and fellow detective Jeremy Goodman, continue to go after the bad guys -- all while Christine is still being stalked by a madman. From the opening pages until the end, I did not want to put the book down. A third book is on the way which I trust will wrap everything up. If not, I will keep reading.Essence of Evil deals with more missing children and the subject of pedophilia. Ms. Derksen writes without needing anything graphic and still keeps you involved in the mystery. I also like the way the author interweaves Jeremy&#8217;s faith and you can see how Christine is finally letting her guard down to the possibility that God might exist. I love to see the subtle changes in the characters as the story moves forward.Make sure you read Shadow Stalker first but don&#8217;t miss out on either of these books. Curl up on your couch and dig in. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.

$review_text.: To Honor is a fantastic example of what can happen when a writer puts a bit of their soul on to paper
This story is told with an honesty that can be elusive in romance novellas
The characters are real, raw , flawed hurting, and just downright human

It's what makes the story


These are people you know and love in your own life


Their journey is painful to watch, and so easy to sympathize with
 Now I'm going to warn you ahead of time so you don't come back to me later, and say I didn't warn you
You may need a box of tissues, and some sensitive matters such as suicide are dealt with here.Evelyn is a woman whose been pushed to the edge and has taken the final leap off


When a myriad number of events pile up on top of her she makes the desperate decision to take her own life


Her failed attempt lands her in a psych ward, and opens her confused husbands' eyes

As she heals she has to over come the situations that stole not only her will to live but a part of her sanity.Derek is stunned when he's contacted because his wife has attempted to commit suicide after he tells her he wants a divorcee


 Clarification has come to late when he realizes separation from this incredible woman is the last thing he wants
Caught up in his emotional affair with his therapist he'd become convinced she was what was wrong in his life

He knows some mistakes can't be taken back, but he hopes like hell they can be overcome
With leave approved from his command he settled himself into the same facility as his wife and vows to be the man she fell in love with once more.Once they begin marriage counseling this couple is forced to examine themselves, where they went wrong, and if they can put the pieces back together.This is a beautiful read, you won't want to miss, and I highly recommend it to those looking for a little more substance.

$review_text.: This book concludes the awesome Saving Angels series by Tiffany King, and I must say I am absolutely impressed.  King is a fantastic writer, and this final novel is just as compelling and mind-blowing as the first two.  Whereas the first novel,Meant to Be, stole my heart, and the second novel,Forgotten Soulsbroke it, this final novel has made amends and my heart is whole again.  I love this series, and I love this novel.  The ending really made me smile because I never saw it coming, especially as King sent me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions as events unfolded, truths were realized, and Krista was forced to make impossible choices.  In all honesty, I'm extremely sad to see the series come to an end; King is a very gifted writer with a vivid imagination, and I have fallen in love with this series.  However, I am excitedly awaiting King's reveal of her next writing endeavor, which I am certain will be just as amazing as her past three novels.

(In fact, it was the Church which defended Galileo against the protestants, who were horrified at his theories.  And no, Galileo never proved his ideas about the earth's rotation.  He enjoyed the Church's money and protection, even after being rebuked for stating his theories should be accepted as fact until proven false.)  Hope Wile's books can be corrected, so they can be enjoyed for excellence in scientific and historical analysis.

$REVIEW.: The cover for this book much like the second one, if gorgeous. I love everything about it. It is very eye catching and sort of just draws you in.So needless to say after reading the first book in the series and hoping that this would be a series that would get better over time and truly thinking the series has potential, I was excited to read the second book, especially after having read the novella that came in between these two which really was quite good, even better than the first book.So it is with a sad heart that I have to say, this book did not live up to its cover nor to my expectations of it.Is it wrong to say how disappointed I am with the plot?This book just felt so..rushed and thrown together.It has some of the most unbelieveably cheesy lines in it between Kama and Torrid and that is saying a lot from me because normally cheesy it okay with me. I am after all a hopeless romantic so I normally eat that stuff up but in this book it just felt so insincere and like Gow was just trying too hard to make it seem romantic and lovey dovey and just...ugh!This was a short book to begin with so really there wasn't room for a whole lot of action or things to happen, I understand that but what did transpire just was so fast and sometimes even a little confusing feeling.Things happened a little too quickly and Kama didn't grow like I was really hoping she would.The book said she did and wanted you to believe that she had but when it came down to her fighting and using her powers she just bombed.Like everything she had been training with Torrid flew right out of her mind and she just couldn't do it.She made some stupid mistakes and then couldn't get herself out of them.Liam was just off in this book too.I understand he learned a lot about Pim in this story that was devastating to him but his character still didn't feel right. He became hardened and acted almost like he expected Kama to be with Torrid and that he was okay with that. I mean, he is suppose to love her. He isn't even going to fight for her?That is just wrong.I don't know. I really am considering whether it would even be worth it to continue on with this series.Maybe once the disappointment doesn't seem so sharp I will give it another shot.

In my review of the prequel I cite Dawson's Creek, and to shake things up I will cite Gilmore Girls--that kind of dialogue just does not happen, at least not in every encounter you have in life
The back and forth between Andi and Dev got to the point of "come ON!" I find it incredibly hard to believe that someone in need like Andi would never even consider contacting her "first love" (Dev) after her husband dies.Unfortunately I read this on my iphone so am not able to actually discuss in detail because it's too hard to scroll and find passages that I liked/did not like.

$REVIEW.: I first read this incredible story in German, many years agon.  Already, I have bought more copies than I can remember, for this book never comes back to me after lending it out (the dog ate it/soup spilled/I forgot who took it).  I KNOW there is no dog/soup/memory loss, for it is next to impossible to give Jenny up, even for as long as it takes to buy one's own copy.  I now read it again in english, and Jenny has not lost any of her charms.  I'm still dead to the world while in 'Jennyland' and dream to be transformed into a kitty myself.  This book is a MUST read for all cat owned and wouldbe shape-shifters.  Read, dream, laugh, and cry with the little child in all of us which longs to be a cat, and experience  1st hand (well, sort of) how challenging it is to actually BECOME one.  Jenny will stay with you for the rest of your life, if you only buy more than one copy, and never, EVER give your own away.  The second copy you can continue to replace as you increase the Jenny family.  It's the purrfect (sorry, could not resist) gift regardless of age or preferences.  Keep passing it out, share the magic, and you will be fondly remembered by anyone touched by your/Gallicos precious gift.

$review_text.: If your interested in learning about the principles of Taoism this is a quick read covering the very basics of Chuang Tzu's Taoism. Far less is known about the philosophy of Chuang Tsu unlike the popular Lao Tsu so familiar in our Western society. This book may inspire you as it has me to read more on Chuang Tsu. The author bravely and vulnerably reveals his many lifelong downfalls and talks about how these teachings have helped him overcome these difficult times in his challenging life. There are many philosophers quoted in this book and I almost wish it stuck more directly to Chuang Tsu because that was why I wanted to read this book to learn more about his teachings and who he was. This is more about the authors difficult journey through life and how these Taoist principles helped him through. I enjoyed it and found it very thought provoking. I didn't come away feeling like I had a deep understanding of this particular Taoist philosophy, it was just a taste and enough to leave you wanting to learn more!

It lost the flow of thought, oh I get that it is supposed to be when they are in heaven, it just lost all context. The characters lost their "umph" and the thinking process became, how shall we say, MUDDLED. It felt to me like the author had an awesome story idea and did a great job of developing his story line and the characters, and then got to the summation and either wanted to "get 'er done," or didn't know how to write an ending.

As a huge environmentalist, only some of it was new information for me - but it tells the story of the crisis of our planet in a concise, very readable, and unique way.This is a must read for all of us. So many people do not understand the connection between consumption and the environment. While I believe the author could have done a slightly better job defining "rich" and discussing the consumption-dependent and consumption-addicted cultures (such as the US), I still believe he hit the nail on the head.This is one of the best books I've read in 2008 - certainly top 10, and probably the only book I've called a "must read" all year.We are definitely in crisis mode, and we must act now. This book is for teachers, students, activists, lay people, and anybody ready to make a change.
$review_summary.: Excellent - a must read for the entire world

Definitely top 10 for the 2008

$REVIEW.: I waited to write my review of this book until I'd had a chance to put Metivier's technique to the test&#8212;about 6 weeks after I read it. I sure am glad I found this book&#8212;not just for memorizing French words, but for everything I want to remember! Unlike so many books about memory tricks or memory palaces, Metivier actually explains, meticulously, just how to go about building memory palaces and filling them up with the French words (or words of any language that uses the Roman alphabet) you want to remember. He tells you what preparation steps are necessary, gives examples of the kind of vivid imagery you're going to use, and even suggests a schedule in which you devote one day a month to each of the 26 letters of the alphabet. I'm 58 years old, learning French with an aim to be reasonably fluent in a year: thanks to this technique, I feel confident I can do it. I'm memorizing around 100 words a day now, and it's fun, too!
$SUMMARY.: a memory palace technique that really WORKS

$review_text.: I have had the privilege of reading quite a few books on Law of attraction and this one is a real good one. Its a concise book which summarizes what is the law of attraction, how to apply it best with various tips and techniques. Also it answers a lot of frequently asked questions about the law of attraction. The writer does a good job at convincing the reader that law of attraction actually works and deals specifically with how it can be used to attract large sums of money. Also visualization is explained quite well and to the point.

$review_text.: Some people joke that people with bad manners must've been raised by wolves. Well, Bryn literally way, by werewolves to be exact. After a rogue werewolf brutally killed her parents, four-year-old Bryn was adopted by Callum, the pack alpha. Now fifteen, she figures there's not much she hasn't seen. Nothing prepares her, though, for when she stumbles upon a caged werewolf named Chase. Case was bitten and turned into a werewolf, and his very existence tears apart the relatively safe world she knew. Shuddering from newly dug up memories of her parents' attack and chafing from the increasingly restrictive protections placed on her, Bryn doesn't quite know what to do. There's one thing for sure: Bryn needs answers--and she won't stop until she gets them.Raised by Wolves is yet another novel catering to the rising werewolf craze. Barnes does not disappoint, serving up plenty of paranormal dangers and wolfy action to keep most readers on the edge of their seat. I was quite pleased, for the most part, with this novel. The characters are interesting and generally realistic, the plot in undoubtedly engaging, and Barnes's handling of the nature and politics of werewolves was superb. There was only one thing that bothered me about this book. It wasn't so big that I can't get over it; however, it made a good chunk of the story really awkward. Raised by Wolves can be divided into three parts. The first and last parts are fine. The middle part is where things go a bit awry. Barnes does not do a good job of connection the first part, a basic introduction, to the last part, where the drama of Bryn and Chase against basically everyone else unfolds. Overlooking that awkward part though, Raised by Wolves is an enjoyable read and a welcome addition to the growing group of werewolf-themed novels.Raised by Wolves will be enjoyed by werewolf fans, particularly those who enjoyed The Dark Divine by Bree Despain, Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater, Stray by Rachel Vincent, and Twilight by Stephenie Meyer.

$review_text.: I hate to give a book two stars but this one just did not do it for me. The sex was hot...but sex alone does not make a good book... unfortunately. So the gist of this book, we have two nerdy exes who are going to what amounts to a comic convention. They happen to have friends in common so they have to ride together in an RV for sixteen hours.Lyndsey and Ben broke up when Ben decided that he wasn't ready for a more serious relationship in his life. Lyndsey always felt like something was missing. She discovered a new world in one of her comics about BDSM. She approached Ben about it and he quickly shut her down. Now on a road trip with Lyndsey Ben is realizing just what he threw away.Lyndsey is new to the lifestyle and finds a few friends to help her along the way. Ben does the same, because he is not letting Lyndsey go without a fight. Ben realizes that to get Lyndsey he must become a Dominant to her submissive...add in a bit of bondage and a little spanking and you have The Seduction Hypothesis.So my question is, can someone just "decide" to become a Dom? Even with some small tendencies, is that enough to build a D/s relationship? I don't think so. There were also a few other problems with this book. It was a bit confusing at first. I am not an unintelligent person but there were a few large words that my dictionary didn't even know. Really necessary? No. Things also skipped forward a bit fast. The back-story was dispersed throughout and it became a bit confusing.Overall, not my favorite.2 Shiny little stars.

$REVIEW.: I liked this "book" - interesting premise involving a woman who packs and ships other people's finer things. I expected it to be a full-blown novel, and it wasn't; didn't even get me through 30 minutes on the treadmill.I'm a little puzzled, also, by the "Teatime Mysteries" subheading.  I guess, from reading other similarly titled books, I expected this to somehow involve a tea room.  Or someone who sold tea, at least.  Maybe it just connotes these are to be read with a cup of tea, or can be finished while having one cup of tea?I notice there are other stories by this author with this heading, but they appear to be standalones.  I much prefer my mysteries to be series-based - if I'm going to invest time and emotion in a character, I like to know they'll be around for a while.  If this had been a full-length novel and part of a series, I probably would have gone out of my way to keep up with it.This was moderately entertaining, but the abrupt ending left me wanting more. Would I buy it on purpose?  I might, if the blurb had indicated how short it was.  I feel sort of cheated.  Knowing what I know now, would I buy it again?  Not so much.

$review_text.: Wow, I love Cash and Lilly, and the kiddos.  A little bit of Cash's story starts in Until Trevor.  Jules becomes pregnant by Cash, right before he meets and falls for Lilly.  He leaves Lilly because Jules threatens to abort Jax and Cash can't let that happen.  He doesn't know that Lilly is also pregnant with Ashlyn.  3 years later, after he is divorced, he runs into Lilly and Ashlyn and he realizes that she is his daughter.  He wants to make everything right between them.  Jules is basically a psycho, doesn't want anything to do with her son, just holds him over Cash's head, even though Cash has complete custody of him.  She will do anything to hurt him, especially if that means hurting Lil in the process.  I figured out who was behind the forgery pretty easily, but wasn't expecting the end to happen.  I didn't see that coming at all.  I will be reading Until Nico when it comes out as well.

$REVIEW.: This book is designed to help people to find more peace, harmony and a more accurate picture of who they really are and not necessarily who they think they are
This is accomplished by being aware of the present moment in one&#8217;s life experience instead of viewing their experiences in terms of the past or future experiences
For those who are students of meditation the book offers a unique, though not new perspective on how meditation works to gain insights into their lives through objective observations andacceptance of their life experiences


In fact, mindfulness is a central theme of Buddhist teachings as well as other eastern systems of thought


The book offers a powerful yet simple method for gaining control over one&#8217;s life for the better.

In particular, accept  the miracle finishes and miracle plot turns  of the genre and you will find this a fun read. I found the idea of the Techno weapons being rendered inoperable as a very interesting basis for the plot. As expected, the US wins out rather easily even fighting with &#34;mothballs&#34;.

$REVIEW.: This book is very well written, and although there are some minor quirks with various versions of Drupal, you can work around them.Each code example is well documented and carries the concept that is being taught.I have not finished the book, but already feel like I could code a basic Drupal module

 The book is so good that I put it down half way because there was too much information going into my brain to process it all without stopping to try it.And with the basic information in the book about how Drupal works behind the scenes, I have already been able to customize my sites better, knowing what parts do what.Before, I couldn't even manage to do basic tasks, because I was so confused


 But maybe chalk that up to a bit of think-headedness.

$REVIEW.: First, allow me, with all due respect to say, "My hat is off to you"
 Anyone who writes knows that just completing such a work is a testament to perserverance and discipline


So forgive me when I say, an awkward writing style all too often obstructs and obscures a fervent imagination and thus, detracts and distracts from what would otherwise have be an enjoyable read.However, I don't want to leave you with just the criticism with no constructive path forward

I do think you have a future and a vivid imagination

What you need is a richer vocabulary and more lyrical writing style and thankfully, with dedication, those can be learned.May I suggest that your work might benefit from being more well-read? That is not to say that you have not read your share of novels


But, there is a great difference between having a capacity for writing English and being immersed in it; paying attention to other, more seasoned writer's prose and sentence structure would be a value in my opinion


Listen to narrative movies and recordings where you can hear the lyrical nature of the words


There is a very real rhythm to good writing

I also suggest that it would be beneficial to submit work to a writer's group where it can get properly critiqued and constructive criticism can flow back to you.I look forward to future works from you and hope my words did not offend and that you remain undaunted.

The phrases used are short, direct and commonplace.The author believes this style adds an air of pure, simple wisdom to his cliches.But it is actually a false and very artificial profundity.You are starting to see what I mean now, aren't you?And the white space helps pad out the pages so you can charge $22.95 for a mostly empty book.This book is squarely in that category and is not worth it.But then, you already knew that somewhere deep down in your soul.Didn't you?

$REVIEW.: I am like the author.  I came of age when water was drunk from the tap.  Then people started to get cool and order water like Perrier.  Now water is just like another commodity to be bought and sold.  My wife and her daughter come from Chile and they will drink nothing but bottled water.  They insist on it, even though our dentist can tell it has had an effect on her teeth.The author makes plain the argument against bottled water.  It tastes no different from regular tap, but costs more and is a problem for the environment.  I witnessed the bottling of Desani and the bottling companies are making a mint off this stuff, and it is no different than tap.  I was interested in the author's comments on the Maine standoff between Nestle and the small town.  Those residents of the town should benefit from what Nestle is doing to the underground water source.This is another read that shows the simplier life was better.  Bring back tap, and get rid of the bottles.

$review_text.: "In the ascending spiral of evolution each new generation absorbs the experiences of the previous level and expands upon them..." (theorist and scholar Gene Youngblood, 2010).Such is the underlying theme of Dr. Bob Rich's profound and sometimes confounding literary masterpiece Ascending Spiral - Humanity's Last Chance.The journey of Rich's protagonist Pip Lipkin through 12000 years of human history is a powerful and often lyrical narrative featuring a vivid pallete of historical settings and fully realized protagonists - all of whom represent a singular hero on a quest for redemption. From the Viking era of Continental Europe to the Irish vs. English struggle for supremacy in the Middle Ages and beyond to the present day, each vignette is visually lush and evocative, laying the foundation of the hero's journey and building on it with thought provoking subtlety and an eye towards a powerful message of atonement for the sins of the past.The connective tissue of reincarnation allows the story to advance through the ages until we come full circle with the modern day with Pip Lipkin. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story as reincarnation is a concept that I am really drawn to and I like to read different takes on it. Rich's use of it in his story - under the convention of the Ascending Spiral - was satisfyingly original.Bob Rich's Ascending Spiral - Humanity's Last Chance is a unique piece of fiction, an almost hand crafted literary work that lingers in the mind long after the final page. You will be captured by the story and perhaps changed by it.

$REVIEW.: A book gets such good buzz that it can't possibly be meet the expectations. This is not one of those cases. I loved this book because of it's humor, intelligence and a heroine who got knocked into the boards, got up and skated back out again. Mia Devine was just that. Taking on Paris by herself was brave -- really it was. But without it she wouldn't have met Lucas or the opportunity to experience the city from his perspective. Loved their chemistry.I will re-read this book again and again -- might even buy the actual bound copy. I want more of Mia & Lucas. Is that wrong?

$review_text.: In our family, I had two unmarried "aunts". I knew that one of them was my grandmother's natural sister, and always assumed that the other "aunt" was an adopted sister. As I grew up, I came to know them as each others companions, more than "sisters". It seemed to most natural thing in the world that they lived together and were not married. Because of my experience, I could really relate to the story in this book. Bobbie (Barbara Jean) comes to her grandmother's home following her death to clean up the house and prepare it for sale. Bobbie is dealing with the pending end of her marriage and coming to the house revives her memories of summers spent with her grandmothers, especially the summer she fell in love. Told in flashback and in present, the story of Bobbie learning more about her grandmothers and their relationship helps her make decisions about her own relationships.

$REVIEW.: This is way more than an early 1900 mail order bride story

 The hero is a gruff plain spoken man who was hurt by his ex-wife

 The heroin find herself homeless and with no family and agrees to marry the hero for a home and security


 I thought the Heroin a little to submissive for my tastes but still liked the book.Both have issues to overcome as the journey towards their HEA.I enjoyed this book very much!

$review_text.: I grabbed the first of these books on a whim and don't regret it for one second! Amazing characters, action and humor throughout the story. Each one just keeps getting better. I also like the way the author has incorporated each character who has found their mates who actually still have spats after they've gotten together instead of the typical rainbows and sunshine after their story is told. It definitely lends continuity and realism to both the story and characters. Well done! I can't wait for Sid's story and his particular brand of sarcasm! He may be my favorite but each of these books has held their own and this series has become one I've quickly soaked up.
$review_summary.: Loving this series!

$review_text.: This book is basically the author's way of exorcising his personal demons. Manz grew up idolizing a man named Adolf Hitler, whom most Germans believed to be a sort of messiah sent to save them from the devastating poverty and national humiliation following the Treaty of Versailles. The book chronicles how Manz (and many other pro-Nazi Germans then) got to believe in the things he did, and his eventual disillusionment with the Third Reich.Did the German civilians know about the atrocities of the concentration and extermination camps? Over the recent years, this question has loomed large in works concerning WWII in the European theater. Manz can't answer for every German during that period, but he gives us HIS story as an offering to further understanding in this matter.This book struck a very personal chord with me. Although I was born decades after WWII, I grew up in a country where the press (in fact, every type of media - books, TV, movies, etc.) was heavily censored by the national government. The government told people what to think, what to say, when to assemble, and throws those who defy their orders in jail under the holy name of &quot;national security&quot;. As a result, I totally understand how mind-numbing propoganda can be. A population, after all, is merely a collection of individuals living in a state. An individual's morals and personal biases are largely dependent on what information they have available to them. Hitler understood this very well, and with the help of his propoganda minister, Goebbels, managed to shape the thinking of an amazingly large portion of the German population, including the author's.Manz is all the more convincing because he doesn't get overly apologetic, but does admit that he's not in any way proud of all that he has done (he was a Hitler Youth, and later a soldier in the German army). He feels very strongly for the victims of the Third Reich (the book is dedicated to them), and although he was never in direct contact with any official programs dealing with the &quot;Jewish problem&quot;, regrets that he couldn't have done more.It is very touching to read books by those who were on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the war, especially those with a sense of morality (however late it surfaced) like Manz. This book is an important reminder to us of how dangerous bigotry can be, especially when it is led by an eloquent and convincing tyrant.

We all admire that nice yard and you know what it is usually the one that is right next to us too...go figure.Well, this book will give you the tools you need to start your yard off right
It is a basic book and it gives tips on things such as where to start in your yard for landscaping, where to buy the things you need, and what things are best to plant and least expensive


This book turns landscaping and gardening into a fun activity rather than a tedious one

$REVIEW.: Tatanka Iyotake - Sitting Bull - was not the killer of Custer.  He was certainly no villain.  He was a spiritual leader of our People.  According to my ancestors, who handed this story down to my generation, Custer killed himself rather than take what he had coming - and had fully earned - at the Battle of the Greasy Grass / what the majority culture calls "the Little Bighorn".  I'm a great-grandmother now, writing through my man's account, and I have no reason to doubt the truth of the story my ancestors told.We kept it among ourselves because of the repercussions we suffered back then, and still suffer today.  To this day, we Lakota out here in "Dakota" Territory are harrassed in every way, all too often.  Not as openly as used to be, but it's still there - the coffee-shop talk, the disparaging stereotypes, stuff like that.  I call it, "the Custer effect".  My People beat the crap out of Custer and his goons that June day so long ago, and whites have been crying about it ever since, and trying to "prove what really happened".Custer was no hero; he was a murderer of babies and women, unarmed warriors and the elderly.  Sitting Bull was a man of great pride and honor and strength.  This book is worth reading more than once.  Thanks for writing it!

More, I don't know, convincing maybe. I mean, I believe in Heaven and I believe in Angels, but if I were a non-believer this would not convince me anymore than the crazy lady standing on the street corner would. It was lacking some REAL revelations. Just my opinion. I did like the stories that were in it though, they were short, sweet, and simple.

$REVIEW.: Orthomolecular Medicine for EveryoneMegavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physiciansby Abram Hoffer, PhD, MD, FRCP(C) and Andrew Saul, PhD,2008, Basic Health Publications Inc., CA, 375 pages  [...]Megavitamin therapeutics? Whazzat? Do vital amines have health-restoring capabilities? In this book, two highly-qualified authors, Abram Hoffer, PhD, MD and Andrew Saul, PhD explain how orthomolecular medicine can help people feel better and live longer

In Part One, Dr
Hoffer (biochemist, physician and psychiatrist-retired) and Dr


Saul (health educator) teach us that: (1) vitamins and minerals are important to human health; (2) nutritional deficiencies can cause health problems; (3) many patients can restore their health by taking supplements; and (4) healing with nutrients only happens if each patient receives optimal doses (much higher than anti-starvation levels)


After introducing the concepts of nutritional deficiencies and dependencies and biochemical individuality, the authors outline the healing capabilities of vitamins, starting with B-3, an essential nutrient which has three names: nicotinic acid, niacin and niacinamide


Then Hoffer and Saul explain how orthomolecular doctors treat chronic illnesses and maintain health by prescribing regimens of vitamins A, B, C, D and E with trace minerals and other nutrients.Part Two details safe, effective and restorative orthomolecular treatments for nine health problems:(1) gastrointestinal disorders, (2) cardiovascular disease, (3) arthritis, (4) cancer, (5) the aging brain,(6) psychiatric and behavioral disorders,  (7) epilepsy and Huntington's disease,(8) allergies, infections, toxic reactions, trauma, lupus and multiple sclerosis and (9) skin problems.Will a poor diet drain our vitality? If we get sick, can nutrients restore our health? Consider mental illness; most psychiatrists quickly label patients, prescribe combinations of meds (antidepressants, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants, etc.) and talk to their psychoses

Non-responsive patients get electric shocks

Early in his career, Dr

Hoffer saw very few recoveries after patients got labels, meds, talks or shocks


He wondered whether psychotic patients might have metabolic disorders rather than neuroleptic deficiencies
Most doctors don't pay any mind if patients eat junk food or self-medicate with alcohol, oblivious to the reality that brain cells need decent food

Certain nutrients are essential

Psychiatrists don't often consider nutrition but Abram Hoffer went to the old school which taught doctors to assess root causes and contributing factors before making a differential diagnosis

As Hoffer evaluated biochemical and nutritional factors underlying psychosis, he discovered that foods and nutrients can affect mental health


Over his long and distinguished career, Dr


Hoffer fine-tuned patients' diets and prescribed regimens of vitamins, trace minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, energy and enzyme cofactors

These treatments helped many of his patients to stop hallucinating, rejoin their communities, work, pay taxes and live well
Impossible, you say?Initially, Dr


Hoffer networked with a small team of scientists and health professionals who cooperated to research and develop restorative treatments for schizophrenia

Linus Pauling, PhD, read Niacin Therapy, in which Hoffer reported his first patients who recovered taking niacin for acute schizophrenia


Pauling named it "orthomolecular psychiatry" (Science, 1968)

Dr
Hoffer explains the restorative dimension of care: "The practice of orthomolecular medicine recognizes that diseases are due to a metabolic fault that is correctable in most patients by good nutrition, including the use of vitamins and mineral supplements."Megavitamin therapeutics proved safe and effective


Many of Hoffer's acute schizophrenia patients recovered taking optimum doses of a methyl acceptor (B-3, niacin or niacinamide) with an antioxidant (C, ascorbic acid)
For more than 50 years, while researching and developing regimens of nutrients to heal psychosis and other mental disorders, Hoffer reported clinical progress and success by improving diets and giving medicinal doses of vitamins B-3, B-6, C, zinc and manganese
Thousands of patients recovered.Most psychiatrists ignored Hoffer's double-blind placebo-controlled gold-standard research


Without studying his ideas, experiments, data or findings, `modern' psychiatrists dismissed Hoffer's reports of a 75% recovery rate for acute schizophrenia
They did not interview his recovered patients

Believing that thousands of patients and their trusting families could benefit from complementary vitamins and minerals, Abram Hoffer somehow found the time to write more than 30 books and 600 medical journal articles and editorials
For decades, he wrote about the biochemistry of schizophrenia, described the healing capabilities of vitamins and other nutrients, recommended healthy diets and introduced orthomolecular medicine to patients, families, caregivers and health professionals

Hoffer's books include The Chemical Basis of Clinical Psychiatry (1960), Niacin Therapy in Psychiatry (1962), How to Live with Schizophrenia (1966), The Hallucinogens (1967), Smart Nutrients (1980) Orthomolecular Medicine for Physicians (1989), and Adventures in Psychiatry (2005)

This 2008 book, clear enough for every reader, is a classic example of Hoffer's thorough research, detailed references, careful observations and thoughtful writing.While prescribing vitamins for patients, Hoffer took the same daily doses of niacin and ascorbic acid himself (vitamins B-3 and C)
How many psychiatrists self-test their treatments? He experienced the niacin flush with two brief side effects: 1

warmth and 2


redness

He had no side attacks or toxic effects while taking vitamins, only side benefits


Abram Hoffer's decades-long personal experiment shows that the right doses of the right nutrients can help a doctor feel better and live longer
Will you live as long as Dr
Hoffer if you take vitamins B-3 and C? Maybe you will; note that Dr


Hoffer wrote this book in his 91st year.Anyone can read about the decades of research, study the references and consider the regimens which Dr


Abram Hoffer and his colleagues developed, tested, healed thousands of patients with, took themselves and wrote clinical success stories about, since the 1950s

Abram Hoffer and Andrew Saul wrote this informative, insightful, helpful and hopeful book to educate the public how we can restore our health, get proper medical care, adjust our diets and take supplements
Hoffer and Saul encourage us to eat foods that we can metabolize, and take nutritional supplements (vitamins, minerals and amino acids, antioxidants, energy and enzyme co-factors and essential fatty acids)


If we suffer from metabolic problems, deficiencies or dependencies, we can ask our health professionals to complement standard treatments with nutritional regimens

If our doctors don't know about restorative care, we can ask for second opinions.As you read this fascinating book, you will learn how to restore health and live well by eating nutritious foods and asking health professionals to recommend nutritional supplements

Ortho-molecular medicine has helped thousands of patients, for decades
Optimum doses of essential nutrients tested safe and effective

You can help yourself recover, feel better and live longer; then tell your friends and families!review by Robert Sealey, BScauthor of Finding Care for Depression, Mental Episodes & Brain Disorders[...][Historical note - Decades before Hoffer's time, malnourished and psychotic patients recovered from episodes of pellagra by taking niacin and tryptophan and improving their diets

Divided doses of vitamin B-3, as niacinamide, were also used to heal arthritis

W

Kaufman
In the 1950s, Dr

Hoffer applied his PhD in biochemistry to research schizophrenia, neurotransmitters and metabolic pathways

One evening he had a Eureka moment spotting a common chemical basis, an indole, in hallucinogenic compounds


He wondered if the human brain produces indoles and if so, might those metabolites cause hallucinations or perceptual distortions during episodes of schizophrenia


Dr


Hoffer found indoles by tracking the metabolic pathways of catecholamines, especially when the oxidation of adrenalin shifts irreversibly to adrenochrome (an indole)


1 or 2% of people, schizophrenics, hallucinate that way


Hoffer tested various doses of niacin and ascorbic acid (vit

B-3 and C) and had more Eureka moments as megavitamin therapeutics restored normal brain function in patients with acute schizophrenia.]

$REVIEW.: Many years ago when World War II was coming to an end, American soldiers started delivering food and supplies to the poor Germans in the bombed out houses. One of the pilots for these operations started talking to the children and hearing their stories. His name was Hal Halvorsen. Hal had two pieces of gum, and he tore them in half. Hal was impressed when the four children he handed the gum halves to tore them into strips and passed them out.Hal started thinking about his gum and candy rations and started passing all his rations out. Then his friends got involved, and soon he was being commemorated for contributing to the piece effort. Children started waiting for "The Candy Bomber" to fly over the designated areas.This is a true story of a man who was kind enough to share two sticks of gum and it morphed into something way bigger than he imagined.CHRISTMAS FROM HEAVEN is a beautifully done children's book, in hardback with a dustcover, and not only that but it includes a DVD with the book read by Tom Brokaw and accompanied by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. There are some really sweet moments in the DVD when Hal Halvorsen himself showed up, and members of the church dropped candy parachutes from above into the church.I would highly recommend CHRISTMAS FROM HEAVEN for a Christmas story for your family. It isn't "Christian" without any religious content, so it would be a suitable gift for any home, no matter their beliefs.I think this book would be great for public libraries, public schools, and even homeschool families. Great book.

$review_text.: William Stolzenburg's "Where the Wild Things Were" summarized the past sixty years of scientific discoveries concerning the importance of predators as keystone species--remove these vital carnivores from the "Web of Life" and entire ecological systems collapse.In this book, Stolzenburg recounts the history of predatory biology as a series of riveting mystery stories

In his capable hands, the stories read like literature; they are thrilling and exciting
As I read each tale, I couldn't help but feel like I was a voyeur tagging onto the coattails of one brilliant scientist after another, each one passionately hell-bent on finding the scientific truth buried in a puzzle of conflicting evidence
Eventually, when the facts fell into place, I was filled with the thrill of discovery
I can't recall many books that have made me feel so intellectually stimulated and delighted!I actually read this book twice

The first time, I borrowed the book from the local library and only spent a few hours browsing through the text, reading here and there, trying to pick up the sense of the whole
I had to return the book before I could read it in earnest, but that brief encounter did not impress me


Browsing the book did not unlock the magic in its pages


A few weeks later, my Advanced Readers Copy arrived and I took the time to settle down and give this book my full attention.I soon discovered that this is not a book to browse
To enjoy this collection of scientific stories, readers have to read it cover to cover--they have to give themselves over to the work and let the author pace their reading

Readers have to allow themselves the time to let each story play itself out from beginning to end

If they do, they will find that these tales will ignite their imagination and pull them along on thrilling journeys of scientific discovery.If you are interested in the concept of predators as keystone species, don't miss reading this outstanding introduction and history
This is one of those rare science books that help you understand the humanity behind the science


It is also one of those rare science books that help you feel the joy of scientific discovery.This book is highly recommended for both the professional and nonprofessional reader
The book is meticulously researched

For those who want to pursue the science further, there are fifty pages of notes and bibliography at the end.

$REVIEW.: I was drawn to this book because of Cora.  Cora is a likeable college student who is fighting, and losing, a battle with cancer.  As I read this I couldn't help but think of my dear friend who is also fighting cancer.  Cora is someone you want to survive. She has had a bit of tough life after losing her parents and then lost the grandmother who raised her.  She doesn't really have a family left but she has several friends who clearly love her.In this first book of the series Cora visits her oncologist hoping against hope that she will be offered a treatment that will really work.  Sadly her doctor has to tell her that she will not survive this battle but there is one option left.  This option is not explained to Cora... the doctor only hands her a business card and tells her to call the number on it.Without going into too much detail Cora, who has so much to live for, is offered a once in a lifetime chance at a possible cure.  What she doesn't realize is that there are major strings attached and even if she survives her life will change forever.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes a paranormal story with a unique, and likeable heroine.

$review_text.: Brian, Deidre, Eddie, Becky and Artie are on their way to a free retreat vacation that Brian has won.  There were supposed to be six on the trip but Cassandra and Artie had broken up.  He felt out of place on the trip without her but they all wanted Artie to come and relax.  They had driven for hours in the backwoods country and were near to finding the lodge.  Suddenly they saw a glimpse of the beautiful blue lake and the lodge was on the top of the hill.As they got out of the SUV, they had a run in with the old gray groundskeeper who left them with a warning, "It's going to be a long cold winter."  The man was obviously crazy as he was wearing shorts at the start of winter.They try to call Cassandra on their mobile phones to tell her that they arrived safely but they discovered they had no phone signal.  They were advised by the lodge manager that this is part of the wonderful visit they would have, no cell phones, no internet, no texting and even the lodge phones were down due to a fallen tree.  They were in total isolation to unwind and get back to the basics as the lodge manager suggested.The lodge seems very nice and at dinner there is quite a crowd in the dining room.  Family groups with a lot of children and the large buffet is very good.  Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.  The only thing that seems out of place is that the beds in the rooms are large old fashion hospital beds.  Brian tells them that the lodge used to be an asylum for about ten years before it was converted to a lodge.  It had quite a history...Thus begins a terrifying story of evil spirits, ghosts and death while trapped in a remote lodge.  Each of the characters faces a horrific and grisly ending at the hands of what seems to be a supernatural force controlling the lodge and the area.This is the second short story written by Drusilla Winters and it begins shortly after the first short story "Flight 666" ends.  This story is well written and action filled and I actually liked it better than the "Flight 666" lead-in story which was also a good read.  Drusilla makes the story flow and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next supernatural occurrence to take place.  This part of the book is about an hour read and is scary and enjoyable at the same time.Please note that I was not paid for this review but I was given a free Kindle copy of the book for reviewing purposes.

$review_text.: This is it, the `Classic' Lonely Planet guide and it's fantastic - a real 5 star job. Don't be fooled into getting the `Discovery' version of the guide or other LP derivatives. This is the version with the most detail and content. The full color pages are well balanced between a light weight paper stock and good quality matte graphics. LP used color throughout text to beautifully frame highlights, headers, icons and call-outs in a very sharp and sophisticated way. The maps mostly benefit from extra clarity and help filter out the noise from the key highlights.From a design standpoint it's hard to go back and look at a 1990's era LP and not think it reads more like a phone book - and what an evolution there has been. The sidebar information is prevalent and can add to the spontaneity of ideas when flipping through casually. I also like how destinations are highlighted via segments such as Berlin if you have one day, two days or three days.You also start to see LP moving in the direction of cut-away illustrations (a la DK Eye Witness) but they haven't really gotten the level of depth down. I like it because you don't need to bring along 2 guidebooks. (The DK books are always nice to look at, but are heavy and a little less practical).On the negative side:The geographic map of Germany in the front of the book has been drastically reduced in detail from previous editions. Now there are no road names and less cities - this is a step backwards.I recommend backpackers take an XActo knife to the binding and only bring the relevant sections.

It's like Scarlett made her choice and Fate decided she had made the wrong one, so it made the one it wanted her to make with a punishment attached to it.I will honestly say I was not leaning more toward one hero or the other.

$review_text.: Leon Fisher is an assassin and this was the one kill that his employers hadn't ordered; this was his revenge against the murderer who had brutally butchered his lover, Ted. However, killing the man responsible for Ted's violent death does not ease his pain and anger, instead it leaves him empty and sends him on a downward spiral into alcoholism and depression. His employer gives him an ultimatum: go to their mountain retreat in Alaska or be terminated. He has no choice but to agree.When he arrives at the retreat it is like a 5 star hotel with great food, staff and most leisure activities he could possibly want but he looks longingly at the forests rather than sample the indoor entertainment. Then one day he decides to explore, with disastrous results. He is attacked by a bear and almost dies before being rescued by a strange young man, Grim. After tending to his injuries Grim takes him to his cabin in the woods which is no more than a one room shack, where he recuperates and gets to know his rescuer.Grim is totally unexpected and unlike anyone in Leon's experience. He is painfully submissive, shy to an astonishing degree and it was obvious that he had suffered some sort of trauma in the past but he wasn't talking. He is rail thin, fragile and it seems as if a strong wind could blow him over. On the other hand, he is extraordinarily strong physically having lived out in Tongass National Forest in the Alaskan woods for years, practically fending for himself.Although Grim was uncommunicative at first, gradually Leon was able to glean snippets of his story which gave him a brief glimpse of his life of physical and sexual abuse and made him realize how much he wanted to take care of him. He was also falling in love. But they don't have too much time with each other before their pasts catch up to them and there is nowhere to hide. Their only options appear to be prison or death.It is no secret that I love Ally Blue's writing and each of her books that I have read brings something new and different to the table but in my opinion the characterizations and incredible world building in Untamed Heart make this her best book yet. This is a story about two men who appear to be beyond redemption - one is an executioner who kills for money and the other is almost damaged beyond repair, yet they rise above their human failings to love each other deeply and unselfishly. Ally's trademark hot sex between her protagonists was ever present and Leon was such an amazing and patient teacher as he tries to make Grim understand it's OK to enjoy sex and ask for what he wants. These two men really tugged at my heartstrings - tough, hard-bitten Leon who becomes whole again by loving Grim and gentle, shy Grim who had a terrible past, had been abandoned or used by just about everyone in his life and now has one sure, safe anchor.Ms Blue can be depended on to give her readers complex characters in her books but this time I think she outdid herself; I was so emotionally moved by Leon and Grim that they broke my heart. Using the savage and stark terrain of Alaska as the setting for this book is a stroke of genius and gives the story a richness and depth that made it even more impactful. I could feel the cold, crisp air and the natural habitat all around and when Leon and Grim have to kill animals for food it couldn't get more real.Untamed Heart is deserving of more than 5 stars but that is the highest rating I can give it on amazon. Any fan of Ally Blue who hasn't read this book should get it or they will miss out on what I believe is her best work to date.

When he meets Harlow, he definitely wants her&#8230;is attracted to her, but he never imagined how well she could fit into his life or how much he would need her to.Harlow also understands the meaning of family. She moves back home for her mom and works two jobs, doing all that she can so that her mom&#8217;s restaurant stays afloat. She&#8217;s not really looking for love, but she definitely feels a pull towards Scott when he comes into the Vet with his neighbor&#8217;s cat. But Scott definitely doesn&#8217;t fit Harlow&#8217;s checklist; in fact, he&#8217;s basically the opposite of what she thinks she needs/wants. She soon learns, though, that everything she thought about him was wrong, and the more she gets to know Scott, the more she wants to be with him, regardless of her list or the danger she may face by being a part of his world.Fierce is a great read&#8230;the violent and dark motorcycle world is not at the forefront of Scott and Harlow&#8217;s story, and I really liked that. There is some danger and one scene in particular is extremely gritty, but for the most part, the focus is on the idea of family and protecting them as well as how Scott and Harlow&#8217;s relationship progresses into something neither are willing to give up. Readers also get to reconnect with J and Madison, and that&#8217;s something that is always a great addition to a book in a series. The banter between Scott and Harlow as well as the sex scenes clearly show the connection they have and how well they complement each other. I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s ahead for both couples as well as Blade. In Fierce, readers learn more about Blade&#8217;s back story and boy is it a doozy. With the events that happen in Book 2, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more drama headed towards the Storm Motorcycle Club, and I for one can&#8217;t wait to see how it all plays out.Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review4 poison apples (The Fairest of All Book Reviews)

$REVIEW.: A pro wrestler serving as governor of Minnesota had varying degrees of success depending on who you ask, but there is no question that Jesse Ventura's story is one worth reading. "Don't Start the Revolution Without Me" is a combination political science book and memoir, as Jesse Ventura reflects on his time serving in office and what he has learned during that time and in the years following. Very opinionated and intriguing thoughts, he shares his ideas on everything from Barack Obama to the chaos of the current economy. "Don't Start the Revolution Without Me" is a read well worth considering for those looking for a true alternate opinion.

$review_text.: Ava March continues her sexy m/m historical trilogy with this second installment, featuring the fortune-hunting Julian Parker. Julian knows he prefers his lovers to be men, but he also knows that a rich wife will be his only chance at the kind of life he wants.Julian grew up as one of the poor relations in his family. His dad gambled and whored the family's money away, forcing them to leave London for America years ago. Now he wants to restore his family name in London and his is counting on his cousin Benjamin to help introduce him back into society.At his first ball, Julian meets Oscar. The young man is rich, generous and kind. The two become fast friends. And Oscar invites Julian to stay with him as a houseguest. It doesn't take long for the men to figure out they're both interested in an affair. And in no time, they are burning up the sheets.The sex scenes are really hot... and they're wonderfully realistic. Oscar is impossible not to like. He is so sweet and genuine. He deserves Julian's love and respect. But of course, those pesky marriage plans don't include him.I liked the story, though I could see Julian's big mistake coming a mile away --and it was no fun sitting there, waiting for him to make it. The HEA came in the form of an Epilogue, which made it feel a little rushed. I wish we would have had a little more time to savor their reconciliation.I'm looking forward to the final story in the trilogy! Almost 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: Pyramid lake is an amazing techno-thriller.  Enough to make you hold your breath in wonder but not so far fetched as to be totally beyond the realm of possibility (DARPA could really be doing these things).  Politics, government secrets, personal secrets, bribery, murder, and more become the maze through which Trevor Lennox must navigate. Even more than a maze it is a jigsaw puzzle that finally comes together for an ending that is truly unique.I enjoyed the book, its twists, turns and its intensity.  I highly recommend it.

The characters are under-developed, and there's a lot of legend and lore thrown in that could be really interesting, but usually just confuses the reader and slows down the story with last-minute explanations. Throw in allusions to time shifts and visions of the future that are never explained, and this book is more of a disappointment than an enjoyable journey.

$REVIEW.: Shakespeare as you've never read it before... Or are likely to again.This is a Young Adult fantasy novel that takes the stories of Romeo & Juliet and Hamlet and takes them into a fantasy land of Norse mythology. Simply put, the story follows Romeo and Hamlet as they take off into the afterlife in an attempt to rescue Juliet from death and learn about the magical gateway Hamlet is charged with protecting by his father's ghost (who also charges Hamlet with avenging his murder as per the original work by Shakespeare).There are Valkyries, Berserkers, Fenrir, large worm monsters, fire giants... A whole host of nasties, dangers and dramas on their quest... It was engrossing and oddly enchanting.The focus of this book is Romeo finding his Juliet.Hamlet's story barely has the surface scratched.I guess from the ending that the reason for it would be the fact there will be another book (which I didn't know going into this one).I find myself happy with that thought as the romance between Juliet and Romeo (when they find her) is kinda poor, especially when you consider they are the legendary lovers.I hate the thought that that's all we'd be getting for them.I also like that there will be a second book as the bro-mance between Hamlet and Romeo is really entertaining!This book is family friendly - early teens onwards - and would go down especially well if someone likes mythology but if they are hardcore Shakespeare fans they might want to avoid like the plague!*Review copy granted in exchange of a honest review*

$review_text.: Once again Quinn has done a wonderful job
Bringing all the characters to life to a point that you actually feel you are there with them travelling their journey

Feeling their highs and lows, joys and heartaches
You cry with them, you love with them.This is not the mark of a good author, this is the mark of an excellent author


She is able to remove you from the real world, you feel as if you are in Triks world, fighting the good fight with the dark king and his human queen.I would recommend Quinns books to anyone who has a sense of the realms that could possibly await you just beyond your imagination


If you like a bit of action, love, hate and just a desire to believe in something more, Quinns books really make you think and feel its all possible, if only you open yourself up to believe.

$review_text.: I have recently become fairly obsessed with DNA, evolution, and biology. This free textbook has given me a fantastic introduction to the basics which have enabled me to better understand the websites and other books I have since moved on to read. There are plenty of charts and diagrams, photos, and links to make the information come to life. There is some over-dependence on Khan Academy, but really who can judge them for that.In addition to the content, it has well-done teacher/student type activities which would make this a very useful book for homeschooling or even for use in school.My one complaint is that it tends to read a little young... but then again, it is intended for readers about 20 years younger than I am!

$REVIEW.: *Mild spoiler alert*This book has infiltrated my favorites list...And I almost didn't read it


I read The Opportunist months ago and swore off on this series because of how it ended
I'm a sucker for a clean, happy ending so that cliffhanger completely threw me for an emotional loop...And I didn't like it one bit


Having said that, Dirty Red sat on my kindle for months and months with no intention of ever getting read


Then I saw the cover of Thief and thought there may be redemption for me for this series after all (Tarryn Fisher, that hottie on the cover sealed the deal...you're a genius!)

And let's be honest...an entire, full length review can be written on the cover alone!This book is entirely from Caleb's POV (except for a chapter)


The depths he goes to in order to win his love (and life) back are incredible


I was frustrated some of the time with how wishy-washy Olivia is but it made absolute sense as to why they both had been running from each other for so many years

To think there were so many close calls for their relationship to finally have solid ground only to be shattered by a devious, sinister person (and each other) is heartbreaking.This series wraps up in a way that only Tarryn Fisher can do it

She doesn't wrap everything up with a beautiful bow and hand to the reader on a silver platter, that's just not her style, nor is it what Caleb and Olivia deserve


They battled and left a wake of heartbreak and disaster


They have never been hearts and flowers, so that's not how this series ends


Tarryn gives the readers exactly what they need...not what they want.Brilliant series!

$review_text.: In Love In a Pawn Shop, Bonnie Edwards has created characters who sizzle into life. From Dix Dixon, Pawn Shop owner, to Dane Caldwell, Philadelphia cop on vacation, to Riley, Dix's teen-age brother with attitude and problems, and Razor the pit-bull (though Edwards will object to that term) and Mitzi, Dane's madcap grandma,each character has a particular role to fill, and each fills it perfectly through Edwards's extreme talent. The problems: Dix wants to go to Paris. It's her dream-of-a-lifetime. For her to fulfill that dream, Riley, her brother, has to get a full scholarship to college. Okay, fine. Except Riley is seventeen, has less-than-desirable friends, and will lose the scholarship if he's got any kind of police record. With a cop--even a cop on vacation--on her case, suspecting Dix of scamming his old granny, Dix wants only to get Dane out of her life, away from Riley, and back in Philly. But she, well, she wants him. And he wants her. To make matters worse, her dog accepts him! What's a woman to do with all that going against her? Is she going to give up her dream? Is she hell!This fun, rollicking read is well worth whatever you may pay for it. Keep Bonnie Edwards high on your list of humorous, but sensuous romance writers. I sure plan to.

$REVIEW.: The title of Carol E. Wyer's book "Surfing In Stilettos" brought strange visions into my head. Once I started reading, I realized that it was internet surfing. I admit it was a letdown at first because I was looking forward to seeing how she could pull off some of those strange visions I'd had! It was only a short-term depression, however, because Wyer's writing style and her stimulating characters took me on a thoroughly enjoyable ride.Amanda Wilson, Wyer's down-to-earth main character, drew me in immediately as she rebelled against the mundane and frustrating moments of her life by trying to reignite passion in her life. She writes a blog titled Fortifying Your Fifties while vacationing in France. Her vacation, which turns out to be longer than she anticipated, and her blog open her up to all sorts of new adventures. Along with her newfound and her past friends, you will want to follow Amanda through her ups and downs, her foibles, her temptations, and her joy of discovery."Surfing In Stilettos" is the sequel to "Mini Skirts & Laughter Lines." Carol E. Wyer has a refreshing sense of humor. Having been given the title by her own blog followers of BOTUK, Bombeck of the UK, she showers you with comedy and heart, all wrapped up in British flavor and French eccentricities. Don't miss this book!

$REVIEW.: The description of the book sounded intriguing: a man returns to New York City every year to celebrate his birthday.  However, the other partygoers are dozens of versions of himself from different years (some in the past and some in the future).  The main character has managed to invent time travel, but how is not explained or even addressed in any way.  Further, the main character is so selfish and self-absorbed that he is totally unlikeable, and I had a very hard time caring what happened to him.  In addition, the book drags in parts, and overall I found it unsatisfying.

$review_text.: I absolutely swooned at the sound of Leeza Island &#8211; the tranquility and the quiet &#8211; like Skye, I am drawn to the peacefulness of creation, the simplistic way of life in the country. As the main backdrop for the story, I was thrilled to spend a few hours nestled in the trees near Puget Sound.Skye is easy to relate to &#8211; with a deep seeded fear that propels her desire for isolation and safety &#8211; she is both strong and determined to make it on her own. Her plan is deeply flawed, though, and the appearance of Danny on her solitary island causes quite a stir of emotion and turmoil.Danny is the hero we all wish for in a good story &#8211; steady and reliable, protective and kind &#8211; and yet, he has a past filled with trouble that moves him toward the very people and place Skye fears the most.I love the juxtaposition of Skye and Danny &#8211; how their strengths and weaknesses play out together. Danny&#8217;s reliance on Skye for life on the island is mirrored by hers on him in the big city. God&#8217;s role is not to be ignored as well &#8211; while Skye and Danny rely on one another throughout the narrative, God&#8217;s provision and grace is a key character. Ms. Leesmith&#8217;s words are never preachy, and she found a way to brilliantly display the work of God in gentle whispers throughout the book.Another favorite of her writing style is the subtle need to fill in the blanks. There are moments in the story where not every little detail is laid out for the reader, almost as if the characters have had snippets of conversions and bits of activity that aren&#8217;t detailed on the pages. I LOVE that&#8230; the room for interpretation, imagination, storytelling of your own.

$review_text.: I have read many memoirs about struggling with depression, mania, alcoholism, drugs, etc. It is a genre I really enjoy reading. That being said, this book was awful. I almost couldn't finish it, but I have never not finished a book in my life. I just found her character to be so annoying and unreal. The book didn't seem honest at all and the author comes off as narcissistic and neurotic. There doesn't seem to be any real reason or explanation for her mental illness, but she doesn't seem "crazy" enough to convince me that she is just crazy without reason. She has loving supporting middle class parents, yet needs to make her life more exciting by dating bad men and cutting herself. She comes off as just a bored, self-loathing girl who wants to feel like a tragic artist in New York. That's all fine with me, but don't write a book about it and try to make yourself seem crazier than you are. Crazy doesn't equal interesting.

$review_text.: Why Church Matters is a relatively quick read, consisting of only seven chapters and a section for discussion questions. I thought Harris could've elaborated in great detail on the topic, as this seemed a very basic (but accurate) overview of why Christians need to be involved in their local congregation. He covers some very important requirements, like doctrinal accuracy and clarity, but didn't explore the issues and obstacles in depth like I would have preferred.Harris makes good points with his chapters - why we need the fellowship with other Christians, how we can serve our community, and how to choose a church. This book would be a good starting place for people who are struggling to find a church within their community.Personally, I have some church "baggage" that has influenced the way I view church and membership. I was surprised and kind of grateful that Harris acknowledged that there are some bad church experiences, and he encourages the reader to not give up hope quite yet. Overall, I'd give this book 4 stars.**I received this book for free via the Blogging for Books program.

The Mets would triumph again in 1986 behind Darryl Strawberry, Dwight Gooden and Gary Carter.Excellent read by an excellent writer.

The book contains lots of good clear ideas upon which to build your own workout /nutrition program or tweak the one you have. And, the book contains some maybe not so good ideas - comparing yourself with others on diet & exercise. Everyone is a universe unto themselves. That was the 1/2 star deduction.Tim recognizes that you can't just workout and expect weight loss results. Diet is equally important. He did a great job of keeping food limitations in perspective and not overdoing the &#34;sacrifices.&#34;I've read several books on this, and Tim gets it.

$review_text.: This is a hard review to write. I'm really not sure what I thought of Butter. It was just way too different from anything I'm used to, so I don't have any books to compare it to.But I felt I could relate on some level to the storyline, as someone who is overweight and knows several morbidly obese people. I recognized Butter's behaviors as things that I'd seen in other people and even in myself. Though I don't think I've ever met anyone planning on eating themselves to death.I found Butter was hard to connect with, especially in the beginning, because he'd already given up. He'd reached the point that he really didn't care that he was already slowly eating himself to death, and wasn't going to try to change anything. But the further we got into the book, the more we were able to see about Butter, both inside and out. And by the end I actually found myself almost liking him.I really liked seeing how Butter used his music. Whenever he was bored or having a tough time, he would either turn to food or his saxophone. I've felt that so many times. If I'm having a crappy day, I'll either break out my stash of Snickers, or go play my favorite show tunes on the piano. I liked seeing how his music affected him throughout the novel.The writing was excellent. It reflected the overall attitude of the book, and Butter's emotions. It felt raw and real, and handled such a difficult subject with ease. And, though this may not be a good thing, Butter's completely morbid, twisted thoughts seemed almost logical!This book definitely isn't for everyone, especially those who have a tough time talking about obesity, but it will find a way to keep it's audience captive under it's flaky, warm, and very buttery spell.Language: Heavy (Multiple s*** d*** f*** g** b****** etc... )Sensuality: Moderate (Seeing as how Butter is 423 pounds, he doesn't get very far with any girls, but there's plenty of talk about that kind of stuff. Touching a girl's breasts is on Butter's bucket list. )Violence: Moderate (Lots of bullying. Butter jumps off a cliff. And eating yourself to death is kind of self inflicted violence. )Recommended age: 16+

$review_text.: &#34;We were introduced to Nat and Ghost in Friend Zoned and I knew immediately I wanted to know more about Ghost and Nat after their secret and very hot encounter

The chemistry between these two was definitely undeniable and the back and forth snippy comments only added to their attraction
I'll admit a few times Natalie's treatment of Ghost annoyed me but I couldn't stay mad for too long because the hysterical comments she would make made me adore her and left me with the giggles many times
Ghost was swoonworthy


Quiet, a hard-ass and fiercely loyal to his friends yet a bit of a softie underneath, something only his friends see of course

Yum!!I loved how their love story slowly unfolded


Their sexual attraction was never in question but when emotions are involved things got interesting

Nat turning to Ghost when something awful happens to her allowed them to spend time together and learn more about each other

Both Ghost and Nat have issues they needed to deal with and I liked how they opened up to each other


My heart broke finding out what Ghost went through as a child and Nat's compassion and protective nature towards him was heartwarming


Natalie's issues with having children was so sad and Ghost trying to help her work through her emotions made their relationship that much sweeter


Of course all the hot sex added a nice steam factor
:)After everything they had been through, I wanted to smack Ghost when he hurt Nat but I liked that it wasn't dragged out for very long and Nat didn't hold on to her anger


She stood her ground and Ghost took his lumps and they were able to work through it


I must say Ghost has quite an original way of apologizing

Wow!! Not everything was serious between them

The pranks they played on each other were hysterical! Nat and her sisters were great comic relief too


Laugh out loud with a great case of the giggles happened many times while reading their exchanges
I hope we get more of Nat's sisters


:)It was great to catch up with Nik and Tina and the rest of the gang

I love how close this whole group is and how much they care and protect each other

It's a big reason why I enjoy this series
Tina and Nat's relationship is so wonderful and Nik and Ghost's friendship and loyalty to each other adds so much to the storyline.Ghost and Nat's HEA was fabulous


I actually broke out the tissues when I realized what Tina was doing for Nat and Ghost


I wish there would have been more to that conversation and how it all unfolded

The ending felt a bit rushed (maybe I'm being greedy) but I'm looking forward to the next book in this series and seeing how Ghost and Nat's life has changed

$REVIEW.: This was a fun read and a sequel to Halloween Jack and the Devil's Gate


 I enjoyed it but I have to admit I liked Devil's Gate a lot better
 The original presented Jack's journey from ordinary man to Halloween Jack (and, to a lesser extent, his cousins too) and it was both wonderful and sad
 This one is more just an adventure story and a running &#34;how will Jack & Moira get out of the latest obstacle this time?&#34; theme
 I finished Devil's Gate in one sitting, and bought Curse of Frost instantly afterwards, but I did not feel that intensity with Curse of Frost.

$REVIEW.: If you're like me, you feel you have a definite future making to-die-for bejeweled adornments! I have actually ventured into the realm, and loved my brief forays. Like me, you may have felt stymied at several junctures, not knowing the specific techniques required for solid and elegant wire-wrapping, or the specs for creating intricate versions of basic chain maille.Jean Yates Northlight book, Links, shows you how to do wire-wrapping, make chain maille Queen Guinevere would have been proud to wear, and other techniques to get you successfully beyond attaching a jump ring to a charm, putting that on a chain and calling it a bracelet. With dozens of easy to follow, and large, clear photographs, Jean lays out a workbook of step by step projects to suit almost any style, from an Art House Bracelet, Elegant Underwater Earrings, and an Indian Summer Necklace, to my favorites, the Golden Flowers Earrings (delicate) and her Mandala Earrings (retro-cool).A few of Ms. Yates' references made me smile, the 'Sara Crewe' line of jewelry (yes, Sara Crewe, 'The Little Princess'!) and the Gigi Bracelet.A rather nice feature is found on several projects where possible variations are explored, including suggestions for additional color schemes. That's particularly helpful if there's a single piece you want to duplicate for gift-giving to friends with dissimilar color faves!The book commences with a thorough rundown of materials and techniques and progresses into the projects and instructions. There is a lovely metric conversion chart included, but I didn't understand, or really appreciate it being on the copyright info page; I would find it more useful placed at the end of the section on techniques, along with the Mohs Hardness scale which is at the very BACK of the book. But those are small details that don't really detract from an otherwise fun and useful addition to the jewelry maker's bookshelf.

I enjoyed the mix of action adventure, psychic intuition and a steamy romance which all served to push the story forward to its conclusion.  McCallan developed  believable characters that I felt I knew throughout the story....even the bad guys!  The sex scenes were pretty explicit, but did not overwhelm the main story.  If action adventure is your thing, suspense and mystery, and romance your draw, then read this book!  It was intriguing and thoughtful and I for one enjoyed it tremendously...I give it a 5 out of 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: Issue #1. This book is improperly labeled as "Pagan", and should instead be called "Wiccan Ways". These two terms do NOT mean the same thing. Things like the Wiccan Rede, the crede of the Goddess, the threefold rule, etc, do not apply to all Pagans. They are part of the Wiccan religion, which is Pagan. But not all Pagans are Wiccan.Issue #2. Wicca should not be refered to as "The Old Ways" when it was invented (or developed, if you prefer) in the 1940's. Yes, some older principles are present today in Wicca, but this doesn't mean the religion is ancient.Issue #3. There is no new information in this, and nothing that isn't already said in a thousand other books on Wicca. In fact, I found quite a few positive things about Wicca were omitted from this work, leaving it simplistic and insulting to real Wiccans.Issue #4. If you pick up one or two books on Wicca and Paganism, this doesn't mean you are ready to initiate yourself as a "High Priest", but the author of this book seems to think it does.This book is childish, misleading, and infuriating. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, least of all a non-Wiccan Pagan.

$review_text.: This book allows for absolutely NO kind of correction in dog training..It teaches that the slightest correction is abuse!!  It is very extremist.(Not that that is bad. Its good in the fact that it makes you aware that HURTFUL violence should NOT be a part of any dogs life.)The methods taught in here would most likely benefit either a dog who has been sorely abused (and therefore cant take any correction) or a person who is extremely sensitive and wants to try a radical new approach in dog training. (Techniques in here take way longer than the normal "leash correction" training.. Do not get this book if you are looking for a way to get your dog trained in a few months!!!)This book did provide good reading, and it does make good points in the fact that you should spend wonderful, decent, quality, loving time with your dog and prove to him you're there to protect him--BUT it goes in the opposite direction of the basic dog instinct.  Anyone who has studied dogs of the wild, has learned of the "Alpha" dog--the one in the pact who "is in charge," giving security to the others in knowing there is someone there to lead them. This book contradicts that and says its NOT true--going against everything people have learned about typical dog pact roles!!!  It states that there is no such thing as a "dominant dog" (except in emergency situations) and that in the household, you and your dog are "existing together as family", and you should never try to show dominance over it--undermining any power you have to show your dog that you are a capable leader for him to follow..setting the stage for your dog to start thinking that HE runs the show (and we know how aweful that can be!)!!  Now, anyone with a dog knows that dominance and submissiveness ARE a part of a dogs pact life..and the human family is looked upon by the dog as part of his pact--someone HAS to be the dominant one.. and you dont be it, your dog will!!This book is on lines with giving your dog rewards, rewards, rewards.. and praising him for every little thing.  WHICH IS GOOD..  however, if a dog needs correcting for something, the book goes against it!  You are not allowed to correct your dog for anything-- not even a tiny leash tug when your dog wanders the other way!!!!  I highly disagree with the fact that you can't correct your dog.  Dogs can and should be corrected..not abused, mind you.. but corrected.  GOOD Correction, when done the right way, and not abusively (such as the terrible teaching of rubbing your dog's nose in excrement) is very helpful. I firmly believe lots of love, praise, and affection should be giving to your dogs (I baby my 2 adorable collies!!) and have never hurt them or hit them or any other drastic thing--but I would have never gotten them trained if I would have followed the techniques in this book and never corrected them! (Have you ever seen a dog jump in a rose bush twice? NO ..immediate correction has its place in a dogs life!!)The good things about this book is the wonderful blanket teaching of being kind to your animal and respecting it, the wonderful chapter on nutrition that it includes (even recipes!!!), and the deep breathing/get in tune with your dog exercises!! For that I gave it 3 stars.. otherwise I would have given it 2
$SUMMARY.: Extremist point of view!!!  NOT a fast training method!

Until the alluring, tattooed waitress Aria Hyacinthe admits she's been living in her car.

I was captivated by the struggle Asher faces when trying not fall for Aria but she breaks down his walls and their love begins to be all consuming.

$review_text.: I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the concept of just seven days throughout the course of an eleven year relationship being able to define and shape it.  If you read as much as I do, you start to notice that a lot of storylines are very similar.  When I read the blurb I thought Unconditional Love looked like a book that would be different.There were a few hurdles I had to overcome right off the bat.  I usually don't care for young adult or teen love stories.  I have my reasons, but I don't really think you care so I'll spare you the details :).  Anyway, the book begins with Don and Jason meeting when they're 16 years old.  The first half of the book, three of the seven days, covers their relationship over the course of two summers.  Normally that would be way too much time spent with underage boys for me, but this book was different.I was immersed in their lives.  The boys were dealing with some pretty difficult situations that a lot of adults wouldn't be able to cope with.  The depth of their love and the complexity of their struggles drew me in.  I loved the innocent naivete they had even while their pain had me wiping away a couple tears.  The last half of the book covers their relationship through adulthood where they were still dealing with the aftermath of events from those first two summers.  I don't want to give anything away about the exact nature of their problems.  I'll simply say that the love from unexpected sources and the lack of it where it should be expected was brilliantly depicted.Unconditional Love is the perfect title for this book.  A lot of M/M romance can do passion, hot sex and angst but this book brought them all together in a beautiful story showcasing the many versions of love.  It was as if their bond was strengthened and tempered as they drifted in and out of each others lives over the years.  At times their story was heartbreaking and at other times it was uplifting.  I love books like this!

When he realizes he is dead and stuck between his condo and a void he drifts to occasionally he finds taking stock of the life he led and finds himself lonely when a beautiful woman finally moves in.Holly Andrews hasn&#8217;t had the best luck when it comes to men. After dumping her fianc&eacute; for cheating on her with a co-worker she longs to move out of her parents house and move on with her life. What she gets is the sexiest man she has ever seen and turns her on like no other but with one little problem, he&#8217;s a dead.This wasn&#8217;t a typical romance in the fact that one was other worldly but during their time together these two both did a lot of soul searching and began to change. There was plenty of sexy moments between these two and even a bit of suspense towards the end. As with romantic ghost stories you wonder how there can ever be a happy ever after with one alive and one dead. I have to say I loved the ending. If you&#8217;re looking for a sexy ghost to make your girly bits tingle Luke is the ghost for you.

$review_text.: This is one of the great books of Western Civilization, but the translation leaves much to be desired -- long, run-on sentences in long run-on paragraphs make the task of keeping the many person and place names even harder.

$review_text.: I was disappointed when I heard Asher's book was before Maddox Locke's. I thought this was going to be a filler book because we really didn't know much about Asher except he was Cooper's brother. Boy, was I wrong!This book jumped in with both feet to the bottom of Asher's hell. I had no idea his story was going to be so heartbreaking.Asher never expected to find love in his life. The two women that should have given him unconditional love tore his heart in two.All Asher wanted to do was protect Coop and show him a better way of life. That never happened.Chelcie came to Atlanta when Dee when she was Injured at her insurance agency. One night with Coop and Chelcie is pregnant. After Coop is killed Chelcie doesn't know what is going to happen. Asher has feelings for her that he is hiding behind his own painThey are on a very long, rocky road. Not even on speaking terms but wanting so much more.I LOVED this book. Asher is such a lost soul that finally finds his sunshine after so much darkness. I wish I had more stars to give.

She is an incredibly talented author. That being said I am glad I didn't know anything about this storyline prior to starting the book or I may not have read it, I tend to stay away from reading M/M sexual relations. I would have missed out on amazing book! Skye did a tasteful job in the sex sciences not to graphic and I thoroughly enjoyed going back seven years in the past and learning more about everyone.

It focuses on principally linear models of supervised learning
It provides important conceptual insights into machine learing and particularly the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting
It looks at this from a number of frameworks
The writing is clear


However, I was left wanting for worked examples and was disappointed that support vector machines and kernel based methods were not explored (thught they are mentioned).

$review_text.: Chic and Tabitha Cicero certainly are quite scholarly and respected in the Ceremonial Magick / NeoPagan world. However, they really rather detract and alter the potency of the original work by Israel Regardie.  To address those reviewers that say that somehow a Ceremonial Magic classic written in the 1930's is somehow "outdated" is really rather absurd. The Magick hasn not changed, nor haa the information and its validity changed. The only thing that has changed is the attention spans of the would-be Ceremonialists who don't seem to have the discipline to pour over the older, original works.  The original book was a required work for our magickal study group.  The potency of the Ritual of the Riutual of the Lesser Banishing Pentegram in magickal work and how it gets things moving in the Magician's life cannot be overstated.  It is the foundation upon which many High Magickians and Ceremonialists build their practice.Regardie quite rightly had caveats in place for those who would undertake the study of Ceremonial Magick to see if they were of sound mind and able to handle it. I personally agree with that approach. While the archaic form of the English language is not what most Llewellyn readers are used to, certainly the magickal instruction is sound.  Chic and Tabitha Cicero expanded the book to make it much more substantial than the original, but altering the spellings, and rearranging the information really adds nothing more than their own personal spin on the material - which really was not necessary.

$review_text.: I was not sure that I was going to like this book. It seemed to be specific to a handful of common problems that people have in life and since I didn't see much that related to myself, I thought it might be boring. That's not at all how I feel now, after finishing this great research work. If you loved the books "Journey- and Destiny of Souls", this is a must read, because you get more details on the pre-life planning stage that goes on in the life between lives.This book taught me some important truths: don't judge anyone else's journey here on Earth, because what looks like a wasted life, is probably a very noble and powerful life that you would really be impressed with, if you knew the whole story.This book takes you behind the scenes to show you the whole story behind many different lives that ended or were suddenly made more difficult. After following through all the details provided by people's spirit guides or their oversouls (channeled through several mediums), I now know that we plan our lives like a flow chart with many different "if this, then that" scenarios that our soul and our personality choose as they go through this school called 3 dimensional Earth.This book would also be very helpful to people mourning and dealing with grief.

$review_text.: I had taken game theory in my masters program. I wish this one book was available to me 10 years ago. It solves many problems in full details. (Please don't go by one poor review. Whatever he claims are absent are actually present in lesson 1. There are lots of applications throughout the book. Game theory cannot be understood without examples and applications.)The book is a must have for anyone who wants to dive at various levels of game theory.The book builds gradually from simple concepts to advanced concepts in a spoon-feeding fashion.Its been 10 years since I had lost touch and this book not just refreshed my concepts, but also proved that if a book is well written then anyone can be made to understand difficult subject like game theory. After reading this one book you will not feel that game theory is only for the elite or cannot be re-learnt after completing college.Once you cover lesson 1, you will be covering lots of lessons quickly because your fundamentals and foundations will be already very strong.Though I had some exposure in game theory (10 yrs ago), I am confident that anyone not exposed to this theory will equally understand and internalize the concept from this book.This review is for kindle edition:1.

It offers ganauche, basic icing recipes that you can vary throughout the book: it's simple, organized, and straightforward. However, non-hydrogenated shortening and non-hydrogenated margerine are staples in the icing which is brilliant but I don't know where to find non-hydrogenated shortening. Otherwise there are no really specialty items to buy. It looks really good.. i haven't tried it yet. But there are just enough pictures... not on every single page like some other overpriced modern-looking cookbooks... but just enough to show the important stuff. I want to buy Veganomicon now.

You'd get rid of a lot of garbage that way.Okay. I don't agree with every last detail Venker puts in her article, but it is food for thought. Regardless of your politics, left or right, feminism has hurt women far more than it has helped them. Now deal with it, those of you who pretend to be adults.Intellectual honesty and integrity.

At one point the author describes "wise, ancient spirits" who are suffering very painful lessons so that they can be closer to God.  Do you really want to take spiritual healing advice from someone who projects her own punishment agenda onto the divine (and you!) and glorifies suffering.

$REVIEW.: The Alchemist is an important book that is very worthwhile to anyone who wants to learn more about the Federal Reserve, central banks and how the financial crisis has been handled, from the inside.As I follow financial matters on a daily basis, I was amazed by how much I learned by reading this book. It appears to be thoroughly reported and researched. Irwin's work reflects how perspective and information can sometimes only be done through a book, not by reading day-day reporting.Irwin provides insight to the challenges that the world's financial bankers faced, how they dealt with them and interacted with each other, as well as members of their own government. I found the chapters on China and the US legislative process after 2008 to be particulary worthwhile.While not an easy or fast read, I don't think it is not intended to be. Overall, I highly recommend this book if you are interested in this topic.

$review_text.: HOMETOWN APPETITES: THE STORY OF CLEMENTINE PADDLEFORD, THE FORGOTTEN FOOD WRITER WHO CHRONICLED HOW AMERICA ATE is a medium-sized book with a long title that offers the reader a double opportunity: to learn about the career of a pioneering female food journalist, and to see many of the regional recipes she collected during decades of research.Clementine Paddleford grew up on a farm in Eastern Kansas and attended Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS, in the 1920s


 She majored in Industrial Journalism, a specialty that occasionally brought her into conflict with the magazine editors she served, who usually expected their reporters to have formal Home Economics training
 But Paddleford already knew cooking and home management, and from early on wanted to write

 After graduating from Kansas State, she lived in New York City, then Chicago, then New York again, slowly climbing the career ladder with massive amounts of initiative and hard work

 By the late Thirties she forged the affiliation that would make her famous:  the New York Herald Tribune and its glossy Sunday magazine, THIS WEEK
 In a combination of car, train, and self-piloting, Paddleford logged (by her estimation) 800,000 miles of travel in a decade and a half of research, coast-to-coast and border-to-border, seeking out and publishing in the paper and the magazine those home-made regional recipes that reached an appreciative and growing readership.Paddleford's crowning achievement is her 1960 book, HOW AMERICA EATS, which drew on that long research:  "I have ranged from the lobster pots of Maine to the vineyards of California, from the sugar shanties of Vermont to the salmon canneries of Alaska," Paddleford extolled in the introduction to that book, which was published in December of 1960 at the then-luxe price of ten dollars
 Even so, a canny investor would have done well to lay in a stack of HOW AMERICA EATS; today, used copies go for many times that amount; and a derivative volume, THE GREAT AMERICAN COOKBOOK:  500 TIME-TESTED RECEIPES: FAVORITE FOOD FROM EVERY STATE, has drawn mixed reviews for updating and altering some of Paddleford's original recipes.HOMETOWN APPETITES gives the reader insight into an ambitious country girl who, with lifelong effort and drive, cracked both the man's world of publishing and the women's world of food journalism, and succeeded at both, despite tribulations that included nearly losing her voice due to throat cancer
 Not coincidentally, the book includes 55 of Paddleford's recipes, durables like popcorn balls and strawberry shortcake, difficulty levels ranging from the easy (Chicken Avocado Salad) to the near "gourmet" (Trout Veronique with Hollandaise Sauce; "House of Schwartzenberg" Pot Roast)
 The writing style, by SAVEUR magazine editor Kelly Alexander and Kansas State U

archivist Cynthia Harris, is simple and engaging
 Especially at current book prices, HOMETOWN APPETITES is an excellent introduction both to food sleuth Clementine Paddleford and to many of her prize discoveries


 Highly recommended.

$review_text.: 4 1/2 stars.Just as well you aren&#8217;t physically sitting next to me, because I can guarantee you that I&#8217;d talk your ears off about this book

You wouldn&#8217;t even have to read &#8216;The Way Back To Me&#8217;! But that would be so sad, as I couldn&#8217;t do it justice

You would most definitely have to read it yourself


Oh yes

What a book! Seriously, the first page had me hooked, f-bombs and all! As I continued reading, I was excited to a point where I honestly thought that having to make supper in the evenings was pure torture, as I&#8217;d then have to put this book down
Life intervenes as it does, so I read whenever and wherever I could
Trust me


As I&#8217;m not one to specifically go out and buy books that are tagged as &#8216;erotica&#8217;, I&#8217;m quite surprised I&#8217;ve now read a few along these lines


I do think though that there is a difference between books purely intended to be erotic, and books that encompass eroticism

I classify this one in the latter

It&#8217;s a kind of self re-invention with sisterly help to begin with, and one that involves not only Lexi&#8217;s physical appearance but one that has her doing a complete mind-shift.Thirty-nine-year old, gracefully ageing, Lexi Reynolds is in a rut
She&#8217;s not happy with anything about her life (except her three adorable children), her divorce (the cold blooded murder of her marriage), to her non-existent sex life and much like most of us in the thirty-five to over forty age bracket &#8211; her appearance &#8211; feeling (we believe) frumpy, is not pleasant

Urgh! And here she&#8217;d teased her mom about her &#8216;turkey&#8217; neck

As Lexi says: &#8220;I guess Karma really is a bitch&#8221;


It will come back and haunt you


Lexi is preparing to go spend a week with her equally hilarious sister, Layla
She loves her sister to bits

Layla practically raised her

However, Lexi also hates her (I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s hate, but more of a frustration) because Layla is always trying to fix Lexi or her life


Infuriating

Prior to leaving she speaks to Layla on the phone where she&#8217;s told in a no-nonsense manner that there are a couple of books Lexi must read on her flight

Did Layla really say they were sweet? From what I gather, this alludes to particular BDSM books everyone talked about last year&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you all know which I mean


Anyway
Lexi drops the kids off at her ex, Benjamin

The reason for their divorce is that he took up with someone way, way younger which always seems to be the case
She meets an oldish lady, Mildred Cameron, on her flight who chats the whole way
She&#8217;s apparently returning to Dallas from visiting her son
This lady will eventually play a big part in Lexi&#8217;s life.After arriving and being shocked practically out of her skin at the way her sister is dressed, the week that follows is nothing short of hilarious and well, hot
Lexi is put on a diet by the ever bossy Layla, has to start running once again and meets two men who become important in her life


I&#8217;ll interject here because there is one scene when they are running that OMW had me gagging and laughing hysterically at the same time! Really? A scooch moment? I&#8217;d never even heard of this term, but it&#8217;s now permanently ingrained in my brain

I won&#8217;t elaborate, you&#8217;re on your own with this one, suffice it to say I&#8217;m laughing all over again

I have previously mentioned that I am the proud owner of a warped sense of humour


Back to the two men


The first one she meets was quite lovely or so I thought, but he then eventually gave me a cramp

Yeah, he too has issues but seriously, commitment phobics just grate on my nerves


So, I&#8217;ll mention the second one, Sebastian, because I really, really liked him even though sometimes he came across as too forceful, but hey I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve guessed by now what he&#8217;s really into


Mind you, it&#8217;s nothing like those previous books I mentioned, so don&#8217;t even go thinking that it&#8217;s all whips/chains/feathers and whatever else BDSM entails


He&#8217;s a plastic surgeon, and quite honestly as far as I&#8217;m concerned and although he makes no bones about ever committing and having children, deep down he&#8217;s so completely the opposite


Sigh


Lexi at first is torn between the two, but eventually realises that with Patrick Dane (a former sport star), there is no future

With Sebastian, it seems pretty much the same until Lexi is involved in a horrific accident


Sebastian who protested too much about &#8216;relationships&#8217; and &#8216;kids&#8217;, proved exactly what he&#8217;s made of


Again, sigh
Beyond wonderful.Although this book, which is meant for adults, had loads of swearing and sex (it has its place and it works!), it is by no means the be-all and end-all of what it&#8217;s about

It&#8217;s about friendships, sisters, a sense of family, loss, accomplishment, coming to terms with hurt and of course, love

I always believe that good things not only come to those who wait, but to those who deserve it

Lexi (I just love her) deserved it


Layla? Oh my word &#8211; I love her too
These two girls remind me so much of my sister and I (not that we get up to more than half the things these two manage to conjure!).I loved this book
It made my days that much more cheerful, put a spring in my step and &#8216;The Way Back To Me&#8217; had me smiling more than usual
I see now that the chemistry between these two really awesome authors (sisters) when they write, is superb
They did a phenomenal job with their debut

Regardless of what may come your way ladies, know that you have satisfied one very happy reader.There is going to be a sequel, which will be Layla&#8217;s book and I simply cannot wait to read it


If it&#8217;s anything to go by after reading what she&#8217;s putting Eric and herself through on this one, it&#8217;s going to be so good! It&#8217;s fair to say I&#8217;m a fan

Ms
Conlon and Ms
Waesch, could you please hurry up? Thank you.Get out of your comfort zone, kick back, pour yourself something decadent and read this book


You won&#8217;t regret it


Before I forget, I must mention that as far as I'm concerned I loved this book over all three FSOG's put together
Not only is it more entertaining, but it's better written

I&#8217;ve given this book 4  stars, and the other  I kept for personal reasons
However, 'The Way Back To Me' has now become my second favourite book for 2013! Fabulosity.I had to add this moment between Layla and Lexi, when Layla hands her a gift
Beautiful.&#8220;Why&#8221;&#8220;Because you need to be reminded of who you are and how I see you
I used to be so jealous of you

You used to be so carefree and exuded confidence
Did you date losers? Sure you did
But you always picked yourself up, dusted yourself off and never gave up on believing in yourself or your dreams
I won&#8217;t say that I settled for Eric, but I don&#8217;t deny wondering what I missed out on because I got hooked up with him so early in my 20&#8217;s


But you always got out there looking, never settling

I love you, but I want my sister back

I think your girls deserve to see who she is, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8211;Layla to Lexi

$REVIEW.: I recently bought an electric grill that came with hardly any information so I bought this to help me get an idea of how long to grill different foods. So far, I've found that most of these recipes require things I don't have in the pantry and the cook times do not correspond with my grill (2 steps below high for chicken for example took about 25 minutes when the book says it should take 12). It has all kinds of side dish recipes but I just wanted a book that would give me recipes and times for grilling only.

$REVIEW.: I downloaded The Barkeep with great anticipation but having plowed through 40% of the book I find I can no longer continue reading it. Perhaps it was my own expectations that led to this disappointment; I am a fan of old style thrillers/murder mysteries by the likes of Robert Parker, John McDonald, and Nelsen DeMille. I expect a novel to have an identifiable protagonist and a plot that has overall direction&#8212;this novel has neither. The characters are all distinctly unlikable, the barkeep himself is a cypher and I found myself not caring if any of the supporting characters lived or died. The plot just sort of mills around, revealing little of importance beyond the general duplicability of the entire cast of characters. The most inventive thing about this book was naming the chapters after drinks. If new age nihilism is your thing this might be OK, I found it a tremendous waste of time.

This is the story of Carla, Heather's friend from book one, and Andy, the accountant that works in Carla's office, and everything Andy goes through to try to make Carla his.  Let me tell you, any normal man would have given up on Carla.  Andy looks at her as a woman he can tame and he's not giving up without a fight!

$REVIEW.: Do Nothing!: How to Stop Overmanaging and Become a Great LeaderThis book challenges the usual thinking pattern about leadership. It is highly recommended for any leader, but especially for people that assume a new leadership role in any kind of organization.The things (skills, behaviors, knowledge) that made a person successful in one level are not the same that the ones he/she will need in a higher position. If you are not able to assume the new skills that are needed, you could fail in your new role.The book gives plenty of useful advise to made the transition to a leadership role in a smooth and smart way.I really enjoyed reading Do Nothing.

$REVIEW.: I didn't read the description thoroughly before purchasing and reading the book. It's a gay romance with a lot of life in a small town thrown in. Two men, both with a lot of baggage, meet each other. One, a cop, is &#34;out&#34; only to his immediate supervisors and is still recovering from a hate crime in another state that killed his love and partner of 5 years. He's been alone since then. The other, is a threadbare handyman and cafe cook who is very private and doesn't talk much.The people of the town and the characters and the plots of different incidences happening on the beat are realistic and well-drawn.For myself, I skip graphic sex scenes in all books, so I skipped a lot of pages in this book.As a gay romance and a story ... it was well-written. Sort of a cozy, gay mystery/romance.

$REVIEW.: I profess to be an amateur historian as I have no degrees to back-up the vast readings I've done on WWII and a small part to WWI. So, I'm always looking for something new and interesting. Sadly this one missed the mark.It does cover WWI in less than an hour and that is the problem. The reader is introduced to the facts and only the facts, yet the author fails to make any mention of the American Expedition in Russia. Yes, American troops were attempting to bring down Lenin and the new Communist government.I did like the introduction on what triggered WWI. That was good, but from that moment on, it left me flat. There is no definitive time line which could easily thwart new readers from garnering any interest in the "War to End all Wars." I did enjoy the Appendix where the reader is truly introduced to the main players and their interesting backgrounds. Well done.I believe if a more structured time line was implemented it would be easier to digest.

$REVIEW.: This book is a fun, quick read for those that are looking for a romance story with some action, some laughs and some fun characters. Mo owns a restaurant in a small village in Wisconsin and is trying to re-start his life anew. He is trying to put the issues of his past behind him and try and build a foundation for something better in Wisconsin. His sous chef Rosa is also trying to start her life again as well, while getting through a rough divorce. Rosa, like Mo, is trying to build a new foundation to her life and finding some bit of happiness amiss bitter filled divorce. One of the things that I liked best about this book was the main characters were in their late 30's. I liked to read about more adult and mature characters, not the typical early 20 something beauties will tons of family money stories that are around. It was nice to see characters who had lived life and found some things lacking with the choices they made. I find that rings true for most people and it is nice to know that romance and love can blossom at any age bracket. Dating can be more  challenging the older a person gets and it was nice to see the author treat that with humor and grace.The pace of the book was quick and it kept the reader involved until the very last page. I've lived and grown up in small town Wisconsin and the author portrayed the setting very well. There is that feeling of a small family setting, where everyone knows everyone, and a person is not able to keep much secret at all. The towns do tend to band together to help one another out and it can at times be stifling too. The one thing that I didn't enjoy so much in the book was the portrayal of the mafia and New Jersey characters. I felt that those characters were less real and more shallow in depth. The mafia part seemed a bit over the top and unrealistic for the most part. I'm sure that there are the typical Jersey people out there, it would have been nice to have seen less stereotypes and more real character feel to themI would though recommend this book to others and I am looking forward to reading more from this author. All in all the book was enjoyable and I had difficulty putting it down until the very end. Even than like a god Italian meal I was left wanting to read more and see more from the little village and characters.

$review_text.: I found this book when it was offered for free on a Kindle Facebook page and being I am a huge fan of the supernatural/wicca/suspense genre, I thought, "what the heck"! I admit to being VERY leery when I first started reading this book...it is as it says, very modern! Yet, after just a few pages, I was totally drawn into the story. Ms. Geary brings in so many quirky, lovable, powerful, varied and sundry characters (which gives me hope that this series will be a long one)that I fell hopelessly in love with all of them! I finished the book in less than a day (and that with a normal eight hour work day...did you know you can prop a Kindle behind a work laptop and no one is the wiser?! Well, it helps if you're the boss as I am, ha ha). Any way, I digress...I always see many reviews that wax lengthly and eloquent on plot twists and turns, but what fun is that, I'm not going to spoil anything for you! If you love a good witch tale as I do, you will love this book. As soon as I read the last word of book 1, I purchased book 2 and am now happily half way through. So, definitely 5 stars from me! And if you're like me, a bit leery of a witch story that strays from tradition and enters the modern world, never fear, it completely works! Thank you, Ms. Geary for giving me a whole lot of GREAT reading to look forward to! Blessed be! :)

$review_text.: What a strange book
Having kids control adults and make them commit sabotage is spooky

Having kids actually committing murder goes beyond that.Our protagonist, Hesketh Lock, is as strange as the kids
His inability to understand human relationships (or to actually be a constructive part of a relationship) is offset by his ability to find patterns and trends in series of events

He constructs origami figures both literally and figuratively to isolate himself from other people

He constructs Venn diagrams to organize data and make connections between those events.His one relationship is with the son, Freddy - actually the son of his ex
Freddy and Hesketh have some ability to communicate with each other


But, that could change.The violence and accidents and deaths are somehow being caused by the younger members of society


How and why this is so is the thrust of the book.This book is quite different from the normal fare and would appeal most to those who like new takes on old themes.I found it to be disturbing but quite well written
I'll check into other books by Jensen.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the book somewhat.  Not quite what I thought it was going to be after waiting for the second installment. Page count was really low and story was over to  me before it got started. Many questions left open in the story. If Xay had the package, then kent has the package also. Good thing Thrill believes in covering his sexual attacks cause I got a felling part 3 will reveal Kali going to get a REAL surprise in her life.  I liked the way the author put in a pregnant pause when Xay was about to spill his guts about what was happening in his life, but the phone call Kali got from Kent interrupted that revelation, thus prolonging the storyline.  I like longer stories and would rather pay a few more bucks for a longer novel than a teasing 122 page count story that only teases.  Like the saying goes &#34;hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!&#34;  Several twists and turns in this one.  Hope the next one is better!

$review_text.: This book covers a lot of self-help, positive thinking, law of attraction associated material


 It includes a compilation of biographical stories from a range of contributors - people ranging from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to Musicians Paul Anka and David Foster
 The core of the philosophy in this book is what you think is what you will attract into your life, as well as a philosophy of becoming an independent thinker and pursuing your dreams fearlessly

 Some of the sections in the book are very thoughtful and empowering
 For me, the frequent Biblical references are a drawback, as the Bible is filled with stories that can and have been interpreted in various ways for various agendas
 It's not wise to imply that The Bible is the ideal source of wisdom and guidance even though there are a number of valuable quotes and stories there - quotes from other spiritual traditions or philosophers could have been included to make this message more universal and inclusive
 Another thing about this book is that it's not that cohesive..

the biographical sections often go in tangents that don't seem to have much to do with the main teachings presented by the author
 So while this book has some good material for readers I found its content inconsistent and not as good as some other spiritual self-help books that are available.

$REVIEW.: Mac's tough, and attitudal, and kick-a$$, and thinks she knows it all before learning she really has no idea.Winn is nerdy yet cute, smart yet tough, and nothing at all like the kinda guy Mac should be ogling after.Yet, when the two are pushed together through class assignment, they somehow end up far closer than Mac would have considered possible. He is a human after all. Blech! In Mac's eyes, she has no need for humans--they're no more than weak beings she has nothing in common with.She couldn't be more wrong.And pretty soon, Mac ends up needing Winn way more than she's comfortable with. Luckily for her, he's a helpful kind of guy.And a cute one.And buff.Traits which only lead to make his nerdiness hawt.I don't really want to say too much because I don't want to give the story away. Just know this is a tale full of action, twists & turns, surprises (for the character as much as the reader), supernaturals galore, humour, wit, whacky characters, and some real LOL moments.Learn about Mac as she learns about herself--and (BONUS!) get to spend some time with Winn in the process.Oh, and as this is the first instalment in a trilogy? I can't wait to see where this one's going next.

$REVIEW.: Her Island Destiny by Annie Marshall is a time travel romance set in 13th Century Scotland.  Though this book can stand alone, Marshall's novellas Her Highland Destiny and Her Noble Destiny should not be missed.The Scottish Highlands and its history are already a magical setting on its own, but Ms. Marshall's story draws you even further in and by the time the book is finished, the reader feels as though they have journeyed to the past themselves.Cian MacKyleakin, with his giant seven foot frame was as powerful, as he was vulnerable and it was refreshing to see such a brawny highland laird in that light.  However, this special man needed the right woman and Annie didn't disappoint with the heroine in this entertaining read.I absolutely loved Isla MacKinnon's character, and loved how the author was able to maintain the heroine's strength, even while Isla had moments throughout the book where she battled with PTSD, and the horrific memories of her past.  Isla was a character I could completely relate to, and my favorite scene was when she is being introduced to Cian's clan in Orkney.  When she opts to be introduced as the Laird of the MacKinnon, rather than Cian's betrothed.  His response is priceless, and had me laughing out loud.Her Island Destiny was an amazingly fun read, and I was able to devour both novellas and this read in a weekend.  If you're looking for a great book that is packed with magic,  action and romance Her Island Destiny by Annie Marshall is a must read.  I was pleased to see it ended on a hanger.............that means that there is more to come from this story and author.  Absolutely loved it!!!I received an ecopy of the book from the author.

$REVIEW.: If you're one of the millions of rightwing viewers fooled by the Fox "News" tag line that they're "Fair and Balanced".... If you're one of the millions who fall into the cult of Fox that THEY are the only ones who tell you the truth and everyone else is just part of the biased "liberal" media .... well you're in for a rude awakening.Mark Howard has done a masterful job documenting the shamelessly misleading headlines and many of the outright lies that Fox Nation, the internet arm of Fox "News", pushes out every single day. It isn't just that they manipulate the news, they literally make it up. Throughout the book, taken from posts from the website News Corpse (The Internet Chronicle of Media Decay), example after example demonstrate that whenever you see a headline on Fox Nation, you can assume it isn't true. Most of the book deals with distortions of President Obama's speeches and record. But, as a Massachusetts resident, another case jumped out at me. In the Massachusetts Senate election of 2012, democrat Elizabeth Warren, running against GOP and Tea Party darling Scott Brown, stated "We've got bridges and roads in need of repair, and thousands of people in need of work. Why aren't we rebuilding America? Our competitors are putting people to work, building the future. China invests 9 percent of its GDP in infrastructure. America, we're at just 2.4 percent. We can do better. We can build a foundation for a strong new economy and get people in Massachusetts to work right now." How did Fox Nation headline that statement? ELIZABETH WARREN PRAISES COMMUNIST CHINA.Read it people. Not only is the book very informative and a bargain at that price, but think of all the talking points you'll have next time you argue with your crazy rightwing uncle.

 Four stars because it had a bit of drag, building up to #6, and seemed very much like a prequel to that

 Still, the characters are well-written with enough turns and twists to keep you guessing even about those you thought you knew well from the previous books

$review_text.: An Anglophile American reading this articulate, comprehensive, chilling, manifesto is bound to have two reactions
The first will be, 'I didn't realize it was as bad as this.' The second, dawning more slowly, will be 'How long before it gets this bad *here* too?'Peter Hitchens argues that during the last decades, broadly speaking the era between Sir Winston Churchill's funeral in 1965 and Diana, Princess of Wales's in 1997, Britain was abolished
Not the land mass itself, obviously, but instead everything -- everything -- that once defined what it meant to be British

In chapter after relentless chapter, Hitchens shows the march of 'modern' PC orthodoxy through the Anglican Church, the marriage and divorce laws, the television and radio, the education system

History, the political system, the language, ancient ideas of loyalty and patriotism, virtue and service, even the very shape of the land itself ..

all have within living memory been reshaped into something new, different -- and completely divorced from the past.Many people have noted these changes


Hitchens' contribution lies in showing that the changes were not coincidental, but instead were deliberate, orchestrated even, and that many of the same activists were behind the various facets of the assaults.Again and again, Hitchens produces evidence showing the arrogance and self-righteousness of the self-anointed 'reformers.' Again and again, they say, 'We recognize that the British people love the old ways, and that there is no popular clamour for change


Nevertheless, change we must.' Hitchens argues that what the 'reformers' have never been able adequately to answer is, 'Why?' And more to the point, 'Why was it necessary to destroy the old way, and make the new way mandatory?'Why, indeed? Why, for example, is Britain now jailing farmers and shopkeepers for using Imperial measurements instead of metric ones? Why is the government trying to abolish trial by jury and the right to self-defense?Sad to say, this book, while insightful and spirited, is almost unrelievedly depressing
It is literally only in the last few paragraphs of the final chapter that Hitchens offers any sort of hopeful outlook ..


and even then, it is only to suggest ways to keep the future from becoming yet bleaker


What has been destroyed has been destroyed forever.Indeed, it's sad to note that in the year or so since this book came out, things in Britain have in fact gotten worse


Tony Blair has taken yet more steps toward a presidential style of government, shoving aside still further both the monarchy and the House of Commons
I'm sure Hitchens finds no joy in being a prophet, but he seems to be, unfortunately, on the right track.For anyone who loves Britain -- and especially for Americans whose idea of Britain is shaped by 'Masterpiece Theatre' and other PBS offerings -- this sad, wonderful book serves as the gravestone of an idealized vision, and a warning to our own country.

$REVIEW.: The Jehovah's Witnesses published a fine book here

It places the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in chronological order, pedagogically telling the tale of Jesus' birth, how he taught, his miracles, and all the way to his death.The Witnesses present a great narrative that should be looked at by everyone

The book is also wonderfully illustrated in fine detail.The Jehovah's Witnesses' religious spin on the story is somewhat fundamentally different than other Christian interpretations
One of those differences is that they don't believe Jesus was nailed to a cross

They profess that he was nailed to a torture stake

Second, they believe that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, which most other religions teach that Jesus was God in the flesh and apart of some holy trinity

The third difference is that they don't believe that the spirit goes to heaven when you die

They believe in the resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous during the conclusion of this system of things, and they don't preach about hell fire because they don't believe in it

The fourth belief is that they believe that Jesus is Michael the Arch Angel.Other than that this book pretty much jives with what most Christians believe about Christ and his Apostles

I recently started studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses again after almost 20 years and I have to say it has been an enlightening experience, and they do use the Bible and contrary to most peoples' belief their "New World Translation Bible" jives with other versions of the Bible, in other words their bible says the same thing everyone's does including the King James Version.You can get a free copy of "The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived" by just asking a Jehovah's Witness, visiting your local Kingdom Hall, or writing to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.Believe it, or not this is a five star read and I'm so glad I've started studying with them again because there is a certain hope for the future and an inner peace that comes with it.

$REVIEW.: Kat is a treasure hunter in a post apocalyptic society.  With the help of her friend (and sometimes lover) Damien, she hopes to save enough money to one day make it to "God Country" where the earth has recovered from the devastation left by the wars.  When she finds out one of her arch-enemies, Hades, is in search of the Monolith, Kat makes it her goal to get to it first.Oh, where to start with this one.  First, I liked it.  It was edgy, gritty and full of action.  I loved Kat and her bad ass, take no crap attitude.  I loved Hades and how that big tough man had a soft squishy center for Kat.  The chemistry between the two of them was instantaneous and kept you entertained by either their barbs, jokes or sexual tension.But the story was so much more than just the relationship between Kat and Hades.  There are the mutants, the vampires and the Vampire King, Baruch, who is determined to have Kat at whatever the cost.  There is the change in relationship between Damien and Kat and what that change ultimately costs her.This was definitely a fast paced ride that was a thrill to be on.  My only regret was that it ended.  This was definitely one that any PNR/UF reader would enjoy and should pick up now that it's been repackaged and re-released.

 I could not put it down


 At first I was afraid that this book would be one sex scene after another with bondage included


 I was wrong

 I had this book sitting on my shelf for over a year but did not venture to read it because of my fears


Now I wished I had read it sooner


 I thought the book moved right along
 I liked that the two main characters where in the story almost the entire time

 Some books I have read where the author is so busy setting up the story for her next book with the characters to be in that book, that the characters in the book you are reading get lost in the planning

 I also liked that Ms
Cameron's Vampires were not bag sucking vampires but took blood from the vein

 Too many "new age" vampire books tend to lean toward bag sucking

 Ugh!This is the story of where people are being murdered with the familiar bite marks that Detective Victoria Tyler recognizes all to well


 Why?  Because at one time she was married to a Vampire

 Her job is on the line and she needs the help of a powerful Vampire whom she also knows well, as she shot him once


 Michael, who is owner of a club and hot and sexy, agrees to help her with one condition.....her neck!This book has sex scenes but is not overdone
 It also has the best thing of all and that is love

$review_text.: Murach's next entry in their upgraded OS/390 titles has arrived and you won't be disappointed.  Raul Menendez updates the prior (1980) edition of their MVS JCL text.  The result is a JCL training and reference book that should be the first book anyone aspiring to work on the OS/390 or z/OS platforms should acquire.The first two chapters give a very condensed, but extremely thorough introduction and overview of IBM's mainframe environment from a hardware and operating system perspective.  Since we continue to see forecasts that there will be a growing shortage of programmers for this environment, this is exactly the type of "quick start" introduction that will help bring new programmers up to speed.  Chapter three gives a very quick overview of ISPF, enough to get started using ISPF to accomplish basic editing, submit jobs, and review job output.Following the introductory section, Job Control Language is covered from the basics of statement format to how to accomplish more complex tasks - managing program execution, allocating disk and tape datasets, handling special circumstances of SYSOUT datasets, and using procedures.  More advanced JCL skills, including conditional processing, job restart/recovery, creating and using generation data groups, and using the Storage Management Subsystem to allocate datasets is covered in the next section.But this is much more than a simple text on Job Control Language.  It includes a section on the basics of Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM), along with JCL required to create and use VSAM datasets.  The chapter covering Access Method Services (IDCAMS) includes just about everything an application programmer will need to know to create and manage VSAM objects.  The most commonly used IBM utility programs, such as IEHMOVE, IEBCOPY, and IEBDG are explained with examples for their use.  And the chapter devoted to the Sort/Merge utility covers both stand alone and internal sorts along with the most common sort control statements.The book concludes with a couple of chapters that will provide the reader with a working knowledge of CLISTS, REXX, and UNIX System Services.  With the inclusion of the information about SMS and UNIX System Services, the text is desk ready for programmers working in a z/OS environment, IBM's current version of their flagship operating system.  But this book will be equally usable by programmers working on earlier versions of OS/390 and MVS.  Murach's "paired page" format is easy to read for those using the text in training mode and also makes this a great choice for use as a reference tool.

$review_text.: I enjoyed this story. I want to put that out there, first off. But it had enough ... disjointedness?... to make me stop reading it several times.*Synopsis can be found in other reviews*An example is there is generally very little cussing. During the intercourse scenes, the female character Emily curses quite a bit. Yet it really seems forced, unnecessary, and out of sync with the story. Or how she says that she talks like a sailor and she really doesn't. She speaks... normally. No cursing. No insulting even. She's not even a casual curser. (I am NOT mourning the lack of cursing, mind you! I'm just saying that to be constantly told X, never really seeing X, and when we do see X you can tell that X has no place there, it's very jarring).Also there is this character Mick. Every time she starts writing about it, it immediately becomes confusing and choppy. She gets taken to a bar (in the beginning) by Mick. 5 seconds later she is horrified to have ever spoken to any male other than them and she has all this loyalty to him and his girlfriend the captain. And then everything is a secret and shameful from there on out, when there is no basis for this loyalty to a friendship that is never really shown. It's very jarring and horrendous. Seriously, at 74% through the book, Mick has shown up again and curses at her and she's all scared of his sensibilities. Mick is also the least character in the whole book! He has no personality, no real role, and he's not even in there enough for him to matter! Yet he's somehow a main character!?!? There's a REAL side character, Tink, who I know more about, care more about, and she's been mentioned even less, with no back story or anything, but she's real and has a personality!Also the main character is an older post-menopausal woman as is the protagonist. The author keeps reminding of this (which is good, even though annoying, because in my mind they always are mid-30s unless plainly stated otherwise). But over halfway into the book, however many sexual positions later, and she's shy about her guy seeing her after a bath? Maybe old(er) people are so very indecisive and change their minds so often that they can't be expected to be rational or consistent? (I don't think that is actually true in real life, but that is a bit how her character is portrayed).I like her settings/the weird hybrid fantasy world she's created. It's definately had some cute and/or funny moments. But issues such as I've mentioned above literally stop me dead in my tracks EVERY time they appear and break me out of the world that she's providing.

$review_text.: "Against All Hope" is Armando Valladares' account of the near-quarter century he spent in Fidel Castro's Soviet-style gulags. Valladares was arrested shortly after Fidel's revolution, simply for not placing a Marxist slogan on his office desk, that would have required him to deny his Savior, Jesus Christ. Several days after this refusal, his house was stormed in the middle of the night, and he was hauled off to prison in Havana, with his mother promised that he would be returned shortly thereafter. Valladares didn't see her in freedom until 22 torturous and terror-filled years later.The greatest thing Armando Valladares has done for the free world is to shatter the myth (CNN and Jimmy Carter, not withstanding) that Fidel Castro's Cuba is a semi-free place, persecuting only a handful of capitalists and subversives. Valladares tells story after story of hundreds (among tens of thousands of others) of prisoners he knew personally, who were tortured, maimed, starved, and executed. Scores of these prisoners Valladares came to know were not upper class or "white" but poor "campesinos" (and many black Cubans), many of whom once fought for Fidel Castro and Che Guevarra's Revolution... only to have that Machine of Death turn and kill them as well.After nearly 400 pages of death and terror at the hands of Fidel Castro and his minions, I found myself wanting to just close the book and forget the rest. But then, I realized that's what the United Nations (ah, what a noble-sounding title that is) and the Western elitist Left has been doing for years with Castro... ignoring his terrorism. Ultimately, I was glad I finished the book, because even though Valladares does not put some lame happy spin on the story, he is at least freed (22 years of his life stolen), and now he can openly speak the truth of his Savior, to Fidel's power.
$SUMMARY.: Valladares' amazing survival of Castro's prison camps.

$REVIEW.: This is the second book of the series and it was even better than the first.  Samira comes home after years of teaching kids in impoverished countries and finds a sexy werewolf named Riel intent on claiming her as his mate (can we have it any other way?). Riel is so HOT and sweet! However, someone in Sam's family is intent on killing for her inheritance and Riel is the only one who can help her. Sexy story + intrigue + hot and protective alpha male = Incredible book!! Can't wait for the next book, hopefully it will be Troy and Nat's story!

 I love the way the author wove the here and now with the past and the way she was able to incorporate the evil characters in with the normal ones

 I am also glad Max found some one to love given her childhood, which was not elaborated on, but was evidently not ideal
I am looking forward to the next book in the series and hope she does write one

 It's have to follow-up with another good book after the initial one has been written.

She knows how to laugh at herself and that is an amazing trait to have.That being said, the gem of this book for me was Mitchell. Every woman needs a fabulous gay friend to go dancing with. I have one and I love love love him to pieces. :)The book was well written, and even if we had just met Keith, his character and motivations are well fleshed out. For being the rebound guy, he's totally awesome. At this juncture, please sign me up for Team Keith.I loved that we had a deeper look into Peaches' past. It made me understand her character more, and really appreciate that she has gotten to where she is. Inspite of it all.I think, at the end of the day - that is what I took away from this book: that life goes on, and we need to keep on living it.Team Peaches 4Lyfe!

$REVIEW.: If you're going to invest in a neuro-fuzzy or other electronic rice cooker, I strongly recommend this book. I purchased it almost 6 years ago when I got my rice cooker (Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro-Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer). I never expected that this comprehensive book would expand the use and scope of my rice cooker to the extent that it has. It was full of surprises for me in terms of learning about the great variety of main and side dishes I can prepare in my rice cooker. Whether consulting it for general liquid-to-rice ratios or specific recipes, I've used it regularly with fine results.A reviewer noted that when a dish with cinnamon is prepared, the rice cooker retains that smell and taste for awhile. I'm extremely sensitive (inconveniently so, at times)to odors and tastes, and I've never had that problem, despite frequent use of aromatic, intense spices for various dishes including breakfast, dessert, Indian, Mexican, etc.

$REVIEW.: The PremiseDetroit event planner Mia Devine gets dumped one week before her elaborately planned wedding to Tucker Branch, her gorgeous, fastidious, ok, boring fiancee and she climbs into her blanket fort with no intention of coming out. For a girl who plans everything, and has a stronger than normal love for lists, being dumped throws her for a loop.  Then her friends convince her to take her honeymoon trip to Paris anyway, because if she&#8217;s going to be miserable, at least she can do it in the City of Lights.  She never plans on meeting Lucas Fournier, but stumbling around Paris, angry and sad, the bartender/NYU professor ends up being the best thing that could have happened.  She only has a week in Paris and she has to figure out if this is just a rebound fling or something more, something worth putting aside her lists and plans and just going on faith?My ThoughtsThis book came along at just the right time for me - I was looking for a sexy little bit of fluff and this fulfilled all my requirements.  Mia begins the story looking like hell and bitter from being dumped, but I didn&#8217;t feel like she was in love with her fiance.  This feeling is reinforced the farther I got into it, so that I was open to her relationship with Lucas.  Their banter and sexual chemistry is pretty intense but fun.  As she explores Paris with Lucas as her tour guide, I loved their burgeoning feelings being explored against the backdrop of Musee de Rodin or the Arc de Triomphe.Lucas is a refreshing hero, in that he&#8217;s not a tattooed, bad boy 6&#8217;6&#8221; of muscle billionaire, who&#8217;s an MMA fighter or a biker, and there has been a glut of those in my TBR pile lately.  He&#8217;s actually an average height, lean muscled, smart NYU professor who&#8217;s in Paris for the summer to visit his family.  That alone makes him almost a unicorn in modern romance.  While I&#8217;m enjoying his charm and connection to Mia, he starts to exhibit those alpha, dirty talking tendencies that just made me love him more.Yes, by virtue of the structure of the story it&#8217;s pretty much insta-love, and there is alot of sex in a short period of time, which can overwhelm the narrative, and by extension make it less effective, but there&#8217;s enough emotional development between the characters that I can buy into that love and hope that they get their HFN ending.The Bottom LineCheck it out - a funny, erotic romance with a &#8220;normal&#8221; hero with smutty tendencies.  I liked it.

$review_text.: Good, short story about shifters. I really like Sable and Akila.Akila is a Veterinarian who loves her animals. She gets a call to take in a wolf, to her no kill shelter but takes him home instead. She knows right away that he's different. When he runs away, she rides around to look for him, but to no avail.Sable; or Brutus, Akila's pet name for his wolf form, shows up at her clinic offering financial assistance for her no kill shelter. She's immediately drawn to him and agrees to a dinner date to discuss business. One thing leads to another, and before either of them can stop themselves, they're having hot sex back at her place.A little lacking in detail but, otherwise, a good story. I imagine there's more in the next book, as to how Sable and his twin sister came to be. A little more history about the man who wants the shifters blood.*3.5 stars*I was gifted this book from the author.

$REVIEW.: *I received this book free from the author in exchange for an honest review*This is the second book and it picks up right where the first one left off. However, like the first one this one too leaves off on a cliffhanger. A much larger cliffhanger. Goodness gracious I hate those!The storyline still holds the same intrigue the first one did, but it also holds a lot more. Cora learns the extent of her &#8216;treatment&#8217; and the exact odds she had been against surviving it. Let&#8217;s just say, alive or not, she still isn&#8217;t too happy about the turn of events.&#8220;That is the bondmark, Cora. It appears when a human survives feeding and is transformed. It shows that you belong to me now. In every way. Forever.&#8221;Dorian (Mr. Thorne) still remains vague about their situation, but it doesn&#8217;t stop him from pointing out how strong of a bond they now share. Even glimpsing his self-control, I&#8217;m still on entirely sure if I like him or not. Part of me wants to, but I guess I&#8217;ll have to continue onto the next book, Bad Blood, to see if it helps me make up my mind.If you like short reads that draw you in and leave you wanting more then these are good for you. If you like something a little longer without all the cliffhangers, I&#8217;d suggest waiting for the series to be complete.My Favorite Moments: I love every time Cora lets her smart mouth get the best of her.&#8220;You can&#8217;t just go around biting people with no warning.&#8221;&#8220;Details? You didn&#8217;t tell me you were a vampire! That was kind of an important detail you omitted. Something a girl might like to know. &#8216;Oh, by the way, this procedure I&#8217;ve been talking about? It involves me sinking my teeth into your neck.&#8217;&#8221;

$REVIEW.: Some stories have to be told over and over, every which way possible, in order to drill their history home.  Vaunda Micheaux Nelson has penned an exciting tale of escape and freedom, set before the Civil War.  Children's picture books that follow the lives of slaves always run the risk of watering down their material.  It is exceedingly difficult to tell a story about slavery to little kids without making light of the nasty aspects of it.  In this book, however, Nelson has adeptly told a story of escape through the eyes of a rag doll owned by a little runaway slave girl.  She has done this without compromising any of the uglier aspects of the time, while softening the point of view to that of an inanimate object.Matching Nelson's sure-footed storytelling come the illustrations of Colin Bootman.  His painting style uses thick oils and paints that somehow manage to convey emotion and depth.  And just for the record, the father of the little girl who owns the doll is probably one of the hottest men ever to grace the pages of a picture book.  I'm not kidding.  Go out, find this book, look at her dad, and tell me he's not absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  Wowzer.In and of itself, this book is well-made but not extraordinary.  However, Nelson has included a couple instructional tidbits at the back of the book for further contemplation and understanding.  In an author's note, she tells how she came up with the idea of the story.  Kids can see a photograph of a real black rag doll form the 1800s.  Then Nelson explains what the Underground Railroad was and how it worked.  Finally, a glossary of terms that kids might not be familiar with (dear = expensive) is included for a final considerate touch.  It is not a book that will necessarily blow you away, but "Almost to Freedom" accomplishes the difficult task of telling a fearful story in a manner appropriate for the young.  No small task.

$review_text.: Living at Aaron&#8217;s house and taking care of the rescued children, Nora is trying her best to put the past behind her when Cameron begins insisting Maddox is in real danger and in need of a rescue
To top it off, she thinks she sees the ghost of her mother.This novella started off slow and then took off, really took off

This had plenty of action and super powers, sprinkled with romance here and there


Twists and turns abound in this suspenseful story which kept me guessing and held my interest until the last chapter or so
With references like &#8220;Captain America&#8221; I was fully entertained and could not put this down.Told from Nora&#8217;s point of view, I was not bothered at all by the point of view switch


Finally Nora and Cameron were strong characters here

These were the solid, capable superheroes I expected to see in Mind Games
However, by contrast, Lewis was unattractive and looked like a wimp.The editing has much improved here


Errors were much less noticeable.This was a great ending to a great series
It gave me the closure I was looking for in Mind Games.A clean read, I recommend this for adults and young adults alike.Disclaimer: All books reviewed by me have been received via purchase, lending, or given to me by an author or publisher for the purposes of an honest review

$REVIEW.: Did I mention I loved this book? Well I just finished, and it was a great read that will make you want to fall in love with Reed and Juliet. The main reason for Skinny dipping and the list was her cousin Amy who wanted Juliet to have fun before she went to college. It was one heck of a ride because that storyline was throwing you for a loop from the beginning. If you like fun, and a fresh new read this book has it all right from the start!! The cover is what caught my attention as well as the summary and it did not disappoint. Alyssa did a great job with her characters and writing styles.Juliet is about to start her first year at college, as summer is near its ending Juliet listens to her cousin Amy suggestions to skinny dip in the pool at her grandparents beach house, then when she thought no one will be there, until her crush Dylan comes. Soon after that things for sure were not how she expected them to turn out. I really liked Juliet as a character because she is confident and also didn't expect love to find her. The book really begins with her going to college and she dates Dylan who treats her like he owns her, while Juliet just wants to end it, but she she realizes that he is not the tight one for her. Dylan is a character I really disliked. Juliet is the sarcastic, and witty character with an attitude, which makes her a really rounded as a main character.Juliet then meets Reed who she first meets at a Laser Tag match and later cleans his sorority. They have an instant connection. Reed is charismatic, and really pays attention to Juliet. I knew from the beginning he would be the right one when you first meet him. I loved him!!Watching this relationship finally unfolding is what makes me happy! Reed is definitely a man you want to read about, and the fireworks between them means real chemistry! Overall it was a fun summer read and will make you laugh and believe you will find your true love.
$SUMMARY.: Hot Summer Read!!

$REVIEW.: The fifth agreement isn't an impressive book in my opinion. It continually repeats itself, and espouses common ideas in common ways, thereby taking one where they started.In short he says - be a skeptic but don't believe thoughts that are negative.- create your own reality but make sure you aren't believing unreality.- symbology that exists can be destructive, but lets create a new dream together as a world.In short, contradictory. I understand there is nuance to these ideas but overall I don't find it a phenomenal book. Best of luck!

$review_text.: It would be nice if there were some points on what to do next time if your bread doesn't turn out as planned.  All of my breads turned out much heavier than illustrated in diagrams. My Italian & Ciabatta breads were better but nothing like shown in the pictures (Those use 100% bread flour).  The Ciabatta bread did not require a window pane test so I was hoping that would come out better, in case I wasn't really passing it, even though I thought I was.The Lavash Crackers show different shades and textures.  Mind came kind of the same except were the thinner parts were somewhat over done. In general it was too thick, bread like. I thought I rolled it out to more than 15" x 12" he called for but adjusted for the fact I held back more than half to try to make a pita, not sure what he mean't by "paper thin".It is inspirational, if only my breads actually turned out better.  I have cooked for awhile, but this is my first attempt at bread.

$REVIEW.: Over 5 million copies have been sold of the annually-updated Writer's Market, but one of the key reasons why this reference mainstay requires annual acquisition and updating is that information on the publishing industry changes so rapidly - and there are many authors out there who need the latest details on how to sell what they write
Any general interest lending library thus needs the very latest: this lists over 3,500 listings for book publishers, consumer magazines, trade journals, literary agents and more
It's been completely revised and updated to include over 600 new listings and is a 'must' for any reference library.Diane C

$REVIEW.: I did enjoy this book even though I didn't much like the characters
 The heroine, Meryl, was a hard and vengeful sort

 I would never even think of treating my mother, no matter what she had done, the way she treated Faye

 Admittedly, Faye, the grandmother, was just plain ridiculous

 The children were spoiled and bratty

 People I wouldn't seek out for friends in real life

 I felt some sympathy for Ethan, though I certainly don't condone his cheating
 However, it was interesting to see what they all would do next

 The whole stripping thing really made me give up on the story completely


 In what universe would such a thing actually happen?  Cheers and wild applause for a striptease from an auditorium full of upper class women?  A polite, dutiful applause and a somewhat  embarrassed reaction would be my guess

 And we're to believe these audience members would actually be interested in learning to STRIP?  Still, the story had a little something different and kept my attention
 Two and a half stars.

$REVIEW.: Interesting premise for bio-engineering research gone bad.  Of course there is an evil bad man and his main henchman.  And a lot of killing and action.  Not much in the way of character development or background story.  As a result the characters seem a bit superficial and generic.  In this case the author simply falls back on plot design and action.  This would be a good vehicle for a terrifying action movie..

$review_text.: If you liked the first Odyessy One book, you'll find this just as good or a tad better.In this follow-on, Weston has returned to Earth, reported the finding of two new alien species, one humanlike (different cultural and technology but physically identical) and one large roachlike nasty species bent on eating the universe (so it seems!).  Similar to the first book, there is plenty of military action (though it continues to bug me why the attack craft housed by Odyssey One are depicted like F-16s..check the cover!) with a tad more intergalactic diplomacy and intrigue. This sequel expands on the battles of the first one and dives more into the governing authority of the human alien race, a mysterious being called Central.Another great value for the money -- if you liked the first one even a little bit, go for it.

$REVIEW.: This book was so powerful to me. It almost kind of reminded me of my own family. At it's core, this book is about the relationship between three women. Ruth, her best friend Georgia and Ruth's daughter, Denise. We get to experience not only the present time of their lives, but also back to the past when Ruth first met Georgia and was pregnant with Denise who is now in her fifties. This is one powerful tale of a mother's love from birth to adulthood.Denise has special needs, and now that Ruth is nearing the end of her life... she is second guessing all of the choices she made for her daughter's life. And she is also trying to write everything she can remember from her past so that her daughter can have it once she is gone. My daughter also has special needs and this book really hit close to home for me. It was a very emotional rollercoaster for me while I read this book. But I loved every page of it.The book was extremely well-written. I love how the author delved so deep into all of the characters and really fleshed all of them out so thoroughly. It truly is a great book.

$review_text.: The "history" part is the selection of certain evidence that Lincoln, Wilson and Roosevelt manipulated the US into war


 The fact that these manipulations occurred is largely true, and discussed by many historians, but the supposed motivations here are based on highly selective histories


 Nowhere is it mentioned that Lincoln mainly went to war to preserve the Union because he felt a United States was a better place than a dis-Nnited States ("A house divided ..
can not stand"), and most people thought it would just take a short showing of strength and the CSA would back down

 If Lincoln went to war for financial reasons, why were there no reparations sought after?There is no mention of the Zimmermann Telegram as a leading reason why the US fought in WW1, and the case that Roosevelt knew when and where the first Japanese attacks would occur on US soil is circumstantial at best.Now the opinion part
 The central theme of the book is that large organized states fought large organized wars for 100 years (1850 - 1950 - note not since)
 True enough, but dont forget that small disorganized states tend to fight many small disorganized wars resulting in a chaotic, dangerous and unpleasant world


 We ran that experiment - its called the Dark Ages

(Or look at much of Africa.)  No-one can produce much evidence that a Dis-United States would have lead to a better world


 It might have been a lot worse world if no Western democracy was ready to replace Britain as the world's stabilizer
 Any contention that the world would be better if the US did not enter WW2 seems extreme
 Most historians contend it would now be an impoverished and weak Nation kowtowing to a set of a strong Nazi Thug States

 Thankfully, after two related bad wars (many historians agree with the author that the outcome of WW1 was a cause of WW2), large states have learned how to avoid large wars ...
though there is concern that 1914 could play out again soon with China, e.g


look at[...]Hopefully we can do a better job of preventing that potential large war than England and France did in containing Germany's expansionist desires.--Since writing this I came across Pinker, "The better angels of our nature: Why violence has declined"


 Pinker shows statistically that the century referred to in "A Century of War" was NOT the most violent relative to the population size

 He places WW2 as the ninth most violent in history on this basis (e.g


The Mongol Invasions were much worse.)  He also points out that the period since WW2 (now over 60 years) is by far one of the least violent in modern history, which would contradict the main underlying theme in "Century of War".

The photos and layout are well-though out, informative, imaginative but not cluttered. The top of the page is a gallery with jewelry made from the various beads being featured. The side margins have helpful hints yet the step-by-step instructions are clear and guides you through everything and I mean everything. I previously bought the Art of Polymer Clay by Lark which is an excellent book but beyond my skill. However, with this book as a companion, a novice will be inspired and encouraged to advance to the more difficult p-clay techniques.

$REVIEW.: Searing Lies (Book 1 of Love, Power & Sin Series) is Marie Astor's new book and I was honored to receive the book as a gift in exchange for a honest review
I have to honestly say this series is going to be a great one


Marie knows how to weave a mystery to sin, power and mystery, with romance all bundle up together
In the first book, you meet, Allyson Roberts Ally for short, who is no stranger to power, love and fortune


She is just engaged to Ronald Graystone who comes from old money and old family


But when her father is taken down his lies and his fortune is stripped and he find himself in jail and then dies from heart failure the Graystone turn on her, as does her job as well
 She then finds herself recruited to an undercover agency where she thinks she will have the resources to put her fathers enemies away! Let the fun begin! In the training camp she meets Instructor aka Agent Jake Morrissey and an instant attraction is mutual between Ally and Jake


But Ally stands firm in her conviction that she is there to learn to so she can take down her fathers murderer


In Ally's mind even though it was a heart attack if he hadn't been in jail it would not have happened
I believe in not giving the book awa so I won't

But let me tell you this much, this book, and any other book by Marie is so so so worth your read! She is a very talent write and gets you into her books and you will not want to put them down

I do love her writing and can't wait for the next book to come


Bravo Marie love this new series!!!!!!

The plot could have been a bit more nuanced with the big &#34;a-ha!&#34; moment coming earlier, considering that the reader probably saw it coming well before Jaylah did. Jourdan is my favorite character in this book by far--love her bold, brash personality and the way she takes Jay under her wing. I'd actually love to read a story from her POV and get to know her a little better. Overall, this book was a nice &#34;beach read&#34;, a bit shorter than I'm used to though.

$REVIEW.: It's hard to escape the religious comparisons in this book.  As much as it is written for the business, entrepreneurial world, it also cries out at the church.  References to heretics and fundamentalists echo of the church.  Maybe I'm just sensitive to these words because this is my field.  But who more clearly has a tribe than pastors and churches?  Who more desperately needs a leader than these groupings that seem so clearly stuck?  Using evangelism and sheep-walkers (an easy connection to shepherd, i.e. pastors) are other other ways this book comes as a call from an outsider beckoning us [the church] to lead.  Yes, this book is for everyone, but it's also for the church.  She has many tribes still needing leaders!"The organizations that need innovation the most are those that do the most to stop it from happening." pg 113

$review_text.: If you haven't read it, you should. It is a classic and the prototype of most subsequent westerns. Here you will find the Lone Ranger fighting for good against evil. Here also is High Noon for the Virginian has to settle the score on his wedding day in the usual way: Gun fight to the death. As a romance, it isn't bad either given the setting and the characters and as description of those times, it can't be beat because it was based on Owen's real life experiences. Of course, the past is a different country: they do things differently there. We will not see politically correct treatment of women, nor does the idea of lynching resonate well with modern sense and sensibilities. But that's the way things were and the truth is the truth.

$REVIEW.: With his prospects of becoming a physician utterly ruined by some rather illicit activities, twenty year old Ward de'Ath turns to the only other occupation left to him - necromancy. When hired by Lord Carlyle to wake his recently deceased daughter, Celia, so that that the family may say their final goodbyes, Ward believes this to be a simple assignment: wake the girl for 15 minutes, cue tearful farewells, and then her soul will once again return back beyond the Veil. However, when Celia wakes, she insists that she's been murdered and calls upon Ward's oath as a physician for aid in keeping her animated long enough to find her killer. Before Ward knows what's happening he's following the beautiful, dead girl out of her bedroom window and straight into the underbelly of Brawenal - into a world of danger, intrigue, suspicion and magic where nothing can be taken at face value. Celia and Ward enter into an uneasy alliance with each other as they are drawn into the mystery surrounding Celia's death. But when everyone is suspect, can they even trust each other?Ward is a bit of an everyman, which makes him incredibly easy to relate to. He hails from the lower echelons of society, works hard for every penny he has, dreams of a better life and despite his run-ins with the law, he desperately wants to be seen as a respectable young man. Though the family business is necromancy, Ward has always desired to save lives before they pass, rather than bring them back from the beyond. He believes that pursuing the medicinal practice of surgery will help him become a better physician. Unfortunately for Ward, practicing surgery is deemed illegal and because he pursues this course, he is banned from becoming a doctor. Ward is left picking up the pieces of his dreams and falling back on necromancy for his livelihood - a skill he never felt he was much good at. Card does a wonderful job at painting him as a normal, decent guy who's down on his luck. A guy who keeps his word, a guy who is unaccustomed to a life of danger, a guy who doesn't have a whole lot of street smarts but who is a quick learner. Ward is the hero of the story - well-intentioned and honorable - but I love the fact that Card's world is rarely portrayed as starkly black and white, especially when it comes to her characters. They are all shades of gray, including Ward. I also tend to love the unlikely heroes, and Ward certainly is that.Celia was quite a piece of work. Born to wealth and privilege and a member of the assassin's guild, she is a girl who know how to take care of herself. More likely to be slitting a man's throat than agonizing over needlepoint, she's adept at reading situations and people, subterfuge, handling weaponry, and is always mindful of the nearest escape route. She's grown up in a world where she constantly watches her back and where trust doesn't come easily. Quick to anger, impatient, pragmatic and deadly, not to mention DEAD, she at first appears quite intimidating to Ward. Scratch that. She's intimidating the entire way through. Though she's definitely abrasive, the fact that Card alternates perspective between Ward and Celia, letting us see the story through both of their eyes, gives the reader a front row seat to Celia's thoughts - her vulnerabilities and weaknesses she'd never let Ward see - and lends her a much more human side.Though all the aspects of this story are very well done, the interactions between Ward and Celia are the highlight of this book for me. Snarky, funny, witty, intelligent - it's fun to watch these two characters antagonize each other as they partner up to bring Celia's killer to justice. Watching their alliance morph into something...else, the issues of trust that they both struggle with and the influence they have on each other's character development are very fun to watch as the book progresses.The world Card places these two characters into is fascinating. The story largely takes place within the walled city of Brawenal. Divided into rings by a system of walls, each ring indicates a certain social strata. From there the society just gets more interesting.  I mean, a society  where necromancy is acceptable, but surgery is illegal has got to be interesting, right? There is a thriving criminal underworld ruled by the Dominus, a guild of assassins, and a justice system that uses seers to determine guilt or innocence.  The off-handed mentions of provinces and locations outside the city.  An ancient culture shrouded in mystery and a religion that permeates all aspects of life, presided over by the Goddess and her two sons - one light and one dark. It's really a well-defined, well-crafted world and I wanted to know more about it and how it worked the further the book progressed.Overall, Ward Against Death was a clever, thrilling urban fantasy, with page-turning mystery and captivating characters. This was a fantastic debut and I can't wait to see what happens next in Ward and Celia's story!* Due to some mature content that may not be appropriate for young teens, I'd  recommend this as an upper teen/cross-over novel.

$review_text.: No spoilers...Oh I do love G.A. Aiken!I've been waiting for this book for ages, and it was a rewarding wait at that! Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!Storyline: excellent.The land masses G has created continue on, as does the hierarchy of the dragons involved, and the the politics (which in any other book, bores me to death) are all still here, as are the characters.All it takes is to throw in one new character and bring that family to the front, twine it between what has already gone on before, and BANG, you've got yourself a fresh new story from a different angle.Sounds simple really doesn't it? Well I can tell you it's not that easy.Happiness factor: excellent.Do you know one of the things I truly love about G's work? Is that there's no repetition. G does not treat the readers like dumbos just because they may not have read the previous book/s. In other words, there is no rehashing of things mentioned in past books, so no boring bits for those of us that have. On the other hand, G also does not leave a new reader wondering what the heck just happened. G's books can be read as part of a series, or as a stand alone.Wanting more? Always!I love how there's always a twist or two in the books, and this one didn't disappoint. I still laughed, still smiled, and still shook my head at the characters portrayed. You see that's it... you have to get so sucked into the story that the world around you disappears and you laugh, cry and giggle along with them?Only thing I don't like: having to wait for the next book. (I know it will be worth it though.)

$review_text.: What's so difficult about the love of God? Carson makes it clear that it is partly the way that `love' is expressed in modern society (where it has been devalued to the extent that it is either completely romanticised or becomes simply a synonym for sex). On the other hand, when we talk about the `love of God' we sometimes get caught using too narrow a definition (love seen as exclusively for the elect), or too broad (love for the world being so over-emphasised that there is no room left for judgement). Carson shows that God's love, as we should expect, is more complex than that. It is consequently more important and more wonderful. This is a great book because it deals with an important topic, in sufficient depth not to be simplistic, but not in such great detail that it becomes impossible to read. Well worth buying and reading (more than once).

$review_text.: The more I read the more I want.  This is a great follow up story to the authors fist book Extensis Vitae.  It fills in the background of Mason, who is one of the characters in that book.  When I read the book I thought Mason was a horrible, despicable human being who deserved every bad, painful, nasty thing that could happen to him - and now I'm conflicted.  I still hate the guy, but I feel some empathy for him too.  Oh dear.  I can see the evolution of this story being hard on my psyche.  I can see Mason playing a larger role as the story progresses.As with the book this short story is well written and well edited.  It was enjoyable to read and felt complete.  I would recommend reading the book first, then this story.  But do read both!  It's well worth it.  This kind of reminds me of how I discovered the Wool Series.  The first book was really good, so I got the second one - then I was hooked.  Same thing here.

$REVIEW.: I'm not exactly sure how it's a "spicy" regency, as the lovemaking never goes beyond kisses. Nonetheless, it was a good read, especially considering the low quality of most novellas I find on Amazon. The heroine had a significant, albeit somewhat unbelievable, reason for rejecting the hero several years ago without explanation. The hero tries to get his revenge by having the heroine feel heartbreak too. As one would expect, this plan partially backfires the more time he spends with her (since he never truly got over her). Eventually, the old secrets are unearthed and everyone goes home happy :).

$review_text.: I, unfortunately, bought the book


It is written by two amateurs, who know very little about geography, or warfare at sea
They are "politically correct" in an archaic way (ca


1941) in praising the "British race" and making essentially stick figures out of the "wicked Nazi"

But, when you are PC, I guess you don't need to know the difference between latitude and longitude, or the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the First Sea Lord (page 109)


Page 109 is practically a Keystone Cops scene in confusing who was what.Although they did the research, their amateurish confusion invalidates the book as a serious historical account.Not recommended at all unless they do a re-write of the amateurish passages
Not recommended as a book on naval history, unless the propagande is taken out.

Instead, it's an ultra-consevative political rant that  refers to specific horror works only occasionally in order to score dubious  points.  The author hijacks Stephen King's insight, &quot;the horror story  is as conservative as an Illinois Republican in a three-piece suit&quot;,  and proceeds to hammer his themes over and over: sex=death, everything was  better before the 16th century, a group called the Illuminati is plotting  to take over the world.  Avoid at all costs.

$review_text.: **Be Aware - Possible Spoilers**I enjoyed reading the two previous Miss Aggie mysteries and looked forward to this one.  Sadly, this tale was a let down.The story felt rushed and an explanation regarding a key element in the mystery never appeared (how did the suitcase end up in the dumpster?).  It felt like the author was simply trying to tie up loose ends quickly.  Also, Miss Aggie's 'let me fly off the handle and overreact' tendency wore thin in this story.  Her high-handed attitude late in the book was aggravating.  Victoria is not Miss Aggie's servant, but she is consistently treated that way.  I found myself wishing that instead of shaking her head good naturedly; she would stand up to Miss Aggie and set her straight.This book still held some of what made the other books charming, including descriptions of the interactions between the seniors, Victoria, and other characters, as well as cozy little snippets of their every day life.  (Hence, the two stars instead of just one)What was most off-putting to me was the large increase in the Christian references.  Yes, I realize this is a faith based book.  This, however, was never allowed to detract from the main focus of the story in the previous mysteries.This story tipped over the edge, however, and allowed itself to become preachy...a huge turn off for me personally.One example was the assertion that one of the characters (and suspects) had told a lie because they were not a Christian.  This kind of sweeping judgement irritates me.  To endow a person with character flaws simply because their belief system differs from the author's is offensive.It's also the reason why people tend to silently cheer when a church official gets caught with their pants down, either literally or figuratively.A holier-than-thou attitude is not only extremely unattractive, it is un-Godly.A person's religious convictions, whatever they may be, do not automatically ensure that they will conduct themselves in a moral or ethical manner, nor does the lack of a belief system guarantee the opposite.During the rush to wrap up this mystery, and I am guessing the series, the author seemed to go into a frenzied, "let's get everybody saved!" mode.Perhaps the thought process behind this decision was that if everybody converted to Christianity then there would be no chance that any other crimes would occur...since Christians are incapable of wrong doing.  /sarcasm off/I am sad to leave the endearing inhabitants of Cedar Chapel Lodge with a bitter taste in my mouth.  This was a charming little series and had the proselytizing been not so blatant and judgmental, this book could have been as well.

$REVIEW.: Khela Halliday is a successful romance novelist. Carter Radcliffe maintains the Back Bay brownstone she lives in. Khela is an African-American Midwesterner and Carter is a white Southerner, although there is one menton that his best friend Detrick, who is also black, gave him honorary blackness when the two became best friends in high school.Race is not the central conflict of Mr. Fix-It, which is why I like this book so much. It is the story of two people who have been hurt in the past by people who were supposed to love them. Khela divorced a man who only loved her for her royalty checks and Carter never went through with marrying a woman who wanted him because she thought he would give her cute babies.Boston is again the backdrop for this book and the city plays a bigger part and you get to know more of it. There are some parts of this book that will make you laugh out loud. In a word, Mangela.This seems to be the kind of book that you will love or hate, but I really loved it because of the verbal sparring between Khela and Carter and the way their relationship unfolded. I also liked the inside look at what it's like being an author.

It was not the "sex" , threesomes, or b**t plugs that turned me off as I am far from a prude. It was her sad, juvenile writing style and unbelievable story line. The "heroine" was so pathetic I wished I could have reached through the pages and slapped her. The way the guys/twins spoke to her during their "sessions" turned my stomach and made me wonder if she had a venereal disease going on... And it's not just me ~ I let a few gals at work read some of the "steamy" parts, and all thought it was ridiculous. I do not recommend this literary garbage to even my worst enemy. If you wish to read true erotic fiction, that is steamy with H*O*T dudes in them and wild fantasies of the sexual nature, pick a a book by Megan Hart. To Ms. Michaels ~ read Hart and see how it is done.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't sure what I would be getting when I first started the novel as I had never read anything by the author before, but I was quickly surprised at how much thought, creativity and talent for writing was put into the novel to create a vivid and engaging story. A Tide of Shadows follows one man as his fate is changed suddenly in the wave of accusation, sending him tumbling into a world of tenuous allies and magical/supernatural foes that all have plans of their own that threaten Carym's own life. Carym must journey to the magic waters of the Everpool in hopes of regaining his freedom and finding a new life among the ashes of the old. The author, Tom Bielawski, has an eye for detail and a flair for the imaginative, creating everything from a chilling evil god who has an army at his disposal to a band of rebels that save and threaten Carym's life in equal turn.

$REVIEW.: According to the saying, you can't judge a book by its cover, but most of us are guilty of doing just that at one time or another

If you look at the cover of this book, and assume it's a standard run-of-the-mill cliched cowboy story, you'd be waaaaaay wrong


It isn't a standard run-of-the-mill cliched ANYTHING


It's fresh and imaginative, well-written, and a thoroughly enjoyable tale from start to finish

Matter of fact, I'm not sure, but I think the author may have invented a brand new genre
A hybrid, and a darned good one.Whether you're a fan of well-researched historical fiction, of the Old West, of time travel, adventure, or romance, you'll find something to rave about in this book

A brilliant scientist owns an exclusive island getaway, and he invites some of his guests to reeeeeally get away..


by traveling into the past through his secret invention


(Not a big deal is made about this..
it just IS


And somehow, the author makes it seem totally acceptable and plausible.) Our get-away-from-it-all hero precedes our heroine into the Old West, and establishes a new life for himself there

By the time she arrives, he's become a bounty hunter


The trouble is, our poor unsuspecting heroine is the spitting image of the thieving murderous woman who darned near killed him five years earlier

And so it begins

The question is: where will it end? But um, don't be in too big of a hurry to get to the end, because the journey is delicious ..
whether it's on horseback on a miserable rainy day, or in a hot overcrowded train, you'll feel like you are there

Total immersion.Great story
I can't say enough good things about it.

$REVIEW.: Short, but very good. It's one of the few books I've seen that's even tried to approach prepping for feminine needs. I'd love to see a companion book about birth control issues, and perhaps one on prepping for babies. They all really do fit together. I rarely, if ever see anything on prepping for birth control (this book touches on it towards the end). But think about the reality- even if everyone is starving and freaking out in a disaster scenario, there will still be an occasional desire for sex, as well as those out there wanting to take advantage of women (and thus a need not only for self defense but birth control as well.) Might sound gruesome, but if you look at some real life scenarios, these things do happen and need to be considered.Thanks so much, Ash, for addressing some female prep needs!

$review_text.: When Americans think of "terrorists", we think of suicide bombers; we really don't think about who these men are in their every-day lives


These stories are at times truly horrific, and these women's voices need to be heard, and listened to

These Muslim men come to America to get Green Cards, and then marry American women for citizenship

They are lovely and charming at first
As soon as the vows are said, the sheep's clothes come off and out comes the wolf
Maybe this should be required reading for all Freshman college women
Scary, scary, scary


 Five stars for the scariness of these stories

The story telling was a bit scattered, but it almost gave it more authenticity as it seemed to be told by very, very frightened women.

$REVIEW.: Cons1.  If you thrive on mystery and figuring things out before the end, don't bother buying this one because it was obvious before the book was half way who the mother was and how everyone was related.2.  The book should have ended 3/4 of the way after all the history is fleshed out, but the author must have felt the need to fill a couple more pages b/c she goes into the unnecessary point of view of Jack McCain AFTER everything is known.  She needs to learn placement b/c you hit the end only to be bored to death by the rest of the book.3.  It's has points where there is rambling.Now the high points:1.  The characters are fleshed out and they have independant stories that are related well.  You won't feel that you don't know the characters and why they are doing what they are doing.2.  The book has a good hook from the beginning and generally is well written except for the cons above.Honestly, the only reason I got this book was b/c it was free on my Kindle.  I wouldn't have paid a penny for it b/c the cons outweigh the pros.

$review_text.: As a manager of a Christian Book store, I have had many good books at my fingertips but in the Christian fiction category, this one surpassed them all! This was my first Martin book I read and since then, I have read two more of his books and can't wait to read the last two. This book drew me in from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. The characters were very deep and set such good examples, not realizing it, you seem to learn from them about how relationships should or could be. Christian or not, I believe anyone would enjoy one of his books. This is not a sappy chick book. Great book to buy and lend out or use for a book club too.

$REVIEW.: Here's the trope: headstrong girl in breeches needs to be taught a lesson.Here's the twist: the headstrong heroine is smart, charismatic, and a skilled manipulator
Hard to trick or corner.Here's the trope: Icy, self-controlled Earl with a dominant streak does the teaching.No twist there

He's pretty delicious, actually

Stuffy and proper and used to getting his way

He's thwarted, in this case, because he's met his match--but, man, do I love an icy earl with a sweet side.THE LESSON PLAN is a hot little number that traps the hero, Conrad, and the heroine, Freddie, alone in a woodcutter's cottage

Most of the novella is spent in the cottage doing exactly what you think, yet the lead-in is enough to understand both of the protagonists, to like them and believe that they'd suit.The tone is light and airy--this is due entirely to the heroine, Freddie, who is cheerful and exuberant and very much in love with being alive; she really wins you over and carries you along

I believed that she'd gotten away with living this hoydenish, unconventional life for so long because it only took her a few pages to charm me utterly.It's smart too--most authors would take this scenario, a heroine at the mercy of a pretend highwayman, and make the heroine feel helpless and outmatched
Freddie is occasionally frightened by what she's gotten herself into, but never helpless

At every step along the way, she and Conrad are equals.This is a fun romp, a pleasure to read, sexy

Recommended.

$REVIEW.: If you suffer from acid reflux and are looking for changes you can make in your everyday life to alleviate the symptoms, &#8220;Prevent Acid Reflux&#8221; does a good job of not only providing suggestions, but helping you understand exactly what acid reflux is so you can make educated choices on your own.I only give the book three stars because it&#8217;s sprinkled with occasional structural and grammatical errors. It could&#8217;ve used another proofread, but fortunately, the errors aren&#8217;t numerous enough to be distracting or diminish the book&#8217;s case. It explains with enough authority that reflux is caused largely by overeating, and it prescribes a detailed action plan for moving to a more streamlined diet that&#8217;s rich in fresh produce and whole grains. It&#8217;s similar to the clean eating trend, but not as restrictive, so you don&#8217;t need to be intimidated if you&#8217;re considering this book. Any diet is, of course, going to be at least a little bit difficult, but with recipes like lobster rolls and banana-nut bread on the menu, I see no downside to giving it a shot.

$REVIEW.: SUMMER'S BOOK BLOGGOT AS GIFTJoely Gilbert a young girl who after running away from her past finds herself at the doorstep and the mercy of a money hungry sadistic woman Clara Delvine, the owner of The Viper Room.  Looking to be saved she signs six years of her life over to the woman and spends the next few years slowly builds her way up to Head Viper.  A title that is praised amongst the private club.  There are six rules to follow and rule number one is never fall for a client because the punishment is time spent in &#8220;the pit&#8221; or worse.I like Joely because she never loses her morals. I know it&#8217;s hard to believe since she is basically a prostitute but when she falls in love she finds it morally wrong to continue with her job even she is contracted into it and the man she loves tells her he understands that she has to do what she has to do to keep herself safe. Where most woman in that position for that long would fall into the rabbit hole and forget all about their principles, she holds onto them and I have to respect her for that. She is a strong character that is faced with a lot of tough decisions through the story. Never knowing who she can trust she stays in head a lot because Clara has eyes and ears everywhere. The story ends on a cliffhanger and it&#8217;s such a good one! I am looking forward to seeing where it goes!

$review_text.: I really like Keshari as a main character. She is a strong and successful woman that holds her own very well. While she is in the spotlight alot because of her record label, there is also a very dark part in her life that may cost her everything. She is one of the leaders in an organized crime ring. Keshari makes a very deep decision. She wants to quit the crime lifestyle and live the straight life with her soul mate. That does not come easy, of course.This was a really good read overall. The storyline was solid, yet somewhat predictable at times. It had a good flow. The name brand dropping was a little much in my opinion, but I'm not much of a materialistic person anyway, so maybe it's just me. I would definitely read another book by this author, and will be picking up a copy of the sequel, Rise of the Phoenix, Larger than Lyfe II.I received a copy of this book to read and review from the author, Cynthia Diane Thornton.

$review_text.: I received this book from Logan Byrne and &#8220;Paranormal Romance & Authors That Rock&#8221; in exchange for an honest review.Banded is the first book in a dystopian series. It takes you through Kalenna&#8217;s sorting after her 16th birthday, and through the first month of her time at HQ. This is a specialized school for all sixteen year olds that are recently banded. This will be the last time that zones will congregate, unless one gets a job that involves cross zoning (doctor, police, etc.). The band is an electronic device similar to a watch. It keeps track of all wrong doings, as well as good choices, while adding or subtracting points accordingly. It starts at 100 and ends at 0 when it takes your life by lethal injection.The main character, Kalenna, is very curious and strong. She has the potential to be an awesome heroine. With that being said, she is very naive and not as mature as she should be at times. Kalenna meets friends who each play a part in her discoveries. Gavin is a super sweet guy and a potential love interest. Hector is a big ole teddy bear. He&#8217;s got lots of muscle and he has the hots for Jasmine, who is a badass dagger fighter. Ivan is a very intelligent nerd boy who has proven his resourcefulness.  The warden of HQ is a major player in this story. He has access to too much power, more information than we know, and doesn&#8217;t seem to be the most just person to be the head honcho at the HQ.This series does have a Hunger Games meets Divergent series feel to it. However, it was a great story in its own right. The similarities weren&#8217;t so much so that it was a put off. I still enjoyed this book, and liked the pace of it. The fighting scenes were very well told and kept me wanting more.There were words and phrases that were way over used, part of the storyline was VERY predictable, and the ending was too abrupt for me to feel like there was any type of resolution.  Regardless of these few annoyances, I am looking forward to book 2 in the series. Banded is very PG and is suitable for any age.

The shaman warns her of bad things to come.When a quarreling couple's house burns to cover up a crime, the shaman again predicts danger for Tempe and persuades her to take part in a starlight ritual of calling the sacred powers for protection. It all stirs up old memories that Tempe would like to forget, and puts her in harm's way.Tipping my hat to the author - well, of course I have a hat.Pat Browning, author of Full Circle

$review_text.: Warning &#8211; This is the second book in The Werewolves of the West Series and I&#8217;ll do my best not to include spoilers.I felt the author really hit her stride right out of the gate in this second book. The action and suspense are palpable right from the first chapter and the romance is a tangled web, with many want to be suitors for Melanie and the newly mated bonds between Chloe and Zane.I just knew Jazmine and that zebra feasting vamp would get at Chloe. She&#8217;s behind bars, framed for multiple murders and Agent Green has nullified her abilities, cutting her off from all who would help her.War, jealousy, and love all rear their heads in this fun continuation of the series.When Chloe and Zane were mated she gained a lot of special talents and seemed to have an intuitive sense on how to tap into them. Carol did a great job with this, making Chloe&#8217;s easy assimilation believable.As with the first book, there is so much intrigue and secrets it becomes difficult to tell the good guys from the bad ones. Even some of the bad guys earned my affection. What can I say, they are supernatural and sexy.Chloe&#8217;s best friend Melanie tells her own side of things. She has a secret. She&#8217;s jealous of Chloe. Her best friend has attitude and glamour and she often feels like the ugly duckling compared to her.That all changes when she arrives in Plum Beach to help get Chloe out of jail. The paranormal books she writes earn her six figures a year, and it may be why she was able to accept the news when she finds out most of the people helping Chloe are werewolves, fae, and vamps.She&#8217;s not lacking in suitors either with all these alpha males sniffing at her door, and she feels sexy, lovin every minute of it.There&#8217;s plenty of action, sizzling sex appeal, and so many secrets to be kept and surprises to be revealed. We lost some characters but gained some new ones and this series just got even better.I was provided a copy of this book for my honest and unbiased review.

$review_text.: I really like the writer's characters and have read all other Levine's books but this one was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed as though everything just got wrapped up too quickly and neatly at the end. There also seemed to be less time spent on character development and I don't think I would have enjoyed the book as much if I had not already read other books and had a sense of who Jake Lassiter was already.

$REVIEW.: This is the beginning of a new series (hopefully!) And as such had more world building than villain chasing, which was ok by me (though I'd love to see more in future installments).  The two heroes grew up together and since literally their first year of life, have bonded.  The author did a beautiful job portraying their friendship to love and the problems of Zev being an alpha and bonded to a male human.I loved all the characters, both secondary and main, but really hope that Cardeno C. will grace readers with a prequel novel on how Ethan and Miguel came to be bonded.  I won't spoil, but dang!  All in all if you love cute light reads with a big HEA and shared past then pick up Wake Me Up Inside.

$REVIEW.: Bailey Walker is trying to put her life in order, and she seems to be on the right track. She is close to establishing her wedding plans, and her dream of adopting a child is about to become a reality. In addition, she is finally starting to feel at home in her lovely, gothic-style mansion, Volstead Manor, despite some of the more creepy aspects of its architecture. Unfortunately for Bailey, one of the ingredients to her recipe for happiness could turn out to be a catalyst for disaster.Someone is conspiring against Bailey, and it seems that this enemy has plans to purge Volstead Manor through fire. The authorities believe that the cause of the minor blaze was merely electrical in nature, but Bailey, an amateur sleuth, knows better than that. In the midst of her personal investigation, she discovers a vault hidden in her cellar, sealed off from prying eyes for many years. The secret she finds there has ties to the darkest period of Prohibition, when some groups would resort to the most heinous acts in order to maintain their profitable bootlegging practices. Now, as Bailey makes every effort to solve the case of this mystery mansion fire, she realizes that her life is in grave danger. And she must act quickly, because the villain is on its way. She may only have hours to live......Another Grave Matter is the third book in Anita Higman's Volstead Manor series of Christian cozy mysteries. Higman has been writing mystery for a while and seems to possess a knack for the genre. It is clear from this novel that she genuinely cares about her heroine, Bailey Walker, who is at the center of the novel. Bailey is a well-developed and dynamic character who has a way of drawing you into her plight and the pressure of her world as it seems to be crashing down around her.If you enjoy cozy mysteries with undertones of Christian fiction, then this is definitely a novel for you. Also, for readers who enjoy well-crafted and suspenseful mystery-style works that are simple to read and satisfying, look for Another Grave Matter by Anita Higman.

I got this book mainly because of a friend I have in another state where we are interested in each other but things are not concrete yet. I figure she would like the book since she has provided similar material in video form that she seems to have like. While the book is aimed at females, I still decided to read it before I give it to her and the book is very interesting, there were even good ideas that I have no think about before so I would say both sexes can benefit from this read.

$REVIEW.: Imagine that your best friends, people you thought you knew, suddenly commit an act of mass murder, also on persons you know and in some cases, like, and you're stuck dealing with the aftermath - while you're still in high school.  This is Brooks Brown's story and it rings very true, with that truth that is unfortunately stranger than fiction sometimes.I had previously read Dave Cullen's "Columbine", which I strongly disliked.  By contrast, I very much liked Brooks Brown's book.  Interestingly, I noted that the books are in agreement on most of the major points of the story:  that the police response to the crime, as "correct" as it might have been at the time, was in hindsight inadequate and cost lives; that during the ensuing investigation, law enforcement at best withheld key information from the public and at worst outright lied with impunity; that Brooks Brown's family had earlier reported Eric Harris to police for making detailed death threats against Brooks on Harris's website, which the police ignored;  that following the crimes, Brooks himself became a suspect, perhaps in an attempt to discredit the Brown family and minimize fallout from the lack of law enforcement response to their past reports about Eric Harris's violent tendencies; that Dylan Klebold had loving, caring parents, while Eric Harris's family, a military family who had moved many times and come to the community later, were a cipher; that Eric Harris was a master manipulator who drew depressed, disillusioned Klebold into his orbit; and that Harris and Klebold hid their mass murder plans so well that no one, incluing their good friends like Brooks Brown (who had made peace with Harris shortly before the killing spree), suspected what they were up to.  I don't doubt that any of these facts are the truth.The main ways in which the stories differ are that Cullen insists that neither Harris nor Klebold were bullied, while Brown tells a different story and claims that the bullying somehow helped bring about the crime; and that Cullen portrays the school administrators and school atmosphere in a much more positive light than Brown, who by his own admission was never happy in school since grade school and in fact was on the verge of flunking some graduation requirements at the time of the Columbine killings.  I tend to find Brooks Brown's story on these points more believable and human, for the simple reason that he was there in person and had the inside view, even if he has an agenda now - perhaps to show his own innocence and explain, as much as he can, the actions of his friends, particularly his dear childhood friend Dylan Klebold.  That is not to say I agree with every one of Brown's opinions.  While bullying probably did go on - seriously, is there any big high school, or maybe even small high school, in the USA where some form of bullying does NOT go on? - I tend to agree with Cullen that Eric Harris, the mastermind, was a psychopath who craved control and hated people, rather than a basically good kid who was driven to his bad acts by bullies.  I also noted that no one as yet has been able to paint a decent picture of Eric Harris's homelife, as his parents (unlike Klebold's) refused to speak without immunity, which they were not granted.  With little or no insight into Harris's upbringing, crucial parts of the story are missing.Despite these flaws, Brown's book is a compelling read that I couldn't put down for two days until I finished it, in contrast to Cullen's book which bugged me so much with its whitewashed portrayals of an unrealistically supportive and communal school that I could barely get through.  It should be noted that Brown's book was clearly written by someone in high school or with the perspective of a recent high school graduate, which makes the book very honest even where it seemingly contradicts itself or blazes an ironic path.  Brown is being himself, and unlike Cullen, not trying to tell multiple stories or be all things to all people.  For example, Brown criticizes the school administrators for creating an atmosphere where jocks were allowed to bully other students, and for being unfeeling to him after the tragedy, but when the principal approaches him on graduation day wanting to know why Brown is so upset and basically asking where the school failed him, Brown doesn't want to discuss it and turns away. I couldn't have asked for a better illustration of the gap in understanding between adults and school kids, and the principal's concern, even if he didn't get a good response, did more to show me that he was a caring man than the pages of fake-sounding praise that Cullen put in his book.  Brown further whines about the school asking him not to return after the killings for his own protection, even though he states that he hated school anyway and that when he did visit his friends at their new school, they were leery of him and didn't want him around.  It's unclear why missing a small amount of school (basically a few weeks) between the killings and graduation was such a big upset to him, but that's how high schoolers think.Brown also complains that investigators considered him a possible suspect after the killings.  Yet, Brown also notes that he was among the first, if not the first, to tell the police about Harris and Klebold on the day of the crime; that he had posed for school pictures with Eric and Dylan pointing pretend guns, that he was close to both of the killers and had just eaten lunch with them the day before, and that one of their other school friends was eventually found to have helped them procure guns used as murder weapons.  He further describes writings that investigators found in his school notebooks as referring to patricide, reportedly a reference to a different classmate who earlier killed his father.  While it does appear that the police wanted to discredit Brown due to their own failure to act on his family's previous reports about Harris, and that Brown in the end was innocent, it also appears that police would have been lax in NOT looking into all of the potentially inculpatory evidence against Brown, even though he turned out to be innocent.In the end, it seems like Brown's issues with Columbine High School, and even to some extent with law enforcement, are reflections of his natural idealism, which is also shown by his disillusion with a Congressional lobbying trip he and other young gun-control advocates make.  Brown, a child of privilege, believes things should be better and gets upset or disappointed when they are not.  The good part is that he seems to be channeling this disappointment into positive energy and action.  And, the fact that he had the emotions of a very typical idealistic high-schooler in response to his best friend's becoming a mass murderer makes Brown even more of an everyman, with a very relatable tale to tell.  It doesn't detract at all from the value of the story, especially the recounting of events and emotions by one who actually lived through them at close range.  This book should be read by all who are interested in Columbine, or in American high schools in general.
$SUMMARY.: It all rings true - even the contradictions

$review_text.: There's just no getting past it; first and foremost, this is a love story! One that will linger and replay on your mind, when you least expect it...I love that I related to Jeff and Mike. These two hot cowboys and the problems they faced were realistic. Those problems require solutions, there are compromises that have to be made, conflicts to face, plans that may need changing and on top of all that, a ranch to run. Their personal attitudes and ideals, past experiences and how it influences their present and any future they make together, is tested. As the title suggests, they are in many ways, two sides of the same coin but from vastly different backgrounds and experiences. For Mike, confronting those demons and accepting his sexual preference and the man he's become, is huge!I really liked that the attraction and their eventual coming together is a gradual thing. Jeff is still in a relationship in the beginning and though it's been going sour for some time, he's not into jumping into bed with the first guy that gives him the eye. It's so satisfying `watching' as these two feel the power of their attraction for one another. How it builds and builds continually until they can no longer deny how they feel and making love is the ultimate expression. They're men. More, they're cowboys, rough and tough, strong and capable, so it's even more thrilling to watch a love tender, new and a little scary, bring these boys to their knees. It makes the characters all the more real because of it. You can't help but identify with them and hope that they have what it takes to make a future together.There's friendship, camaraderie, danger, murder and mayhem, especially when cattle rustlers threaten the very viability of the ranch and the lives of those living there. It's about `sticking together,' helping each other through the tough; building solid foundations and strengthening the bonds of friendship. It's about courage. Courage to grab and hold onto something real and precious, even when there's fear you might be wrong, yet finding the courage and strength to do it anyway. It's about intolerance and injustice; prejudice resulting from fear and hatred, how those challenges define and direct the characters and the choices they make. Last but not least, it's a story that reminds us, that life is a journey. A journey, that if we're really lucky and want it bad enough, we might just get to share it with someone who makes us complete.Jake Mactire brings this story to life with an affinity you can't help but empathize and relate to. He draws you in with a subtlety that will make you grin -when you realize you're half way through it and wondering where the time went! It's simple in it's message yet well told and sincere. As my first gay romance, I had no idea how I'd feel about the explicit sex. I found it sensual, erotic enough to burn down the house and convincing. It was love and that's always beautiful in my book! Don't miss this gem!Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews

$REVIEW.: Review provided courtesy of Romance JunkiesMARRY ME, COWBOY draws readers into the fictional town of Marietta, Montana, where the sights and sounds of the Copper Mountain Rodeo come to life.  Author Lilian Darcy excels at spinning a story that will capture your heart and imagination, and will leave a lasting impression that you will not soon forget.Tegan Ash is a native Australian who is in the United States on a visa that is about to expire.  Not wanting to leave the country, she makes arrangements with her friend Chet to get married so that she does not have to give up riding in the rodeo circuit.  When Chet backs out and leaves Tegan at the alter, she must reconsider her plans and she may have to go back home.Jamie MacCreadie is a man of few words.  He and Tegan do not exactly see eye to eye, but he offers to marry her anyway to help her with her dilemma.  Jamie is not prepared for the overwhelming attraction that he has for Tegan because the two just cannot seem to get along. Can two people who are so at odds with one another possibly find love together?Tegan is shocked when she realizes that she harbors feelings for Jamie.  The sexual chemistry between the two is explosive.  Tegan has unresolved issues with her family and Jamie encourages her to go back home to work her problems out.  I loved that Teagan is such a strong and resilient character.  It was a pleasure to read about a woman who can hold her own in the rodeo ring.Jamie may not have a lot to say, but he is an awesome friend.  He is there for Chet when he drinks too much and when he discloses a life-altering secret.  I fell for Jamie's vulnerable side and the way that he interacts with his family.  He and Tegan might not always agree, but the banter between the two kept me amused.Lilian Darcy really brings the town of Marietta, Montana, to life with vivid descriptions that will have readers kicking up dirt, smelling the food from the concession stands and enjoying the beautiful scenery. MARRY ME, COWBOY is a fresh and fun novella that makes for a quick and satisfying read. I highly recommend that you get yourself a copy today![...]

As the cover suggests, this is an intense, passionate story of love. It also deals with the resiliency that one must have to face a loss. If you have ever lost someone special, a friend, a broken relationship, a dream, a hope, you will be able to relate to this book.Avery and Hayden have a very special relationship. And of course, their relationship must face the deep pain of loss. From the first page to the last you will find yourself rooting for things to work out, in one way or another. As I read, I became invested in the outcome, and I sincerely believe you will also feel this level of empathy for both Avery and Hayden. This one is unputdownable.

 The story is ingenious, creative, and original

 Often times an author will have a great idea for a story but the delivery may not do it justice

 That is never the case with Mr

Walker's books

I couldn't wait to see what would happen next
I knew Shayla's activities would eventually come to a head but I couldn't wait to see how it would happen

 I could go on but I think I have made my point.

$REVIEW.: Lady Justice And The Assassin was my first read of this extensive series (about 15 titles, I think) and it was really enjoyable enough for me to say that it is far from the last.Written from the point of view of Walt, a 69 year old cop, the characters in this fun story are about as far from retirement as you can get. They love what they do and they really do it well. The friendships of the players here are what strikes the reader as being realistic and honest.While the story here is pretty far-fetched, it does make for a good one and it does so at a pace that quickens as it progresses. Like any good mystery, drawing the reader into the story takes a little while to be set up. But when it does, you can't turn the pages fast enough. It's not a story line that's commonplace or even very believable, but the characters are crafted so well that the reader won't let go.I look forward to others in the series. I have a feeling that the likability of the characters will continue easily to the other titles and will let the reader develop a relationship with Walt and his buddies.

$REVIEW.: It was a surprise to me to read that Faust had already been popularized by the excellent Christopher Marlowe way before Goethe who is more closely associated with Faust. I have indeed after reading &#34;The Jew of Malta&#34; as the precursor of Shakespeare's &#34;Merchant of Venice&#34; and this book, a precursor of Goethe's &#34;Faust&#34; only reaffirms my belief that Christopher Marlowe was the greater Man/Writer than these two popular figures for reasons that I don't care to entertain. In my book, Christopher Marlowe will live as the Original Genius English Writer. He writes so well and Faust flows with a intensity that is spell binding yet so quaint and real. The writer knows how to re-tell a tale most old, but tells it well. Of course all the god bit of heaven and hell is sheer nonsense but must be appreciated at the time of simple hearts. It is a book that tries to reaffirm society's chains around a free man. Let there be Free Men. Break these Biblical chains.

$review_text.: Murder At Mount Hermon: The Unsolved Killing Of Headmaster Elliott Speer is a true crime story concerning the 1934 murder of a thirty-five-year old school administrator, whose efforts to bring progressive reform to the tradition-bound Christian prep school earned the good graces of many students and faculty. A shotgun blast through his study window killed him, and the murder was front-page news nationwide, yet no criminal was ever charged. Veteran attorney Craig Walley pieces together the clues of history and dares even to indicate the most likely killer. A fascinating, fact-filled study of murder and the shortcomings of a 1930's homicide investigation.

$REVIEW.: I had previously written a negative review about the Thoth Deck in general, but I have committed to spending a year with this single deck and have purchased all three sizes.  There is no doubt this deck carries VERY strong energy -- which I now realize scared me because it was triggering strong psychological energies within. . .  So, this deck, I believe, is for the more advanced and/or well-balanced student.  If one is wrestling with dark energy issues, I would not recommend this deck as it could intensify this struggle.That being said, after purchasing at least a hundred core decks over the years -- many of them esoteric in nature (Golden Dawn, Alchemical, Rider Waite, etc.) I have come to believe this is the single most power-packed deck -- and may remain so indefinitely.  The richness of the alchemical and historical symbolism alone took a lifetime to craft (the sum of Crowley's studies) and while I don't subscribe to Thelema, this deck is FANTASTICALLY accurate and brutally truthful.  I've come to appreciate the naked truthfulness of negative cards in this deck because they are helpful warnings -- and teaching points extraordinaire.One piece of helpful advice is, I've found, not to be too put off by the word labels of the minor arcana cards -- the meanings go well beyond these sometimes puzzling titles.  Hands-down the best book I've found to accompany this deck is The Crowley Tarot by Akron & Hajo Banzhaf.  Each person will resonate uniquely with each deck, of course, but, for me, this book has really unlocked the deck in way no other book has (and I've purchased and read them all).Highly recommended and this smaller deck is just adorable -- I use it to place each card on the Tree of Life where it belongs and it deepens the reading.  They also fit very nicely in small hands, are portable, and make a great companion deck.

$REVIEW.: Being a pastor's wife is tough. Everyone judges you, tells you what to do, and you're always in the spotlight. You can't complain about this to anyone else because you're supposed to be a spiritual leader in the church with no problems at all. That's what it's like for Mimi, Felicia, Lisa and Jennifer. The foursome get together bi-weekly to share their problems, frustrations, stories and laughter. This is their chance to let it all out because no one else understands what life is like for them.This book was a refreshing realistic view into the hardships of what it's like to be a pastor's wife. Reading books about members of a pastor's family are always difficult for me to read. It really irks me about the absurd expectations people place on the the pastor and his family. Why do we as church members think that the pastor's family should be perfect and that we have a right to judge every move they make? We're hypocrites. We think that because we "pay for their salary" we have the right to tell them what to do, call they up at anytime for our bidding, and pass along our advice on how to raise their family. There were several interesting revelations I discovered while reading. One was how competitive pastor's wives are with each other which was the case with Kitty. Now that was a character you love to hate. I actually enjoyed reading all her scenes because she's the type of Christian who's walking around with the plank in her eye. While I enjoyed the book, there were several things that irked me. Out of the four women, Mimi was my least favorite. Her story just doesn't make as much of a statement as the other 3. I know she was tired of having the church members constantly dictating what they could do but it didn't seem as important as the other 3 stories. And honestly I found her refusal to stop joining things rather annoying. Mark comes off as the most supportive husband in fact. Now as for the other three wives, I could understand their plights more. It's not fair for Felicia to be looked down on simply because she wants to work outside the home. The pressure put on Jennifer to have a baby is very realistic in this day and age but it's not right for church members to make her feel unworthy for not having a baby. However, the story seemed to portray Catholics as completely different from other Christians. Also I don't blame Lisa one bit for her anger towards Joel for not treating her with love and respect. I've said before, what's the point in helping others if you can't keep your own family intact? I just felt though lot of the misunderstanding and tension in the story could have been made up very easily if people would just talk to each other. It would have made for a shorter story but a lot of drama could have been avoided. Still it was an enjoyable read and I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.

$review_text.: If you like to listen to Garrison Keillor, you should appreciate this delightfully fun (and funny) parody of his Lake Woebegone books. I can't speak to the print book, but I highly recommend the audio version. Phil Gigante gives an absolutely fabulous performance-- his voice, tone and cadence are so much like Garrison Keillor's. Each character has a distinct voice and his accents are wonderful. As you would expect, Lake Woebegotton is full of unique, colorful characters and the story is somewhat slower paced, with quirky tangents and ramblings, much like the Lake Woebegone books. However, it is precisely these things that make the book such a delight. I laughed out loud several times while listening to this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. You do not need to be a zombie fan to appreciate this book. It has its moments of goriness (due to the subject matter), but it's not overwhelming. I am so glad I accidentally stumbled upon this book and decided to give it a try.
$SUMMARY.: For fans of Garrison Keillor- listen to the audio version!

$REVIEW.: Spitfire, Gillian Rutherford is a daughter of a recluse duke. She is has been running from a dark sad secret for the past eleven years, and she is tired of running. She has one shot to have a happy life and make sure his sister Whitney, has a happy life. Gillian must marry to make this reality. She has set her sights on an successful American businessman. This will be her ticket out of England. What she doesn't count on is her heart telling her the American's business partner and best friend is the man she should be with and not the American.Alexander Trevelle, Lord Lionhurst is all things handsome and wicked. He lives a rakes life. Breaking hearts as the day is long among the Ton. Behind the rakes facade Alex is troubled, haunted and desperately faking his way through life. When his sisters sudden death throws him into overdrive, he finds he must ruin and help the woman that makes his blood boil with passion into the arms of his best friend and business partner the American, Drake Sutherland.It's simple really... Gillian Rutherford must marry the American Drake Sutherland and go to America, taking her sister, Whitney with her. She can do that. She'll just need to have the American fall in love with her. She is beautiful and witting, what's not to like? What she doesn't count on is the rake known as Alex Trevelle, Drake's business partner and best friend. A sad turn of events will take place and Alex and Gillian will team up and find a way to get Drake to marry Gillian. This will seek revenge for Alex and give a fresh start for Gillian and her sister. What they both didn't see coming are the sparks that are between them. Can they both ignore the spark to accomplish their goals?This was my first read by Julie Johnstone and I really enjoyed it. This book has quite a bit of suspense just waiting to be discovered. The villain in this book is nasty, and you can't wait for him to get what's coming to him. Great secondary characters as well. Auntie is funny and a strong force to be reckoned with. The chemistry between Alex and Gillian is electric and it was a joy to read it unfold. You'll be on the edge of your seat until the very end to see what happens. Fun read.

$review_text.: Julie Dawn Cole's portrayal of the venomous Veruca Salt in the original WILLY WONKA (including her trademark song I WANT IT NOW!) is unquestionably one of the highlights of a memorable film.  The story of her life before, during, and after the filming is even more interesting.Abandoned by her angry, abusive father at age six, she and her sister were raised by a loving mother who couldn't shield her children from poverty but did everything possible to give them a happy childhood and to help them develop their interests and talents.  For Julie, that meant dancing, singing and acting lessons.  It was the owners of her acting school who arranged the audition for the film (and later pocketed most of her salary!)  The treatment of the four child actors by the film's producers was shameful, but somewhat mitigated by the kindness of the adult actors, including Gene Wilder.  The wonderful character actor Roy Kinnear (who specialized in slimy roles) is remembered as a gentle man and a gentleman.Anyone who saw the movie and loved it will also love this delightful, well-written book. I know I did.

 Megan does not think through her plan very well, and does not understand the potential danger she is putting her family in by bringing home her Highlander
You will have to read this book to discover if these two strong willed characters learn to work together and whether or not they discover love and can find safety.Anne Greene has done a nice job creating &#8220;Masquerade Marriage.&#8221; She helped me have a better understanding of some of the differences between Highlanders and Lowlanders as well as how thorough the English were about hunting down and killing all that fought against them

Some of the themes in this book are pride, and letting go of it, about having respect for others, and about God&#8217;s faithfulness
Truthfully, I got a bit bogged down by all the Scottish brogue, but Greene does have a small glossary in the front of her book which I found helpful.I received this book from The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: I saw this recommended on Twitter by several people and thought why not. Having read romance after romance and monotony taking hold, I wanted (and needed) something different.  Something with some grit. Something romantic with a story to get my teeth into and the grey matter working.  Semblance was exactly that.It is a thrilling, dark, mysterious, romantic journey and Logan Patricks has done a superb job in leading you to believe you know where the story is heading only to discover you're completely off the mark. Granted, I was a touch unsure whilst reading the first 20% but then it grabbed me, I was captivated by the characters and the story and I absolutely devoured it. Right until the very last page my heart fluttered, ached and raced and I went back and forth between smiling, being on the edge of my seat and everything inbetween.It's been a long time since a cliffhanger ending has caused me to wail out loud; the sheer number of books I've read has somewhat conditioned me. However, this has brought all those feelings to the surface again and the need for the next book has left me dangling on the precipice of desperation.Without a doubt, I recommend.

$REVIEW.: I had just reread the very intenseNowhere Ranchand so I have to say I while I enjoyed this book,  it wasn't as strong/powerful as Nowhere ranch and so it lost a star.  I like working class men,  I like books about men and horses, and I liked the family setting.  I just found the revelation of Quinn's secrets to be a bit too heavy handed, and didn't really care about that resolution all that much.I did however adore the virginal Aaron and liked all this thought processes (is Quinn like a dominant horse or a skittish horse? can he apply tactics from either horse to getting him closer...) I enjoyed them together,  and the sexual tension was nicely executed.So an enjoyable book, 4992 locations,  but not one to obsess on afterwards.  I was happy spending time with them but forgot about it pretty quickly, and had too look at my notes to remind me what the book was about.

$REVIEW.: I am not normally attracted to books written in the 1st person, so I was pleasantly surprised when I read this story.  It was great. I became engrossed very quickly with Sandra, the fifty year old heroine, and the cast of quirky characters. Wesley, the eccentric millionaire, I really thought he would be the hero until Carson Holiday, Sandra's ex-husband, arrives on the scene. Carson is a singer and songwriter who has been married several times, but he is so charming you can't hold that against him. And I desperately wanted him and Sandra to get back together. Then there is the crazed stalker Eva and an interferring mother added to the mix.Brenda Whiteside has written, I wouldn't say sweet, more like a whimsical love story with a dash of intrigue. Her mention of the pop stars of the 60's/70's and their songs, certainly gave me a trip down memory lane.If you want a good love story that is just a little different, you won't be disappointed in Sleeping With The Lights On.Margaret TannerPublished Author

 This book clearly presents the battle and is a good book to read before going to the larger works on the subject
 The problem, and it is one with all Kindle war books, is the maps which are very hard to enlarge enough to see them

$review_text.: Unlike some others on the market, Chwast's graphic adaptation, I don't feel, is a replacement for reading the original book. The language is simplified and the story is laid out with large graphics (not small boxes comic-book style that fit more content on each page). There are few words on the page, so even at over 120 pages this read like a fast-forward outline of the original work.I have not read the entire original book by Dante, but for this review I read excerpts of Dante's original to compare. I have read some other graphic presentations of classic literature, some of which use all the original language and some that use modern language and still others use simplified, easier reading type language and am comparing this to those adaptations. All of the others I've read and seen have more illustrations with greater detail than this also.Having read Chwast's adaptation from cover to cover, as a reader who has not read the original classic I had trouble connecting to the story. It just went so fast and I didn't feel emotionally tied or even very interested in the story. The scariest parts were not horrifying but came off as funny to me in a way that I thought, "I don't think I'm supposed to think this is funny but it is", such as in some torture scenes and I'm unsure if this was the intent or not. I found myself scoffing at some religious ideas instead of aligning with Dante's vision to inspire the reader to lead a moral life. I'd hoped to feel hooked in to read this cover to cover in one sitting or at least within one day but I found it boring and uninteresting. I wound up read this over two weeks time picking it up and reading along for short bursts.The book's simple language is easy to understand but my gaps about Catholic church history, history of the Saints, and with the political history of Italy I was lost in some parts. (I fully acknowledge that my lack of context and my ignorance on these topics is not a fault of Chwast, the adaptor but am explaining this so readers of this review may think about whether this graphic adaptation is enough to read as a stand-alone or for what purpose this would be read. For example, a school teacher reading my review may wonder how this could be used instead of or alongside a reading of the original work.)To be honest, reading this graphic adaptation underscored for me the importance of context and how certain works of literature really deserve a careful reading and study to not just understand it but to educate and enlighten the reader in the process of reading it through further study to fill the reader's knowledge gaps. Honestly I now want to read Dante's original as my curiosity is piqued. I was left with a feeling that I'd like to learn more about some of these things that I don't know about in order to understand Dante's journey more deeply.The characters in the story are illustrated with 1920s American styles of dress which was an interesting choice that I don't quite understand. The illustrations are in black ink (unlike the full color book cover) and the illustrations are not very detailed. The faces of the people usually have just the eyes with eyebrows, nose, mouth, and facial hair, most have no additional lines to show emotion on the face. The illustrations remind me of coloring book pages with outlines and white space inside (even the clouds--are those white clouds on a blue sky or storm clouds or what?). There is no shadowing or cross-hatching to show light and dark areas, it's either solid black or white space.I can only speculate that some who understand the original work who also enjoy graphic adaptations may find this adaptation entertaining yet I am sure some would dislike or hate this feeling it cannot ever compare to the original, longer and more detailed allegorical poetry version. I don't think I can predict how you will receive this book no matter how hard I try!I rate this book with Amazon's rating key of 3 stars = It's Okay comparing this to other graphic adaptations of classic works of literature currently in print such as those published by Classical Comics Ltd.

$review_text.: When we think of Luther, he is the personification of boldness. In his day, he stood up to the most powerful man in the known world, the Pope.Luther loved the word of God. When we hear each of the "sola" slogans of the reformation, it is like reading a biography of Luther. Luther was a preacher at heart. Like Paul, he was "not ashamed of the Gospel". He was far from perfect, but aren't we all. He was a world changer.Unlike most books about Luther, which are just about his life, this book is more about Luther's beliefs and teaching. I enjoyed it more than any book I have read concerning him. Lawson brings out the things Luther loved most, the Bible and preaching.To Luther the Word of God is all sufficient and preaching brings that word alive. Without either, there is no salvation. Scripture, being the very word of God, is without error. He believed in the perspicuity of scripture; that it can be understood by anyone who takes the time to study it.Luther was an expositor. He preached through complete books of the bible, explaining them verse by verse. He felt that study was important and was mentally harder than working with the hands.When studying, we should go to the Bible first, before consulting commentaries. He was not against commentaries, but felt that they should not be used as a crutch. We should only consult them after we have spent time in meditation on the scriptures. He believed in a literal interpretation of scripture. The Bible means what it says. It can still contain allegories and metaphors, but we can understand from the text what the author means.Luther studied in the original languages and believed all pastors should know Greek and Hebrew. With that said, because the congregation does not understand the original languages, they should not use in sermons. If they were used it would seem prideful. Above all the preacher should rely on the Holy Spirit to illuminate the scriptures. Without that it is just dry logic.All through this book, we get glimpses of Luther's love for the Gospel. He was a man raised up by God for such a time.I loved this book and highly recommend it and give it 5 out of 5 stars.I received this book free of charge from Reformation Trust in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: This is a good book which is a unique mix of intro and intermediate material. It is now also available as electronic edition including Kindle Edition  from Amazon.It is suitable for one semester course in Perl. Version covered is Perl 5.8 not 5.10. Some issues covered such as dereferencing of arguments in subroutines are rarely covered even in intermediate books. This is definitely much better and cheaper book then Learning Perl (ignore the lemmings effect in Amazon reviews of this pretty weak book).The strong point of the book is the set of examples (you can download them) which illustrates basic material of each chapter. Running them is a must for studying Perl with this book.Examples are often sometimes overcomplicated (like most Perl books authors Simon Cozen tries to impress reader with his knowledge of intricacies of Perl and often loses the sense of proportion; but he is not as bad as Randal Schwartz who is a pathological "overcomplicator" ;-). Still they are very helpful in understanding the language. A very useful exercise that I successfully tried with my students is the simplification of examples provided.Due to this the book is the best for programmers moving from other languages then to "plain vanilla" beginners. It might be also useful for Unix system administrators who know Unix shell reasonably well.The range of topics covered is really impressive:IntroductionChapter 1: First Steps In PerlChapter 2: Working with Simple ValuesChapter 3: Lists and HashesChapter 4: Loops and DecisionsChapter 5: Regular ExpressionsChapter 6: Files and DataChapter 7: ReferencesChapter 8: SubroutinesChapter 9: Running and Debugging PerlChapter 10: ModulesChapter 11: Object-Oriented PerlChapter 12: Introduction to CGIChapter 13: Perl and DatabasesChapter 14: The World of PerlAppendix A: Regular ExpressionsAppendix B: Special VariablesAppendix C: Function ReferenceAppendix D: The Perl Standard ModulesAppendix E: Command Line ReferenceAppendix F: The ASCII Character SetAppendix G: LicensesAppendix H: Solutions to ExercisesAppendix J: Support, Errata and P2P.Wrox.ComSimon Cozens definitely knows the language well and it shows.The book covered a lot of intermediate topics like references, databases, OO concepts, CGI, etc.Lists and hashes are explained well although the author often abuses lists and uses them where they do not belong.  Both are introduced early in the book.Regular expressions are explained OK.  I like the approach the author takes in writing a small program which demonstrates various concepts.The book covers both DBM databases and SQL databases. MySQL is used to demonstrate how PERL interacts with an SQL database. Most Linux distributions have MySQL installed by default, the book also contains useful information about installation and basic configuration, that helps to make MySQL up and running.DBM, which are simple key-value pair databases are covered in more detail. The author demonstrates complex data storage using DBM files. Normally DBM can only store a single value for any key.As for SQL only fairly simple SQL commands are covered, but then is an introductory books and it's naive to expect full SQL coverage.In CGI chapter the author introduces CGI environment variables and HTTP commands such as GET and POST first. Then he switches to the CGI.pm module which is standard module in Perl but unfortunately  introduces a lot of overcomplexity in the topic. CGI security issues are also mentioned.Basic networking is covered in chapter 14.  The Net::FTP module is covered in chapter 11, Object-Oriented Perl which makes this chapter simultaneously an extension of networking chapter.The set of examples from the book greatly enhances the value of the book. It is mostly error free and immediately usable. Also each chapter has exercises with the answers. That makes the book perfectly suitable for the classroom.All-in-all this is a solid introduction to Perl which is attractive not only due to the price.
$SUMMARY.: Good, abeit slightly overcomplicated introduction to Perl

Lori approached myself and Donna to review this, and I was on a NA kick so I couldn't wait to get started.The moment I started this I couldn't really put it down


I really enjoyed it


The characters are great, the story is although been done before still worked fine for me because I like these kinds of stories.The sex was..well it was steaming hot


Which I also like
However there was a lot of it, and to some it may detract from the story and their relationship on a whole or feel a little unnecessary but overall, hot hot hot!I really liked Harlow from the start and I thought she was a strong female who knew what she wanted and went out and got it, and that something was Gunner
Ah Gunner, read so many other men like Gunner, that I actually don't find it dull

Yes ok, I thought the book became slightly predictable in parts and I felt myself rolling my eyes a little in places,but none the less I still enjoyed it.Short and sweet review, overall not a bad book at all
A little flawed in places, but the plot is good the characters well developed and there's a HEA

Fairly satisfied with the reading experience overall

It's definitely a solid 3 stars from me.A copy of this book was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest review

$review_text.: When I received this book to review last week..I was actually away on a beach vacation with my family and I was itching to read a contemporary/summer read!! Luckily, this book definitely didn't disappoint and is the perfect summer beach read.One of my favorite parts about this book was the setting! I really enjoyed reading about Clementine's journey on the boat and how relaxing it was. I also liked how Melissa Walker was able to go into detail about the event that broke Clementine's heart and showing flashbacks of what happened, instead of just telling the reader.I really liked seeing Clementine progress throughout the novel. At the beginning of the book she is a depressed teenager, but by the end she has fallen in love again and is able to pull herself and become the independent girl that she is. I really liked the romance in this book but I wish that there was more of it! The only complaint I have would be that this book does end kind of leave things unresolved, and I wasn't 100 percent satisfied by the end.Overall, I really enjoyed Unbreak My Heart and I thought it was a great beach read! If you are looking for something light and fun to read this summer check this book out!!

$review_text.: A fun read that would make a great family movie!I had been wanting to read Leaving the Bellweathers for a while, but moved it to the top of my reading pile when I learned that Kristin Clark Venuti's sequel, The Butler Gets a Break, was coming out
 I can't read the sequel if I haven't read the original!  The cover hooked me, the characters were quirky and funny, and the storyline simple and fun.The Bellweathers' butler, Tristan Benway, has been serving them, and their ancestors for just under 200 years, to fulfill an Oath of Fealty

 Most of the book are excerpts taken directly from the butler's journal."The happy news is that the two hundred years are nearly up, and I will be free of this circus which masquerades as a household."Even though Benway, the Bellweathers' butler, is planning his escape from the lighthouse, it doesn't take the reader long to realize that Benway is soft on these crazy kids


 His complaints are justified, sure!  The eldest girl hosts a troupe of circus performers, and their pet seal, in her bedroom; the eldest boy thinks a hungry endangered albino alligator is the ideal pet for a lighthouse; and the triplets...well..."...it is an unfortunate fact that the triplets never communicate at a decibel below earsplitting unless they are Up to No Good."..and they are often Up to No Good
 Ah, yes, Kristin Clark Venuti loves to capitalize in Benway's journal, to emphasize his dislike for certain nuances of the Bellweather family

 He counts down his finals days in the house, but finds the faults of the children charming, as does the reader
 Still, even when he begins to doubt his plans to leave, Benway reminds himself:"I only know that any action ever taken by any Bellweather family member has always, and will always, result in crisis"Maybe it was the their-crisis-is-bigger-than-mine aspect that made this such a fun read for me!I only have one criticism, which isn't really a negative when you see the big picture
 While the content was fun and imaginative and appropriate for children, I felt a lot of the humor and vocabulary may be lost on younger children, and would go over better for the pre-teen set
 No one understands sarcasm better than a twelve-year old.Interestingly, this one criticism I have is the one thing I love about some of my favorite children's movies


 Don't you just love going to see a movie with your kids, and there are little one-liners that are benign to the kids, but hilarious for the parents?  There were a few times I felt that way about this book

 So, if you're going to get this book for your Middle Grade reader, read it together!Oh, and when you're finished go read Kristin Clark Venuti's Butler Tristan Benway's website - hilarious!

$review_text.: It's too bad that most creationists won't read this book, and those who do will likely ignore its clear exposition of the evidence for human evolution found in the human genome.The two reviewers who each gave the book a single star exemplify typical creationist approaches to books like this. One reviewer complained that the book began with a "sneer" in the form of an anecdote and refused to even read the book. I presume he was referring to the historical account of Thomas Huxley's response to Samuel Wilberforce not long after Darwin's Origin was published. I hardly think that anecdote can be characterized as a sneer, and I think the reviewer was simply looking for an excuse not to read the book.The second one-star reviewer showed an unwillingness to take an honest look at the evidence and instead asked those with open minds to read the works of that paragon of intellectual honesty and open-mindedness, Jonathon Wells. If only she had an open mind when reading books like this. Quite frankly, I doubt that she, like the other reviewer, even read this book.That said, this book will be an enormously important resource for anyone who is really interested in learning about the genetic evidence for human evolution. It provides numerous clear examples of the "relics"--one could say "fossils" of human ancestry--in our DNA.I was especially interested in the book's analysis of human chromosome 2. It had been known for about a half century that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, whereas the great apes have 24 pairs. Subsequent studies had shown that all of the human chromosomes were highly similar to those of the great apes with the exception of human chromosome 2, which was similar in total to two separate chromosomes of the great apes. With the sequencing of both human and chimpanzee genomes in recent years, the similarity was confirmed. Human chromosome 2 was the result of the joining of the two analogous great ape chromosomes, by an end of one of the chromosomes to an end of the other, some time after the split from the common ancestor of the chimp and human lines. The sequencing revealed that the human chromosome 2 had a region consisting of non-functioning telomere coding in the exact place where the fusion would have occurred, and non-functioning centromere coding in the exact place where the centromere exists in one of the analogous chimpanzee chromosomes. Moreover, the functioning centromere in the human chromosome is in the exact place where the centromere occurs in the other chimpanzee chromosome. These findings make the human-chimp descent from a common ancestor quite evident.These findings are quite significant in light of the fact that creationists had made an issue of the difference in chromosome number between the two species.

$REVIEW.: I have fallen in love with Debora Geary's Witch Central stories.  Her characters are incredibly believable and fully formed.  Her situations and stories are completely believable.  Her family of characters are people I'd love to meet and know.  And until this book, I didn't realize just how much more of the background storylines there was.  To Have and To Code is a tremendous gift from the author to her readers.  She's given us tidbits all along about the history of these two loveable people - Nell and Daniel.  This book brought so many characters together, it includes Nell's family, friends, and even hints at 'witches to come'.  After reading each of the stories in order - I thought I knew everyone's background.  But I was so wrong.  This book was priceless and I'd enjoy getting more backstories in the future. As in all the stories in the series, Ms. Geary skillfully weaves magic, romance, intrigue and suspense, humor and real-life situations into something that keeps you reading page after page and never wanting it to end.  I love how cookies make everything so much better.  I love how in with the laughter and tears, joy and sorrow, is the author's no-nonsense approach to love and life.  She shows how the best things in life are not always the easiest, and that, again, cookies can make most things better.  Ms. Geary, I can't wait to see where you take me next.  And I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.
$SUMMARY.: I had no idea I what I was missing until I read this!

$review_text.: I will start this review with a few quotes from the book that will help you understand how the author(paranormal investigator) explains the paranormal events in the book and how he addressed them to help the people involved and sometimes remove bad entities from their houses.These following quotes are from the introduction.Quote 1. In quantum reality, all of us, whether "living"or "dead" are intimately united in very concrete ways. Time as we understand it doesn't exist. Our sense of "self" is and illusion. All that ever was and all that ever can be exists all at once - in multiple, parallel universes.----------This is the concept of parallel universes, also known as the "multiverse".Quote 2. I don't believe that ghosts are "spirits of the dead" because I don't believe in death. In the multiverse, once you're possible, you exist. And once you exist, you exist forever one way or another. Besides, death is the absence of life, and ghosts I've met are very much alive. What we call ghosts are life forms just as you and i are. I certainly don't believe that ghosts are just video - like "recordings" on the environment.Quote 3. My experience is that there are three basic phenomena that people experience as ghosts: space-time displacements, parasites and what traditionally are known as visitation apparitions. For any of these to become apparent to an observer, electrical and geomagnetic factors that effect quantum reality have to fall into place. These include electromagnetic fields at the sight, minerals in the soil, the height of the water table, and proximity of high tension wires.Quote 4. What i call "ghosts from elsewhen" essentially are conscious glimpses into other areas of space-time. As long as the electromagnetic "ducks are in line" these space-time displacements can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere. I believe they occur at points where two or more universes overlap.Now i will discuss the chapters of the book.Chapter 1 Ghosts From Elsewhen. Involves ghost stories where the author believes the ghosts are living people in parallel universes. And that you are able to see or hear them due to electromagnetic influences where universes overlap.Chapter 2 Tortured Souls. This chapter involves ghost stories similar to chapter 1. Living people in parallel universes who, "while in emotional distress", are inadvertantly projecting themselves.Chapter 3 The Parasites. Involves stories of bad entities and poltergiests. The author believes these are entities that live in the void, that feed off of negative, sad, depressed emotions of humans. Can also be referred to as demons by some people. In these stories the entities are attracted to humans in these forms of emotional distress  or people who open doorways with things like Ouija boards.Chapter 4 The Ancestors. Discusses connections to the departed and how they can help you.Chapter 5 Death: The Final Frontier?  The authors views on death.I believe this was a fairly good book. It is mostly ghost stories with the authors theory mixed in. But let me reassure you that the stories themselves don't get bogged down with his theories. He gets most of his theories out of the way in the introduction. The stories themselves  gave me more than a few chills. They were definitly worth reading. And whether you agree with his theories or not, it can be nice to check things out from a different perspective.

$review_text.: This author is no nutritionist and certainly no scientist


She is a "food writer" who needs to go back to reviewing restaurants
People want to believe that they can eat all the fatty, high cholesterol foods they want if they are "organic" or "unprocessed." It is an appealing idea but just not true


Her main argument is that if our ancestors ate it, it must be good for us

Yes, our ancestors had less heart disease and diabetes, but mainly because they died sooner of what are now curable diseases

 There is no sound nutritional advice in this book.

$REVIEW.: I have purchased quite a few different vegetarian recipe ebooks here on Amazon and also have a small collection of "real" books in my kitchen that I reference all the time while I whip up healthy vegetarian meals.Quite surprisingly this vegetarian recipe book was a little different... here is what I mean.For starters it was written by real people!  I know, sounds crazy but some of the ebooks I bought here on Amazon didn't really have any personality attached to them, like a robot wrote them.  Larry and Oksana really put "themselves" into this book.  It is everywhere!Even in the intro they share what they stand for which after reading really made me like them.  I honestly hadn't been exposed to them prior to this purchase but I am also now following their health blog which fully backs up this recipe book in every way.Plus the recipes are delicious!!  I have had the ebook now for 48 hours and I have already tried 3 of the items in there, all have been great!  I made and subsequently devoured the Coconut Curry Tofu (amazing), the Adobo Herb Salsa (can't go wrong with this!) and lastly the Vegetarian Slow Cook Chili (I ate it all).All in all I give this recipe collection a 5 star rating... I totally enjoyed it!Thanks Larry and Oksana for putting this together and for bringing your "bewellbuz" mindset with you!~Mateo

$REVIEW.: Having read books by both Hise and Brooks before, I was very curious what this joint offering would be like
 Each author has clearly played to their strengths, and there are laughs aplenty in this intricate yet easy-to-follow yarn


 In places the situations reach Victorian levels of farce, and throughout this is a fast, light read to which it is easy to return


 Perhaps most refreshingly for this reader, it was a real pleasure to chuckle, chortle and laugh so often in a story with no profanity

 Even with one hilarious plot twist which I can't reveal because it would be a spoiler, the issue is handled cleanly and for maximum comic effect - a story for the whole family.In summary, Triple Dog Dare is a gem of a book where two talented authors have combined their skills to produce something which greater than the sum of its parts.(Disclosure: I received an Advance Reader Copy of this book and am involved with the authors' Indies Unlimited website, however I would never recommend a book which did not objectively deserve to be recommended.)

$REVIEW.: I love a story that manages to give me goosebumps and &#8220;aww&#8221; moments all at the same time, and If You Dare managed to do just that.I loved that the tables were turned in this one. Instead of girl-likes-boy-but-doesn&#8217;t-have-the-guts-to-tell-him, it was more like girl-thinks-boy&#8217;s-a-douche-and-shouldn&#8217;t-be-alive. With a male character that has been crushing on the female character for two years, this story had some interesting twists.When Marcus Black dares Lily McIntyre to stay in a haunted house for a whole night on Friday the 13th, she accepts, because if she wins, she gets a trip to Hawaii and if she loses, she has to go to an awards dinner with Marcus. But Marcus has other plans. For one he really cares about her, and having her lose the bet is a sure-fire way for him to get a date.When Marcus&#8217;s plans go awry, we find the characters stuck together in the haunted house. Throw in some weird sounds, a strange blackout, and a man who can make you feel safe, well, you can all guess where that leads. Then you put in a ghost or two and you are well-spooked, yet pleasantly romanced.This is a definite must-read.

$REVIEW.: So this is must-read material for any Bond villain. If only Voldemort or Sauron or Cthulhu or French Police Inspector Javert had perused these pages, the world would've been theirs. After years of failure at world domination, Vordak the Incomprehensible is going another route. He's come up with this comprehensive instruction manual that he hopes will inspire some future miscreant into someday taking over the world. All Vordak asks is that a place be made for him in this new world order, preferably that of second-in-command with an option to immediately slide in should something happen to the evil head cheese. This book comes with an evil employment contract that you should probably think twice before signing.In Vordak's own words: "It is my desire to impart a portion of my incalculable knowledge upon those of you who prove to have 'what it takes,' which in this case happens to be $13.99. I realize that seems like quite a bit of money for a book, but when you consider the payoff is sole possession of all the accumulated wealth of human civilization, it's got to be worth $19.99 easy." So, yeah, I'd say Vordak's tutorial, HOW TO GROW UP AND RULE THE WORLD, is a steal.It's "transcribed" by Scott Seegert and illustrated by John Martin in a fun and appropriately cartoony style. I love Seegert's sense of humor which consists of equal doses of absurd and wicked sharp. I've no doubt that kids ranging from elementary to middle school will be chortling like demented seals. The casual first-person writing style allows the reader to feel as if the author is addressing him directly. Vordak guides you thru the necessary steps required for you to eventually hold the world hostage. Relevant chapters include how to choose a costume and select the appropriate supervillain name, how to pick the ideal minions, how to perfect that diabolical laugh ("Mwa-ha-ha-ha!"), how to engage in biting repartee with your nemesis the superhero, how to construct the perfect evil lair, and tons more. Note that you may have to soak in your share of abuse. Vordak the Incomprehensible has got an exaggerated ego and suffers no fools or goobers gladly.Vordak even comes up with a few ingenious ways in which the impressionable young reader can raise capital to pursue his evil goals (lemonade stand, bottle returns, mowing lawns, etc.).So do you have a dark side? I hope you're prepared, because there is a multiple choice quiz to determine your level of evilosity. There are charts and diagrams and checklists. In a moment of largesse, Vordak has even included confidential dossiers of superheroes with whom he is "nauseatingly familiar." As a sample, here's Vordak's index-card file on The Amazing Toddler Man (my favorite):- IDENTITY: Todd Lerman- ORIGIN: Was bitten by a radioactive two-year-old- POWER/STRENGTHS: Possesses the proportionate strength, agility, and snot production of a two-year-old. Strength (and snot production) multiplies hundredfold when having a temper tantrum. If he closes his eyes, you can't see him.- WEAKNESSES: Will eat anything. Gets cranky after 7:30p.m. Requires afternoon naps. Has been known to "drop a stinky" while battling adversaries. Poor balance.- WEAPONS/ACCESSORIES: Will pick up and throw objects he finds lying about, usually after putting them in his mouth first.- NOTES: Easily lured into diabolically clever yet extremely slow-acting death traps with cookies, candy, or music from Dora the Explorer.Also, on page 161 there is a maze puzzle with a very lazy solution. I laughed for 20 seconds straight.So what's keeping you? HOW TO GROW UP AND RULE THE WORLD is a fantastically comical read. It's recommended for those who like to laugh and who aspire to world domination. It's available wherever baddies and superstitious cowardly lots buy books (that includes Amazon and Barnes & Noble). I imagine Vordak's follow-up book,Vordak the Incomprehensible: Rule the School, is also there, sharing shelf space, a shelf space of evil.

$review_text.: Water-Seer is the second book in the Elements Series and the story continues to build.  Ezra continues to learn the truth about the world that he lives in and things are not all that great for him after some of the events in the first book.Sky continues to use his rather unique tactic of sneaking some pop culture references, both current and past, into the story making for a couple of chuckles when you can catch them.  He also reveals a lot more about the various elemental powers.  The water-seers are especially fascinating, at least from my perspective.I'm happy to say that this book didn't suffer from the second book slump that a lot of series experience.  It seems that it's very common for the second book to be more about building the third than actually accomplishing anything and Sky deftly avoided falling into that pattern keeping his latest offering flowing wonderfully and remaining extremely entertaining.  The ending leaves some big questions to be answered and I can't wait for the next book to see what happens next.Review based on an ARC from the author.

$review_text.: This fictional take on the unsolved real-life "Jack the Stripper" murders in London from 1959-64 delve deeply into the era's sordid side. The city is on the cusp of breaking out of the postwar gloom and into the so-called "Swinging Sixties", but meanwhile, someone is killing prostitutes and dumping them in the Thames. The story alternates between two characters: copper Pete (who rises from patrolman to detective inspector over the course of the story) and Stella (who rises from art student to acclaimed fashion designer over the course of the story). The former finds the first body and is later deeply involved in the hunt for the killer, while the latter is tied to the killings through her psychic "gift," which allows her to experience the last minutes of each woman's death.That's right, for some reason, what could have been a perfectly good gritty noir is marred by an unnecessary dose of the supernatural. Now, I'm not completely opposed to mixing the supernatural and the crime genre (for example, Colin Cotterhill'sLaotian seriesdoes it quite well), but here it jars badly. I can only imagine that the author had decided to write about the burgeoning art and music scene of the time, and felt the need to connect that aspect to the murders much more directly than it already was. It's not a good choice, but nor does it wreck the book -- it's more of an irritant.The story oozes atmosphere, and anyone interest in the cultural history of modern London will probably find it worth reading on those merits (Colin MacInnes'trilogyis clearly a heavy influence). Those with an interest in music of the era will also have fun matching some of the fictional characters to their real-world counterparts (the two I'm pretty certain of are the pioneering producer Joe Meeks and the provocateurScreaming Lord Sutch). On the whole, it's a sleazy world, and as the story progresses, it comes as little surprise that plot elements and characters start to mingle with the Profumo Affair. And if you're familiar with that, then the ultimate destination of the story should come as little surprise.So, while the book is pretty engaging and full of atmosphere, by the end it starts to feel a bit like a nostalgic synthesis of 50-year old touchstones: the rise of modern art, the birth of British rock-and-roll, subcultures likeTeddy Boys, the sleazy West End before it was gentrified, the high-level corruption, the lords and ladies up to their eyeballs in porn and S&M;, and soforth. It's all remarkably well-done, but I'm not sure to what extent readers will find it satisfying.Note: Those interested in the real-life case can find plenty of info about it in various serial killer anthologies, as well as two hard to find books published about a decade after the events:Murder Was My Businessby John Du Rose (the autobiography of the cop who led the investigation) andFound Naked and Deadby Brian McConnell.

$review_text.: Home Jobs by Steve Branson is a quality book full of useful tidbits of information that will help you figure out what you might enjoy doing online to make money. It's true we do tend to focus on money before considering whether the job is something we love or not. Unfortunately it takes lots of money to live happily in our society today and this often trumps whether we want to do certain online job or not.The author makes you stop and think before considering what online job you'd like to pursue, which is only going to help steer yourself clear of inevitable obstacles. The &#34;take action&#34; style is what makes me smile because without it you've just got a whole whack of useless information to clog your brain.If you're looking to make some serious money online doing something you love, this is the book for you!

$REVIEW.: These 2 novellas are well written & engaging, certainly I don't resent the price or the time I spent on them.  They're a unique 'take' on a a well loved classic. I do think that if you're looking for another 'feel good' you might be looking in the wrong place(?). Both these tales had terrific plot lines & well crafted stories. Though I admit that (especially the first story) left me a trifle 'unsettled'(?). Very much a case of personal taste as to whether you love, like, hate or are simply indifferent to the stories.

$REVIEW.: The Shaodwrun 20th Anniversary edition combines several sources and some new art into a great starting point for new players. I quite enjoy the book and find that it's laid out relatively logically, though some of my players have complained that it can be a touch more difficult to use then the Shadowrun 4th edition (SR4) book. Character creation is exceedingly flexible, allowing you to build almost any character you'd like.The book opens with establishing the setting, the magical world 2071 where for sixty years magic has returned and changed everything. Next it covers character creation, followed by example characters, how skills work, combat, advice on running the game and creatures, then at last gear and equipment. A great addition from SR4 book is a marker ribbon, allowing you to easily mark one place while looking up other things. The book is of generally high quality with good binding, a durable cover and thick pages.My only quibbles with the system are that it's relatively simple to create a character that can act 2 to 3 times as quickly as a normal person, meaning in many combat situations there can be someone getting twice as many turns as anyone else. Reflex Wiring (Cyberware), Reflex Boosters (Bioware) and Improved Reflexes (Adept power) are very, very powerful.

$REVIEW.: BAD IDEA by Todd and Jedd Hafer takes readers on a road trip with eighteen-year old Griffin Smith. About the time I thought I knew just who the main character was, another - and sometimes disturbing, facet of his personality would be revealed.Difficult subjects are not shied away from or addressed in a predictable way. Each chapter brought a surprise, and kept the action and the road trip moving forward - with a few unexpected detours.I especially enjoyed the hilarious, mental riffs Griffin would take off on. Reading BAD IDEA represents a departure from my usual fare, and I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone to read this book. Once I started, I had no intention of cutting my trip short.Recommended for ages 13 and older.

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE this author! She is one of my favorites and this is the sixth book I have read by her. As usual, I couldn't put it down.I think this one had the most believable love aspect to it. Sometimes the love seems a tad too rushed and feels more like lust on steroids. While this one happens very quickly as well, it feels extremely natural. Maybe it's because it was a little less graphic. Either way, it was incredibly enjoyable.When Ray (Rachel) meets Mark, she is completely disinterested in anyone. He changes that pretty quickly. Soon, they are heating things up and Katrina (the author) does a good job of telling us exactly hot things get! This is definitely not a book for the younger audiences. That is really the only draw-back I can find with her books. Not that I don't enjoy reading them. Just that I have to find time to read them without my kiddos looking over my shoulder. Hehehe.Anyway, I am almost out of good things to say about this author, so I better save them for her next book which I anxiously await and know I will love.Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Tom Minnery believes that Christians not only have a mandate to proclaim the gospel, but to see it exemplified in society as well. He believes that we are not really forced with choosing one or the other: either evangelize or do social reform. He says we can and should do both simultaneously. He rightly argues that meeting people's basic needs (of food, shelter, clothing, jobs, etc.) is part of what it means to be salt and light in the world. And such activities also make the gospel message much more palatable, much more believable, much more acceptable.And the history of the Christian church is full of examples of the use of a whole gospel to meet the needs of whole people. Wherever missionaries went they did good deeds as they preached the good news. Hospitals were built, women and children were ministered to, hunger was dealt with, schools and job opportunities were developed, prison and work conditions were improved, and so on. It is exactly because so many Christians treated people as whole beings, not just souls to be saved, that so many people were in fact saved.For example, many people became Christians in the early days of the church because of these acts of mercy and compassion. When a plague or pestilence swept through an area, most people would flee. But it was the Christians who stayed behind, ministering to the sick and needy. Many thousands of conversions took place as a result.In this book Minnery, from Focus on the Family, provides examples of great saints whose lives were a testimony to many, not just because of the words they spoke but because of their actions as well. He looks at Theodore Weld, the Christian anti-slavery activist who made such an impact in nineteenth century America.He also examines the remarkable life of William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army in England. The number of souls saved and people whose lives were changed for the better as a result of his ministry numbered well into the thousands. London saw a radical transformation because of this Christian work. The help given to the city's many prostitutes, for example, is a powerful and moving story. And practical help offered to the poor and homeless by the Salvos over a century ago still provides inspiration and instruction for Christian workers today.Other history makers and social transformers are discussed, such as the Wesleys and William Wilberforce. Their inspiring stories demonstrate what a handful of people can do when empowered by the spirit and motivated by Christ's compassion. Not only are souls saved but whole societies are transformed.And as Minnery makes clear, the opposition such world-changers receive does not come simply from unbelievers. Often the greatest critics of these men and women of God were other believers who thought their zeal to change the world was misplaced and misdirected. Many thought they should just preach a simple gospel, and forget about slavery, prostitution and other social ills. But these saints persevered, and all the world owes them a debt of gratitude as a result.This book not only provides historical examples of why Christians need to be involved in their communities, but offers solid biblical reasons for why we must be so involved. He thus answers many of the common objections, such as, "Christianity and politics don't mix;" "You can't legislate morality;" "Christians should avoid controversy;" and "Social engagement is worldly". And he provides a theological rational for why we need to be involved in our world. The command to be salt and light is just that: a command. Jesus did not say, "Hands up all of you who want to be salt and light". He said it is part of our job description.Minnery deals with other objections, such as the lament that I am just one person, and what I do cannot really make a difference. He reminds us that God often works through one person, or a few people, to accomplish his purposes.He also offers practical advice on how concerned Christians can impact their communities, on a local level as well as on a national level. Solid advice is given on how Christians can influence local issues and politics; how they can set up social actions committees; and how they can network with like-minded groups to make a difference in their communities. And several appendices offer down-to-earth advice on how Christians - both as individuals and groups - can get started in really making a difference in their church, their local community, and their world.In an age where the world in many ways really is going down the tubes fast, there is the temptation to shrug one's shoulders and simply say, well, there is no reason to rearrange deck furniture on a sinking ship. But just maybe it is this wholesale withdrawal of so many Christians from the world around them that has lead - at least in part - to its destruction and disintegration. Instead of being salt and light, and turning our world upside down as the early church did, we have simply opted out. And the world has been the poorer because of it.So this book is an urgent and necessary wake-up call for many believers. We have offered a half-baked gospel to a desperate and needy world, and we are surprised that so few heed our message. Well perhaps it is time to rethink our message and our lifestyle. And this book helps us to do just that.

$review_text.: I have never read a writer who has such a command of literary technique as Rafael Sabatini. His plots are intriguing, extremely well thought out, colorful and historically accurate. He has the knack of describing settings meticulously without being tedious. Each of his characters (not just the major ones) are superbly developed. I loved Captain Blood when I was 13 years old and today, nearly 40 years later, it still holds tremendous fascination for me (and for my now 13- and 17-year old children). As a child, I admired the fast moving plot, the wonderful use of dialect and those beautiful words (most of which I had to look up in a dictionary) which Sabatini used to paint pictures in his readers' minds. This collection has given me the opportunity to read his other works which are no less superb than Captain Blood. Scaramouche and Seahawk are just as well written as Captain Blood, although all three books feature innocent men who suffer unjust punishment for crimes they did not commit. Sabatini seems to be fascinated by the ideal of men who suffer tremendous injustice, but whose nobility, gallantry and magnanimity triumph inspite of unimaginable persecution. In our world today where the word &#34;virtue&#34; is hardly ever heard or written about anymore, it is refreshing to read novels where such qualities are demonstrated in the light they deserve. Another reviewer mentioned the amazing expansion your vocabulary will enjoy if you read Sabatini. I couldn't agree more. Anytime you want to be transported out of your world into an exciting, action packed one, pick up a Sabatini adventure. You will not be disappointed.The only reason I gave this collection 4 stars is that there seems to be quite a number of typographical errors in the novels. Nothing you can't figure out, but it does detract from the reading experience. Interrupts the rhythm of the reading, so to speak. But I'm finding out that this is a common defect of many Kindle books.

$REVIEW.: Emilie's first adventure was Emilie and the Hollow World
Emilie proved to be both resourceful and clever after she determines to run away from home

Except her planned adventure takes an unexpected detour when she finds herself a stowaway on the Marlende steamship
I'd definitely recommend the first book but you can read this second book on its own, too.What I like best about Emilie is that she both thinks for herself and she's quick on the uptake


She takes her job as Miss Marlende's young assistant very seriously

(She should because she more than earned the position in the first book.)Reading a Martha Wells book is just such a joy
Emilie and the Hollow World was roughly along the same lines as Journey to the Center of the Earth except Ms


Wells' peopled her world with her own alien characters and her own steampunk technology

The aliens are even better in the Sky World

Both worlds are so richly textured and the world-building has so obviously been well thought out.I would recommend the Emilie books to anyone wanting to read a thumping good adventure, especially by an author with such a vivid imagination!



$SUMMARY.: Another splendid Emilie adventure!  More, please!!

Once you've met the characters, this story moves very quickly.Good plot, interesting twists with the villains.In my mind's eye, I'm picturing the wizardry and to some extent the creatures of Lord of the Rings mixed with the cultures and people of Game of Thrones. There are giants, but otherwise everybody so far is human. There is definitely magic, and there are griffins, dragons, and flying horses.Looking forward to the third installment.

The prose in the first chapter was promising but it was all down hill after that.I get that the dragon was trying to adjust after thousands of years being asleep but the so called humour relied heavily on crude and coarse comments made by the main character in an effort to show how out of touch he is and then there is the frequent use of the F word. I'm no prude and have no problem with a judiciously placed crude comment or swear word but in this instance it was immature and read more like a teenage boys idea of a hero.Every woman on the planet lusted after the dragon after seeing him naked in human form on security camera film because he was so perfect. He's a perfect warrior, just and kind but can be righteously angry. Something we are told constantly throughout the novel. He's so virile that he gets his love interest (dispite the fact she is supposedly infertile) pregnant on a one night stand and they're so in love after said one night stand, he is willing to rip the world apart to save her. By the end of the novel he is idolized as a God by the world. Really????I gave it 2 stars simply because for the most part there were only a few spelling or editing issues but unless you are a 16 year old boy I don't recommend wasting your money or time reading this

$review_text.: This is gorgeous hardcover book all about the world of Numenera and the cypher system.  It's a story driven system all about exploration.  The character creation system only has 3 "classes", but the real meat is in the descriptor and focii.  I've not seen a system like this, and it's worth picking up for this alone. I'm really looking forward to the expansions that will come to this over time, as well as the new The Strange game being kickstarted.It's not a game built around combat and loot.  You can do that, but there are better games for that.GM intrusions are a great idea, worth stealing for any other system.  It allows the GM to give the game a push, and gives an xp to the player it's used on and they can give a 2nd xp to a 2nd player!  What a wonderful idea.I truly love how alien the setting is.  You know that humans were here, were gone, and now are back.  And no one knows why.Strangely, there is one flaw, which while easy enough to ignore, absolutely shocks me for it's appearance.  Some focii tell you how your character feels about another PC!  No.  No, no, no.  A game rule should NEVER do this.  Take Lives in the Wilderness, p. 68.  "Pick one other PC who isn't from the wilderness.  You can't help but feel a little contempt for that character and her "civilized" ways, which show disdain for all things natural and (to your mind) true."  It amazes me that this sort of thing was allowed, but no way I'd ever force a PC to react to another PC in any manner.  That should always be in the PC's control.Also comes with a full color poster size map.  Pick up for sure.

$REVIEW.: I was mixed on this book.  It presented a wonderful history and philosophical background for Hsing-Han Liu's Ba Gua, but the palms shown were the simplest levels (predominately qi gung), the applications were rudimentary (perhaps even watered down), and the mechanics simplistic.  For a book that started to emphasize energy, proceeded to walking qi gung palms, a more appropriate finale would have been more sophisticated energy applications and/or development.  Real insights from this incredibly experienced Ba Gua master would have been nice, and invaluable.

$REVIEW.: Book Review: For Love of a CauseIt is the 1970's
A small insurgent group is battling an undefined but assumed corrupt and brutal government in Bolivia


American suburbanite Annie Crossland travels there with a church group to aid an orphanage and connects with the British purveyor for the well-hidden insurgent group
Annie accompanies him on a supply trip to the main rebel encampment where she finds a role for herself that has been hitherto missing in her life, as well as a volatile yet fulfilling relationship with the rebel leader


Yet we know the fate of most South American rebellions 


.This is an amazingly well-researched book that lets us walk in Annie's shoes the entire way
She is the bored wife of a wealthy and bland lawyer but she has hidden strengths and skills that quickly become useful to the rebel group; shooting thanks to skeet with her father, Spanish from college courses, and animal husbandry because of the horses she has at home

She is an innate organizer, as well, who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty.The authenticity and writing quality of this book, in terms of both description and characters, cannot be overstated

Annie is no idealistic do-gooder and she is torn between going back to her husband, the Brit who makes periodic supply trips between civilization and the rebel encampment, and her growing fascination with Alex, the educated and handsome but brutal Marxist rebel leader (think Che complete with black beret.)Everyone is complex--the product of their background--and Michaels does a wonderful job of slowly connecting Annie and Alex as each struggles with lust, ideology, and relationships with other members of the growing rebel force
I was impressed with the way the author kept Alex true to his character and never gave into temptation to soften him into an easier person for Annie to love
And Annie never loses her awareness of his volatility and cruelty

Dialogue is used to good effect such as when Alex taunts Annie because she is not eating and she tells him it is because he smells like an animal

The atmospherics throughout the book are excellent and consistent.The rebels want to create a new society in Bolivia and try to create a system of local justice to provide the peasantry some measure of protection and stem the Bolivian Army's random seizures, taxes, and rapes

Annie gets caught up in the effort, deciding to stay with Alex and divorce her husband
Some of the best scenes are those in which Annie shoulders a gun and engages in guerilla warfare with the rebels whose infiltration efforts are well described

Expect your heart to pound as Annie panics but does what is expected, with an emotional aftermath she barely survives


Another stellar scene is when the volatile Alex finds out that she is married.I would have liked a little more backstory on the Bolivian government the rebels are fighting


The book also deserves a better editor


But overall, this is a sweeping 5 star novel that fans of Ann Patchett or Anita Shreve will enjoy.

$REVIEW.: Before I write my review, let it be known that I am a big Quinn Loftis fan and absolutely LOVE her stories!  Some may not like "my opinion" in my review, but it is just that, MY OPINION.  I also know for a fact that an Author who really cares for their writing, appreciates a review that isn't always just written in a positive view but what they REALLY think.  (That is said with experience from past replies I've seen and heard from other Authors.)  Also, I don't give too much detail in my reviews because I don't want to ruin it for anyone else who will read this book.  With that said:As usual, I LOVE Quinn's stories and I have loved the GWS.  The first book in this series was exciting, fresh, humorous and so much more.  The next couple of books that followed were also really good.  Then they started to get a little silly with the banter and such.  In this book, it was just down right ridiculous.  And that really stunk!  But only because the story itself is fantastic.  I will try to explain:  Peri is suppose to be a very old Fae who is serious and extremely intelligent and so on.  When you have her saying things that are like this:  (This is not word for exact word, but is quite close) "...acting like chimpanzees picking up poop and throwing at each other..."  SERIOUSLY??!!!!  There is A LOT of this silliness that if you were a young child, you would think was humorous and wouldn't realize that it's being said from someone who would NEVER say something like this.  There are also things in this book that are not appropriate for young audiences so this also confused me.  On one hand you have a bunch of childish banter and on the other hand you have sexual content or violence.  Reading it, it was like you have one book made for children and another for adults but they were combined together even though they are the same story.  It was confusing.So, I am strongly on the fence on this one as to rating it.  I must say, I really liked the story and how things went throughout it.  With the adventures, action, struggles, "some" of the banter, the love ties between all, the evil plots and so on, it was an awesome book!  But what ruined it for me on MANY occasions was the overly silly things being said.  They were not really appropriate coming from a couple of the characters.  UGH!  See?  I am going back and forth about it in my review:  "I love the story".  "The silliness was overdone".  "I love the story".  See?  lol Okay, I think you get my point.I do recommend this read ONLY if you don't mind a bunch of childish sayings from people who you would NEVER imagine saying it or them being said at times that are when you would NOT do so.  It is a really good read otherwise.

$review_text.: What was the KGB is now the FSB


 What are these people now doing?  This 2010 book  brings the reader up to date, as best the authors can manage


 It's a difficult subject, what with the principals not the least interested in journalists recording their organization
 The authors deserve a C for their limited but admirable penetration of the FSB bureaucracy


 They even have an org chart -- Appendix 1!There's a serious concentration of attention on the Chechen threat to peaceful Russian society and the FSB's responses to that threat


 While this brings some gritty detail to the book, it also leaves some of the more boring parts of the FSB's dossier quietly in the shadows.The wooden prose, as other reviewers have noted, is an obvious flaw


 Where are the thumbnail sketches of important players, descriptions of buildings, or the weather on the day the authors met that key informant?  Was it a dark and stormy night?  As a reader of "Wired" and "The Atlantic" I appreciate first class reportorial prose
 A book like this is a patient slog
 Recommended only for those with an interest in contemporary Russia.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted this to wrap up and a nice little bow for me. Ella started to annoy me in this installment. She had a lot of traumatic events happen to her and that lead me to forgive her &#8216;stubbornness&#8217; but it was full force in this book. I still really liked the prose of the work. I think Miller is a good story teller and I&#8217;d like to read the 4th book (hopefully the last!) in this series &#8211; just because I want to know what happens.Ella is in a love triangle, and boys just can&#8217;t seem to NOT be attracted to the girl. It gets old and Ella&#8217;s reactions to the new hottest boys are also confounding &#8211; WHY? Also, I felt the part of the past books that I would&#8217;ve liked to have been cleared up is that she&#8217;s royalty. Not, just a princess, but the future Queen. Why does it have to be her? This is not answered and I felt like I needed it to be. She&#8217;s the youngest of her siblings and traditionally the mantle gets passed down to the eldest? Right? Wrong, according the Ella&#8217;s parents, we just don&#8217;t know why. And we never really find out why all these abundant powers - powers that no one else in her family, or in vampires in general &#8211; have but her. But, I was expecting this to be the last in the series where I finally got some answers&#8230;perhaps why I am a bit irritated I didn&#8217;t get them. I am still interested in reading the next book, just so I can get the answers to the many questions I have. I just felt, if Miller gave us a few of them in Unforgiven, then I&#8217;d be less annoyed. Having said that, I still enjoyed the read enough for 3 stars.Disclaimer: I was given this book in exchange for an honest review from Lovers of Paranormal (LOP).

Though I know we still have a lot to learn about Stella and Gabe, this was a solid introduction. It was a little too short for me, but I'm hoping there isn't much space between each installment. I recently read a serial where the installments were released every two weeks. Let's hope that the case here!I'm not sure what Gabe's reason for playing this game is. Could be because something has happened in the past that doesn't allow him to think he can have something serious. However, he sought Stella out knowing she had a plot. Obviously, Gabe has an agenda too. It happened a little suddenly, her first day of employment, but that didn't make it any less hot. Looking forward to what &#34;F&#34; and beyond brings!

It's about someone who has had a difficult life and as a result has a difficult time trusting those around her or even liking herself. I loved that it wasn't a love simply based upon physical attraction as so many of the romances are these days, but one really born of emotional and intellectual connection along with the physical attraction.

$review_text.: Stupid by Choice is a self-deprecating portrait of dysfunction in the upper echelons of society


The book follows Melanie, a thirty-something Texas debutante who has all the trappings of success in New York through her personal "aha" moment

The story opens with her inviting movers into her home to relocate her from a bad marriage as stealthily as they can
As the three apply their muscle to packing up her belongings, Melanie unpacks the baggage of all that has transpired to get her to that place.The story is all at once funny, dramatic, sad and everything in between as we relive Melanie's life from Texas, Monte Carlo, Manhattan, Newport, and Palm Beach, where she faces destructive love affairs, financial trouble, family issues, unplanned pregnancy, and more of the same with her sister and her friends
 Her father, Oldie, is a figure who could be compared to the Rock Hudson character in the classic movie, Giant, and her mother the Elizabeth Taylor character


Her parents raise her as they were before her, as spoiled children of entitlement who have to learn to separate reality from the trappings of privilege to which they have grown accustomed


Melanie suffers a lot of the same trials and tribulations as women of lesser means, despite having been born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth.With a surprising and unprecedented opportunity to have lasting love with the most unlikely person, will Melanie squander it on principal or will she experience the epiphany she needs to free herself from being "stuck on stupid," or will she remain "stupid by choice?" Find out for yourself
Make Stupid by Choice one of your summer reads.I give Stupid by Choice 3.5 Stars.

$REVIEW.: Of all the skills Juliet Waldron draws upon as a writer of historical fiction, none stands out more powerfully than her sense of time and place. In "Roan Rose," the reader is transported through tiny details of dress and setting into a late medieval world that comes alive with stark and vivid realism. A castle, a peasant's squalid hut, the field after the brutal carnage at the Battle of Bosworth -- all pulse with sight and smell and sound. This is not to say that the people who populate this wonderfully imagined book aren't likewise endowed. With a mixture of historical and fictional characters, the story of peasant-born Rose's surprising lifelong relationship with Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Lady Anne Neville (later King Richard III and his queen) is a joy to read and hard to put down.Filtered through Rose's point of view, the historical events have a marked Ricardian perspective. (And what could be more timely, given the recent discovery of "the king in the carpark?") Richard comes across as a man true to his era, complete with faults and strengths, in a way that will make us in the 21st century pause to consider the 500 years of bad press that has been the lot of the last Plantagenet king and the last English king to die in battle.But this is Rose's story even more than it is about giving a much maligned king his due. It is a story of honor and loyalty...and deep, abiding love. Through Waldron's stellar prose and Rose's eyes, we experience the inequities of 15th century life from both sides of the class divide, as Rose grows from a child of ten into a woman. We suffer with her and feel her joys and fears while she hacks out an often hard and bitter life as a woman of intelligence and sensibilities in a time when it was tough enough just staying alive.

$REVIEW.: Originally published at The Rookie Romance Blog.Every girl (well, most girls) dreams of being swept off of her feet by the handsome rock star they idolise, but when it happens to Sophie Penhalligan it's not quite as perfect as she'd imagined.Sophie is a journalist, working in London and dating the steady and safe Tim
Things have been a bit lackluster between her and Tim, and Sophie finds herself rediscovering her favourite rock band, Tuscq- along with their alluring lead singer, Dan


Sophie is surprised by a proposal from Tim, but can't help but have some conflicted feelings towards Dan.Soon, Sophie is whisked away on Tuscq's revival tour

Can her relationship with Tim last when she's with Dan every day? Does she even want it to?Sophie is really relatable and likable, I found that I could really empathise with her situation

She's fun and throughout the book we follow her journey as she tries to figure out exactly who she is and what she wants
Sophie only really seems to stay with Tim because she is comfortable and wants to settle, though of course she thinks she loves Tim
It was clear that Tim wasn't the one for Sophie though, as often pointed out by her dependable and outrageous best friend, Rachel.Dan was very much how you imagine a rock star to be- charismatic, delicious and a total ladies man
Sophie is swept into a whirlwind romance with Dan that seems idyllic, but may not be the right relationship for her.I loved the journey Sophie takes throughout the story, she seems to grow into herself more
She definitely gains the confidence to make some hard decisions, that may just surprise you.Nicky Wells' writing is perfectly descriptive, you can imagine everything easily and vividly


I loved the parts when they're on tour, especially their time in Paris! There's fun moments, but the story has plenty of ups and downs and keeps your interest without difficulty.The ending was right for Sophie, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else will develop in her life!*I received a review copy from the author, for my honest review


Thank you!

$review_text.: Before writing a review for a book like this one, I actually want to try if the method explained really works

And yes it does


But, you must keep in mind a few things:* Yep, it must be a non-fiction book.* You MUST be an authority in your field.* You feel a need to share your expertise with the world to help others.* What you'll write in less than 72 hours is your first draft.Because, if you are an expert in the field that is the subject of your book, the words will just pour out of you


You know what it is you are writing about and it just comes out - a stream of consciousness.You should have a need to express yourself through writing, you have an inner yearning to share your experiences with the rest of the world
If you think that you can make money writing but you don't actually love doing it, then this book isn't for you
Nor any other on writing for that matter

This book is for those who write because they like it, but do not know where to start
It will give you a process and a framework to work with

It is short, clear and concise, as any great guide should be.Don't be fooled into thinking that your book will be ready for publishing on Amazon in under 72 hours


You will WRITE the first draft in that time window, but refining and checking for errors takes time


And Nancy's guide tells you exactly that - writing a book under 72 hours


Proofing, marketing and other stuff comes later.Here's further evidence - I did it by following Nancy's method:Eliminating Energy Vampires, Drainers and Negative People: How to Recognize, Protect Yourself Against and Get Rid of Persons Who Steal Your Energy, Drain You and Make Your Life Miserable
Yes, you can do it too! Good luck!



$SUMMARY.: Yes it works, if you meet the requirements!

$review_text.: Now, as being a 57 year old woman who grew up in an upper middle class family, this book was very interesting and thought provoking. I feel really bad that life is like that for so many of our young people. It was well written and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.  Not to be able to sit on your front porch because of so many 'drive bys'  I feel really bad for the people forced to live that way. I know it happens everywhere, every city , every state.  I wish the boys in the hood instead of trying to protect their hood would join the service and protect the whole country but it's not like they are like citizen watch, they want control of the drugs, the woman etc.... I have not lived like that but I do have a heart and feel for the moms and families that have lost someone to a rival gang or by being an innocent bystander or just playing in their yard..... I usually know what to do when bad situations arise,,, but never had to deal with what this poor girl had to go through.. I'm hoping she gets great grades and gets a scholarship and can get a great job and move to a great neighborhood.... guess the next 2 books will tell me what happens..  this is not your fairy tale happy life story that most books I have read are about,,, this seems to be an accurate description of what it's like to live in the hood or the project.... so wish school would start early and help these kids and that parents would not be taking drugs and be more responsible but it is not my place to judge,,, My heart really does go out to the families living in scary gang riden neighborhoods.... Good job Niki showing us the real way a hell of a lot of people live. So sad that it really is like that for them...

$review_text.: I read this novella a couple of weeks ago and for some reason am only now getting to writing my review which is perhaps a strange way to start but on reflection helps me make the point that it is still strong in my memory.Bayard did a very good job of giving us a glimpse into this universe, letting us know that we do not know all of the rules and let a story unfold in a reasonable way
The efficient use of language packed a great deal of story into an exciting novella that hopefully promises a lot more from the &#8216;Half Wise&#8217; series.This is a fantasy novella that packs a lot into a small space and well worth a read by fans of that genre.



$SUMMARY.: Captures the imagination and promises more
