$REVIEW.: 4 out of 5 stars, this is one young adult novel that entices you into the story then hooks you into wanting more!!! I could not get enough of this story!! It starts out not long after Jax left her coven and is trying to find a way to get into High School when her world takes a hard left turn when a hunter, Keller, comes into her life. Their relationship is the type I love reading about; it's intense, all encompassing, and undeniable. In addition, the plot was written in a way that you cannot help but be intrigued with it especially when it leaves you hanging at the end. Is Keller really fully human? Will Jax be or is she the only one of her kind? What will happen to Jax & Egan? Will Keller & Toni follow Jax & Egan? So many questions about what will happen make me even more curious as to what will happen in the next book in this series, "Bane."I recommend this series and novel to anyone looking to read a different take on what it means to be a witch. Or to anyone who likes young adult paranormal romances!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and two teasers on my blog)

$REVIEW.: Set in 1910 and thereafter, this novel picks up from `A Flickering Light,' the first book in the `Portrait of the Heart' series, and follows the continuing saga of Jessie Ann Gaebele, an eighteen year old photographer, who was born and raised in Winona MN

 The story is based on the life of Jane Kirkpatrick's ([...]) own grandmother.Here is the book trailer for this fascinating novel:[...]The main character, Jessie Ann Gaebele, was an astute businesswoman who had her own business in the fairly new field of photography


 Her belief was that a woman needed to be able to take care of herself - to not rely on men to take care of them

 She had a strong sense of wanderlust - and she lived a very adventurous life.Jessie worked for a gentleman named Fred Bauer, a German immigrant who owned a photography studio
 Their relationship began in `A Flickering Light' and continues here
 Although I have not read `A Flickering Light' (yet!), it is clear from reading `An Absence So Great' that they were attracted to each other (Fred was a married man), and Jessie needed to get away from the situation


 She did so by moving to Milwaukee Wisconsin.Jane provided a handy `Cast of Characters' list and a map of Winona Minnesota circa 1900 at the beginning of the book


 I found that list and that map to be of great value in order to more easily follow along and to get a better perspective on the story.I was totally captivated by this book

 I made the mistake of starting to read it late in the evening; fortunately, I did not have any early engagements the next morning, or I would not have made them!  I read the book in just a couple of sittings

 Jane's ([...]) writing style is entertaining and very creative.And I was finding myself admiring Jessie for her strong sense of self and amazing resilience and work ethic
 She had a wonderful artistic sense, and always had her eyes open to the possibilities and to the future (with the occasional regret for past mistakes)

 She ultimately realized that she was missing out on the important things in life by dwelling on the past and on her shortcomings


 I was also attracted to Jessie's character because she was attracted to a man named Fred of German descent (that's my husband's name)!I was also intrigued by the fact that Jane often mentioned the architect Frank Lloyd Wright ([...]), who had a studio near where Jessie lived, in her book
 Although he often had a tumultuous personal life, I have always been interested in his work.I found Jane to have a wonderful way with words
 Here is an example - both for its lovely writing and for its helpful words of wisdom:Today atop those hills looking west, she affirmed that she might never marry, but she could be part of something good if she set aside regrets, if she ceased demeaning and instead admitted that her self-pity, jealousy, and hopelessness were as offensive as her part in [edited by me - spoiler]


 Perhaps then she could be available for....love, for the good God intended for everyone

 That's what her pastor assured


 She decided that self-pity was an even greater transgression than going to a movie theater or attending a sporting dance...
(p


327)Here's one more wonderful passage:When I'm feeling low, I pull out my photo album and remember as I did that day that photography was my life only until I discovered what life is really made of: the settings, props, and poses we encounter, then put aside so we can cherish family and faith, live fully, and abide until we go...


His caring eye behind the lens captured a love that now helps fill an absence so great I could not have prepared for it on my own
 God remains my guide
(p
367)Some neat facts in the Author Interview at the back of the book:* The photos included in the book were taken by Jessie; several are those of her family.* Jessie passed away in 1990 at age 98.* Jane learned that she and her grandmother had a lot in common:"Like Jessie, I tend to deal with disappointment by first avoiding then acknowledging the truth


 I struggle with unworthiness, distancing myself at times from spiritual support, and have to work at seeing what's past become water under the bridge
 How I deal with absences of the heart gained dimension in the writing of this book." (p
374)There is also a Reader's Guide with questions for personal reflection or group discussion
 This would be a fascinating book for a book club, and Jane offers phone interviews for book groups.Jane Kirkpatrick ([...]) is an award-winning, best-selling author of sixteen historical novel and three non-fiction title, including `A Flickering Light,' the first part of Jessie Gaebele's story


 She is a native of Wisconsin; for the past twenty-five years, she and her husband Jerry have lived on a ranch in Oregon.This book was provided to me by Waterbrook Press for review and giveaway purposes.Reviewed by Andrea Schultz - Ponderings by Andrea - [...]

$review_text.: Fr. Phillippe's Interior Freedom is a gem, a guide to developing the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity: "we gain possession of our interior freedom in exact proportion to out growth in faith, hope, and love" with an emphasis on "the key role of the virtue of hope in our inner growth."Simply but profoundly, Fr. Phillippe discusses freedom and its counterfeits, the barriers to freedom, suffering, forgiveness, resentment, acceptance of others, spiritual trials, living in the present moment, pride, and more.A "fundamental mistake about freedom is to make it into something external, depending on circumstances, and not something primarily internal." "Every Christian needs to discover that even in the most unfavorable outward circumstances we possess within ourselves a space of freedom that nobody can take away, because God is its source and guarantee. Without this discovery we will always be restricted in some way, and will never taste true happiness. But even if we have learned to let this inner space of freedom unfold, then, even though many things may well cause us to suffer, nothing will really be able to oppress or crush us."Fr. Phillippe's presentation is an invaluable aid to the interior life. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: H.B.I.C. brings the crew back with Elle, Twyla and cousin Needra as they have become international brides, drug smugglers, and now they embark on becoming drug dealers in new territory.  The young ladies are experiencing grown up endeavors with danger lurking stealthily in the shadows.  Now that they have a legitimate goal in sight, their hustling instincts have kicked in to overdrive as they grind with a purpose.  Although their love for fashion and designer labels proves to be a stumbling block in their naivet&eacute;.H.B.I.C. 2 continues the saga as these young ladies venture into the seedy jungles of Venezuela, to the backwoods of North Carolina...all for the love of money.  Again, a great storyline peppered with death, betrayal, drug activity, bravado, choices, and allegiances are tested and defined as they delve deeper into a life of crime.  I love the underlying message of their Christian upbringing, a very loud yet silent message.  In their pursuit of dirty money, they encounter treason among family and friends....will they stand or fold?  I would have liked to see more character and scene development displaying growth with their age and more emotional exhibits instead of just matter of fact situations.  Part 2 cinched this as a commendable read.  The cliffhanger ending left the reader further intrigued with even more questions...Kudo's!

$review_text.: This is a great book and what I believe the first of its kind!!  I was so moved by it that I ended up buying the other 3 books written by Pia and Lynn.  I have read almost everything you can think of as far as books on the mental game and many books on the mechanics of the game.  I for the first time feel I have direction with my golf game.  I also can look back and see how I was a self-defeating and self-fulfilling prophecy with my anger and frustration with this game of golf.  The past 2 yrs have been out right horrible and in both seasons I have quit for at least 2 weeks with no intentions on returning but the never ending draw of the game always brings me back.  Through this book and their other books I can see my mental faults and most importantly how to attack them.  You will not regret getting this or any of the other books if you really want to start enjoying this game.  One of the best books I found that really shed light to my problems is the &#34;Managing Emotions&#34;.  The other 2 books, &#34;Play your best golf now&#34; and &#34;The Game before the Game&#34; are similar but my only corrective criticism is that I don't have enough time as a father of 2 and working full time to try all the activities they recommend.  I have no doubt they are worthwhile and I will try to do them on my wed. afternoons off for my 30 min practice sessions.

$review_text.: Diva NashVegas was a fun, adventurous read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The humor was delightful and the antics between Aubrey and Scott were hilarious at times. I enjoyed hanging out with Aubrey and getting a feel for who she really was inside. How she learned to conquer her fears and make better decisions for herself, including returning to her childhood faith. Aubrey was a tough, but lovable diva, and when people treated her like a normal person it not only touched her heart, but it moved mine as well. Fame definitely comes with a price and her story is a wonderful illustration of that truth. Overall, Aubrey seemed more like a friend to me than a character in a novel. She was that real. And the way the author brought her character out through a variety of interviews was pure genius.Scott grabbed my heart from the beginning. Though I didn't despise Car, I definitely wanted to see her with Scott, who was less pretentious. However, the scene with Car in the restaurant was truly touching. And her discovery of her feelings toward Scott gave me delicious shivers. Scott was just an all-around nice guy and a true hero in every sense regarding Aubrey. I loved watching their friendship grow. I think of all the novels Rachel has written (that I've read) this is my favorite. I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: U.S. Deputy Marshal Morgan Jacobs thinks she's going crazy. She was attacked in an alley and stabbed in the chest. But then it felt as if her eyes caught on fire. The mugger turned to stone, falling apart and crashing bit by anatomical bit to the pavement. He turned into a frigging statue and fell apart.So when she's released from the hospital, she locks herself in her apartment, doesn't talk to her friends, orders groceries online for delivery, and spends the next four months trying to figure out what happened. But one night when she sneaks downstairs for her mail, she's approached by a law enforcement-type hunk who asks for her help on a case, some impossible man-monster combination smashes through the building's doors, and Morgan is suddenly fighting for her life against a new reality that's determined to kill her.This is the first installment in a series of novellas, each complete in themselves but best read as a group. Normally I wouldn't start such a series (serious cheapskate here) but there's a reason I'm already hooked on this one. See, I'm becoming addicted to writers who've mastered the art of deep point of view (PoV) and I'm finding I miss it now when reading a book that's lacking this one feature. And yes, that lack does lessen my interest, even if the book in question is otherwise excellent (and cheap or free).Long story short, the reader will not have that problem with author C.I. Black. This is her second book, and in both her plotlines engage, there's always something going on (no sagging middles), the dialogue is crisp, and her characters and PoV are very deep. Her first bookImmortal Coil (A Dragon Spirit Novel, Book 1)had multiple PoVs, giving the reader access to the thoughts and feelings of several characters; this novella has one, but it's so deep, readers experience the action as it happens. As that character is a strong but vulnerable woman whose reality just got turned upside down, the book fascinated me from the first paragraph.Best yet is the way Black makes paranormal seem real and possible, not an easy combination. Especially difficult is the ordinary heroine suddenly dropped into it; the reactions of a real person to an impossible event can be frustratingly difficult to capture. Black has done it twice now, and I can't wait to see what she writes next. Five strong stars.

$REVIEW.: New Beginnings can be read before or after the first novel in the series, In Too Deep

 I personally think if I could do it over I would read it first, but that's just me


 There honestly is no reason to.New Beginnings takes you through the story of Jess and Slater


 Each character has a past they are running from
 Both Jess and Slater must tackle their demons in order to move forward.The  author does a phenomenal job of giving you the back story needed to understand the characters
 Through Jess's visions (She is a were-psychic.), you learn about the stress and heartache many of her new pack members have endured
 The reactions and interactions between the characters are very plausible.Jess is one powerful, outspoken lady

 She gives you courage to take a chance and speak your mind
 Slater is the gorgeous pack leader that will make you go weak in the knees and have you still crawling back for more.If you like shifter books, The Others of Edemton will make an excellent edition to your collection.

$review_text.: What I loved (loved loved loved):A new, imaginative world. Seriously, this had everything that makes my fantasy-loving heart sing - knights, kings & queens, curse-laced beards (yes, beards, people!), storytellers whose very breath gives the appearance of life to the story, ancient prophecies and more. Granted, not all of these are "new," in the world of fantasy, but they are infused with such imagination and creativity that it feels fresh and lovely.And yay for a young adult novel that doesn't use the whole love triangle aspect (so overused), but features an honest-to-goodness sweet, brave, flawed male lead. And no insta-love!!!! The relationship developed naturally and realistically over the course of the book.I fully enjoyed E'veria, the world that Chase created. Never was I overwhelmed with imperative information, but rather the world was presented throughout the story in ways that felt genuine. No information dump truck here!And, oh my word, can I just mention the bronze-skinned, bright-eyed pirate-I cannot wait to read more about him in future books!The Ryn made me sigh with contentment and "flip" the pages of my Kindle non-stop. I hated to put it down. Fantastic world-building, a heroine worthy of her story and ultimately a beautiful story about love. The story is an allegory, and it works so well. Serena did a wonderful job of creating action and introspection where they flow into the natural course of the story perfectly.I am wholeheartedly a fan of Serena Chase & of this series. I already have The Remedy on my Kindle and you can be sure that it is on my list to read soon. And I hope this review is not one long ramble. My apologies if so :)

$review_text.: If you're a fan of ghost hunting, you will really enjoy this story. Although it is a short story, the characters have a great connection, and the story line keeps you reading to find out what will happen next. I'm looking forward to reading more stories by Ms. Bishop.Arabella Pierce is a medium and paranormal investigator who has had her share of criticism for what she does. When she finds out that her boss has agreed to let a reporter join her and her crew on their next investigation at Kingston Cottage she is not very happy. The cottage is on an isolated island and reported to have more than one ghost, and if the reporter is as skeptical as the rest of them are, he could create a lot of problems for their investigation.Lucas Brown only reports the truth about ghost hunters to his readers, so he will get every bit of proof he needs on this investigation. He's not as skeptical as Arabella thinks. But he will not lie for them either, no matter how hot he thinks Arabella is.When the ghosts makes their appearance Arabella and Lucas must work together to find what has been keeping the ghosts here and help them move on before a storm leaves the entire crew stranded on the island. As they learn things about one another Arabella starts to think that she may be able to trust Lucas. Will she let go of the past hurt enough to see what can happen with Lucas, or continue to protect her heart?I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I truly enjoyed this story.  It was so refreshing to read a romance without a lot of drama, which seems like a oxymoron considering Tonju has three men vying for her affections.  The thing is Tonju is level headed and not fickle.  It doesn't take her long to decide, which man is right for her.  She doesn't play any games or pull any punches.Marcus the married man is her ex-high school sweetheart.  The attraction from the past is still there and they are forced deal with them, however can he really be the man she wants? He's willing leave his wife for her.  Hmmmm is there really a future in breaking up someone's marriage?Reggie is the ex-husband who broke her heart.  He wants her back and is determined to show her he has changed.  Has he really change and should she give him a second chance?  He really realizes his mistakes and loves her more than ever. Can a philandering workaholic really change and put Tonju first?Tony a successful attorney with his own law firm.  He's very rich, handsome, a gentleman and the chemistry is there, however his views are a little out dated.  He seems to want a trophy wife without ambition or an opinion.  Can Tonju be a trophy wife or is he willing to change his view?In the meantime, everything is falling into place for Tonju's friends, her co-workers and she just acquired her Law degree. This was a real page turner for me and all I will say is Tonju is very decisive.  There were editing issues, that have become pretty prevalent in ebooks, however I do not feel the distract from the story.  If you want to know the answer to the above questions, read the book.  It won't take long to realize who is the best man for Tonju.  It was definitely refreshing to read a book, in which the Heroine is truly confident and sure of herself.  I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I like this book. It is 124 pages of a good overview concerning the outrageous, anti-Bible allegations made in THE DA VINCI CODE bestselling book by Dan Brown.In THE DA VINCI CODE, the author criticizes Christian beliefs by criticizing the Catholic church (while pretty much ignoring the Protestant movement of the last 500 years). THE DA VINCI CODE seems to define Christianity as being solely a Catholic endeavor, which this author, Amy Welborn points out. It is interesting to hear a Catholic speaking out, since Catholics specifically are focused on in THE DA VINCI CODE book.Welborn explains that the Gnostic gospels which THE DA VINCI CODE elevates to being more reliable than the Bible, are actually a minor offshoot from the Gnostics. Gnosticism was a weird, un-organized movement, similar to the self-help craze of the last decades in our current times--lots of folks are doing it, but nobody is officially in charge. The Gnostic gospels were frauds, written at least 200 years after the Bible apostles lived and wrote their true Gospels. The Gnostic writings have the strange Gnostic beliefs, told in THE DA VINCI CODE, but they also have plenty of bizarre, other writings which would turn off any reasonable reader seeing the whole writings, not just the tiny amount used in THE DA VINCI CODE book. Following Gnosticism, then or now, is very much like claiming to be a Christian though following someone's latest New Age religious concoction instead of relying on the Bible and the true teachings of Jesus found in the Bible.Amy Welborn also covers how the Bible books were assembled and chosen, correcting Dan Brown's fallacies. She covers details about Constantine and the Council of Nicea, debunking the hokum in THE DA VINCI CODE book.There is a chapter on Mary Magdalene, pointing out that the Catholic church has elevated her as a Saint, not trying to erase her story, just telling her true story which is NOT found in THE DA VINCI CODE book.Welborn also discusses pagan worship and religious movements pertaining to THE DA VINCI CODE teachings. She also does a chapter on Leonardo da Vinci, pointing out that da Vinci himself did NOT NAME the famous Mona Lisa painting, but a later biographer did. So the whole business in THE DA VINCI CODE about Leonardo doing a secret anagram for Amon and Isus are just plain lame fabrications.Aside from hitting all of the MAJOR points in THE DA VINCI CODE book, Welborn also points out lesser known items of interest. As a writer of other Catholic books, she briefly points out how THE DA VINCI CODE book was heavily supported by an enthusastic promotional campaign, even before the book was released; there is no field of Religious Symbology, in real life; and more.The only downside to this book is that sometimes Amy Welborn seems to get so offended by Dan Brown's bogus history and anti-Bible bile that she gets a bit sarcastic at the outrageous illogic of THE DA VINCI CODE allegations. It would have been better to remain more unemotional, but then, what Christian can be unemotional when our Saviour Jesus Christ is being demoted from being part of the Holy Trinity to just being another really great guy to learn from, once again in our popular culture.I found out about this book when seeing the author in the DVD debunking documentary called BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which is the single best book or DVD on the topic that I have come across yet--get that DVD! Amy Welborn's book is better and more in-depth than THE DA VINCI CODE: FACT OR FICTION by Hank Hanegraaff and Paul L. Maier, (who both appear on the BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE DVD, as well as Amy Welborn).If you are open-minded about learning how to defend the Bible against THE DA VINCI CODE lies, then you will find this book enlightening. If you are dead set on believing the "gospel" according to Dan Brown, I will pray for you, but you probably will reject what Amy Welborn writes as easily as you reject what the REAL Bible writings say.

Give the brainstorming methods of this magnificent gem a chance and I can assure you this will be a part of your life.I've been able to find a spattering of brainstorming methods on the internet. Heck, I even made a couple of my own. However, I was never really satisfied in that no single reference point occupied a dedicated space in my library. Nothing seemed worth it.Let's just say that this is no longer the case. Thinkertoys is a tool that any person, creative or 'not', can use and *will* produce usable results. An honest attempt at the exercises is necessary - you can't go becoming a body-builder just by picking up a weight one time now can you? This book will take some time to go through if you take your time but it's worth the effort.Add this to your library, tab/flag the Thinkertoy 'blueprints', and proceed to have a great innovation tool by your side at all times.This book makes my unconscious mind shout for joy. For that, Mr. Michalko, I thank you many times over.==============================Recommend to anyone who is (or is not) creative, anyone looking for a metric "butt-ton" of idea generators, and anyone who would like to understand the mind a bit more.==============================This is one of the rare books I actually paid full (discounted) price on Amazon... and it's worth every penny.

$REVIEW.: Once I finished up The Greyfriar, I dove right into The Rift Walker


As mentioned in the debut's review, an extremely fun novel, but noted some grievances I had with it
So started reading the sequel with some trepidation and leveled my expectations; I shouldn't have
The Rift Walker took all my concerns and rendered them moot

If Clay & Susan Griffith's debut was a good one, then The Rift Walker is an excellent sequel in the Vampire Empire series.War has been averted for the time being, though concerns still remain and the possibility of retaliation is being planned

The citizenry have romanticized through numerous plays and stories the possibility of a relationship of Greyfriar with their Princess Adele

In the meantime she's set to be wed to Senator Clark and finally forge the alliance between their respective empires, and the date is fast approaching; Adele has been trying to avoid it


The vampires are on the move, and they're planning something big, maybe even catastrophic with the cunning Cesare leading the way.I described The Greyfriar as a very fun, but unbalanced novel

It was action packed, but a bit uneven on the plot progression and some of the character interaction


I'm glad to say, that as far as I'm concerned, these issues were fixed in The Rift Walker


While still having plenty of action, it was more sparse allowing many of the underlying elements to come to the forefront to be developed
This is particularly true with how the political intrigue gets into the meat of the story and makes it that much more interesting

I've always felt that a good political intrigue, no matter how small a part it has, really has the potential to enhance a story exponentially


The misuse of it in the debut novel hurt it in my opinion, but it made The Rift Walker that much richer for me

It added another layer to the plot and actually gave it the support it needed, making it stronger.Going back to the character interaction aspect, once again much improved, particularly with the interaction between Princess Adele and Greyfriar


The dialogue was more natural and abundant, and despite my usual reservations about romantic elements, some of it was introduced to the story which I thought was for the better

They got a good dynamic going, with its usual up and downs, but I think there are some interesting things going on between those two
I just hope that the balance that exists at the moment remains.Outside of the two main characters great strides were also made, I thought just about every character that has been introduced in the story to this point became plenty better, a marked step in the right direction
Even Senator Clark, who I figured to be annoying in the first book


Still annoying as heck, but Clay & Susan made it work, even making fun of the character's buffoonery which is a sign that the authors know what they actually have with him

There was also Cesare, a prince among vampires and the main antagonist, who I thought was misused in the first book as his tactics were inconsistent and underwhelming, really shines in this one
Lastly, recognition has to be given to two of my favorite side characters, Mamoru and Colonel Anhalt particularly since they were given plenty of exposure, as opposed to being relegated to obscurity.The only real complaint that I recall having through the book is that pace could have been better

This time the story takes a while to develop, and there were some slow, maybe even dull moments, during the middle portions


While I'm usually a patient man, I think the story progression could have used some speeding up, while still remaining detailed


The good thing is that through all of this we get plenty of interesting developments, plot twists and we get plenty of world building; learned about the history of the world and the place of magic in it.Speaking of world building, once again I have to compliment of the steampunk devices that have been introduced
They fit just right with all other aspects of what has been created, making the action plenty interesting and well balanced with magic and other supernatural aspects
That said, I hope we get even more of the steampunk variety going forward, there's plenty of room for it

And of course, the magic gets a bigger focus this time around, so looking to see what more they can do with it

Lastly, the world is expanding

We're entering new territories, delving deeper into Africa and we also got a few glimpses of life in North America
Asia has been mentioned, so I wonder if we'll get there at some point too.These books have been quite action packed, and though in The Rift Walker it was a bit less so, when the action comes it comes hard and quite violent
It can get a bit graphic at times, but not overdone
Let's call it tasteful violence

But let's just say, that the story doesn't shy away from creating a bloodbath when it calls for it
And when coupled with the improved plot progression and the numerous plot twists the novel introduced, it simply makes for very good entertaining read.My main complaints to this point have been about characterization, about plot progression, about balance, about consistency, about character interaction

I think I've said enough to illustrate how The Rift Walker has improved upon these issues
And let's not forget that I also had mentioned about the inconsistency of how warm weather affects vampires, and that's also addressed in this one, and put to good use


The characters have been given more depth, more moral ambiguities, and simply became less predictable throughout


Betrayals and trust issues abound, never quite knowing who we can rely on, adding to the suspense of an already improving plot.This is one of those books that I feel make a good crossover between the YA market and the adult market, in a similar vein to that of Blake Charlton's Spellwright books have been doing, but only in that context
The story is not complex, it reads simple, but not simplistic


But it's building towards something more which has me plenty interested.I simply loved reading The Rift Walker, thought it to be an outstanding follow-up to Clay & Susan Griffith's debut


I'm still of mind that the more discerning adult readers might not find much to their liking here, particularly those who look for more challenging reads, but this is a book that I'll recommend with little hesitation, even to those that might have not found the first one to their liking

I'd have seen plenty of the aforementioned readers enjoying the heck of these books, so what do I know? It simply gave me exactly what I was looking to get out of the Vampire Empire series, and very much looking forward to the next installment, The Kingmakers.

$review_text.: Research scientist Dr. Anjali Mehta lost her beloved family in an earthquake. With her new job she also finds her new research subject, reputed mass murderer Jake Finn. Somehow she doesn't think it is strange she is accepted for this job with so little work experience. But Jake Finn make it up. He was maddeningly uncooperative before she arrived but getting better to handle when she started working there, he is very sexy and dominating. Anjali is  tempted to run away but how can she leave Jake behind. De man that is intriguing and can't wait to touch!After working there for a few days, Anjali finds out there is more to Jake than meets the sexy eye. By accident she finds out he is not human but a shape shifter who can change into a lion or a dragon or combine the strength of both. And with the animal feelings he has for Anjali only makes it harder to handle.Karin Shah has written an thrilling story with the caged Jake. And the addicting tension between Anjali and Jake. In like a Lion contains all the right elements you are looking for in a shifter romance. But the good plot is a nice bonus.I specially like the character Anjali,of course while reading the story you know from the start that Anjali's employers are behind the whole thing. But that doesn't make is less fun to read about. Karin Shah has done a great story that is hard to stop. So be aware that when start reading this book your are compelled to read it to the end.I recommend this book to all shifter and paranormal romance lovers. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did.

Saul also had dignity and strength of character and it was easy to root for them both to get together.  There was not a lot of angst in the book, which I actually prefer.However, I was hung up on the main premise.  It's hard for me to believe that someone would give up his house so that his son would get married and stay in town.  Also, I think the publisher could have created a more attractive book cover.  I know you're not supposed to judge a  book by it's cover, but it does help grab the reader, doesn't it? This cover was so blah.

$review_text.: This book is a little different than what I am used to reading and it was just okay for me. I didn't know anything about it before I started reading, so I was unsure as to what to expect regarding the main character and premise. Kali is a strong, young female character that is used to being the "monsters in closet's" worst nightmare and specializes in all of the things that "go bump in the night". The plot of the story was fast-paced and interesting, with lots of twists and turns, but I just couldn't get into it as much as I had hoped. I really do think that a lot of other people will be interested in the premise of the book, but it was just hard for me to grasp the entire concept of a chupacabra, especially after I have heard such different things about that legend before. The main character was a little hard to get attached to, but her friends were actually enjoyable to read about.I'd recommend this book if you're looking for a little change-up in your reading list.

$review_text.: The one thing that I missed was the map that is usually included in Warhammer novels. I had to keep one of my other books nearby, so I could have an idea of where these stories take place.I was surprised by the different POVs in the stories, but I think it was the right touch for this anthology.Slayer's Honour by Nathan Long was a strong start to the collection, including another slayer and his "rememberer." I loved the contrast between the two pairs. It highlighted the depth of the bond between Felix and Gotrek after all of the adventures that they've shared.A Cask of Wynters by Josh Reynolds was a great story about Snorri Nosebiter, another slayer that has appeared in other Gotrek & Felix novels, but I didn't think the story fit well within this collection. However, I would love to see Snorri get his own series. *hint hint*A Place of Quiet Assembly by John Brunnner featured the POV of Henkin Warsch, who is on a journey of personal discovery in regards to his past, and he crosses paths with Gotrek & Felix...fortunately for him. I loved the twist.Kineater by Jordan Ellinger is a story about an ogre mercenary facing off with Gotrek, and it was one of my favorites in this anthology.Prophecy by Ben McCallum was told from the POV of two twins with supernatural abilities. Definitely the most unique story in the collection, with an HP Lovecraft style to it.The Tilean's Talisman by David Guymer was an awesome story featuring a Skaven POV. I loved it! I can't get enough of those Skaven tales...no pun intended.Last Orders by Andy Smillie was a confusing tale about a bar fight...it wasn't bad, but I wasn't sure what the author was going for with that one.MindStealer by CL Werner is a story told from Grey Seer Thanquol's POV. \m/ Horned Rat rules! \m/ I was soooo hoping Thanquol would make an appearnace in this anthology, and I wasn't disappointed. Definitely my number one favorite!The Two Crowns of Ras Karim by Nathan Long is not only an action-packed foreign adventure featuring our two heroes, but it's a great example of Long's talent for writing an engaging fantasy story.The Funeral of  Gotrek Gurnisson by Richard Salter was told from Felix's POV, and includes an appearance by Ulrika, as well as some Skaven - perfect way to end the anthology!I think if you are expecting something likeDeath and Dishonour, you might be a little disappointed with this anthology, but if you are simply looking for some great fantasy stories to add to your Warhammer collection, this is the collection for you.

More importantly, he had the love of his life Sidney McCall, and they were about to celebrate their first anniversary.  Drew thought the perfect gift would be to indulge one of her deepest fantasies of a m&eacute;nage with his best friend Brody Nash.  He wanted nothing more than to give Sid everything she ever wanted, and keep her happy.  While he loves her with his entire being, she has never reciprocated his declarations of love, and that left him dreading for the other shoe to drop.  He was afraid that maybe she didn't have as deep of feelings as he did.Brody Nash was the true definition of a free spirit.  He was an immensely talented desert chef, but couldn't keep his feet planted in one spot for any length of time instead choosing to sail off at any given moment.  He loved women, but never kept any of them living up to his bad boy reputation.  He had no real relationships except the one with his best friend Drew.  They had a special bond usually reserved for close brothers, and that was exactly how he thought of Drew.  When he asked Brody to be the third for a special anniversary celebration with Sid, he couldn't believe his ears.  Surely, his best friend was not suggesting that they share the women that had possession of his soul?  When Brody finally agreed, no one was prepared for the ramifications to them all caused by their combined actions.This was a moderately entertaining read, but not a keeper.  The characters are not fresh, and the story falls flat.  Drew had no business initiating a m&eacute;nage into a relationship he was so unsure of.  It screamed of desperation on his part, and he deserved everything that happened to him.

But Julia finds his offer of a helping hand and a hot body too delicious to refuse and dives into a reckless, one-time fling. What she doesn&#8217;t realise is that tomorrow has a way of sneaking up, and that saying goodbye to her home town &#8211; and to Ryan &#8211; is much harder the second time around.My Thoughts:  NOBODY BUT HIM is a debut novel and the first of the &#8216;Boys of Summer&#8217; trilogy; it is quite a feather in a debut authors cap to be signed up for 3 books before the first one even hits the shelves!  It took me a chapter or two to settle into the story &#8211; but when I did I loved it.  Set in a fictional town on the beautiful Fleurieu Peninsular in South Australia I am familiar with area having holidayed there myself, although I was there for the wine rather than the surf!In winter the small coastal towns are left to their own devices and the local businesses struggle to make ends meet until the summer comes around and there is an invasion of city dwellers getting away from it all.  NOBODY BUT HIM brings to life this almost symbiotic relationship between the long term residents and the city folk. On the one hand the residents resent the influx of tourists, who take over the town for a few months each summer and then leave as suddenly as they arrive; on the other hand they need the money to survive.  Julia left town because she felt that the summer visitors were looking down on her and the other permanent residents making her feel less than important, Julia wanted to be important too so left to go to university in Melbourne where she made a very good life for herself.  Back in her home town she has every intention of just packing up and leaving forever, however she gradually comes to face the fact that she has turned into the very type of person she always despised, and that maybe not all the summer visitors are bad, and that maybe there can me a melding of the two factions.  Maybe, just maybe she has been wrong about everything &#8211; including Ryan. Maybe now is the time to think seriously about what she really wants out of life.I loved how Julia grew as a character, how she was willing to compromise and see another point of view.  The same with Ryan, the story of how he went from being a summer surfie boy to a well-respected business man make interesting reading.  When it came to each other though, both Julia and Ryan were stubborn and willing to believe the worst about each other.  Gradually as the story unfolds along with some heart in mouth moments the two gradually realise that they are meant for each other. It took some doing but they were surrounded by some very good friends such as Dan and Lizzie &#8211; who I am hoping are going to appear in one of the next two book which I will be keeping an eye out for.

$review_text.: I've literally counted the moments until this third installment of THE BLUEBELLS CHRONICLES would arrive.  Drumming my fingers and tapping my toe....waiting.  Once it arrived [I felt like] I latched onto it like a starving dog to its bone, and simply couldn't read it fast enough.  To say it's exciting or thrilling is a major belittlement.  It is well beyond that.The story continues directly where the second installment, The Minstrel Boy (The Blue Bells Chronicles)The Minstrel Boy: Book Two: The Blue Bells Chronicles (Volume 2)has left us.  Like the first two installments, this third installment was such an original, adventurous delight.To recap in a nutshell; self centered, arrogant Shawn Kleiner travels back approximately 700 years in time to the year 1314.. (from book #1Blue Bells of Scotland: Book One of the Blue Bells Trilogy).  He struggles to accept, adapt and deal with the horrifying nightmare which ensues, while trying to get back to his own time. Shawn struggles to survive - - to come to terms with this bizarre nightmare of being thrust back in time.  He adapts...makes friends while learning many life changing lessons.  Shawn isn't one to exactly pay attention to anyone or anything.  He can be very superior, pompous and overbearing.  Yet through it all..through this fantastic nightmare that he's found himself living in... he can laugh at himself and his predicament too.  It's his way of coping.Niall Campbell...loyal and courageous...sometimes headstrong and overly confident. A gentle man and a Highland Warrior.. and he could be Shawn's twin.  They're identical in appearance.  Niall is next in line to be Laird of Glenmirril.  And he's living in the year 1314.  He knows what has happened to Shawn (after-all, it happened to him!)...and as time passes, he begins to look upon Shawn as a brother.Shawn's ex-girlfriend, Amy Nelson is living in the 21st century.  She knows what has happened to Shawn and eventually comes to terms with this fantastic knowledge...all the while fighting to get him home.  She's come to terms with Shawn's lying, cheating ways and the scoundrel that he was.  Even so, she blames herself for his dilemma and works feverishly to get him home....somehow.Angus MacLean is a Scottish Inspector (Inverness), who, against his better judgement, has fallen in love with Amy.  I utterly adore his wholesome, strong character.I absolutely loved this entire story. There are so many profound lessons in this magnificent adventure of Shawn Kleiner, Niall Campbell and Amy Nelson. Learning to forgive yourself (or circumstances).  Accepting culpability....your faults and trying to better yourself.  Accepting who you are. Learning to trust and be trusting. Facing truths about yourself staring you in the face & forgiving. Trusting and believing in God's miracles and learning to have faith in God.  Releasing bitterness. On and on the lessons go.This story is such a commanding time travel performance. The Author gracefully eases the reader from one era to the next with fluid talented ability. Absolutely superb storytelling at its finest.  The power and excitement of the final battle (in this third installment) had me sitting up straight on the edge of my seat, reading faster and faster...propelling me into the battles (both 14th & 21st centuries).  An absolute stunning & dramatically delicious tango.  And when I approached the closing pages, a feeling of profound regret came over me...as I realize I am about to temporarily sever a relationship with characters I have grown to love.  As the pages dwindle, I feel as if something precious is being taken from me, that cannot be replaced.I anxiously await book #4 "Westering Home" with bated breath.

$REVIEW.: I have not finished this book and do not know how it ends, however, so far (about half way thru), it is a wonderful book.  It shows the hard times people go  thru and how people of strong character struggle, but make it regardless of adversity.  It also reveals how someone can be very turned off by the hypocrisy of church members, but can still come to Christ in spite of it.  It shows so very realistically how little the modern church is actually following Christ.  This is an old book which is out of print and out of copyright.  It is not only available on Amazon, but it is also available for free from [...]. Whether you are a Christian that enjoys reading about the struggles of others coming to a full knowledge and relationship with Christ, or a non-Christian that wants to know what a true Christian is like, you'll like this book.UPDATE: 04/15/2013Finished the book and it was as good as I thought.  Most things come together nicely, but it did seem a bit rushed in the last couple of chapters, but that is to be expected. There was at least one surprise that I didn't see coming.  A most enjoyable book.  I have recommended it all my friends.

BUT, I'm continually bummed how the books are getting shorter and shorter

I also feel really cheated
I feel Mr
RAIN IS TAKING advantage of all our love of his work and the endings of the last three books just totally teed me off! I FEEL I was forced to buy the next book up the line just to get some kind of satisfaction and closure from the one I'd just spent my precious free time reading.I understand it's his job to write to make a living but I still feel really incensed and left hanging in the wind


No closure just another tease

Got to buy the next book if you want to know what happens next! Anyway....I agree with everyone else, PLEASE give us a decently sized book next time


Let us feel appreciated enough to at least get our moneys worth and to not be left swinging in the wind

$review_text.: I was totally interested in reading this book not only because I followed the story on our local news but also because Mt. Hood is our Oregons mountain, 1 hour away from where I live. It holds a special place in my heart as my grandfather helped build Timberline Lodge when he was in the WPA decades ago. Through the years many a climber has lost his life to this mountain. The uncertainly of it still has a strange lure to climbers and beckons them to climb it even when our Pacific Northwest weather here is anything but predictable and can turn in a heartbeat! Squalls come in and our weather takes drastic turns in the flash of a second, hence why the very dangers lurk there. The best of the best climbers have lost their lives on this mountain.Reading the book gave a more up close intimate look into the lives of the climbers. The author is the main climbers wife. To read her story is heart wrenching and sad to say the least but also a very good read. I liked the book so well I insisted my husband read it on his Kindle. He is not a book reader but he too has enjoyed it as did my son inlaw. If you love mountains and their beauty, lore and  unpredictability, or your a avid climber and are interested in the facts, please read this book as it all may change your mind in a heartbeat about climbing this one. Its a story that will touch your heart and stay with you for a very long time.

$review_text.: Dreams flow into Istanbul from all corners of the Ottoman Empire to be sorted, interpreted, stored, or acted upon by an enormous bureaucracy of faceless figures
 Wheels operate within wheels:  nobody really knows what is going on except a few puppet-masters at the top


 The innocent scion of a high, powerful family begins work in the Tabir Sarrail, that cavernous palace of endless blank corridors which, like Dr
Who&#65533;s Tardis, is much bigger inside than out


 Sinister goings on, always just out of sight, almost out of earshot

 Mark-Alem learns as he goes

 His meteoric rise may have ominous significance

 Maybe not
 He has to make sense out of the senseless
 He has to give meaning to the meaningless
 Interpretation is everything, but a wrong twist could lead to fatal disaster


 Are his fellow workers in on some dark secrets that he has failed to decipher ?  Or are they just as they seem, friendly and struggling ?  The world of power dazzles and depresses simultaneously.When is Ismail Kadare going to get the Nobel Prize ?  I have asked this before


 THE PALACE OF DREAMS is yet another masterpiece by this Albanian author
 It has links to &#65533;The Three-Arched Bridge&#65533;, another of his great novels


 While the tenor of THE PALACE OF DREAMS is entirely different from the latter work, they do the share the enviable quality of operating on several levels, which to my mind, always indicates the highest craftsmanship
 The present volume resembles Kafka more than a little, perhaps also is reminiscent of Sartre&#65533;s play &#65533;No Exit&#65533;

 At one level it is such a nightmarish fantasy, a bad dream played out in a couple hundred pages

 At a second level, Kadare succeeded in writing a magnificent replica of the workings of secret security agencies within the administration of Communist era nations like Albania

 Part terror, part nightmare, he sets his story in the 19th century Ottoman empire to avoid personal repercussions (the book was banned in Albania anyway)
 &#65533;Anyone who ruled over the dark zones of men&#65533;s lives wielded enormous power.&#65533;  Dream Palace or Sigurimi, the Albanian security agency ?  It does not matter


 By linking the protagonist to the Quprili family, a genuine Albanian-born dynasty of Ottoman officials and administrators, and to the recital of Albanian folk epics, Kadare ties the dream palace to actual history in a very clever way


 The voice of the people must eventually be heard--it is only a question of when
 This is a most clever book and Kadare fans should not miss it
 If you haven&#65533;t started reading him yet, you could well begin here.

Delving into deeper secrets and longings of the past, the stories explore experiences of heart break and heart ache. With each, I was pulled in from the start, seeking along with the protagonists for understanding, forgiveness and love. I resonated with the characters, the imagery was vivid and compelling, and the format works -- each story offers a moment both gripping and satisfying, and leaves me wanting more.

$REVIEW.: I have read the first two in this series - and if their construction/quality is any indication: the boxed set is a must-read for children and parents.Their story is cleverly constructed, with just enough description so children can visualize the setting, and not so scary as to cause bad dreams. Because, Jocker and Bivy, despite the fact that they are causing their parents grey feathers are clever little hatchlingsWhile there are some scary moments, there is nothing that isn't quickly and happily resolved for the main characters, so sleepless nights aren't an issue. Additionally - both of the books in the series that I have read are simple to read - perfect for new `chapter readers'. It was a clever little story, showing the importance of making friends, being brave and standing with your friends and family.I purchased the first two books in this series with specific intention of using during the Children Read week at I am Indeed. The author requested I place this review in the boxed set, to give potential readers an idea of quality and construct.  I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$REVIEW.: Love Finds a home on Christmas morning in two holiday stories set in Cary, North Carolina.Deck the Halls by Debby Mayne:  Lillian Pickard's family is struggling since her dad's injury. He hasn't been able to work and so Lillian is forced to go work at the local Five and Dime to put food on the table. The money doesn't always stretch far enough so they live on a lot of potatoes and onions. But when wealthy William Tronnier starts paying attention to Lillian her family is wary and warn her away. Is William after only "one thing"? Or is it possible that he's planning a proposal that she can't refuse?`Tis the Season by Trish Perry: Nikki Tronnier is the granddaughter of William Tronnier, and moved back to Cary and works as a chef for a billionaire in the hopes of saving enough money to buy the family home. But as soon as she earns enough money to make a downpayment, someone else buys it from under her. Drew Cornell loves old houses, and he felt something special about the old Tronnier home. He plans on remodeling it to its historic beauty. Will that beauty also include a new bride?LOVE FINDS YOU ON CHRISTMAS DAY is a charming addition to the Love Finds You line - I've read all the books I could get my hands on so far in this collection and am keeping tabs on what is coming out so I don't miss a story (I hope). I love Christmas stories and Trish Perry's books so I was especially looking forward to this novella collection.Deck the Halls is a historical, and William is a dream come true. I found Lillian quite bitter and she treated William very ugly. I honestly didn't understand what kept him coming around. But the story was very well written and I did keep reading, mainly because I loved William and his family. It did end well.  `Tis the Season is in true Trish Perry style. A contemporary, it is fun and sassy and involved food. I thoroughly enjoyed this last story and rooted for both Nikki and Drew. There is a cookie recipe included in between the two stories. This is a fun holiday read.

Miscellaneous factoids are listed in the "This Year at a Glance" section.  Weather forecasts for all sections of the U.S. for November 2010 through October 2011 are issued, and there are also gardening tips and recipes.

$review_text.: With a little more polishing, this could be a great book or series.  The idea behind the story is interesting and the action throughout the story is good.  The characters need a bit more.  They were likeable, but have the potential to be loveable.  There also seems to be some inconsistencies within the characters.  The hero Rebecca is logical, smart, and quick at some times and then a complete idiot at others.  For example, when she is not allowed to see Ashley for what seems like months on end and does not throw a fit for quite some time, even though she is quite attached and protective of the little girl.  Other than those little things is was a good novella with the potential to be a great book.I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.

$review_text.: "Fourteen and three people who could save the world" parts of the riddle that few people throughout different points of the future have seen and yet do not understand is it truth or a myth as the chosen ones must find out. Somehow the human race has died out replaced by aliens but why the question remains unanswered. It seems solving the riddle, besides those chosen, has fallen directly upon teenagers Kenneth Yardrow and Savannah Proehl who were kidnapped from school and taken into the future to solve the mystery. Maybe pictures upon a wall that an alien character Nolan has discovered might be an indication or a wakeup call to those of us in the here and now, "If the various pictures on the wall were any judge, the human race had been a self-centered species."Winters has written an exceptional science-fiction tale that seems to have it all from kidnapping, time-travel, futuristic events, mystery, riddles and maybe even romance. A unique novel that reads more like a history book than a sci-fi tale that draws the reader in from page one wanting to know the answer to the "riddle".  For anyone who may remember the writing seems reminiscent of an outstanding novel from the 1970's "Yargo" by Jacqueline Susann making for an exceptional read. With amazing word descriptions and excellent characters the author leaves nothing to the imagination as all is laid out in book 1 of the "Children of Two Futures" series leaving the reader desiring more and to continue onto the next book in order to discover what is behind the "riddle" of the human race.

$review_text.: It's a welcome return to the world of John Ray, son of a retired mobster, the white sheep of the family
He has no desire for that life, but keeps getting drawn back in


He'd been standing beside his brother when the shots took his life

He'd help find the real killer when a friend had been accused

Lanny Bride, who now ran his father's old business, the real business, also wanted the killer found.His Father, Tony, the victim of several hear attacks, lives in a retirement home.John gets called out of his bed, delightfully filled with a gorgeous redhead, and asked to find another killer by Bride

The victim is an older man, Roberto Swales, an ex-boxer who'd worked for his father and now presumably for Bride

He was Duct-taped to a chair with bullets in each leg and one arm

What had killed him, though, was the beating his head had taken from a champagne bottle, enough blows to shatter the skull


John remembers Swales from when he was a boy.He begins his investigation and soon gets a connection to a twenty year old bombing, when the young John was on the other side of the world, New Zealand, pursuing a young woman

A bombing that haunted to this day for the scene of a young father bringing his two week old son out of the building, dead in his arms.We have an ex-Irish terrorist killed first, then Swales
What did they have in common? Both had been interviewed by the redheaded bed mate of John's mentioned earlier

She was a writer doing a book on John's father Tony.John soon has the cops interested in him once again
They'd never believed he was straight, even when Baron, the lead cop on John's early investigation, got all the credit for what John had uncovered.Quite liked this one


Again told in present tense, I found myself engrossed again in the story
Ready for more John Ray.Strongly recommended, both this one and the first, HOPE ROAD.

$REVIEW.: Young children learn by doing, and the David Sticker Book is a great way for them to do just that.  This book tells the story of David in a child-friendly manner, with unique illustrations that fill up the pages.  The text is limited to three to four lines per page, which helps keep kids' attention on the story:&#34;In a stream, David found five smooth pebbles.He picked them out to use in his sling.Then he went to face the enormous giant.'I want to fight a soldier,' yelled Goliath.  'But they've sent a child!'&#34;The pictures are done in cartoon style, but the characters are not depicted in an &#34;over-the-top&#34; way, which I appreciated.  The story is simply told, but it is well-written.The book includes four sticker pages for kids to use to complete the pictures throughout the story.  As you can see in the pictured book cover, some areas are left blank, and kids must match up the correct stickers to complete the scenes.  This will also keep kids interested in the story as they hunt for the outlines and try to match up the stickers.  By doing a hands-on activity with the book, kids will also remember more details from the story and will enjoy it more.  Activities like this increase reading comprehension by focusing kids' attention on details from the story.  Parents can ask questions like, &#34;What is David carrying on the tray?&#34; or &#34;Who is the tall man yelling at David?&#34;  By having kids narrate back parts of the story as they attach the stickers to the pages, it will &#34;stick&#34; in their minds and hearts.The David Sticker Book ends with the verse reference so kids can look up the story in their own Bibles.  This book is best suited for primary ages.{The publisher provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.}

$REVIEW.: This story includes a very tough, resourceful, determined, prickly character who becomes an unwilling hero to her unprepared neighborhood.  She's prepared and just wants to be left alone.  That does not happen!  It found their survival journey extremely entertaining.  I did feel the ending arrived rather abruptly and would have enjoyed a resolution with one particularly problematic person.  I would also have loved seeing a more definitive wrap up with the doctor.  There are some very interesting, yet fairly simple, projects included in this story that many will enjoy.

$REVIEW.: How to Unbreak Your Health - Your Map to the World of Complementaryand Alternative Therapies by Alan E. Smith is a compendium of cuttingedge therapies all aimed at giving patients choice in the delivery ofmedical care.The author cites specific body process methodologies that have beensuccessful with patients. The Advanced Jaffe - Mellor Technique (JMT)is one such example. JMT is a bioenergetic therapy which uses muscleresistance tests as a diagnostic tool to identify pathenogenicmicroorgansms at the root of diseases; such as, lupus, fibromyalgiaand MS. The treatment involves a gentle tapping of muscles with anactivator or arthrostim providing mild percussion in rapid succession.The device elicits sensory input allowing the practitioner tomake adjustments physically or through the use of vitamins, herbs orother protocols.Asian bodywork therapy has been in existence for centuries. The therapyaims to apply deep tissue manipulation to improve circulation, as wellas correct imbalances in the flow of energy. A number of treatment modalitiesare in use currently. Examples are Shiatsu, Tuina and Chi Nei Tsang.Smith cites bee venom therapy (BVT) which is a concentrated use of beestings aimed at increasing the bodily reproduction of cortisol, aswell as complex peptides and highly concentrated enzymatic action.Patients are first tested for an allergic response prior to undertakingBVT.The author explains Colonic Hydrotherapy Irrigation which is the gentleremoval of toxins from the intestine utilizing mineral water combinedwith special herbs. The treatment flushes the system of toxins whichaccumulate over time. Patients have been known to lose up to 5-10 poundsin just a few sessions due to the discharge of large amounts of fecalmatter which the body may not be able to eliminate on its own. Patientsshould seek out a licensed practitioner for colonics.MLD or manual lymphatic drainage is a modality consisting of light sweepingmotions to stimulate the lymphatic vessels. These motions promote the flowof lymph into the capillaries near the skin surface. Stronger motions push thelymph to flow more deeply into the tissues. The treatment is aimed at movingfluids to the kidneys and liver for elimination.Perhaps the most interesting modality is the author's description of thehot stone massage. Hot stones provide deep warm stimulation which relaxesthe muscles and calms the nervous system. The hot stones expand the bloodvessels which help to push blood and waste throughout the body.Smith explains that the federal government is studying alternative medicinethrough the prism of the White House Commission on Complementary andAlternative Medicine, as well as other areas of the National Institutes ofHealth. The purpose is to provide patients with cheaper treatment modalities,as well as less invasive ones.How to Unbreak Your Health - Your Map to the World of Complementary and Alternative Therapies by Alan E. Smith is a wonderful resource for patients everywhere. The book is written simply and the author has provided many authoritative sources to support the proper use of these modalities.Article first published as Blogcritics dot org/books/article/book-review-how-to-Unbreak-your/'>Book Review:  How to Unbreak Your Health: Your Map to the World of Complementary and Alternative Therapies  by Alan E.

$review_text.: If you haven't read books 1 and 2 in the Maya Diaries, then put down the book and step away. You will be hopelessly confused. I managed to muddle through, but there was something on nearly every page that had me scratching my head and hoping for some background. While it was nice not to have Carlson fall into the (very annoying) recap-itis that so many series authors have, it would've been pleasant to know, for example, that Maya is half African-American. I went nearly the entire book before this was finally made clear - there were no descriptions of her in the first 3/4 of the book - and even the remainder didn't have a description so much as a statement that the other girl (who you knew was African-American) "looked like her". (Plus, given Maya's ethnicity, you'd think the publisher could've chosen a cover model that would make this more clear.) And this is one of tidbits that falls into "would be nice but doesn't really matter" - there were plenty of other things that I suspect fall into the "really would have added to the readability of the book."What Matters Most follows Maya through the first three months of school in what she decides will be her senior year of high school. There are a lot of plot lines that start up but get dropped - and many of them are on the back of the book (example: the back of the book talks about the cheerleader making her life miserable. And sure, there are two incidents...and then they become, if not friends, certainly not at odds. No real drama even getting from point A to B. So why the melodramatic intro on the back cover?) The decision making process hinted at on the back cover is also resolved very easily - in fact, I'd be hard pressed to point to the part of the book that had some sort of climax leading to resolution. There were several places where there was a hint of tension to come but within two pages that balloon had popped and you were left dragging from page to page hoping that you would, at some point, reach the end. Maybe having read books 1 and 2 would help...but I can't see it fixing everything.As it's a "Diary of a Teenage Girl" the audience is clearly younger than me...but I can't think it'd be a middle or high school audience. Possibly 5th and 6th grade - but certainly no younger (because of themes) or older (because of drek quotient).I wasn't impressed, and as normally I really enjoy Carlson's work, that was disappointing. But I'll be sticking to her adult fiction from here on out.

$REVIEW.: FASCINATED, spurned from its laudable predecessor, CAPTIVATED once again reigns as this year's one of the most erotic offering. FASCINATED is comparably more well-rounded to the first one with all 4 writers churning galvanizing reads.Bertrice Small, for one, with her MASTERING LUCINDA shows the no-holds barred raunch and passion in the dark labyrinths of romance. The Master of the Devil's Disciple was initially hired to tame the arrogant Lucinda, and it was unexpected that Lucinda with her tenacious and enchanting wits manage to turn the tables around, and found herself a well-suited match in her brass. Compared to her previous prose in CAPTIVATED, this scored with more panache and romance element and most importantly discarded the abysmal thought of incest.SUSAN JOHNSON keeps up with her usual stunning repartee and scorching hot heroes and heroines of rakes turned mellow when matched by true passion. Felicity, a desperate widow finds herself hopelessly addicted to the Duke of Grafton, a man who overwhelms her with his protection and tenderness. The fiery scenes in RISKING IT ALL, continues her tradition of raunchy tales and is an enjoyable read.THEA DEVINE's brand of sensual writing is always subjective, and I personally find her italic writing a little too formulaic and the plot rather in shambles. The sex scenes are violent, dark and will mitigate readers with dangerous passion in their mind. It is nevertheless explosive sexuality written in an explicit tone. Jeremy and Regina, the characters in THE PLEASURE GAME are beguiling with their logic and I find it hilarious seeing both of them in this cat-and-mouse game of ensnaring each other.ROBIN SCHONE, remains by far the most accomplished of the lot. Even though there were some critiques of this story about an enunch falling for a widow, this litany of grief and passion enchants not for its powerful eroticity, but rather the fusion of compassion and tenderness for both the flawed Megan and Connery. This in fact is much better than her novel, THE LOVER, whereby the poetic mood swings languourously to sweep readers with its poignancy. The daring paragon of passion is admirably well-done for its heart-rendering emotional drama.FASCINATED treads a thin line between romance and being casted off as salacious porn which may throw off some readers. For the proponents of these 4 writers, it is a delicious treat of wild sex and fantasy and being rewarded to a genre that titillates and satiates the human sense. It is fascinating - even for the boldness and courage of the writers to strut off these stories with such ease and finesse.

$review_text.: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042XA30S/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThe CK-Foundation intends to create GOOD,inexpensive textbooks. In this book it is certainly succeeding. I wish this system had been available when my youngest child asked for home school for grades 8-12. I have a PhD in English and my husband has an MA in history and an MBA. But those don't make us great teachers for math and science, and we were fumbling our way through these courses.The books are carefully planned and include all the written information the students could possibly need. As more and more outlets for experimental material for science students appear, lab work becomes more and more available even to home scholars.Any students who complete their courses without being allowed to fail--that is, if the work is done wrong it has to be done over, something that is far more possible in home schools than in public schools or even private schools--will be well equipped to handle all college entrance exams and probably will be far ahead of their fellow students who came out of public school.I will never forget one of my college freshmen who came to me in tears the day before Thanksgiving break. She told me that the first thing she was going to do when she got home was to go to the school board superintendent and chew him out, because she was in honors English for four years, and never learned the parts of speech or what does and does not constitute a sentence. I wish every student would do that, when he or she feels failed by the present educational system. If the students would complain, the system would have to change.We're already seeing this in our four-year-old granddaughter, who is complaining that Church primary is boring. Right now she is enjoying public preschool, but by kindergarten age she will be so far above her fellow students that she, like her mother before her, will be bored stiff throughout public school. Her cousin, our fifth-grade granddaughter, is already reading on a high school level; what is she going to do in high school?I'm thankful that people are willing to work without charge to create a new school system that every students can use. I have already written to volunteer my services.

$review_text.: Wow. Wow. And more Wow. Although I've been interested in end-of-days, dystopian literature for years, I've only recently become a zombie fan. (Thank you, Walking Dead). My interest was instantly piqued when this book came across our groups' request queue.  With its combination of these two genres it definitely did NOT disappoint. This series is going to be EPIC for zombie fans. It will definitely be my #2 (second only to the previously mentioned, and they've had years to work on their storyline).Jackson is a kick-@$$ chick that has been through a literal hell on earth and has evolved and survived to get where she is now. Luke has had it easy comparatively and must step up his game now that he and Jackson are making their way south.  I liked that he tried to take care of her and had a protective instinct, which is rare trait nowadays. Their chemistry is obvious, and it was a nice change of pace to see a little positive in a world full of negatives at every turn. The twist of the zombies getting smarter was unique and gives more anticipation to reading the story.

$review_text.: I have to say I'm a bit surprised at all of the wonderful reviews for Devilish. I found the narrator, Jane, to be unlikeable and her friend, Ally to be somewhat of a flat character. Lanalee was the most interesting character but readers don't gain much insight into her world. I almost wish Devilish had been told from her perspective. The premise and the fact that I enjoyed Maureen Johnson's other novels attracted me to Devilish, but I was left disappointed. The plot holds a lot of promise but unfortunately, I as a reader, didn't gain any satisfaction from the ending. I thought the concept of Hell and it's workers could have been explained a little better, along with why Jane, a high school student, was being recruited, besides for just her intelligence.Johnson is talented writer. I appreciate her usually likable narrators and humorous situations. I'd recommend The Keys to the Golden Firebird anyday but Devilish? Unfortunately, I'd have to advise other readers to pass.

$REVIEW.: Frankie looks desperately at the clock, why wasn't it break time yet? Her body is screaming for a sugar fix! She is in her own personal Hell, which in this case happens to be the Alaska DMV. Her day is gets a whole lot worse when the next person strides up to counter. It is Charming, the same man who recently tried to kidnap and kill her best friend Piper. There is no way she is going to be polite and help him no matter how gorgeous he is and regardless of what her boss the broom rider says. Luckily, his request is something that she doesn't handle so she happily shoos him into a longer line. Yet, she can't help wondering what he is up to. After all, Charming is a Death Escort who kills for the Grim Reaper. Frankie is determined to figure out what he is up to. Can Frankie avoid Charming's charms and foil the Grim Reaper?What I Liked:*It is no secret that I am a fan of Cambria Hebert as I have read every book of hers. That being said, Charmed is her best outing to date. This book falls into the wildly popular New Adult category, and I am happy to report that it is something original. This is a fun new adult tale with paranormal flair and a sizzling hot romance. What could be better than new adult blended with the supernatural? It is the best of both genres. I would highly recommend checking this out especially if you are bored of the typical New Adult books that are flooding the market.*I love that this is a companion book series. You don't need to read Recalled before picking up Charmed since they aren't sequels. Instead, Charmed brings back two characters who were secondary players in the first book. I am a big fan of the companion books because I love that I can jump in at any time without worrying about being lost. Of course, reading all the books does enhance your experience. For instance, I did not like Charming in Recalled. He plays the role of the villain, but this time around, I got to peel back his layers and learn what made him tick. It just goes to show that you can't and shouldn't judge someone until you really know them. I love that Charming made me change my mind about him, as Frankie did as well.*Speaking of Frankie, if you enjoyed her in the first book, you will love her in Charmed. I love Frankie! Frankie is one of those girls whom you want as a best friend. She is funny, not overly concerned with appearances, sarcastic, messy and she has an enormous sweet tooth. This girl is addicted to sugar and devours it like there will be no more cupcakes tomorrow! I was craving cupcakes after reading this book! I adore Frankie's snarky commentary, especially when it comes to her job. She is one of those characters who will make you laugh. Charming is a solid counterpart to Frankie. He is complex and has a difficult past. I enjoyed learning more about him and especially liked that he was a boxer. It was easy to see why Frankie could overlook his dark side and fall in love with the good man he once was.*The romance is spicy hot! I always enjoy romances that start out with the couple being at odds, even enemies, and that is the case with this romance. Frankie and Charming do not get along, and their first few encounters are full of antagonistic remarks and witty banner. Along the way, an attraction builds and then it explodes with a hot scene. I will tell you that the sex scenes in this one are just right, they don't go on and on for pages and pages with too much detail. They are steamy and passionate and to the point.*I like that this is a paranormal series that is different. It features a big, bad guy known as G.R. or the Grim Reaper who bears a striking resemblance to Monty Burns from The Simpsons. G.R. employs Death Escorts to kill targets at his bidding. He keeps dead bodies hanging in his closets like suits! How creepy is that? Along with the Death Escorts, G.R. also has ghost escorts who assist the Death Escorts and keep an eye on things for G.R. Storm is one of these ghosts and he is a a lot of fun! Definitely get this book if you want a unique and entertaining New Adult book with sizzle and supernatural!And The Not So Much:*At the beginning of the book, Charming is given a Target to kill which seems to be an impossible task. For the first portion of the book, the focus is on Charming killing this rich girl. Then things heat up with the romance, and the original story line falls by the way side. Finally at the end, things get back on track and Charming moves toward completely his task. There is a big scene involving the Target and a twist that was a bit shocking, and then it just ends without much resolution. I wanted to know what happened with the Target after the fact?*I loved the banter between Charming and Frankie at the beginning of the book, it was hilarious and so much fun. I was a bit disappointed that Frankie lost a bit of the snark toward the end. I would love for the tension and sarcasm to have built a little more before the two got all hot and heavy, I love antagonistic romances, and the more antagonism the better.*I am still a bit confused over G.R. I want to know what makes him tick, what drives him to collect souls and bodies? What was up with eating the souls? Who is the mysterious female soul in his closet? I am guessing that more will be revealed next time out, but I am impatient!*I was excited to see Piper return, and I was hoping that she would be in a good place. I was a bit sad to find that she was still hurting and alone. I am hoping that things will work out for her.*This book utilizes dual narratives between Charming and Frankie. I am a huge fan of the switching point of views, but there were a few times where the change wasn't seamless and I thought that details were omitted. One big detail that was left out that bothered me was when Frankie, in an attempt to ruin Charming's chances of getting close to his target, reveals a big untruth about Charming to the Target. She later tells Charming what she told his intended victim. I actually went back and read to make sure I hadn't missed it, but found that this conversation with Frankie and the Target was not present. There is no dialogue between Frankie and the Target regarding Charming, I thought that this should have been included as it is a big important development.Charmed is a solid entry into the smoking hot New Adult genre. I love that it blends the paranormal with a heated romance. It is the best of two genres. Frankie and Charming are two fun and memorable characters who drive the story. There is action, sizzling romance and the Grim Reaper in this one! If you are worn out of the same typical story lines in the New Adult genre and you want spice and supernatural, don't hesitate grab Charmed. You know you want that sexy cover on your shelf!Favorite Quotations:"Once my shift hell at work was over I drove straight to the closest gas station and filled my arms with enough sugary goodness to get me through the next week, or maybe just tonight, and dumped it all on the counter in front of the cashier who took in my haul with his usual disdain. I ignored him to grab some Dr. Pepper, Cherry Coke and Yoo-hoo and added that to my pile.""I wasn't fat, though by today's standards (which basically said you should look like a stick with a head), some people probably thought I was, but I didn't really care what those people thought. In my opinion, a woman should have a shape; she should be a body of swells and valleys.

$REVIEW.: What a wonderful story!! I loved everything about it and found it to be the best book I have read in a long time. Mac and Grace  were great as hero and heroine, and Hollys story was so precious. I cried while reading. I highly recommend and look forward to more books by Malinda. Oh yes, there was lots of dialogue and interaction between Mac and Grace, which is always a must for me in a great romance. This book moved me to be more loving to my own mom. Dont miss this one.

$REVIEW.: Overall this was a good book. Had a good story line. I few words weren't needed and some words were needed. I was a little confused on the time frame of the book. Needed a little more description but none of that would stop me from telling people to one click it. I love Goldie and Jordyn. I dislike Dude can't believe him, not with how he gets down. I sooo sad about Mercedes, I hope she goes on. Everyone in the book seemed very humble with their drama. Will read the next one.

$REVIEW.: I remember how much I loved the first book in this series, The Devil's Metal, but it felt like eons since I read it so when I saw that this 2nd book, The Devil's Reprise, was coming out, I re-read the 1st one. This was both to remember how great it was and remember why I obsessively had this Israel's release date in my calendar a year before it came out! I can't go on about it without ruining it with spoilers so just trust me on this one...read it NOW it's amazing!!! I put it down only because I had to work today but otherwise I would've read it straight through, which doesn't happen often, as I love sleep as much as books. Katrina Halle is one person whose writing is so good I will forego sleep for her books and that says a lot...love love love it!!!

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this book. It transitioned smoothly between past and present and I thought the author did a great job with character introductions. Even the "second-string" players brought a lot to the story. The only downside I could find to the book were the numerous typos. I'm not usually one to weigh my rating of a book by the editing, or lack thereof, but it was extremely distracting in the book. There was one character whose last name differed not once but three times. Not just a simple typo but a completely different last name. Aside from that, I did very much enjoy the book and do plan on reading more by this author.

$REVIEW.: I deleted this off my kindle right after I finished it. It was horrible , a true horror story . I found almost everyone  in it , with one exception , awful . I love American Horror Story and Hannibal . I don't shy away from horror , but this went too far for me.It is pretty well written , and sets the mood and the place well, but , oh, I could not bear the payoff. Firstly, a bit silly and convoluted for me. Secondly , just too ghoulish.As I said , it is deleted from my tablet , and good riddance !I actually feel much like I do after returning from a carnival.

I prefer series that mix things up, but this was a great follow up to the first book.Another book with loads of intrigue, surprising twists and turns, with plenty of smexy steam. I really like the lead characters, even dig their whole dynamic. The supporting characters gained more depth, Gavin and Mason. Oh boy, I have a new book boyfriend in Gunner!!!The only ugh moment, the book ends in a cliffhanger!!!!! Noooooooooooo!!!!

$REVIEW.: My Girl has done it again!! This is a awesome read. Leo and Kelly's story hooked me from page one until the last page. Had to read it in one sitting .Two MC's that used to get along, now they are at odds, suspense, conflict and a really hot man with a woman who is his equal, and looking for a place where she really belongs and with a man she can be with, and belong to. There are hot,steamy, scorching love scenes that will make you want to fan yourself. Ms. Masters writes her books and bring us readers into them as if we are really there in this world she creates, to me that make her an exceptional writer. I myself can almost feel, hear and smell the words on the pages that is how powerful of a writer this reviewer feels about her the writer, thanks for the many enjoyable hours of reading.

$REVIEW.: This is a good Classic Western story and I enjoyed it.  The story line provided interest and reading pleasure. In my opinion, this was a very strong three star effort that almost reached four stars.  The three stars is definitely not intended as a negative review!  I believe most fans of Classic Westerns will enjoy this story.  It was well written and flowed naturally.  There were numerous instances of proofing oversights, which didn't detract unduly from the story, and which I hope didn't overly influence my rating.

$review_text.: Oh, boy, so I'm still trying to calm down from the shocking ending to this as I'm writing! I flew through this book, there was so much action, suspense, romance...all of the things I love about fantasy stories!! I'm pretty sure this is the first series about faeries that I've ever read, or the others just weren't memorable! Morin created a beautiful world with beautiful characters, and I loved getting sucked into it...First off, I loved Alannah! I hate weak heroines, and she anything but; a bit naive to her world, but strong and brave despite her lack of knowledge

I can't wait to see her grow into her powers, because I have a feeling it will be amazing to see her once she harnesses all that she's capable of!! I was also pretty smitten by Kaleb from the start, I must admit; that spark at first sight is always so exciting, and I loved how he was so desperate to see Alannah again


But when Alannah finds herself suddenly in danger and desperate to escape the clutches of the evil Maligo, she happens upon the sexy and strong warrior faerie Brennus, and boy does he shake things up!! (Including for me, because I am now absolutely 'Team Brennus'!!) Alannah isn't sure what to make of him, yet she feels drawn to him in some way she can't resist


He's the flame and she's the moth, and boy do the fireworks go off when they collide!! Brennus is very protective of Alannah, and it becomes clear that their feelings for each other are becoming more and more meaningful.There was so much action throughout a huge portion of this story!! Kaleb, Tristan, and Alannah's sister Evyette travel to rescue Alannah and face danger at every corner, and the fight scenes were written with so much detail it was like seeing it through their eyes

As Brennus and Alannah make their escape from the mountains, they too meet up with rogue faeries, trolls, and other malevolent creatures that try to stop them from making it to safety

Along the way, Alannah's powers begin to reveal themselves, and she learns that she is far more powerful than she ever knew

The unique mark she wears means that she will be a key figure in the future of the fae world, but she has to first learn to control her powers with the help of the Elder Faeries

I'm excited to see Alannah train and learn to use them, she's going to be truly bad-ass as this series continues!!I really loved the fae world that Morin created for this series; it was beautifully described and I really felt like I was right there with the characters

I loved the concept of the markings growing as the fae used their powers, too
The picture on the front of Princess caught my eye when I first saw it, and now that I know what the markings are for I think it's even more beautiful!And I can't finish off my review without mentioning the ending...oh, my lord, my heart just skipped a thousand beats and now I'll have to wait while I torture myself with the possibilities!! I feel so heartbroken for Alannah, and I am so anxious to see what all this will mean for her future
Can't wait for the sequel!!

$SUMMARY.: Love this faerie story!!

$review_text.: Hello Kitty Must Die was a hilarious and fun trip through someone else's eyes and situations


 I loved the twist in the end (which I guess is given away by some of the other reviews, but I won't)

 It's definitely dark, but it's a humorous look at finding out that people aren't always what you think they are

 Isn't that what chick-lit is all about?  Putting yourself out there, being brave, sometimes brazen, but always looking at the world with a bit of humor


 I can only imagine that those who gave low reviews are either uptight or somehow it struck them wrong

 It almost seems as if there was a campaign to smear this book

 So, maybe the author did strike a nerve somewhere.

$REVIEW.: It is just too preposterous.  The love scenes totally out of character for time period.  Tried too hard to get past the inadequacies and try to like the story and thus waited too long to get a refund.  Sample:  calling the property  a farm and then calling it a ranch.  Totally different uses of a property.  Just one example.  Needs an editor and a flushing of the uncomfortable love scenes.

Is all it takes for Ms. Diablo to capture your attention and once she's got it she will not let go until you read the very last sentence. Set in the Midwest during the late 1800s, Sky Tinted Water follows young Rory Hudson as she heads West with her older sister's family, settles in and meets the young man that truly captivates her from the first time she lays eyes on him. Theirs is love at first sight even when all they have is a glimpse of each other and no names to fall back on. Follow Rory and Dawson as their love as it grows and is strengthened by time, tragedy and even war.To call this simply a Sweet Romance is not doing it justice. If you're not careful, Ms. Diablo will not only capture your attention, she'll capture your heart.

I agree with the other reviewer that the ending was a bit abrupt and the other detail I didn't liked was that a few things where to rapidly resolved (I'm not going to spoil it for anyone so I'm not telling what lol). I think this author and the story line has a lot of potential that I hope is explored and reached for the next book in the series. For those of you that like hot sex scenes the book has some really good ones. Other than that I think it's a good enjoyable read with the potential to become amazing. I will definitely buy the next book in the series to see if how it goes.

$review_text.: This is most certainly not a technical book. It avoids the nitty-bitty techie jargon that so many photography books fall into. Instead it looks at the more difficult subject of *why* certain images work, and how to develop an eye for a better shot. It's an interesting book, full of spectacular images, though some are unusual choices, though he does go on to explain why each was selected. The author talks about how to 'read' images, what makes a good image great, and how the various parts of an image work together to form a more pleasing whole.He goes on to discuss how to find an image and 'work the scene', getting more out of the location you've chosen. Lots of good advice in here on composition, cropping and using the edges of your frame. There's an interesting discusson on the 'mind games' of photography - how you wish you had better kit, how you get stuck in a rut (and advice on how to get out of it!), what to do when photographs go wrong and so on.Overall, it's a fascinating read, with some great photos, including a selection which are analysed in more detail.

$REVIEW.: Thanksgiving is just days away and elementary students are learning about Native Americans and the importance of giving thanks. Giving Thanks: A Native American Good Morning Message (Reading Rainbow Book) is the perfect complement to any Native American lesson plan.Written by Chief Jake Swamp, an educator and environmentalist who founded the Tree of Peace Society, the book is based on the Thanksgiving Address, an ancient message of peace and appreciation of Mother Earth and all her inhabitants delivered by the Native people known as the Iroquois.The message gives thanks for all the gifts of life--Mother Earth, the deep blue waters, the green grasses, fruits and berries, animals, trees, sun, moon and more. And the rich paintings by Erwin Printup, Jr. beautifully add to the Native American feel and history.It's the perfect time of year to share this Native American Good Morning Message with young readers and what better way to teach them to greet the world each morning by saying thank you to all living things?

$REVIEW.: The storyline was believable. Wealthy people wanting to keep business and money within the family and their children to marry within their elite social group. Some parents choosing an arranged marriage. I'm not so sure the characters were that believable. I felt the storyline dragged on a little too much.

$REVIEW.: By: Joanna RomerPublished By: Msi PressAge Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 5Review:"Widow: A Survival guide for the First Year" by Romer presented some very good advice for any women who is or has experienced be a widow. This advice to so well needed especially during the year after the death of a husband. I liked how this author presented her own story of being found alone and 'uses her emotional and occasionally humorous story as the backbone for this self-help guide that takes you from your first Christmas alone to making household repairs.'I liked this quote..."Remember, your husband died--you didn't."From the book: "Widow" there will be many issues that will include: "hints for those first holidays, and birthdays; ways to nurture and take care of yourself; loneliness, survivor guilt, money, cleaning out the closet, making future plans; and later on, how to join Face book, and use an iPhone; and whether to get a job, accept assistance, comfort and advice from others, reading, prayer and meditation and less not forget time for personal strength and dreams." There will be even more insightful information that will help you day by day.So whether you are a widow or know someone who has lost a husband, I would recommend this read to you as a excellent guide and read.

$review_text.: I bought this one mainly for research purposes in how to format a musical and while interesting, I don't think it reads particularly well as something to curl up with next to the fireplace


The storyline ranges from somewhat nonsensical to compelling and it's the kind of thing that probably doesn't work without actual people to breathe life into it.

$review_text.: Even though I read A Taylor-Made Life with blurry eyes at times with tears brimming over, I felt privileged to know such determined, courageous characters. Since cancer is the number one enemy they battle, I related in a very personal way having watched family members and precious friends in a life and death struggle with this cruel invader.While A Taylor-Made Life is not the usual happy-ever-after, it is such a beautiful love story, I would hate for you not to know about it. Also there is foreshadowing of what will happen in a second book that will be out soon. Kary Rader must have had some up-close experience with cancer and the emotional upheaval it brings as well as the physical suffering. She reaches out and touches that something inside that makes one cry and care and hope against hope for the characters to win battles that seem unwinnable.Seventeen-year-old former cheerleader Taylor Smith is out of options for a Leukemia cure. A marrow transplant cannot be found. She tells her mother she doesn't want to die a virgin and enlists her help. These two have a special connection that is a joy to see even if it is just vicariously. They have an unbreakable bond that never weakens--a unique understanding to admire.Gavin Taylor, the billionaire entrepreneur and genius computer game creator, is along fighting cancer and functioning with determination and a touch of desperation. He is estranged from his family and his friends are friends because he can make them rich and richer. His volunteer work as a cancer patient mentor has him knocking on Taylor's door and welcomed with open arms. Did he ever get a surprise and the gift of his lifetime!Ms. Rader creates secondary characters that seem so real. Some show their true colors and seem to circle like vultures waiting for Gavin to die; their greed, underhanded dealings, and threats are appalling. The people of the unfeeling media wreck havoc on two lovers without any compassion; they are worse than vultures. They want to feed on their prey before it is dead. Of course, other secondary characters like Maureen and John, Taylor's parents give and support unstintingly. The reader even can enjoy the undercurrent that Maureen brings to the story while all the time her heart is breaking.Kary Rader weaves a spellbinding tapestry of a tale as she lets the reader into the minds of Gavin and Taylor to feel the confusion and vicariously experience their battle against fear and hopelessness. She helps the reader understand the ferocity with which the two play their computer games--a symbolic battle that they have hopes of winning. While the tapestry is very dark with disease and dreadful people, it also has a beautiful brightness of friendship, fun, family and fantastic love that gives above and beyond AND Gavin's lawyer that knows how to "kick butt". A Taylor-Made Life truly shows the reader characters that live the life they were given; love the life they made--a theme that threads through the story. The foreshadowing throughout the story is subtle but there to let the reader no life goes on and more good things are ahead for the former high school cheerleader that had to grow up so fast. I'm eager to read the next book.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews

There is a story line that will make your heart melt.The characters are very likeable and if you get as involved as I did in the story, they are also very lickable! Scarlett and Mace are my EPIC couple of the year. Their intensity is HOT and I guarantee that you will wish it was you instead of Scarlett that Mace is touching physically and emotionally.Scarlett is my favorite female heroine and I have no doubt that she would have your back. Watch out boys, she is a HOT Badass Chick! She reminds me a little of Kat Von Drachenberg from LA Ink...she is a tattoo artist that is sexy as all hell and listen up boys...she loves HOT Cars and HOT Men!!Mace is my favorite male hero and the epitome of HOT & SEXY! He is a Bad boy with Tattoo's but will also dive deep into your soul. When he wants something he does not give up and he isn't going to be a douche about it. He fights for what he wants....& boy do I wish it was me!Wow, what else can I say about this book except that it was AMAZING, HOT, SEXY, EMOTIONAL, FUNNY as HELL and definitely LOVEABLE! Just like the Author Lola Stark. What an amazing Chick!  I am excited to see what this adorable author comes up with next! Watch out for her, she is on track for a best seller!

$REVIEW.: With the glut of "molecular gastronomy" lovers, these "Science of Cooking" type books are bound to play to the market. This America's Test Kitchen volume sits in-between books byAlton BrownorModernist Cuisineand evenCookWise.Where as the Alton Brown "Good Eats" cookbooks do a great job of both providing information as well as entertainment, "The Science of Good Cooking" reads more like a text book. The information provided (How convection heat works, What happens when you boil food, etc) is factual and to the point, but about as dry as reading instructions on how to put together your stereo. To the point, I have, to date, never had problems reading through an entire America's Test Kitchen book from cover to cover. Even the "year books" from over a decade ago still provided interesting reading - even if the gadgets were out of date and long gone. The "Science book" will probably end up more as a spot-check reference book, much likeLarousse Gastronomique.As for the recipes, there aren't really any new ones added. Instead, the book focuses on the "why's" of the cooking. However if you have many of the previous ATK books, you'll probably have 98% of the recipes found here.So to conclude - this is a great book for those who want to know the science of why food cooks the way it does - and does not mind being fed that information in a fact-of-the-matter classroom type manner. It would also make a good addition for the bookshelves of any seasoned cook who just wants to brush up their knowledge or find out why cooking one way works out while another doesn't. For those who are just venturing into home cooking, I would say that this is also a great volume to have as well - but only as a second or third volume. This just isn't a great introduction book, because honestly, you probably won't make it through the whole thing - it's simply too plain. For the new cooks, I would say stick with the Alton Brown-type books first - but grab this book later on.

$REVIEW.: Fiona Archer, you little minx, where have you been hiding all my life?! I found my favorite new getaway, and that my friends, is King's Bluff, Wyoming! Full of suspense, intrigue, and a whole bunch of sexiness, High-Stakes Loving will take you on a thrill ride of epic proportions. Even though, Fiona is a fairly new author, she has kicked the *** out of this genre, putting her in the same league as Sophie Oak, Lorelei James, and Cherise Sinclair. High-Stakes Loving is Book #2 in the series, but it can be read as a standalone. I haven't read Book #1, Chloe's Double Draw, but after getting a glimpse of these characters, I am ALL OVER IT! Everything about this book had me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. This was very well written, well thought out, and the characters she has created, will have you falling to your knees in no time.It always adds to the story when you can relate to a character. For me, that was definitely Reagan. Us full-figured gals need to stick together! Reagan is the town librarian who is loved by many. Even though she is stuck with a horrible reputation because of her mother, she still has friends that have her back no matter what. Reagan has this "good girl" behavior that has her quick to please everyone. On the outside she has times where her insecurities show. But one night with two gorgeous, protective men, she succumbs to her natural submission, and with that comes strength and confidence to help her fight her demons.Mike and Quinn, 2 Ex-SEALS who also happen to be Doms, (SHOCKER, I know) want nothing more than to capture the heart of their sub. Dealing with issues of their own, trying to fight their own demons, could ruin their chances with Reagan. Quinn's past tragedy and personal guilt is getting in the way of his happiness. Mike's personal demon is himself, and the disappointment he feels from his family has been eating at him, making him feel like half a man. Finding Reagan, bringing out her beautiful submission is just the first step in letting everyone heal.High-Stakes Loving had multiple swooning moments for sure. Beautiful, protective, strong Doms reading erotic romance books in bed with you? Holy ****! Sign Me Up Now! The love that these three had for each other was breath-taking and just seemed to jump out of the pages. Not only did the main characters have me hooked, but with all the great secondary characters; they just made me even more excited on what will happen next in the great town of King's Bluff.*Gifted copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: Another great romance from Elizabeth Lowell, except that I think that when they re-released it she should have written a few extra chapters to give the story a bit more body and the characters a bit more personality and back-story. She did this about 10 years ago when they re-released Summer Games as Remember Summer. I haven't read the original version, but Remember Summer is one of my all time favourite romances. I think Lowell could have done something similar with Sweet Wind, Wild Wind and improved it as she most certainly did with Remember Summer.

$REVIEW.: Hot Knight in Paradise is a modern and more realistic take on the whole stranded on a desert isle tale. Leah heads off to St. Lucia for a relaxing vacation only to get mugged on the way to her hotel. Left without any money, an ID, or her passport, she's stuck. Luckily, Marshall was hiking along and spotted her. He takes her back to his bar where his white knight syndrome kicks in. Leah doesn't want to be saved, so Marshall offers her a job and a decent salary while she works on getting her paperwork in order. Of course, there's a whole lot of seductive glances and sexual tension between them, so it's not long before these two fall into each others arms, and Leah realizes she has more reasons to stay than to head back to the US.I really liked the set up of Hot Knight in Paradise. It's pretty scary to think about being stranded in a foreign country with nothing but the clothes on your back. I definitely admired how Leah remained calm and did what she had to do. What else I liked, was how the romance developed. It still moved way too fast for my liking, but I did like how Leah and Marshall moved through each of the "bases" instead of just jumping straight into bed with each other. Those scenes are definitely steamy! However, as much chemistry as they had in the bedroom, I didn't really believe it in their day to day interactions. They always seemed too stiff around each other, even after things started heating up.My main issue with Hot Knight in Paradise was the use of rape as a plot device. I absolutely cannot stand this. Thankfully, Leah wasn't the one who was raped so there was some distance. But it was her cousin, who was as close as a sister, and Leah blames herself. It's been seven years and she still cannot see that it was not her fault. She's been caring around this burden and stayed estranged from her family for all this time. I would have thought that they would have talked through it by now, given how close they supposedly were. Nope, it takes Leah being confronted by a man she's known for a week for her to get her head on straight. Marshall has some grief from his past also, but at least his made more sense to me.In the end, I kind of liked Hot Knight in Paradise. It had the steamy romance that I was looking for and a wonderful exotic location. Unfortunately, the character's problems were not ones that I liked reading about, and I think it's bad taste to use rape as a way to get two people to bond. There's any number of issues that Leah could have had involving her family instead of that. To me it felt like the author used it as a way to have Leah be wary of Marshall in the beginning and for them to have some big blow up about not holding herself responsible. It just didn't sit right with me.*Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley for review. No compensation was offered or accepted.

Sally Nimitz, a widow, is a nurse who, after years of a good marriage is happy enough to live alone, enjoy her friends, and her job, working a few nights a week in the hospital. When a neighbor is killed, Sally, along with two other friends try to discover who killed the lady. The narrative takes the reader through Amelia's day-to-day life with work, gardening, her grandson, interaction with the police, and the unusual way she goes about finding all about the secretive victim to learn enough about her to find who could have possibly killed her. She travels to other states, and even to England to find the answer - which she does in her own way.

If you are brand new to EFT, you may need The Basic Manual or a DVD to explain, and show, the procedure clearly, but once you know how to do it, you can "try it on everything," as the developer of this method, Gary Craig, has often said. Please be careful about some of the informal videos you may see on You Tube or other sites. Some of them may be correct and some may not. Take the time to learn it the right way and its benefits will return to you a hundredfold.

$review_text.: Not every novel has to be deep and meaningful -- and that's just fine. When you're in the mood for a "just tell me a story" historical romance to distract you from Real Life, this one is a good candidate.The setting: Elizabethan London. Lizzy Croft works in the theater sponsored by Lord Hawkesbury, where she is responsible for costume sewing, wigs, and other props. She has "an understanding" with her neighbor Jamie... which goes flying out the window when his brother, the dark and mysterious Rafe, returns to London after an absence of seven years. Lizzie is worrying about the theater's future because of threats from, well, I'll avoid any spoilers but it'll be obvious who is the bad guy. Said Dude shows up dead under circumstances that make Rafe and Lizzy the primary suspects. Rafe, who was fretting over his brother's predicament, his personal secrets (well I was INTENDING to give up that old profession), and his feelings of "uh-oh I am so very attracted to Jame's intended..." must deal with the real murderer and try OH SO HARD to resist Lizzy.Gosh, do you think they get together? Of course they do. But it's the journey that matters here, and C.J. Archer does a good job of interweaving the time-and-place (yes, Will Shakespeare shows up) with the characters. She also gives Lizzy and Rafe plausible reasons to do things that are otherwise implausible (such as constructing a costume out of not-much, made reasonable given Lizzy's theater background). I like that the author created a _shy_ heroine for once (enough with the headstrong chicks!), and the tidbits of history spiced things up. (Oh, so that's how debtor's prison worked?) The ending is a stretch, but I was perfectly willing to play along.I read the novel in a short period of time, and enjoyed every minute. It's not "memorable" fiction that immerses you in time-and-place (if that's what you are in the mood for, turn to something likeDissolution), but it is certainly an enjoyable diversion, which is just groovy with me.

$REVIEW.: I read the first book in the Secret Wishes series where we were introduced to the hero and heroine. Just those tiny interactions made me realize how much I wanted to read their story. In some ways I thought this book was even better that the 1st. The banter between the two was hilarious. If there was a smart ass contest, Kagan would win.Kagan is hiding out from her wealthy father. He's trying to direct her future, including who she should marry, and she's at the end of her rope. She mainly keeps to herself. Most of her socializing comes during her shift as a waitress in the Crown & Anchor bar. When the man her Father wants her to marry shows up, she needs an out. She lets out a little lie about Shane.Shane was chasing Kagan in the 1st book. No matter how many times he asked her out, she turned him down. Shane is not someone who's used to hearing the word no. Especially from a woman he shows an interest in. Shane happened to appear at her door when she needed him. While he tries to puzzle out everything about her, he somehow ends up agreeing to be her pretend boyfriend. What better way to get to know her right? Why's she hiding things? Is this just pretend for them? Could the town playboy finally have met his match?

$REVIEW.: In book two Ms. James delves head on into Greek Mythology and intertwines it with a modern storyline.  Lots of twists and turn from beginning to I would say end, but there wasn't one.  Did I mention how much I hate cliffhangers?  If not for the fact that this book was so very entertaining, written well, and had a heavy dose of my favorite subject (Greek Mythology) I don't think I would be so quick to give it 5 starts because of the cliffhanger alone.  I look forward to the next installment of the series and hope that the end makes up for the two she didn't write in the first two books. Other books by Lola JamesBound to Remember, a Paranormal Romance (Book 1 of the Spellbound Series)andFate's Design, a Paranormal Romance (Fate Series Book One)

$REVIEW.: The reason I love this book because the author (William Amerman) keeps you wanting to know more about life after hundreds of years and guessing will it ever come to this. Has the worlds population expanded so much that we need to build up into the sky? We meet characters that are involved with Nick Burke, members of this group that he has trusted to help and ensure him and his family to get emigrated to another level. Quarantine takes over his level to control this 'Malady' (sickness) that has taken over and walls are being put up all over the ground barricading people in.Every moment  throughout this book is so descriptive that you feel as if you are right there along side Nick, running, dodging and attempting to help each circumstance with valor and praying he doesn't get caught.Follow the roller coaster of events that come about through out the book with flashbacks of how they all came about and got to this point. Meet Nick, Jane (his wife), Simon (his son) and many more. They are all intertwined with each other and you get to meet each one and understand their story. One goal in mind for everyone - to get to higher ground by any means possible.I hope you the readers enjoy it as much as I did... Enjoy!!

$review_text.: I met M.K. Harkins nearly a year ago when Intentional was still a newbie, she took a chance on a new blogger and asked me to read it. I fell in love with her writing style, with the amazing story she was writing, and this guy - Cade.Cade is a simple guy. He loves his music, loves his friends and bandmates. He doesn't have much of a need for anything more. However, when he finds himself on the outside of a Love, so real and so rare, he's jealous and he wants it for himself. Now tending to a broken, shattered heart, he sees the darkness swallowing him, he feels like he's drowning in despair. What else is there for him if he can't have the one thing he really wants?? Unable to pull himself from the abyss, he alienates everyone around him and risks everything he's worked so hard for.Laurel wants Cade. No, not like that. She wants the band. She wants the contract, she wants to give him everything on a silver platter - it doesn't hurt he's the sexiest man she's ever laid eyes on. If only she can get through to him. An entertainment agent, she can see what his future will be. His face on the cover of the magazines, his popularity with the band soaring beyond his dreams. Now if only she can get to him.An awkward first meeting. Ships passing in the night. What's it going to take to bring Cade back from the edge and show him life is waiting for him to participate.M.K. Harkins blew my mind with Intentional. It certainly went in a direction I didn't expect it to go, with Unintentional, she did it again and made my heart break for Cade all over again. She has a bright and shiny future ahead of her an intricate storyteller who can share her own emotions with the words she writes.~Amy TTP

Interracial relationship are difficult when faced with prejudice.  They are much more difficult when they are faced with doing the right thing for love.  Time can change people, but it can also make you see that things done for love are often misguided but they are rarely mistakes (if you learn never to give up on it).

$REVIEW.: If you are a fan of X men or Heroes this book is spot on target for you. A fast paced, action packed adventure. Two friends lives are changed forever when they are "gifted" by a mysterious benefactor. They then meet up with other "talented" people to try and overcome the "lords" - beings whose abilities are amplified when they consume blood. And the battle of good vs evil begins. A well constructed read, probably best suited for older teens - but a good general read for anyone who likes adventure.

$REVIEW.: 4-4.5 starsThis was a very good story. It's the second book I've read from this series and I'm really looking forward to #3 (I read a sneak peak of it and it looks good). Menace and Naya are a great couple and I really enjoyed their story.Naya has had a very hard life. She was abandoned by most of her family and people she's cared about. She grew up on the streets and had to work hard to make a living. Regardless of past disappointments, she's very loyal and when a friend gets picked for a "Grab" (a race where warriors come in to chase down a woman to take for their wife) Naya gets herself in the Grab as well so they can try to stay together. They have an escape all planned out but an unfortunate turn of events has her friend reaching the safe zone and Naya getting pulled back just shy of freedom.Menace is a friend of Vicious (the hero from book #1 [book:Grabbed by Vicious|17695124]) and after he saw how happy his friend is with his wife Hallie, Menace decides to enter a Grab to find his own wife. He thinks he wants someone soft and docile and almost gets a woman like that in the race. Fortunately for him, things don't turn out the way he planned and he ends up with a spitfire who seems intent to make his life hell.Menace is a good guy who has been through a lot of horrors of war. He's been dreaming of someone he can love and lavish attention on and someone who will do the same to him. Someone to build a home and family with. He's very disgruntled to find that his wife curses more than him and is a combination of pissed at him and scared of him and his intentions. Once he gets her back to his quarters on the ship, Menace tries to bridge the gap between them. It's not easy and Naya tries not to give an inch. Menace treats her well though and seems honest when he says he wont hurt her and just wants to make her happy. She has some misgivings but eventually figures she could give it a try. She feels a strong attraction to Menace and wants to give in so Menace makes her feel safe enough that she does.Despite the initial blowup, Menace and Naya come together as a couple pretty well. They find their likes mesh, both in the bedroom and out. Naya also gets to meet Hallie (the heroine from book #1 [book:Grabbed by Vicious|17695124]) who helps her get acclimated to life on the ship. As Menace and Naya get to know each other more, they start exploring their different kinks. This takes them (after being together for a bit) to the officers club on the ship (aka BDSM club for officers) and Naya gets to experience a little m/f/m action (with Menace's friend Hazard who I really liked and I hope he gets his own book).Both Menace and Naya are doing well and pretty happy when things go to hell. Naya did things she shouldn't have when she was a teen that Terror (one of the secret police) finds out about. He doesn't believe (or more accurately care) that she hasn't been involved in anything bad for years. He has her arrested and threatens Menace and Hallie to force her in to a dangerous position that almost kills her. Menace and friends have to ride in the rescue and are almost too late but fortunately aren't. The day is saved but not without a lot of trauma. The thing that pissed me off and brought this down from a 5 stars to a 4 star was that Terror did horrible things and almost gets Naya killed and he gets away with it with basically no repercussions (he should never get his own book because he's to much of a jerk to ever treat a woman decently). Regardless of that issue, the book was great and I loved seeing Naya and Menace's reunion and have their HEA.Overall I really enjoyed this story. I loved Menace and Naya and was really rooting for them. I'll definitely be looking to get the next book in the series when it comes out as I'm loving this series. I'd recommend this book. Thumbs up! :D

$review_text.: Are your close relationship "stuck".  "Family Ties that Bind", by Dr. Ronald Richardson, is now in its 2011-4th edition and has sold over 135,000 copies.  "Family Ties" is a systematic way to get un-stuck from all of our family of origen's messiness.  He dares us to understand why we are who we are without being powerless to become healthier both within, and with our closest relationships.Dr. Richardson forms powerful concepts to visualize how we link our families together.  He uses Family Systems theory from the Bowen Theory approach without using a lot of psycho-jargon.  The paperback is brief, only 140 very readable pages.  He is wonderfully transparent with his own family "mobile" and shares how he has worked through his own relationship.  This gives the book some flesh and blood, far more than a text book or a mere "how-to".Everything begins with our own need for closeness and separateness.  As we understand our personal needs and move toward our own healthy balance we are able to identify the dynamic, everchanging forces at work in our families.  You will find that there is all families have messiness and not just yours.  You will see that all families are built on emotional relationship that spiral in and out, closer at times and farther away at others.Each chapter contains thought provoking questions and an exercises to find healthier ways to live together.  He teaches us the difference between thinking and feeling; the wonders and dangers of "triangling"; how to escape unhealthy roles and form healthy ones; what we can learn from birth-order; and ends with a step by step process to put these concepts to work.  The goal is not to cure but to improve personal relationships and lead a less anxious life in the process.My introduction to Ronald Richardson was in seminary through his book, "Creating a Healthier Church". This applies Bowen theory to pastoral leadership and like this book shows that these concepts affect all corners of our lives. The concepts that he uses to create healthier relationship at home also apply to church, work, sports teams and any other situation where two or more are gathered. I strongly recommend this book. A more complete outline will be posted on my blog. Thanks from the "thoughtful pastor" for reading this review.

$review_text.: World War II seems to supply authors, whether those for children or adults, with an inexhaustible supply of true stories for inspiration.  Author Maryann Macdonald turns to historical fiction in her new novel, Odette's Secrets, about a young Jewish girl in Paris during the Nazi Occupation.  Odette's story is told in spare free verse; we meet her Polish-Jewish parents who have immigrated to Paris with their only daughter Odette.  Odette is beloved by her gentile godmother, the concierge at her building, and has a comfortable existence until her father joins the French military, is taken prisoner by the Germans, and conditions began to worsen considerably for the Jewish population of Paris.  Soon the round-ups of foreign-born Jews begin, destined to be shipped off to the East.  Odette's mother, realizing the danger, makes a plan for her daughter and the daughters of other friends to go stay with family friends in the Vendee, outside of Nazi-occupied France, where she will be in safely in the countryside with plenty to eat.There's one wrinkle--Odette must forget that she's a Jew.  She must blend in perfectly with the village children, learn how to cross herself, say Catholic prayers, attend mass, eat pork, in other words, do nothing that could distinguish her from other children in the village.  She becomes very good at keeping secrets--even from her closest friends.  But when her mother flees Paris to join her, suspicion follows them just the same.  Can they stay safe?  And what will happen after the war ends?  Will her father and other relatives find them back in Paris?This is a moving, small novel that can be read quickly but delves into real issues of prejudice, bravery, and how ordinary children can survive in dangerous and extraordinary times  This novel is inspired by the life of the real Odette Myers, a story the author discovered while doing research in a Paris library; she was helped in this project by Odette's son, Daniel, who shared family photos and experiences.  Highly recommended.

I love the main characters-- Indy was a tough beautiful girl, and Jonathan was the perfect cowboy alpha. Really enjoyed several scenes including the 'rooftop' one. I can just imagine everyone's reaction when they saw Indy. Also, Jonathan asking Indy to wear a dress and their wedding, of course. I actually have a little book hangover right now.This is my first book by the author and I can't wait to read the next one on the series. I am so looking forward to Jacob and Allie's story.

Mr. Pudge takes a disgusting, violent, absolutely monstrous character, and by the end of the book has you actually rooting for him to win.  Throw in an enraged Sheriff out for revenge, a vampire that literally bites off more than he can chew, a pack of werewolves, and you've got one amazing horror novel.  As always I'll be on the look out for Mr. Pudge's next great work.

$REVIEW.: Lash opens up this ambitious & fascinating work with the story of Hypatia, or rather the murder of Hypatia by a crazed Christian mob in the early 5th century C.E. It is a shocking story and a powerful opening salvo in this all out attack on the Judeo Christian salvationist program.  More than this, it makes a strong case that gnosticism, usually associated with early Christianity, is an ancient mystic and esoteric, Goddess based traditional worldview.  The gnostic material is even referred to as "gospels" by Elaine Pagels, the best known writer on the gnostic writings linked to the discoveries of ancient texts near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1947. Lash makes a case that the Nag Hammadi writings represent a mixed bag of narrative myths, poetry, philosophy and that they were hidden to protect them from marauding Christians. This is certainly a novel view of early Christians, persecuting the pagan mystery sites and the academic institutions that had grown up with them.Lash essentially links the gnostic and Earth based religions to newer ideas about deep or sacred ecology.  He sees a powerful link between these ancient, long hidden writings, and our current attempts to better understand our planet and its (her?) relationship to all life forms, including humans.Lash also delves into the Dead Sea Scrolls, and links the Essene Community to Paul, Jesus, James and the early Christian community.  This is a new and no doubt controversial portrayal of the Essene community, but it builds logically on the DSS.  This is fascinating stuff, but difficult for a non expert to evaluate.These are beautiful and powerful ideas, and Lash has written a book to provoke, inform and inspire.

That damn Chelsea is wreaking havoc on the lives of the people in her inner circle. She is leaving an aftermath of all of her relationships with no regard. You are not ready to read for this character&#8230;at all&#8230;

$REVIEW.: I decided to give this book a 5 star as its been quite awhile that I read a good book that kept me interested enough to keep turning the pages. Thought the storyline was a good one and liked the fact that I was well into the story before the reader could even make a guess who the murderer really was. I liked how the drama of each character went back in time to characterize the personalities and what lead up to the disappearances and murders. Absolutely loved the end which left me totally surprised and left me thinking of the book well after I finished it. The ending was not what I expected and left me thinking of making up my own story on what might happen now. Good book. Will look and see if other books from this author.

I have read all three in this Whoopie Pie Juggler series and love what Rebecca does with her stories, the chances she takes with the Amish genre, and her gutsy heroine and all too human characters
Despite the typos and even in spite of the fact that a married man is all-of-a-sudden single at his own funeral, I would still recommend this book for the author's deep probing into human nature.

Very we'll written and true to the spirit of Austen, romantic not crass, and it delves deeply into the pride and prejudice of both characters.

$review_text.: The two MCs spent so much time agonizing over whether to have a relationship or not that after a while, I just didn't care what they did - or didn't do. If the book were about a third shorter - with less emphasis on the &#34;should we, shouldn't we&#34; and more time spent on character development, I might have liked it a little better. Unfortunately, by the end I really didn't care about the MCs nor their friends and/or employees, all coming across as rather lackluster, cardboard characters.

$review_text.: Celeste opens with a young man named Kyle trying to find his way in the world following a nervous breakdown. He has a job, a place to live, and a loving brother. All of those are important, but the one thing that makes the others seem obsolete is Celeste.After meeting during his stay in the hospital, Celeste quickly becomes the perfect woman for his needs and desires. The only catch? He's afraid to share her with the world. As Kyle's brother pushes him to introduce his family to Celeste, questions about her and her past begin to stir up feelings of doubt in Kyle's mind about his own sanity.One of the more thought provoking novellas I've read, Celeste took me back to the days of being a kid when I used to read Tales From the Crypt and other horror/suspense comics. There's something about a good suspense story that puts a smile on my face. If you're the same then this is your fix.

As each character was introduced, for each scene that play out, I could easily picture (in my mind's eye) what was happening.  Zach and Sloane both have their own trust issues.  However, from the first time they meet, their chemistry is undeniable.  The mystery surrounding Ann's disappearance held me until the end.  It was a romantic, suspenseful, intelligent read!

I loved that the heroine learns and grows past her past while the hero is growing more mature; they make each other better people and that is always enjoyable to read.

$review_text.: When I bought this title, I had no idea the treasure I was getting. Here are Edward Lee stories being released in sets, and they are not simply a small outing into the world of fandom. No, this is a flashback into the works you never see, never touch,and always want. Its like having something grand fall from the sky and you find it.I caught a deformed angel with a halo made of - I don't think I can write that into a review. Let's just say it made me happy and horrified all at the same time.For fans of Lee, you should just get this and the other book before they go out of print. you know that is how it goes - the man has books that come out in small orders, and those go when someone sees they are here. This is a reprint of a lot of stuff, too, and gets together with one other release to bring back so many stories that simply disappeared for ages. When I saw this, I thought it was someone else or something different because I didn't think his chapbooks came back after than evaporated. That's what they do, too, because you simply can'ty find much of his work. This, however, is here and the listing of what it contains is typed up either in the product description or in one of the first reviews. Originally it was in the product description, but you know the names and how they get pulled down.for fans and non alike, this is some horrific style horror. You think you've seen it all then read some of this, thinking what kind of sickness drives someone to create that. But the thing is that it is adictive because, truly, horrible people would make horrible marks on the world. That's why I like Lee; he doesn't make up monsters that couldn't be real most of the time. Sure, he has some fanciful books and now creates beasts, but the first things were peopel with deformities and the terror they bring. sometime those deformities were inward and sometimes they stood outside but always, always, they owned their world.Just don't buy on a whim - know what you are getting.

$REVIEW.: This is a difficult book to review. It is written in the first person by an 18 year old girl who has left her uncaring and verbally abusive father to live and work in Avalon on Catalina Island. Her reflections on her home life are commingled with her reactions to her encounter with a mysterious stranger who begins to change her attitude toward her future and her desire to develop meaningful relationships. She's been loner most of her life and seldom encountered people who actually cared about her. A mystery ensues and close friendships begin to develop. The book is interesting and the descriptions of Catalina's history and topography is fascinating

$REVIEW.: Now and Then has been sitting on my kindle for some time now.  After reading Bound by Brenda Rothert and loving both the story and writing style, decided to grab this one, but just never got around to it, way too many new books and just not enough time.  So yesterday when I was in the mood for a sweet romance that I would enjoy, thought it was about time I picked this up and boy am I glad I did, I haven&#8217;t been able to put it down.Emmaline was always the shy nerdy type teenager that was always overshadowed by her older sister Layla, who was the pretty cheerleader that could have any guy she wanted.  From the moment Cole Marlowe moved in across the street from Emmaline, she had a huge crush on him.  But being three years younger, he never really saw her, it was always Layla.  So upon graduation she decided to make a change with her life and off to Paris she went for 5 years to study art and when she came back she was a beautiful and much more confident women.Cole Marlowe, now a hot and sexy junior lawyer working hard to make a name for himself at the practice he was working at.  Cole had never notice Emmaline, that was until he ran into her, literally, 6 years later at a coffee shop near her work.  After that, she was all he could think about, she was all grown up, sexy and confident and the three year age difference didn&#8217;t seem to matter anymore.I absolutely loved this story, it was a nice fresh change from all the other books that are out there seem to have the same old same old story.  I loved how from the moment these two reconnected, there were sparks and butterflies, but that things started out casual and built up.  I truly enjoyed that these characters weren&#8217;t having sex and professing their undying love right away.  Their love story was a sweet one but when these two finally hooked up, boy did it have its hot and very sexy moments.  I loved how real the story and the characters were.  I really enjoyed Emmaline&#8217;s character, she was shy and timid as a teenager but after coming back from Paris she was much more confident but it was nice to see she still had her moments of feeling insecure, especially when it came to Layla and Cole.  I really liked how their relationship progressed over the story, it wasn&#8217;t perfect, they had their moments of struggle and with them keeping it from their families and his secret, it was true to real life and I love that.  Like I said it was a nice fresh change from the same old same old that I keep picking up and get bored with really quick.  This book kept me engaged from the moment it started to the moment I finished, can&#8217;t remember the last time I read a book in less than a day and a half.  So if you are looking for a great well written sweet and sexy read, you should pick this one up, I wish I hadn&#8217;t waited so long and can&#8217;t wait to dig into Layla&#8217;s story now.

$review_text.: "Swept up by the Sea" is a romantic adventure novel about a young man named Percival Taylor. After meeting a girl named Tuppence who fell in love with him under the false pretenses that he was a pirate rogue, and being told by fortune teller, Madame Zoltana, that his destiny was to be a legendary pirate, he knows he was meant to live a life on the seas. He embarks on a possibly life-altering journey from Blackshore to prove to himself and Tuppence that he can be the great pirate he wants to be.This book was slow moving and dense, and draining to finish. I would have liked the book a lot better if the authors used a range of sentence structures and variations instead of only using lengthy, wordy sentences. This made it hard to enjoy what seems like would have been a good plot.What I did like about this book was that in the end, all issues were resolved, however not exactly in the way I thought they would be, and there was a feeling of achievement when I reached the end.  I think other kids might like that, too.Although the ending was strong and I liked the sense of accomplishment I felt when I finished the book, I wouldn't recommend it.Review by Emily W., age 12, Metropolitan Washington Mensa

The brutality, expertise and pycho nature of the villain has been captured very well. His name is Moreno and he's a Spanish psychopathic killer. He really fills you with dread. The story starts with his escape from the prison. KGB intelligence chief Feramontov  has helped him to escape after eight years of prison to use him for recovering some political secrets. So the British Intelligence sends Johnny Fedora and Sebastian Trout.They have to not only track Moreno but also stop the KGB operation.Even as they try to investigate they discover that the plot is even more deeper. The characters and the story suck the reader into the plot.You can really feel the tension and the thrill.

I have a great library of software books but this is one of the best for teaching yourself. The subject is very fun and interesting and if you are just getting started with Python then what a great way to get started than with this book on grey hat hacking. I have done the first few chapters and I am loving it. The books examples are very clear and you hit the road running. It's not an extensive treaty on the subject of either Python or Penetration Testing/ Hacking but it is a really fun way to get started.I recommend it if you are trying to just learn Python since it is a fun way to do it. Most books have really dry examples.

$review_text.: I had trouble putting this one down, that's for sure! Amazing and believable characters, good action and lots of humor - this book has a wonderful blend of it all. Mr. Mayer shows that he has all of the qualities of a professional author. The only thing that could have made this book better would have been the exclusion of profanity and blasphemy, as well as the brief erotic scenes. All are unfortunately part of the most popular author's books these days, and I was hoping that Mr. Mayer would prove himself talented enough to avoid falling into that particular trap.  Maybe next time, I hope, because this story leaves the reader waiting on the edge of their seats - waiting for a sequel.Family friendliness:It's obvious that this book was intended for a very mature adult audience.  It concerns the world as it is, and not as the author wishes to portray it, which means that nasty things creep up in the story along the way.

$review_text.: After reading each of the books in this series, I didn't think one could top any of them, but this one just about does it!!  Love Sam's spunk and confidence in the midst of a terrible family tragedy.  She kept her emotions intact, even though on the inside she was so broken up about what her niece went through.  She finally lets go on the way to the hospital after Gonzo is admitted with a gunshot wound.  The heart stopper for me was the hospital waiting room scene.  I can hardly wait to see what her life is going to be like as Second Lady!  Wonderful book!!

$REVIEW.: I went to bed early thinking "I will just get a few pages in before falling to sleep". Well you know I could not put it down until it was finished. The author built a world I could visualize and characters that made me curious to see what was going to happen next. The drama was fun and the character development veered in ways that surprised me. The book is an unlikely choice for a guy that prefers military science fiction but the action feeds that itch for conflict and unknown dangers. The twists and changes would be ruined if I gave you insights to the plot.I will be looking up other works by this writer.

$REVIEW.: That is I AM pleased, HE IS a gifted author and IT WAS a wonderful book, if however, somewhat vicissitudinous.  That is to say: there were without a doubt some wonderful "ah ha!" moments but for this reader they took sometimes 30 or 40 pages to develop, and it took me nearly 2/3rds of the book to figure out why; each sentence is rife - packed to the gills - with insight.  It is in my nature to plow through a book picking off the low hanging fruit, as it were, then circle back to the more esoteric wisdom that I failed to notice the first time around.  I advise one not to employ this methodology with this work; slow the pace, absorb the content carefully and then move on.Somewhere on or about page 38, Mr. Falco refers to a woman (via an example) as a person whom had been in effect lying to herself as "diluted," I'm quite certain that he meant "deluded." Other than the aforementioned, the book was very well written, edited and capaciously insightful.  4 stars on board, with a real 4 and  on this first working day of the new year.

$REVIEW.: Expectations usually cause people to rise to the occasion. Too many expectations coming from everyone and too many negative situations cause Ben Torres, surgeon extraordinaire, to do some wildly unexpected things. Ogling the resident nurse for starters, during off-duty time of course...Ben Torres grew up living the values of his father who gave of himself and his time to the African people. Ben watched his father sacrifice so much to others, learning that enjoying himself was frowned upon. So he encouraged his friends to join in sacrificing of themselves also. As an ER surgeon, Ben is known for making the right decisions and helping to heal various people who happen to end up in the ER sometimes due to their own bad choices in life.Jessica Bradford is the nurse who Ben ogled after he makes himself unavailable for ER duty. She is dependable, reliable, and conservative in all that she does because she wants to be a good role model for her younger brother and sister who she has been looking after since she was twenty. Jessica also grew up with a father who constantly promoted giving of things, time, and self to others.When Sam, Jessica's brother, asks her to help him with his friend, Ben, she goes willingly without question to help him out. Ben of course does not want any help, since he realizes that they all want him to go back to being the selfless, giving person they thought he should still be. Ben and Jessica's tug of war with each other's lives and emotions is thoroughly examined. Their escapades are sometimes comical, with a generous helping of brotherly, sisterly, and friendly love from supporting characters.I enjoyed reading this first installment of the Bradford series. The main characters and supporting characters are very likable. The story seemed a bit long in parts, but it was necessary for including all the scenes that built up the characters and the supporting characters who will probably be getting their own stories told in separate books. Ms. Nicholas' writing is a pleasure to read as she makes it easy for me to vicariously enjoy what the characters are going through.I highly recommend reading Just Right for those who are questioning "what is the world coming to" and "where is the good in the world". I also recommend this story for its sexy story line, with great reading about falling in love and dealing with life as a whole.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews

$REVIEW.: As of 2011, there are now seven billion human beings inhabiting Planet Earth.  Each individual is a complex organism, whose entire entity is controlled and managed through a complicated yet delicate neural network, unifying mind, body and soul into the individual as he or she stands in the present moment.  The individual is a unique mish-mash of past experiences, current, on-going assessments of perceptual cues--internal and external--leading to decisions, which are overtly expressed as measurable behaviors, creating a series of short-term and long-term consequences, over which, more assessments are made of what is being perceived in the moment.  As we can assess, individual human mammals are neither simple in its day-to-day operations, nor can it easily be pigeon-holed into a series of set predictable behaviors.  Just as we believe we have created a viable template with which to organize and understand individual behaviors, he or she acts in a fashion totally unpredictable in relation to what we had expected.  Magnify this human dilemma of human on human violence seven billion times, and such is the human condition in which we currently reside.The cultural and social ramifications of physical violence is a complexity of human relating that owns no simple, singular solution to its occurrence.  The roots of violence possess combined biological, societal and individual learning components, and to fully understand how one human will relate to another through the expression of physical violence must confront this multifaceted dimensional aspect of physical violence.  There are many theories, many templates, and many opinions as to who, what, when, where and why humans are violent, and how we might manage said violence.  Rory Miller's book: FACING VIOLENCE is one such offering that approaches this problem along a multi-dimensional strategy.In an attempt to take what is an extraordinarily complicated topic and break it down into a simplified formula for resolve, Rory Miller achieves what can be labeled as a comprehensive and inclusive approach for dealing with the frightening aspect of human violent behaviors inflicted upon others.  He does so along ways and means which are appropriate within the confines of our constitutionally based, representative governmental bureaucracy.The template formulated and reasonably expanded upon, is the creation of a manual encompassing the study of seven distinct variables that combine to create the consequences and solutions to the consequences, when two or more humans decide to relate to one another through violent means.  Each variable addressed in chapter form, are presented in elaborate form on the why and how a violent human form arises and then offers the reader examples on that variable with its sequential resolve in an intelligent, common-sense blend of academic research and documentation with hands-on, pragmatic experience.The formula's chapters are arranged as follows:  #1.'Legal and Ethical;'  #2. `Violence Dynamics;'  #3. ` Avoidance;'  #4. `Counter-Ambush;'  #5. `The Freeze;'  #6.' The Fight;'  #7. ` After;'  `Afterword;'  Glossary;  and Further Reading.The above seven variables contained within this 223 page manual, begins with the legal and ethical implications of what might result when two humans relate violently--one inappropriately, the other attempting to respond appropriately, out of self-preservation, within the confines of the established bureaucracy.  While each municipality possesses specific rules and regulations pertaining to acts of violence perpetrated against others, the United States as a whole, possess common denominators of what are acceptable behaviors when managing criminal violent behaviors.  Miller provides a simplified format, explaining each facet in detail in accordance to the chapter title, which is easy to understand and assimilate.  It is, however, each individual's sole responsibility to know what is, and, is not lawful behavior in his or her specific region, as Miller's book is not a legal law document addressing criminal codes of violent crime.  Ignorance of the Law is not an acceptable excuse from violating said law.Miller attempts to capture the actual dynamic nature of what might occur when one human entity perpetrates violence against another.  Miller offers a few potential reasons for violence occurring, painting a reasonable realistic picture as to how a violent altercation can unfold.  Understanding how best to manage a physical altercation, as Miller so deftly explains, means we must first thoroughly understand the unpredictable and ambiguous nature of human violence being expressed between two or more persons.In what Miller believes is a natural state of progression when trying to understand violence, and how to manage it, he next addresses the issue of learning how to see where potential violence resides and then to take a course of avoiding violence altogether.  This third chapter discusses an in-depth process of recognizing, understanding and possibly de-escalating violent behavior in others before it becomes problematic to the individual passing through.When our awareness is subpar and our de-escalation and escaping skills fail, the next progression is to find us neck deep in an ambush.  According to Miller, once we are captured in the throes of a violent encounter we have not been able to avoid, we must understand how to engage a few gross motor responses in order to off-set the physical violence being inflicted. This fourth chapter on "Counter-Ambush" demonstrates several simple scenarios of violence and how to appropriately neutralize the physical threat, swiftly and with conviction.He does illustrate the closeness of physical violence, and just how up-close-and-personal it gets.  Miller has chosen to use Boyd's OODA loop paradigm, and how this method of assessing external and internal variables interrelating, might be of use to expediently off-set personal attacks with the appropriate levels of swift, aggressive and surprising counter responses to an `ambush' situation.The next two chapters:  (#Five): "The Freeze," and (#Six): "The Fight," offer solid peeks into some of the neurological and physiological effects and side effects of perceiving potential violence and what happens at these levels when both the prepared and the unprepared mind engages said violence.  Proper preparations are mandatory for eliciting the kinds of situational correct, proactive responses to perceived violent threats.It is within these two chapters Miller dispels some of the misconceptions and misunderstandings about how the human mind manages startle responses, and what actually occurs, when push has been lost to shove.With a unique blend of his personal experiences tempering sound academic explanations of what is "The Freeze" and how best to overcome it, Miller remains concise and focused on just what is needed, without frills and extras.  Insofar as explaining the nuance of "The Fight," again Miller keeps things humbly on track, providing pertinent examples of what happens in a violent `fight' and what are appropriate levels of `fighting' responses.Lastly, in the seventh chapter, Miller covers the human price paid for engaging in violent behaviors--the emotional fallout, legal ramifications, physical consequences and psychological trauma induced.  Here we can see very clearly, reasons why violence has no real winners, and why we really need to learn, as a species, how to follow a less violent course of relating.  We will see how violence may be our easiest, knee-jerk response to potential disagreements, that same violence must become our last resort.  The price paid for violence unleashed, finds everyone involved, on the losing end.Miller does an excellent job in taking a complicated topic of overt human violence, breaking it down into layman's terms (the glossary following these seven chapters is a great aid) and helping the everyday reader to understand the who, what, when, where and how of violence.  He goes on to discuss what are the precursors to human violence, how we can detect these precursors, and in many cases, off-set the potential for violence before the relating turns problematic.  Miller further discusses and demonstrates practical, `hands-on' tactics when the circumstance deteriorates into expressed physical actions.  He continues with how best to proceed in such a way that our actions remain within the legal course of our bureaucratic due-process.  Finally, Miller concisely delivers the matter-of-fact cost--the price--of human violence and how we can prevail, but are forever changed as a person from being immersed in human violence.

 I'm glad I did

 I love the writing, although it does veer off a bit from our 'heroes' to a touch of 'I feel everything and hear everything from my soulmate' -- annoyance


 Some of it to me is a bit of disbelief, but the author is still good at what she does.The one reason I tried her book, is because she had read J.R


Ward's BDB series
 So have I and am a BIG fan of the WARDen
 So how can a kindred reader of these fantasy heroic/erotic vampires turn down a book by an author who loves them enough to work her own heroic magic? They can't

 I am looking forward to the Forged Series and the next book

I will agree that she ended her book a bit abruptly, almost like one of the 'Summer Season' series hits

It suddenly goes on Hiatus and you have to wait till next season
 That is the only way I can describe it


Left with a cliff hanger until Fall Season begins

:)I do hope Trish keeps up the rocking suspense, the hard-ass heroes and bad guys
 I hope she does more delving into the SEAL structure, because I do like that side of things as well
 Don't just slap them with the big LOVE sign in five minutes, because that gets old

However I think anyone having digestive problems would benefit from reading this, as it outlines many useful tips for healing the gut and digestive system in general.The author makes a very valid point about commercially available gluten free foods

Not everything labeled "gluten free" is healthy


Find out reasons you should treat these foods with caution

There are many recipes provided in the book for healthy gluten free foods you can eat instead.As a health therapist myself, I particularly enjoyed the section on leaky gut and the recipe provided that can help to cure this very common, but little known health issue

I shall be preparing this for my family.Thank you Ms Matthews for a very useful resource.

$review_text.: Carlton Mellick III has been hailed as one of the brightest, bizarrest talents in the field of weird lit
His latest collection, FANTASTIC ORGY, is a fine example of his strengths, five stories that blend visceral thrills, erotica, social satire, and vicious wit into a thoroughly unique vision.In the title story, the collection's centerpiece, mutants meet at an exclusive swingers' club to trade fashionable, functional STDs (I'll not spoil the fun in discovering just what that entails) until a strain of violent, unpredictable disease turns the revelry into a fight for survival

Like a fever-dream remake of Cronenberg's THEY CAME FROM WITHIN, this longer tale is worth the price of admission alone.The other stories are no less impressive
Featuring a body-building douchebag with a lollipop head (and a taste for fine cheese), a bio-engineered cat made of ears, a porn-film cast adrift in a very strange ocean, and shark sex--lots of shark sex--Mellick serves up oddity after oddity without sacrificing story or character.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I don't know why it took me so long to read this book.  It's just over 200 pages and the font isn't small.  Perhaps it's because I'm scared of its content!I had heard of this book because Steven Furtick came to our church as a guest speaker.  He preached a sermon called "Sun Stand Still" and everyone was amazed by the message.  It was very memorable and I remember saving the podcast in iTunes and re-listening to it occasionally.  When this book came out, I knew I'd love to read it.  But it sure has some tough stuff in it!Furtick challenges us to have "audacious faith" - to believe God is actually who he says he is.  So often we pray weak prayers (ie "Lord, help me get through the day").  God is all powerful and he created the entire universe and he has perfect love for us.  With this in mind, shouldn't we believe on him for more than just getting us through the day?Furtick points us to the story in Joshua 10 where God promised Joshua victory over the enemy he was fighting.  Everything was going as planned until nighttime arrived and it started to get dark.  The battle was not yet won, and if Joshua didn't destroy the enemy now, they would escape.  Joshua showed audacious faith by making a radical request of God - to stop the sun from setting in the sky so that he would have light to see and continue battle until its completion.  Through the book, Furtick refers to this as a "Sun Stand Still" prayer.This book challenges us to search our lives and be willing to ask God to do the impossible.  This definitely requires audacious faith!A relatively short book, but filled with mind blowing statements!  Just like I listened to Furtick's sermon several times, this book will definitely be up for a re-read soon.I received this book free from Multnomah Books as part of their book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

$REVIEW.: Think: Why You Should Question Everything by Guy P


Harrison"Think" is a fantastic and inspirational book that will teach readers how to think like scientists


 Question everything, embrace doubt is a recurring theme that accomplished author, historian, anthropologist Guy P


Harrison drives home with mastery and clarity

 This is an entertaining and illuminating book that will empower you to avoid common pitfalls of bad thinking in a constructive way

 This enlightening 300-page book includes the following five chapters:  1
Standing Tall on a Fantasy-prone Planet, 2

Pay a Visit to the Strange Thing That Lives Inside Your Head, 3


A Thinker's Guide to Unusual Claims and Weird Beliefs, 4

The Proper Care and Feeding of a Thinking Machine, and 5
So Little to Lose and a Universe to Gain.Positives:1
Beautifully written and researched book


 Harrison has a passion for his topic that is palpable and admirable


 A master at conveying clear and inspirational thoughts grounded in good science and sound thinking.2

Skepticism is a great topic
 This book is enlightening and fun to read.3
Harrison always delivers!  Quality critical thinking goes in before his books come out

 He has earned my trust as an author that will consistently deliver a book worthy of my time and interest.4


Drives home the need for skepticism

 "Skepticism is an important issue for everyone


It's something we all need, regardless of intelligence, education, location, social status, or income."5

This is a thought-provoking book and a quote fest, "Skepticism is just about having a healthy dose of doubt and using reason to figure out what is probably real from what is probably not real


It means not believing you know something before you can prove it or at least make a very good case for it


Skepticism is nothing more than thinking and withholding belief until enough evidence has been presented."6


Harrison has a unique gift of giving intellectual beat downs in the nicest and most constructive ways


 "Millions of people say that paranormal mind powers can move objects

Big deal; people can say anything


Let's wait until someone gets around to proving it before we get excited
In the meantime, why not check out how nature moves entire continents? It's called plate tectonics and scientists have plenty of evidence for it."7


In defense of good science
 "Science is best thought of as a tool

And, like most tools, it can be used to do something constructive or to whack somebody over the head


Science is a great way of thinking and discovering that helps us figure out much about the world and the universe."8

Debunking common misconceptions
"Being smart, whatever that word means to you, doesn't automatically make someone a good skeptic."9
Understanding the right approach to skepticism and it may involve just asking the right questions

"If believers refuse to think critically about their claims, then call them on it


Why are you reluctant to challenge a claim that you say is so important and obviously true? What are you afraid of?"10
The value of being a good skeptic

 "Weak skepticism is perhaps the greatest unrecognized global crisis of all

Every day, people waste time, throw away money, suffer, and even die because they failed to think like a scientist."11


A great discussion on brain science and how it relates to skepticism
 "The good news for you is that just being aware of how your brain goes about its business greatly improves your chances of keeping both feet planted in reality."  A bonus quote, "We don't really see what we look at


Instead our brain tells us what we see, and it doesn't give us the complete and accurate picture." Great stuff!12

One of the great strengths of this wonderful book: reasons to be skeptical

 Harrison goes through a long list of reasons to be skeptical in an accessible and intelligible manner.13
Sound scientific principles
"The best we can do is accept conclusions that are backed up by the best evidence we have today and agree to change our minds if better evidence ever comes along that says something different tomorrow."14

Great examples of common biases/fallacies and how to recognize them
 Base-rate fallacy


"We can readily find ourselves focusing on one tiny speck of information (a single story, for example) or on bad data that supports a claim while simultaneously ignoring more credible information or a larger body of data that goes against it."15
Provides MANY great examples of bad claims
 "The basic claim of homeopathic medicine is that water can "remember" an active ingredient in the original brew and that--contrary to logic--the more you dilute the solution, the more potent it becomes for treating diseases


Most homeopathic remedies are diluted to such extremes that there is nothing left of the original active ingredient!" "Complementary or alternative medicine is really just unproven medicine."16

Find out Harrison's favorite end-time scenario.17


Addressing the so called Moon-hoax, "The late Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, summed it up nicely: "It would have been harder to fake it than to do it."18


Good overall health, including brain health
"There is just something about flipping back and forth between languages that keeps a brain sharp and healthy

It even seems to delay for years the onset of Alzheimer's disease in elderly people."19


The hard cold facts, "humankind currently spends hundreds of billions of dollars per year on fortunetellers, medical quackery, and other nonsense."20
A sense of awe
"By the way, if your life ever seems too slow, just remember that the Earth is spinning at the equator at a rate of about a thousand miles per hour
We are also flying through space around the Sun at speeds of more than 65,000 miles per hour."21


Excellent notes, Bibliography and even a section called Resources to Keep Learning.Negatives:1


There is very little in this excellent book to complain about other than the feeling I get that Harrison wanted to go deeper into some of the topics and decided to go for quality and brevity over a more comprehensive approach.2


On such an ambitious and broad topic like thinking and skepticism you can certainly question everything but it's too hard to cover everything
 That is, some topics were left out:  911 conspiracy, Holocaust deniers, etc..


understandably so.In summary, what a wonderful and inspirational book this turned out to be


 Skepticism is a fantastic topic that has real value for the individual and society

 Harrison succeeds in showing how to put good thinking into practice by applying it to a number of fascinating and popular paranormal claims


 But what set this book apart from most is the youthful glee for knowledge and the quest for wisdom


 "I love knowing that I'll never run out of things to learn and experience." My sentiments exactly!  You owe it to yourself to be a good skeptic, get this book and learn how.Further recommendations: "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True" and "50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God" by the same author, "Critical Thinking" by Wayne Bartz, "An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist" and "The Magic of Reality" by Richard Dawkins, "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark" by Carl Sagan, "This Explains Everything: Deep, Beautiful, and Elegant Theories of How the World Works" edited by John Brockman, "Nonsense: A Handbook of Logical Fallacies" by Robert J

$review_text.: This is actually the first M Todd Gallowglas book I purchased.  The title grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Then I found out it was the 2nd of the series, so I started with First Chosen instead.  I'm very glad I read them in order.Once We Were Like Wolves picks up where First Chosen leaves us.  Julianna has come out of all the conflicts victorious enough to satisfy the reader, but there are many realistic things she did not conquer, and her very existence has changed.  We go through all the emotions with her as she tries to decide if the gods sticking their noses into human business is a good thing or something heinous.  We meet new characters in Wynd, Korrin, Nathan, Aurell, and Allister.  We meet the Stormcrows.  We see more of how the society of the world is structured in the order of precedence of nobility and common folk, the conquerors and the indigenous people of the land.  And we learn more about the gods, the system of magic, and the priestly orders.But, like First Chosen, we have fight scenes that further the story, characters meeting and battling their suspicions while good fights against evil, Julianna learning to be a leader, machinations on both the celestial and mortal planes, and the new edition has very few typos.  To me, Wolves feels more fast-paced than First Chosen, and it feels like there is even deeper character development, and again it stands up really well to re-reading.One of the things I really like about Once We Were Like Wolves is that the bad guys are well-rounded and feel like real people.  They have their tender moments, their worries, their ambitions.  We can almost see why they chose the path they did.  I really hate one-dimensional villains, so these villains are refreshing.Overall, I like Once We Were Like Wolves better even than First Chosen, but Arms of the Storm is still my favorite of the series (so far).

$review_text.: Lovely and hot romantic BDSM; this book surprised with the high quality of the writing and a sense of realism. The heroine has very normal reactions and interactions to the situation as it unfolds. She's not just submissive, she's also afraid and freaked out by what is happening. The hero, likewise, isn't an all-seeing perfect dom, he makes mistakes and he is honestly sorry for them. My favorite human moment is his muttering, "spoilsport," when she refuses his erotic suggestion during an argument.Plot and style-wise, this is similar to the work of Cherise Sinclair, who writes fabulous BSDM romantic novels with excellent plots. Cherise, however, tends to a slightly glossy vision of BSDM where doms are always doms and subs are always subs (but bratty) and the locations are nice and never seedy. "Dom of My Dreams" is far more real. "Dom of My Dreams" is also light as far as BDSM; it is primarily D/S with light bondage, but still very hard core for erotica.I can't wait to see more from this author. This was a truly delicious read.

$review_text.: I loved this book. It was different from most zombies. These zombies were like jaws. These zombies don't just roam around in the streets. They hide in houses. They wait. If they hear a noise they will swarm. If they bite you and you get away they will follow from your blood loss. If you shoot a new zombie and if it still bleeds the zombies will eat them. If u die from a gun shot they still eat the corpses.  But when ur out you better be very quiet or they will hear you.But it was a good story about jed his brother martin and clintian. They save two people from a helocopter but I won't say anymore about them. But jed and martin have bad blood. But depend on each other for help until jed will kill martin for a reason. The two from the plane crash has a secret that will get them killed or save the survivors. Read and find out.It has gore and bloodie details and the author descibes it very will.

I appreciated the author's pace and how it was applied to Kurt's decision to embrace his sexual orientation
It made the acceptance more believable

I was struck by the first sex scene though, since I wasn't expecting either of them to act that way


I truly enjoyed the characters, main and secondary

Kurt's family was hilarious and Simon was very understanding and accepting

$review_text.: This was one of the oddest books I've ever read. The premise is amusing, as you can see by the title. I don't believe in ghosts or anything of that nature, but you don't have to in order to enjoy the story. The dialogue was wry and interesting and the characters were drawn out very well.Unfortunately, the book could have been much better, had it been half the length. There is a huge overload of descriptive text that completely drowns the story. I almost gave up on the book but ended up skimming pages instead. Lowenstein can write, that's for sure, but perhaps needs some editing help.

$REVIEW.: Known as The Shadow, Sir Calan Beaumont came to Graywall to find smugglers.  He had to be very careful no one knew his other identity.  While watching for smugglers, Calan heard a conversation about a kidnapping.  His first thought was the nobles daughter, Genevieve.  Sir Calan knew he must protect her at all costs.  After approaching the castle, he found out his childhood friend Elsbeth was living there as well.  Elsbeth  was a friendly person who helped serve the village and castle.  She was content with the knowledge she would never marry.  Sir Calan sent her thoughts in the other direction though.The story is a good one and you'll enjoy the mystery and intrigue this book offers.  A little light on the romance, but that's okay. When it does have a romantic moment it's sweet and special.  I recommend this book for everyone. You'll enjoy the refreshing approach Ms Park takes.  For a debut novel, this one ranks right up there.I found only one issue.  It takes awhile to build up to the conflict and then ends quickly. Up to that point, it's a little slow in parts.When all is said and done, I gave this one 5 out of 5 cheers. Great debut Elsie Park!!~Copy of book provided by author in exchange for a fair review~

Reiss you have a lifetime fan in me! I devoured these 3 novellas in one day and was left aching for more. I am not always a huge fan of novellas which is probably why I hadn&#8217;t read these yet but WOW, I do not remember the last time I was in so much lust over a man ! These novellas are refreshingly well written and so easy to get lost into.Monica Faulkner is just what I like in a heroine; strong when you need her to be yet still vulnerable. I feel like I saw her come into herself in these stories and felt a true connection to her. Watching her fight her inner desire to be submissive to Johnathan was great because I think that is how many of us would be if faced with that situation. Just because your heart and body want something does not mean that your brain always understands.Johnathan Drazen has what us romantic dirty girls want; a good heart and a filthy mouth. I loved ever second I spent with him and I am dying for more. The man oozes sex appeal and knows just how to talk to a woman to get her panties wet. The rich hotelier is a role that has been done a million times but for some reason Johnathan felt fresh and new to me. I loved the way he commanded Monica without demeaning her. They just fit and I was rooting for them even when they were at their worst!I honestly have absolutely nothing bad to say about this box set! Amazingly well written and literally pulls you in from the very first moment. You will not regret this purchase!

$review_text.: This book takes the political teachings of Machiavelli and gives lessons for today's CIO on how to survive and thrive

It paints a picture of three dichotomies that the CIO leader must navigate through and compares them to dark and light side animals that embody each concept
 They include  Power (lion vs lamb), Manipulation (snake vs dove), and warfare (shark vs dolphin)
The dichotomies have a Myers Briggs type self evaluation to determine your natural bent on each


The book advocates a mixed situational approach that it calls a wolf tactic that uses a blended combination of all the dichotomies for optimal results

 It then discusses building your power base by grooming a wolf pack of followers who can build the political influence
The book advocates a level of manipulation and non-transparency that will be uncomfortable for many
Definitely embraces the Machiavellian principles espoused by others such as in Robert Greene's &#34;48 Laws of Power&#34;.

$review_text.: Dr Kelly had come to this conclusion during his examination of Nazi leader Hermann Goring before the Nuremburg trials


 A number of pre-eminent Nazi leaders were tried with crimes against humanity in one of the first international tribunes of its kind

 War had always meant death for endless civilians, but the Nazi government had set aside a priority for murdering and obliterating whole populations of Jews, Gypsies, and "defectives"


 The killing camps had been liberated and the horror had demanded an explanation.This book concerns in large part the interaction of a self ordained man of fate, Kelly, with the notorious Goring, who viewed himself in the same light


 The enmeshment of clinician and patient reveals a catastrophic inability for either to self evaluate the "rightness" of the chosen path
 The aftermath has left unanswered whether the Nazi leaders were psychopaths of uncommon evil or men who ceded to unprecedented power
 The characterisations are dimensional and instructive, but I think the narrative could be more clearly mapped.There are some scenes that exactly capture the task of those who would make sense of the war
 One day without fanfare, the prosecution filmed the now famous scenes of raw brutality and horror found by the liberators of the Nazi concentration camps
 Emaciated and tortured faces peer at the camera and piles of naked bodies mound throughout the background
 Goring had planned his trial as a showcase for the glory and the power of the Nazi undertaking

 After this film he noted, "It was such a good afernoon, too, until they showed that film


 They were reading my telephone conversations on the Austrian affair and everyone was laughing with me
 And then they showed that awful film, and it just spoiled everything."  That paragraph casts Goring firmly in the psychopathic category, but is he then a monster?  This book does not know


 History, if anything, has not delivered a verdict in subsequent massacres.We long for the word that tells us that we would never be a Nazi
 Kelly's verdict was to urge his "countryman to refuse to vote for any candidate who made political capital of any group's race and religious beliefs or referred indirectly or directly to the blood, heritage, or MORALS of opponents."  I am afraid this is the only answer we get
 Perhaps the book's most brilliant achievement is the lack of an answer


 Diligence remains our task.

Alister (the man of the curse) kept me going for 100 minutes on the elliptical, and I was still sore, 3 days later.This is a very readable, suspenseful, riveting novel with redeeming social value and literary themes. The prose is good, especially for an ebook and for this genre (I prefer literary; Joyce Carol Oates, Ann Hite, Rod Usher, not Stephen King). I highlighted line after line on the subject of death and God, thinking "I LOVE THIS" - especially scenes with young Alister in the hospital, disillusioned that his mom's prayers do nothing to keep Grandma alive. I love the cerebral and philosophical passages more than anything.Rommel does a great job of pulling us in the mind of the mental patient. At times it's unclear who's saying what in the dialogue, and some scenes seem to be dead ends or red herrings. An early chapter makes it appear the director is motivated to maintain the image of Alister as the harbinger of death to all who dare speak to him, but another chapter suggests the deaths are a figment of Arthur's crazed imagination, and I kept turning pages to find out what was really going on, but by the novel's end, I still wasn't sure.I'm reminded of cerebral movies like Shutter Island, A Beautiful Mind, Inception, even The Tourist (a fluff piece, so I hate to include it). I like literary surprises, but I hate being misled. I'm told Stephen King pulls these little literary shenanigans, and smarter readers than I must come away feeling really smug about figuring out the novel. Ha. I went so far as contacting the author, who very kindly and patiently emailed me what really happens in the novel. He cited in his defense the famed Brown and King Self Editing Your Fiction "bible" (all those e-novelists guilty of awful prose should be required to read this enduring and oft-quoted writing guide). Brown and King advise novelists not to explain too much, but trust the reader to have enough of an IQ to figure out what's going on. Ha! If I have to re-read a book three times to get it, the author is a sadist, or I'm even more obtuse than I thought. Keith, are you listening? You snared me with a book I couldn't put down, and as if the consequence of aching muscles for 3 days afterward wasn't bad enough, the novel is still on my mind a week later, and wintergreen oil won't help my exhausted brain.Set a timer if you read while working out on an elliptical or treadmill or bike. Why don't we ever feel the pain while we're sweating it out? No, not until we've gloated over our time exercising do we suddenly suffer the consequences with aches and pains that make us never want to work out again.This novel is said to be based on a true story. Kitty interviewed Keith at GreatMinds Literary Community, and Alister did indeed spring from a person in real life, but that person didn't carry the mystique of death that Alister does.The Cursed Man kept me thinking and turning pages, even if it didn't seem to resolve in a way that made sense (to others it may; to me, it didn't). It's rare that I start a book and don't put it down until I've finished reading it. THAT is great writing!

$REVIEW.: I have been eagerly anticipating the second book in this series, as I am sure many of you have.  Based on the author's website this book took longer for her to write than intended, so please let me say that the wait was more than worth it.  This book outshines the first one by miles...Mrs. Kace did an amazing job with this story and I enjoyed every second of it.  If you have not read the first book I would highly recommend this series as you will not be disappointed.  I cannot wait for the third book in this series to come out and based on what we were given in this book I know that no matter how long it takes for the third book to be released it will be more than worth the wait.  Thank you for such an enjoyable story and for the way you pulled me into the characters lives....

$REVIEW.: I have sat through countless messages by numerous speakers, ranging from all sorts of subjects.  Some of the time they are easily forgettable (the brain can only process so much at once, while the rest gets filtered out).  Yet on many other occasions I can look back and articulate everything that was spoken to me.  Why?  Well, because for most of those instances, the speaker stuck to a single point and expounded on it to the point where it would never leave you.  In this book, Stanley's one point method is brought to the table, primarily for preaching, but it can apply to many areas of public speech, especially when the speaker wants something important to remain with his audience.The book is broken into two halves, with one being primarily a fictional narrative between a preacher and a truck driver, all the while teaching the practicality of the one point method in mind.  The second half breaks down into what was discussed in the first half through greater detail.  I don't know why, but whenever the retired truck driver spoke, Sam Elliott's voice came to mind.I can see where some might get a little hung up on this idea.  Especially people who preach for a living.  In my opinion, this seems like it would work out better for those who do topical messages or series rather than expository preaching, but the principles that it contains can be extremely helpful for both.  I can understand the push back, but he does make his case for the why and answers the objections he typically gets pretty well.Preaching here is seen in the same way as taking someone on a journey.  This layout gives a number of helpful guidelines in the process.-Determine your goal:  what do you want to accomplish and where do you want your listeners to end up.-Pick a point:  One point in which the rest of the message will revolve around.-Create a Map:  The "Me We God You We" approach to getting the hearer on the same page as you.-Internalize the message: He stresses that the message you preach is really not yours unless you can speak it out without glaring at your notes.  He sees preaching as more of a one way conversation or the sharing of a story between the speaker and hearer, rather than a lecture.-Engage your audience:  This is the means of keeping the attention of your audience.  Simply speaking like you're reading a book will lose your hearer very quickly.-Find your voice:  Watching and studying how you preach can help you focus more on simply being yourself when you get in front of people, rather than creating a persona that is different than who you are.  This will show your authenticity and humanity to others.-Start all over:  There is not much worse than getting stuck in a message or the preparation thereof.  So these tools offered can help you get out of the mud.  Ask questions like:What do they need to know?  InformationWhy do they need to know it?  MotivationWhat do they need to do?  ApplicationWhy do they need to do it?  InspirationHow can I help them remember?  ReiterationOverall, I think this book offers some invaluable wisdom for public speaking, but I would not leave this as your only resource.  I was told that if you were to only read two books on this subject, this would be one and the other would be "The Supremacy of God in Preaching" by John Piper.

$review_text.: I was excited to read this book after seeing the reviews giants like Ambler and Alan Furst gave it.  I don't really think McCarry is on their level, but this is still a fun read.  The title is literal -- that is, the book is not a single narrative, but presented as a dossier of various documents and accounts that have been compiled after the fact for presentation to a investigating committee.McCarry's world is almost entirely inhabited by professional spies, which is one obvious way it differs from an Ambler or Furst novel -- it's not about a "regular guy" who gets caught up in espionage, or even the recruitment of someone into a secret service for the first time.  I found this made it somewhat more difficult to really empathize with the characters, who seem to have limited personalities, with a couple of exceptions.  McCarry's female characters also struck me as a bit clich&eacute;d.I left the book feeling that the first half promised a lot more than the second half delivered.  As the story goes on, McCarry somewhat lazily relies more and more on long "diary excerpts" and "reports" to tell the story, rather than the short individual documents more common at the beginning.  He also sticks a letter from Christopher's (the main CIA-agent protagonist) boss at HQ in at the very end to tidy up a bunch of details at once, which contributes to a sense that he didn't really know how to end the novel.  And indeed, there is no well-defined ending; the reader is left to decide which version of events he believes.  I'm sure this was supposed to be thought-provoking, but I was left with the sense that the author just didn't feel like having to nail down what had happened.It's always a bit silly, perhaps, to point out things in spy novels that are "implausible," but I did feel like the genesis of the mission itself could have used a bit more explanation.  It seemed like all the characters were suddenly in a Cadillac headed to Sudan within a couple of pages of the idea first being floated out of nowhere.Finally, a technical note -- the 2007 paperback version is very sloppily done, with a number of obvious typos, misspellings, and printing errors.  I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $12, given that my copy came with a bookstore remainder mark on it.  Would recommend getting another version.

$REVIEW.: I'd actually give this 4.5 stars but Zon won't let me.I love a strong, stubborn hero and Joanne Wadsworth's Archie MacDonald doesn't disappoint. Archie is determined to obtain the release of his chieftain, Angus MacDonald, from the clutches of his sworn enemy, Lachlan MacLean. Lachlan wants land his father frittered away returned to his clan at any cost, and is raiding and marauding to get what he wants. Archie is set on defeating and destroying Lachlan, regardless of the consequences.But Archie meets his match in Marie MacLean, a descendant of the first match between Clan MacDonald and Clan MacLean. After the death of their mother, Marie and her twin sister, Katherine, journeyed to Dunyvaig Castle in present day Scotland to return a 400 year old amulet. Things start to get weird when they wish for adventure while standing in a fairie circle, and suddenly, Marie finds herself whisked back in time. Archie believes she is a fairie sent to help him conquer his enemy. But the very act of obtaining his goal will end Marie's existence. She has to convince Archie there is a better way.It becomes a race against time and scheming highlanders when Lachlan captures Marie and her ancestor, Mary MacLean. Mary is Lachlan's sister, but she is also married to Angus MacDonald, a marriage meant to unify the two clans. Archie races to the rescue, not once, but twice, finally capturing his prize and rescuing Marie.This was a very satisfying read. It had everything I look for in a romance novel--intrigue, danger, the wilds of Scotland, a hunky hero, a spunky, bold heroine and time travel. This was the second book in the series, but I didn't feel like I'd missed anything because I hadn't read the first book (which is now waiting to be read on my Kindle). Joanne Wadsworth has a true gift for bringing a story to life.

$review_text.: This author, James Gawley, can write!  Obviously drawing from his educational background and love of the subject matter, Mr
Gawley seems to have thought long and hard on his story before he put the proverbial "pen to paper" and a very good effort it is!  His character, Primus Seneca, a member of the "Dead Men", a Roman Legion is more or less relating his own life
 Primus tell us of the unforgiving life as a Legionnaire.....and his personal struggle with some internal issues.Well written and researched (although I had one moment of "eye-brow raising" - he refers in a couple instances of "blood tasting like a penny" and another reference, I believe in placing "pennies on the eyes of the dead") - would the word "penny" be correct (seems more like a later time date term)?  Would "copper coin" have been more period.....have to excuse my ignorance on this as from Latin, I do not remember the word "penny"?Started a bit slow for me, but the action scenes were good and seemed to be very relevant....described as well as some Bernard Cornwell descriptions of battles, etc.I want more of this story and really do hope that James Gawley continues on with his effort
 129 pages is way too short and I would like to see if he can sustain a 'Series' with this character (Primus) and the story-line!Looking forward to it.....!

$REVIEW.: This was not a fast read for me

I have been working on it and savoring it


Being unfamiliar with many of the locales, this meant a bit of research while I read so I could get a feel for where as well as why

Spanning different countries and cultures as well as decades, I found myself immersed in a world of governments, spies and natives all vying for power, control and/or freedoms.Men using weapons as accoutrements, women's lives in the hands of male family members and nuclear weapons the scariest back up plan for the struggle to live, I found the brutal honesty of how far the 'poor' and the major powers are willing to go quite the eye opener


Finding threats in all sorts of small, out of the way places and the diligence to keep at it for so many years was a wonderment of dedication

The Spymaster faces constant threats from every direction
The life he lives semi-outside of his work is just as intriguing, with him navigating friends, middle age and matchmaking
It wasn't all serious, there was subtle humor interspersed along the way, proving that everyone involved is still human

How he tries to see all sides before leaping to conclusions both in and out of work shows him to be the epitome of diplomacy.One of many favorite quotes:&#34;The actors in this drama may not be aware that their actions do threaten us, so it would be inaccurate to call them our enemies,&#34; replies Wang.

However, she highlights where some of the differences can occur and gives suggestions on things to watch for.She has a straightforward approach and, having raised two sons and a daughter, I certainly like that she tries to warn about raising boys in the stereotypical manner and instilling equal respect for men and women. Also, she does not advocate pushing boys into sports, just because they are boys, but being aware of where their strengths lie be that physical or scholastic - or even other. Bravo!

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed all the entries as they all were amusing and some were downright funny as in laugh-out-loud funny. The four star rating instead of the five is strictly because of level of writing. Ms Dougherty's prose still felt a bit like a blog -which all of the entries came from. Am I being nit-picky? I don't believe so. I am hoping that she continues to write and increase her skills while maintaining her wonderful sense of humor.  There is a bit of language in the book bitch is the only word that comes to mind but there are a few more tossed in - not larded with them but they are there.  Ms. Dougherty simply takes a fun skewed look at quilting and quilters and juxtaposes those thoughts with ideas from something entirely different (Sex ed. in one) for a delightful fun read.Hope this helps.

$REVIEW.: This was a great little story
I truly connected with the characters and felt like I wanted to know them in real life

Ford and Poppy &#8230; love those names!At first, while reading, I thought some of the dialogue was redundant

The character would think it then say it

But I think it improved over the course of the story or I got used to it

It didn't distract me too much because the story was just too good.With alternating POV's Poppy and Ford told their stories and it was done so well


The story covered a couple of sad and tough subjects to deal with and the author did a great job

I experienced it all with the characters.I would recommend this book for anyone that enjoys romances, football, and a great little story.

Neverland was well-imagined and the secondary characters were interesting.  The story provides a tragic history to illustrate why Peter and Hook are the way they are and why they never grow old.  Angel is caught in this world after an accident in her own world and while she wants to go home, there is plenty that is appealing in Neverland, especially Jamie Hook.  The story has a major cliff hanger but the ending is satisfying in its own right and I usually hate cliff hangers!  I look forward to the next book.

$REVIEW.: This book was such a fun read. I so enjoyed this it so much.  It may have been a short one but it was worth reading.  I haven't laughed as much reading a book as I have this one.  I Couldn't put the book down once I started reading it until I finished it.  It is one I will read over and over.  I loved Annalee and Boone.  When I think about them I will smile or laugh.  This is the first book I have read by this author,  I can't wait to see what other books she has written. I HIGHLY recommend this book!

$REVIEW.: I've read a ton of Kindle books, looking for real answers, and this book delivers them. I've had a certain amount with success with my published fictional Christmas Kindle books, but have struggled with the decision about what to release next (some non-fiction titles). I have a ton of writing done in one niche market, but didn't have the confidence I needed to move ahead with the books. I believed that the topics I will cover wouldn't be financially viable.Oh boy... was I wrong. I was so, so, so wrong. My readers have been telling me what they want from me for years, but I just didn't have the confidence I needed to believe that they were right.I guess I needed proof.Steve's thorough research guidance showed me that I should go ahead and release books in the area that I am drawn to. My only regret is that I didn't discover this book until today.Thanks, Steve. My hat's off to you.

$REVIEW.: I finally had to stop reading this drivel after about halfway through. While I do not believe the Democratic party has clean hands, neither do I believe just about any of the crud these two idiots have come up with.I just got down watching one of the authors, McCain, on C-Span's BookTV and the guy comes off as a raving lunatic.Back to the book, one of the most insidious devices these and other rightwing nutjobs use is taking a story and TELLING YOU what it means. Those who want to believe it means what they are told it means will do so, the intelligent reader however will see through this manipulation of both emotions and logic.So I did some online researching of the "meticulous" footnotes and "proof" and pretty much all of it dried up and blew away in the wind.Something else these two morons do is equate the party that existed 50, 100, or more years ago with today's party. When I hear them proclaim the party of Lincoln I just want to puke. Lincoln would disavow these guys in less than 3 seconds. The Republican party of Lincoln has absolutely nothing in common with today's Republican party.So like I said, if you want fiction passing itself off as truth in order to justify your hatred of democrats, or in support of  your worldview, (Truthiness so to speak),then this is the book for you.IF on the other hand you want a book that tells the truth irrespective of where the chips may fall, then this book is worth nothing more than using to start your fireplace with.Total garbage.

$REVIEW.: Another great sequel, this installment has a great storyline and holds you captive from beginning to end.  There's lots of action, intrigue, and of course romance.  The characters are strong and full of depth as they struggle to make right what went so very wrong.  The story starts in the last book, but can still be read as a standalone.  I love how Eliana does whatever she has to in order to take care of her people and how utterly dedicated Demetrius is to her.  Their journey together is a powerful and emotional one that takes you through the range of emotions with nail biting suspense as things only heat up once they get started.  The overall storyline for the series also only gets better, so I can't wait to see what book 4 holds in store!Yet another very exciting chapter in the Night Prowler series that will have you on the edge of your seat, Rapture's Edge will leave you clamoring for more!**I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**

$review_text.: I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.Deborah Ann is an amazing author and this book blew me away just as her other ones have


This book was a contemporary romance which was different then her paranormal romance series, which is the first books I have read by her
This book was just as good as her other ones

Her style of writing is so unique that it sucks you in and makes you think the characters are friends you have known all your life


This has caused me to shake my nook in frustration and yelling at the characters that has caused my friends to question my sanity.This book is focused on Grayson Dane and Elliana Brandt


Grayson is a wealthy CEO that is used to getting everything he wants so when he meets Elli and she wants nothing to do with him he becomes intrigued and wont take no for an answer
This leads to a tragic accident that leaves one of Graysons closest friends to be killed and Elliana thinking she is his wife after losing her memory


Grayson plays along not wanting to let her go because he knows there is something special about her


This causes a countdown to begin in your head since you know eventually something will happen, she will remember and it will be painful


But before all this happens you get to see the kind of "wedded bliss" they get to experience


They fall in love which just makes it that much more painful when it all comes to a head

A good part of this book is seeing Elli's and Grayson's fake marriage grow into a true love
There are many problems that arise during this novel and some parts where you truly don't know how this story is going to end which makes this a suspenseful novel filled with romance that will have anyone wishing for a love like theirs.One of the few reasons I didn't give this novel five stars is because it dragged a little to long

There were some unnecessary scenes in the end that could have been removed to make the novel end more smoothly and wrap up most of the novel while still preparing for the next one
All in all though I loved this book and can't wait for the next one.

$review_text.: A good, detailed guide to making my most favorite bread!  I went through it then forwarded a copy to my mother's Kindle (she has recently gotten into bread making as well).  My edition, however, had some very strange formatting issues... huge white blocks (I use the sepia color setting) and missing hyperlink icons dotting the recipe section, makimg it distracting to the eye. And truthfully,  devoting 25% of the book to sourdough history seems just a tad bit too much filler.  Less fluff, more bread, so to speak.-----I regularly review eBooklets but do not allow the asking price of each eBooklet to influence my final review and rating, concerning myself with ONLY the content and format as compared to similar offerings, allowing the potential consumer decide if the price is worth the usually *very* short page length.

$REVIEW.: Shay grew up with her two best friends. It is apparent from the beginning that they both vie for Shay's attention.  As time goes by, Shay's twin sister commits suicide. She never really deals with the loss of her sister. Instead she starts to dream. She creates Gabriel, who excites her sexually and her inquisitive side. With a mental block on her drawing she follows Gabriel into a world of horror. She draws a comic based on her journey and lands the job of her dreams. Her best friend Aiden leaves her yet again and Eli wants to move to the next level.  I loved this story. Bella has created a story that is a page turner and leaves you wanting more. I look forward to the next book and continue on Shay's nightmare.

$REVIEW.: Sue Townsend's great success in creating the character of Adrian Mole has been to come up with a boy (and eventually, a man) who--despite having gone through the normal trials of growing up, falling in and out of love, fatherhood, divorce, and so on--never, ever really &quot;gets it.&quot;  Adrian Mole is truly extraordinary in terms of his near-genius talent for cluelessness while still remaining remarkably sympathetic


 The reader has a relieved sense of &quot;That could have been me&quot; through much of &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappucino Years.&quot;  Adrian has grown into a 30-year old man who is divorced and has a humiliating job as a chef and host of a cooking show by the hilarious title of &quot;Offally Good!&quot;  He doesn't understand (or particularly want to understand) his young son William, and he remains appalled at his bad fortune to be born into a family he considers to be beneath him

 Adrian is, full on and fully realized, the person any of us could be if we'd stubbornly refused to learn from any of our mistakes.

$review_text.: "Feed Your Skin Starve Your Wrinkles" is a great book for everything you need to know about the care and maintenance of your skin. Sadly, most of us don't start paying attention to our skin until it starts showing signs of ageing, and the sooner we start taking care of this most visible part of our bodies, the better, and this book is a good place to begin, starting from the inside out, with what we eat, and knowing how it affects how we look. There is much more here though, and subjects like acne, different types of skin, rosacea, etc. are covered.The last 100 pages are devoted to terrific recipes, with a nutrition analysis as well as caloric content. From fresh snack mix to luscious soups (including a chilled cantaloupe soup to die for on a hot Summer day!) to salads, entrees, and beverages.  Among Allison Tannis' many credentials, she is a registered holistic nutritionist, and "knows her onions" when it comes to what we eat and what different foods do to us. She also knows how to write well and transmit this information clearly."Feed Your Skin Starve Your Wrinkles" is beautifully illustrated, and its thick pages are a visual pleasure to peruse. This is an excellent addition to your cookbook or nutrition library, and its unique recipes should delight you for years to come.

 She is an unconventional girl, living a solitary life in a mans world (she is a mechanic with an obsession for restoring old cars)


 Just when she thinks her life couldn't get any more boring a man walks into the garage and spins her life into a whole other direction.Jonah is a fighter, literally and figuratively


 He has been fighting his whole life for one thing or another
 He is also a dog when it comes to women
 He is the hit it and quit it type, never going back to the same women twice


When &#34;Ray&#34; is recommended to help him restore his old Impala, little does he know he is about to come face to face with a woman who will change everything.I really enjoyed this one and I was hooked from the heartbreaking prologue

 Yes there are some themes that I know others don't like, insta-love and the heroine is a virgin but hey....that's why we read romance novels right?  To escape...The story is solid and sucks you in, I read it almost all in one sitting, didn't want to put it down
 It lags a little after daddy's big return around the 50% mark but the last few chapters make up for it...what a ride!My thoughts:Character development: 4Level of Romance between characters:  4Passion/Heat level: 4 (these two are hot for each other from the start

 Take a little while for them to do the deed but worth the wait when they finally get there)Angst/Heartbreak: 3 (there are a few obstacles and some serious drama but for the most part once they are together, they are in it together)Cliffhanger?: 5 (Nope, this is the first in a series but this you get your HEA)My favorite line:&#34;Baby, I promise you that you'll never want for physical contact again.&#34; His big strong hands hold my head  and he leans his forehead against mine
&#34; I'll always hold you when you're scared&#34;
he softly kisses my jaw


&#34;Comfort you when you're sad&#34; His lips brush my cheeks


&#34;Take care of you when you're sick&#34;

Tilting my head back, he kisses my forehead
 He bends down and his hazel eyes narrow into mine


&#34;I'll make it my life's mission to make up for every second you were neglected.&#34;Overall, I enjoyed this one...a great debut novel

 Can't wait for the next in the series!

$REVIEW.: Another great read from Greg Herren in the Scotty Bradley Adventure series.  Like the earlier books in the series, Greg populates his beloved New Orleans with wonderfully kooky, lovable characters, including the Bradley family.  Private Investigator Scotty Bradley and his work and life partner Frank have a multitude of crises to sort out all at once: LSU mascot Mike the Tiger has been &#34;tigernapped,&#34; Scotty's father kidnapped, Scotty's mother's old friend murdered, and Frank's 18 year old nephew from Alabama has been thrown out of his home by his rigidly Fundamentalist Christian parents and is coming to live with Scotty and Frank [and their third partner Colin, absent from most of this story].  Throw in a delightful history lesson about former Louisiana Governor Huey Long, which is a central feature/motive for some of the sudden crises, and it's wonderfully entertaining read.  Herren has a gift for creating delightful characters, many of whom I'd love to meet, and describing New Orleans so lovingly that I almost want to move there to see these places [many of which I have seen before, others not] and meet these people.  Because I've read the previous books in this series, I knew that Scotty would get deeply into trouble and then get himself out [with Frank's help].  Check.  I also knew I'd love the descriptions of the characters and the city of New Orleans.  Check.  Strongly recommend that if you want a rather light and entertaining read, and especially if you've read any of Greg's earlier works and have been charmed by them as well, then you should get a copy of this book and enjoy.

There are all kinds of jokes long ones, short ones, silly ones, cheeky ones and many that i am sure you will have heard before as well.The book is very well presented a quality production, hardbound. I think hardbound says 'i am a good book.'It is a good book and will remain in my library until I am an old man.I think what sets it up is the multiple contributors. It is not just one comedian rattling off the same style of joke over and over again. It has variety and the mood changes from front to back.Well done on a quality production, i would recommend the book to anybody young or old.

$review_text.: Marvelous romp that gives you a real feel for all kinds of crazy characters in New Orleans when things were falling down around our ears, and hustlers of every stripe were moving in to make a killing---many sorts of killing. Great character development and charming story that swerves back and forth among all castes and configurations. Wonderful, fun, crime novel, comic and heart breaking by turns. Do read it ---it's written by a woman who really understands the New Orleans underworld and over-world and in-between, and always has! Mastery!

$review_text.: When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I would like it, because it seemed to me to be going the way of a science fiction read, which is not my style


But, as I read on a little further, I saw that this was not true at all


It turned out to have a bit of a magical theme, but actually was a great read about what happens when you are granted your wishes.When you read the book, you will think of the old saying &#34;be careful what you wish for&#34;
Be ready for the consequences


A great book to read for yourself and to your children (I would say about ages 6-11).

$REVIEW.: The novel was well written and the character of Belinda was snippy and reserved


Initially I didn't quite know how I felt about her


The author developed her character so that in the end, I was very attached to her


It took me quite a long while to work out her agenda, in fact, it was probably the Epilogue that actually spelled things out to me although little clues along the way pointed me in the right direction
I am usually fairly quick at working out plots and twists and so this book kept me going right up until the last.I loved the character of Aidan
It is really unusual to have a redheaded male hero and it was utterly refreshing


He was so outside of the norm that I got quite caught up in him

I thought he was lovely.It was an awesome prequel to the series.

$review_text.: Cruises are a time away from time. So when two men who shared a kiss in high school reunite nineteen years later, can their travel into the past turn into a road map to the future?Little do Trae Ambrose and Jon Ross, both thirty-five, know that sailing along the coast of northern Europe will bring them together after so many years. On the verge of a divorce from his wife of one year, deeply closeted Florida lawyer Trae is sharing a huge cabin with his married friends George and Liz.Gay Hollywood actor Jon is sharing his much smaller cabin with his fifty-five-year-old gay friend Ruben. While Jon is often mistaken for actor James Marsden, Ruben is happy to tell the people they meet that Jon's a famous actor and that they are a couple, both misconceptions Jon is quick to correct.When Trae and Jon recognize each other onboard, they happily fall into high school habits, trying to avoid detection when they're together and leaving secret notes to each other in a book in the ship's library. However, it's not long before they, George, Liz, and Ruben are meeting for drinks, and while George and Liz don't suspect that Trae and Jon are falling in love, Ruben does and is jealous.Trae is a bundle of worries at first about what he and Jon are doing which is mostly kissing and holding hands, but as they get bolder, having found a couple of secluded spots on the ship, he is enchanted with gay sex and what he's been missing in life. But will he want anything to do with Jon after the ship reaches final port?Jon, on the other hand, was devastated in high school when Trae ignored him after the kiss. Although Jon's had other partners through the years, no one has affected him the way Trae did. As they get closer onboard, Jon wonders if he'll be dumped again, especially since he's fallen even more in love with Trae than he was in school.Even with a lively pace and often interesting dialogue, both men unfortunately are cookie-cutter gay men with no distinctive, memorable personalities, making it difficult for a reader to feel their unique anguish.Also, not only does the story cry out for proofreading with enough typos and missing or misused words to be frustrating, but a good editor would help to capitalize on the potentially interesting plot twists and shore up the ending so that it isn't such a letdown. All of this means is that while THE REUNION is a pleasant enough book, its flaws drag it into the ho-hum category.Reviewed by Pat Henshawfor TheRomanceReviews.com

$review_text.: "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."Wow, did I really just read that? This is one of those reviews where I have no idea where to start.This story is first and foremost a nightmare that two people must survive together and as they depend on each other for survival and hope they fall into one of most altruistic loves I've ever read about.Lilith is strong, determined, and seemingly unbreakable. She is a heroine that has issues of her own, that needs control and organization to feel safe. She is in no way meek or virginal as a lot of heroines have been lately. She is also Finn's savior.Finn is not your typical hero; actually he's not really a hero at all, more of a victim...I think? I've never met a character quite like him. He is absolutely gorgeous (see pic below!), but my heart ached for him throughout the entire novel. He has had an incredibly awful run in life and he is at a point where he has given up, he self-medicates with alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes to survive. He is NOT your typical alpha male character that makes your heart thump and your panties wet (at least he didn't for me), BUT he does have alpha male tendencies when Lili is involved and risks himself to try and save her. He is boiling with contradictions, and it was breathing-taking to see his character blossom at the end of the novel."But if there was one lesson my life had taught me, it was that as bad as all this was, there was always room for things to get just that little bit worse." ~FinnThe relationship between Finn and Lilith is built up slowly, sweetly, and subtlety. It is not the main plot line but is woven into the horrors that occur at Albermarle Hall. Their stolen moments of intimacy are beyond heartwarming and are one of the only things that give hope to their situation."Something immutable happened to the bond between Finn Strachan and me, and our unnamed relationship shifted into something far stronger than either of us know how to control. If I'd had the energy, I might have halted it there, kept my face turned away and driven on through the storm. But right then, I needed the haven that Finn offered more than oxygen." ~LilithSome of the supporting characters, especially Blaine and Coyle, are some of the most vile, malicious, and evil people I have ever come across. Can people really be that cruel?I like that this story is told in alternating POV between the two main characters so that, as readers, we are able to get the full story and background from both sides, however the POV switches multiple times in a single chapter and even through it is clearly marked, it can be bit hard to remember whose "voice" you're hearing at the moment. It is exceptionally well written but a bit slow paced, wordy with a lot of conversation, and full of British slang that took some getting used to. Thank goodness my kindle has a dictionary because I actually had to look up a few words, which I loved because who doesn't want to expand their vocabulary?The beginning was a bit slow for me and I didn't feel like much happened until about the 60% mark, and then the last 15% or so of the book was mind-blowingly amazing! There is no cliffhanger ending here and its about as happy as can be expected after what these two have just been through, but there is definitely more story to tell.I applaud the author for writing something so outside the box, for writing something that combines a horror story with a fairy-tale, and for giving me a story and characters that I will NEVER be able to forget.WARNING: This is a VERY dark read, and I mean dark. Not like Captive/Seduced in the Dark, but more along the lines of Ann Rice's The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty dark (although not nearly as explicit). I don't like to compare books, but I just want you to be prepared if you're thinking of reading this! Be forewarned that there are rape and torture scenes with varying degrees of details.

$REVIEW.: The Farmer's Market in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, must be VERY different than any Farmer's Market I have ever seen anywhere in New England, where the markets are full of high end veggies, beautiful fresh greens, wild mushrooms, local cheese, honey & meat, local jams, jellies & pickles and of course fruit in season and locally made crafts.  Thus I was shocked to see so many recipes that called for cake mixes, Cool Whip (isn't Minnesota a dairy state too?) and ramen noodles.One recipe was particularly revolting:  a Red Beet Cake that not only called for beets, but also instant chocolate pudding and Cool Whip.  A Spring Vegetable Frittata contained only vegetables that can be found at the Farmer's Market in either Vermont or Minnesota in late July, August and September.Favorite Farmers Market Recipesis not completely terrible.  There are a few rather nice recipes for unusual pickles and the Maple Pecan Waffles sound good.  You will have to do some mighty careful hunting for them though, because the entire functional Table of Contents appears numerous times, at the beginning of every division.  Really, don't authors check this stuff?

$REVIEW.: This author/s specifically state that they were inspired to write this book based on movies they had seen as children. The old Black And White giant bug movies and giant sea monster movies. With all this, they put together Clickers, a book that is basically like reading a B grade movie about exactly that, sea monsters that come up and attack this small fishing community. I couldn't pass up an opportunity like this so I bought the book from Amazon, along with its two sequels.Clickers follows the story of this small little fishing town that gets hit really hard with a storm of the century! During this storm, some of the townsfolk as well as Rick, a horror writer that has come to the town for some relaxation and a quite place to write his new book that he has signed a contract for, are stuck in this storm and cannot get out of town because of it. At first, the come up in small numbers, up, out of the ocean and onto the beaches, attacking the people on small boats or are too close to the shore but soon they are all through town. Huge, 3 feet long, red crab type creatures with giant claws that can snip your hand off in one clean click. They call them Clickers because their claws click as they walk and hunt. To make matters worse, like a scorpion, they have huge tails with stingers and when you get stung, the area will blow up like a balloon, expand so much that you will pop from the insides out and the clickers will devour your steaming soppy mess within minutes. The clickers aren't coming in for no reason though, the town's people think they are pretty clever when they manage to get a lot if clickers out of town or killed, the second wave is yet to come in. These are bigger, A LOT bigger, meaner, smarter and if this little tiny town thought that the storm and the Clickers were bad, they haven't seen nothing yet!This book is a mere 200 pages but for some reason it took me a couple of months to get through. I didn't mind it, I honestly didn't. But it didn't have enough to sustain me for long periods of time where as a really great book will have me reading it for hour upon hour and suddenly my Sunday is over and I don't realise I have a headache (from so much reading) until I need to break and make myself some dinner! But this one didn't do that for me. The book warms up pretty quickly and is go-go-go until the end but the characters didn't have me overly engaged and I think maybe all the deaths were very similar so once I had read a couple, I felt I had read them all? There were a couple of great scenes though, or chapters I should say. Like when you learn of the Clickers and their origin, when the scientist is trying to figure out how they work and where they may have come from. And there is also a chapter with a girl that is attacked in her home and that was easily my favourite part in the whole book and I zoomed through that in no time but then, it seemed to have slowed down again and I would pick it up, read another 10 pages (instead of the usual 100) and put it down, finding something else to do.I think for me, I would have preferred the characters be a bit more developed. There is the sheriff that is a royal pain in the ass and he could have been one awesome character you absolutely loathed if he was developed well enough. Same with the main character, I liked Rick, he was okay but I needed more than just finding him okay. When reading a book I get so sucked in by the characters and want to feel something when they go, if they go. And with this book, I just didn't feel that way. Which told me that was half the problem with it. But then again, the author did state this was a B Grade movie book and when I think about these movies, it is all running and screaming and not a lot of character development so really, I cannot fault the author, as this was no doubt what they were going for.I did think it was an entertaining little read and I do still recommend it. Particularly for those that like the sea monster stuff! But personally, I hate to say it, I have read a lot better. But because this is a small read, and if you are a quick reader, you could probably bang through it in no time and you wouldn't be wasting too much time if you walked away not being too keen on it. A definite for horror fans but not for those that like their psychological stuff or the stuff that will utterly scare you shitless. This is more your clicker fun than anything else! Pick it up if it sounds like your thing!

$REVIEW.: My wife loves watching British television shows (mostly the ones that happen in the small countryside towns) and since my son is living there for a couple of years she's hoping to go visit in a year or so.  Knowing that Lonely Planet often excels at guiding those who want to travel off the beaten path, I got this in hopes it might help to plan our trip.Unfortunately, this one isn't like my prior experiences with LP and is more like Fodors or Frommers with their heavy emphasis on flashy color pictures.  It's very beautiful and tries to bridge the gap with "local" recommendations but it still seems superficial and lacking much depth.  I realize that Great Britain is a big place and can't possibly be covered so easily in a small travel-guide, but this one seems to ignore entire patches of the country.  It's divided into several sections:- "London and around" (which basically ignores everything but London)- "Oxford and Central England"- "Bath & Southwest England"- "York & Northern England"- "Wales"- "Edinburgh & Central Scotland"- "Scotland's Highlands & Islands"It also has brief sections covering topics like history, family travel, architecture, sport, etc., as well as a "Survival Guide" addressing things like climate and money, but overall I found it a bit disappointing.  A pull-out map of London is included.

$review_text.: Second book I read in the Celaeno series I read and I enjoyed this one as well.It delves further into the planet's society, again stressing the conflict between the Sisters/Guards and those who oppose them.This story takes place sixteen years after Temple at Landfall, and follows up on the deserted Rangers and heretics and how they fare in their newly built city. Myths formed around their desertion and the new city in Landfall, and the Sisters try to keep it quiet and at the same time have more Intelligence information and try to take the leaders of Westernfort out.The story focuses on two young women, Dani, a heretic, and Natasha, Guard on a secret mission. It's a classic tale of faith and betrayal, the women have grown up with different truths and Natasha for the first time is confronted with a different truth than the one she believes in.I just love this planet and the stories it has to tell. For my liking it focuses too strongly on the romance aspect and is caught in the traps of that genre in that it's obvious from the start who will end up together and what conflicts they will have to face to get there. But the story they have to tell is a good one so I take this minor weak point, imo, gladly to find out more about Celaeno.

$REVIEW.: K.M

Stross is the author of the post apocalyptic  tale The Man in Black, The Woman in Whitegives us something quite different with Purgatory.Purgatory is a border town on the southern edge of Arizona surrounded by a dry patch of nothing and not much else

 (I copied that right from the book.)  The choice of Purgatory  as the name of the town is interesting, and after you read the book, you can decide for yourself whether it is appropriate, a metaphor for something deeper.A priest walks into a bar....


 I bet you thought it was going to be a bar joke, right?  Actually, a priest walks into a cafe, and so it begins,  a town where nothing is as it seems on the surface, not even the priest


 He has come to Purgatory to act as Devil's Advocate for the Church, which is in the process of canonization of the former priest of Purgatory, Father Aaron Abaddon

 You might recall that Aaron was Moses' older brother the first high priest of the Israelites, and is remembered for the miraculous blossoming of his staff or rod


 At the command of Moses, he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first of three plagues, the Plague of Blood
 You would do well to keep this in mind as you read.No one in town wants him there; they are all reluctant to talk to him
 The town has dwindled down to not much,  but what is keeping it alive are the illegals - the undocumented Mexicans who continually slip across the nearby border, and are hired by the local ranch owners, the only way they can make their ranches pay

 The Mexicans spend their money in town, and most of the shop keepers are glad to see them

 There is a memorial in the center of town to Father Aaron, which brings in pious Mexicans


 As one character says, the problem illegals go to other towns

 Purgatory gets the faithful

 The canonization of Father Aaron will do much for the town, in terms of tourists, and survival

 Everybody wants this to go through.But now, wait

 We have a problem


 Three of them, actually


 Maybe more

 A prior priest disappeared
 No body found, no trace, no nada

 And then there was the priest after him who ...

dare I say it? ...


killed himself
 And we don't actually know what happened to Father Aaron
 He seems to have just disappeared, after working a number of healing miracles in town, and is presumed dead, hence the canonization
 (You can't make a saint out of someone still living.)And then there is the church


 Locked up

 Unused now for several years


 And it's spooky, and nobody likes going there


 The people say it is haunted.Our protagonist Devil's Advocate has an eye problem


 He has glaucoma in his left eye, worsening daily
 The future of his right eye is in doubt
 And as the story goes along, he begins to have hallucinations -- but only through his left eye, the one with tunnel vision, and darkening vision

 If he closes that eye, and looks only through his right eye, all is normal.Our Devil's Advocate also seems to be searching for a particular person in addition to his Devil's Advocate duties

 Or is that why he is there in the first place?  We begin to have the same problem as our protagonist,  darkening sight, seeing ghosts in the periphery of our vision
 But what we can see clearly is that his physical tunnel vision may also be a metaphor for his determined unwavering quest.

$review_text.: I liked the first installment, but not this one b/c I didn't like Jonathan discussing Jane and  their private intimacies with Kellan nor the idea of Jonathan using drugs to eliminate what few inhibitions Jane had to get her involved in a menage without her fully cognizant agreement. That really offended me. Jane was really a little too forgiving about that episode, shades of tstl! I realize that the author had to do something to make Jonathan unworthy in the readers eyes so that Jane will end up with Zaren, who was a sweetie. There was another incident that was too far fetched to be believable unless Jonathan is involved secretly with the natives and their exploits. I'm not sure I will read the next installment unless my curiosity gets the best of me since I would like to see Jonathan and Kellan get theirs in the end, if in fact they do.

What you get is what is says on the box, the Lord has many delights and most of them have something to do with body parts.This is rompy romance, basically the dapper hero with the ginormous pulsing...umm crown jewels, saves the beautiful virgin bride. Strangely enough said virgin has no problem whatsoever with voyeurism, getting era specific lap dances and/or exhibitionism. All that as a dutiful blushing virgin of course.There is some odd finger sniffing tactics going on that I found bizarre to say the least. The main character was quite obsessed with his genitals, they ached, itched, throbbed, were aflame and spoke to him on many an occasion.It is a quick non-demanding read.AVP-UK

$REVIEW.: Cheri Huber has written quite a few self-help books. If you like (or dislike) her style, I don't think you will find much to change your mind in "Making a Change for Good." Like some other books it is set in a hand-writing type font.Reading other reviews, I saw that some reviewers are upset and others relieved that the book is so simple. There are no lengthy dissertations about complicated philosophical concepts. On the other hand those dissertations may not be very helpful to the end-user. Simple language drives home the point. Here is one example (discussing disidentification):"I want to do something.I do it.I feel good.Voices talk me out of doing it.The same voices beat me up for quitting."I am sure the same concept could be expressed in a manner that only 2% of the readers would comprehend :) The recipe for the antidote is just as easy to understand. A 30-day guided 30 to 45 minute a day self-retreat. It WILL work as long as one is honest to oneself. The method is sitting meditation and the clear view created in that space. Compassionate self-support will step in and recognize the "voices" that sabotage us.I agree that all the conversation about the "voices" can turn you off. However, if we accept the word "voices" as a conceptual place-holder, the message will not get lost. And we have to say something, don't we?

$REVIEW.: The narrator is a classy &#34;dog&#34; from better zip code neighborhoods on the prowl  for pedigreed GOLDEN Retrievers hopefully in heat.  This dog knows some great tricks and more often than not gets his bone (r)!  Very Fun and almost believable.  Having been one of these Objects of Quest Blondes in my younger years it was like reading my memoirs but from the quester's perspective. Glory days are missed by older blondes but there is truth in the adage That &#34;Blondes have more fun&#34; and this book attests that those with blondes have a great deal of fun too. Sexy but not graphic. I love the way the narrator hunts them but worships and appreciates the allure of his prey. Tasteful and not disrespectful.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this book because lets face it the cover is interesting. I carved out some time to start reading it and found myself wishing I didn't have to put it down. The characters are original and the setting is unique; yet I can picture them in my mind as if I was there w/them during their adventures (or misadventures you decide). The next moment I had to finish this tale I was reading it to completion only to be left wanting more. The heroine in this story is a young girl who at times has you at the edge of your seat rooting for her and other times you sadly are crying with her and her companions. Yet this is what makes this book a must read.  If you are looking for a book to delight -sometimes give you the chills- then you need to look no further. I am going to try to patiently wait for the release of Book 2!!! Well written. Non-mainstream. Inventive.

 I literally was turning each page just anticipating what in the hell was going to happen next

 I love the Characters  Cutter is HOT as HELL, and Melissa is sexy and spunky

 I was amazed at actually how much alike Cutter and Melissa were but really hadn't even realized it


 Cutter is a bad ass, but can be brought to his knees by this little woman, and Melissa is timid and perfect cookie cutter person, but when Cutter comes into her life she is able to show just how strong and badass she is

 This book has a VERY interesting plot line which includes more than one plot twist and I loved every minute of it!  Now I wonder will there be a book two???  Cant wait to read more from Amber Rides!

$REVIEW.: This marriage book stands out because its focus is Biblical.  Many Christian marriage books seem to come at marriage from a psychological angle first, then add verses to support that.  This starts with a Biblical view of marriage and then moves towards each spouses practical responses to that view.  A group of couples in our church recently went through this book and many found it to be very helpful in their marriages.There were aspects of the writing style that bothered me a bit.  The authors would change from his perspective to her perspective in a kind of haphazard way.  It seems like offsetting or transitioning between these two viewpoints would make it easier to read.  However, despite that I still highly recommend this book!

$review_text.: Read the excellent Driftwood and then downloaded the next thing I saw by Harper Fox - Life After Joe,  and now I'm wailing because they are the only two books she's written.  I can only hope she writes fast because she writes beautifully.  Often in romances,  the sentences aren't as supple as they could be,  the words more common,  but Harper Fox uses words beautifully and creates evocative and moving sentences - as well as having great characters and hot sex.  Really, who could ask for anything more?Matthew is having a breakdown after his lover Joe,  leaves him to marry a girl. Then he meets the enigmatic Aaron and he starts to find that there can indeed be a life, after Joe.She's on my auto buy list,  writing emotional and engaging m/m romances,  and while they have a strong sexual component,  they are not simply erotica,  but are fully fledged (and full length!) romances,  with intricate and well thought out characters and settings.  I rate this a keeper and a reread.

$review_text.: If you're looking for cool, cutting edge, gay male psychic free-lance investigator intrigue then you need to look away because all this `story' involved was a shifty plot that led up to `omg, they're having sex to catch a killer!'. However, if you're into men crying, feelings gushing, soul mates, and kisses that heal, then this is a story for you. I'll warn you, things like quotation marks and punctuation disappear sometimes, leaving the pages as if they were never there (and probably weren't).My first complaint is regarding the plot, or rather, the lack thereof. Sure, there was lots of sex, but the plot... well that was just a very flimsy, shifty excuse to get the two characters to have lots of sex. And honestly? [...] However, I look to books for plot.I guess I was expecting more than what could be done in so few pages. I assure you that I was not expecting men crying, feelings "gushing", soul mates, or kisses that heal. To me? [...]I know that the author did do some research for this story, and I applaud that. [...]My second complaint is in regards to the characters. For instance, the author repeatedly stated how strong Toshi was, how impressive. Yet, it was merely stated in reflections and introspective thoughts. It was never really -shown-. There were dozens of opportunities to show things, like clues to the investigation or the dead leads being combed over again or suicide clubs or something, but all of that was dropped and left with vague murmurs that there were no leads.When it comes to Toshi... I never saw him being repressed. In the shortness of the author's story, I saw him cry more than any other character, and I saw him never yielding when it came to giving in to his emotions, I saw him being tender with both Keiko and his uncle (which is understandable given all of their relations, but doesn't lead to anyone believing he was being repressed). The only indication that he was being `repressed' was because the author would mention that he was engaged to Keiko repeatedly and usually when he was thinking of John, and that they were both doing it because of their families. I'm sorry, but to me, that's not being repressed. It is, however, part of his character in so much that he's willing to give up his own happiness, and potentially allowing his fianc&eacute; and wife to have an affair with her one-true-love, just to keep the family happy. Who knows, it could be that they'd have an open marriage, especially if Keiko was game. In the end, though, the author went for making him emo rather than complex.The author had an amazing opportunity to do some really fun things with John, but she skipped them at every turn, favoring more sex than anything else. [...]  Never once did we see John building up his mental walls. He was always fortified by Toshi's strong, masculine touch. John's a veteran. He should have some strength of his own, something that the reader can `see' rather than be repeatedly `told' about.Also, the interludes that occurred at random intervals could have been handled better. Those were dead giveaways to the `criminal'. The author could have done more to actually build the mystery, not just have the `solution' handed so nicely to the two investigators.All in all, I think there was a story here that the author didn't want to tell and characters that she was afraid of fleshing out. In essence, there was a missed opportunity here [...]

$review_text.: When I first heard the premise behind the Morgue Drawer series, a murdered car thief's ghost is able to communicate with a coroner and help solve mysteries, I thought it was appealing and so I ordered Morgue Drawer Next Door. By chapter two, the book was already annoying me. The ghost, Pascha, is an obnoxious and vulgar, very unlikeable, character. While he may have died at age twenty-four, he acts like a 12 year-old. His retorts and ripostes are juvenile, he constantly refers to women as "chicks" and "broads", and the scene when he watches the coroner's girlfriend take a sponge bath is creepy. Also, as this "mystery" revolves around the arson of a church and death of Sister Marlene, now an unwilling new ghost, Pascha cannot help but constantly insult the Catholic religion and the nuns; "penguins" in "black caftans" who should wear "leopard-print jeans".Pascha, unable to pass on to his eternal damnation, has become a persistently disruptive and unwelcome force in the life of Martin, the coroner. In what might be construed as remorse over his life as a felon and partier, Pascha decides to stick with Martin, a boring little milquetoast, and solve mysteries. His disembodied voice is able to interrupt Martin's life, and more distastefully, his love life. Now, to confound Martin even more, the newly dead Sister Marlene can talk to Pascha, but not to him. So, there are interminable scenes with Sister Marlene having Pascha translate to Martin for her. His translations and ruminations are not always the most mature.The mystery surrounding the arson of the convent will confound no one, the perpetrator practically wears an "I did it" sign around his neck. The author tosses in a few broadly written red herrings but no critical thinking is needed to solve this one.I hate when I have to say, "I really wanted to like this book", but that truly is the case here. There are a few amusing moments, and Pascha does gain a modicum of respect for the dead sister, but he still is unable to refrain from the juvenile insults. The author has a great concept with the ghost helping the living, but in my opinion, the ghost ruins the story and I know I won't be reading any other Morgue Drawer series books.

$review_text.: There's been a lot of attention paid to this comic book series since the movie was released based on it, and I have to say I don't know what all the excitement was about

Generally speaking, I like Miller's work, both his writing and his drawing style

But this thing is just silly


Historically, in fact, it's a bad joke

Both the Persians and the Greeks mostly look Moorish, not Aryan at all


And Xerxes (who appears sub-Saharan) is a travesty, with piercings all over his face
The hoplites seem to have no food, no baggage, and no spare weapons, which is unhistorical

Nor was facial hair allowed

Also, hoplites were heavy infantry -- emphasis on "heavy" -- and they most certainly did NOT fight near-naked

The Immortals are pure Hollywood in appearance
The Phocian wall, where the heaviest fighting took place, was NOT built for the occasion but was already a centuries-old old frontier fortification


Not to mention -- where exactly IS the Spartan phalanx? And on and on





Thermopylae is a great subject for a graphic novel, but this treatment of it is just dumb.

It gives a very honest view of slavery from a slave's perspective. The author addresses some big questions through fiction that mostly get left unanswered.Excellent read. The only thing that makes me hesitate in recommending it fully is that it reminds me of To Kill A Mockingbird, and I think that one is a better book. If you have already read To Kill A Mockingbird, then pick this up and read it as well. You will learn a lot about an American hero/villain, and be entertained at the same time.Since reading the book I've learned:Quentin Tarantino calls John Brown 'the greatest American'Christopher Hitchens has an essay about him in Arguably, saying that he is more responsible for slavery ending then anyone, including Lincoln

$REVIEW.: Just when I think that the entire zombie genre is completely played out, along comes something like Lesser Creatures to restore my faith.  Without giving too much away, in this novel the zombies are more of a social problem than a real menace, opening up the opportunites to examine our own social (welfare?) programs in the real world and our prejudices about same.An intriguing alternate world combined with Peter Giglio's adeptness at drawing us in to the emotions of the characters make this a great read.  My only problem with Lesser Creatures is that the plot relies very heavily on a couple of HUGE coincidences.  Still, this is a fine novel with an unexpected sweetness to it.

$review_text.: I have read all three books in the Laura Cardinal series.  The first book was good, the second book was a little better, and the third book was quite good.  The first book I would rate a 3.5, the second book a 4, and the third book a 5.  Not a lot of bad language, and the bad language that was there wasn't thrown in for shock value, but rather for character development (still not sure it was necessary).  Good series to take to the beach or to hop a plane with.

$review_text.: LOW PORT is not your typical Lee/Miller book

 It is an anthology of short stories, some very short, set in the depressed underbelly of our future space faring civilization


 Don't expect any uplifting happy endings here, there are none

 What you do get is some darn good writing from some of the best writers of our times.If you like short stories, not my personal favorite, or tragedies, again not what I usually enjoy, then this is a book for you.


 Involved plots and character development are almost nonexistent, but then that is to be expected from short stories
 These are snapshots of life on the sharp edge, the stories of people who inhabit the seedy, grimy parts of our universe
 Humans will be human whether its in the shanty towns surrounding a naval port in the Philippines or the whorehouses of a spaceport somewhere out in the stars.Expect to be fascinated and enthralled by these glimpses into the belly of the beast, but don't expect to feel good afterwards


 This isn't space opera where the hero wins out through incredible odds to save his lady love and live happily ever after, this is more like a Greek tragedy where the best you can expect is an ending not quite as depressing as the beginning, a forlorn hope for the most part.For those of you who like tragedies and E.A


Poe type of stories then LOW PORT is for you in spades
 If your tastes run more to the happy ending, space opera genre then you would do better looking elsewhere.

The girls are upset because their boyfriends have taken a job overseas and won't be back in time to leave before hurricane season.

$review_text.: First of all I really do appreciate the thought and work that went into this cookbook and I've made several of the recipes and Hubby and I enjoyed them but there are way too many recipes with maple surup and honey!  This is shocking.  Read &#34;The Sugar Fix&#34; and you'll be put off by this.  Granted the amounts are not substantial but when one is trying to cut way down on fructose, no matter if it's pure maple surup or raw honey, it's still fructose and for many women especially post menopause it can be detrimental in keeping the weight off of the middle section.  A little sugar in its purest form here and there adds up!  This cookbook is definitely worth buying though just for the info on prep for a busy life.

Kingma gives helpful, specific examples of how each of these are paths to self love. The book also provides vignettes illustrating ways in which people do not express self love, and asks readers to examine their own feelings of self worth and behaviors. She describes "life themes" which shape our values and our actions. The message is positive and affirming. Readers may choose how deeply they want to delve into their emotions and history. I will re-read this book more than once!

$review_text.: The title of this book is misleading. Though The Cellist of Sarajevo opens with the cellist witnessing a horrific event, we don't hear from the cellist again until briefly at the end. The bulk of the story is told from the POV of Dragan the baker, Kenan the father, and Arrow the female sniper during the military occupation of Sarajevo in the 1990s.Sarajevo is devastated. The war with "the men in the hills" has wrecked the city physically and economically. The Sarajevo wasteland is populated with the poor souls who didn't make it out in time and soldiers. The soldiers fight openly in the streets. Both citizens and soldiers must be on guard against shells and snipers.The cellist's story begins the book. From his window he sees 22 people, who are in line to buy bread, blown to bits by mortar attack. Horrified, he does the only thing he knows how to honor these people and to protest their murders: he plays Adagio in G Minor every day at 4pm for 22 days. One song for each person.The cellist is based on the real-life musician from Bosnia named Vedran Smailovic. He regularly played his cello in abandoned buildings or at funerals during the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s.Dragan is one of the few people who still has a job in Sarajevo. His path to work is always perilous but on this particular day, he sees a woman he knows get shot and doesn't help her (The Bystander Effect).Kenan goes on a water run for his family and his neighbor. Getting to the brewery (which has the only clean water around) is dangerous enough but once he reaches it, he finds himself in the middle of a shelling, seeing things that he could never have imagined.The way time passes in The Cellist is odd. Dragan and Kenan's stories happen over the course of one day and touch on the little horrors of everyday during a war. Whereas Arrow's story happens over a month or so and is much bigger.Arrow is assigned to protect the cellist during his 22 day performance. She's a sniper for the "good guys." She adopts the name Arrow when she joins the army, shedding her old skin and becoming a weapon.  She mourns the person she was before the war, before she realized she was pretty godd*mned talented at sniping people.  She hates and loves the person she's become and she lives by some whacked personal rules about killing folks.I could take or leave Kenan and Dragon's characters, but the cellist and Arrow were fascinating. There wasn't enough of the cellist's point of view! And Arrow has such a deep inner conflict and mysterious past that I couldn't get enough of her. I also thought her decision in her last chapter was strangely out of character and was upset with the ending.I would have given this book 4 or 5 stars if Steven Galloway cut out the two dudes and focused on the cellist and Arrow. They perfectly oppose one another: the beautifully mournful cellist and the tough mysterious sniper-both wanting the same thing and trying to achieve it in different ways.

$review_text.: Embrace by Cherie Colyer(Book #1: The Embrace Series)Source: Author/Omnific PublishingRating: 4/5 starsUp to this point, Madison has had a pretty normal life
 Sure, she lost her mom years ago but her dad and little brother are pretty awesome, her best-friend Kaylee is delightful and loves coffee as much as Madison does and, the new, totally hot guy at school has his eye on her
 All in all, not a bad life as far as high school goes

 But this book would totally suck if something intense and slightly awful didn&iexcl;t happen and this book is far, far away from being sucky For the most part, Kaylee and Madison&iexcl;s lives are pretty normal; Kaylee is an excellent student, Madison not so much; Kaylee has a wonderful boyfriend, Josh and Madison is excited to be newly dating, Isaac


 Even though he is new to town, Isaac quickly falls into place with Kaylee, Madison and Josh and the four friends instantly become inseparable
 All seems right with the world until the morning Kaylee totally snaps the tether and has to be admitted to the hospital, heavily sedated and strapped to the bed


 Though all the adults suspect drugs, the doctors can&iexcl;t find a trace of any substance in her body that would cause Kaylee to scream uncontrollably and hallucinate

 Determined to figure out what is wrong with her best friend, Madison begins to do some research only to be totally disappointed that the only real fit to Kaylee&iexcl;s symptoms is witchcraft

 Yeah right, like that exists.As the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures and when Kaylee shows no signs of getting better, Madison decides to cast a spell
 Inexplicably, Madison not only manages to get the spell going but she over does it and damn near burns down her house

 Thankfully, Isaac appears in the nick of time and puts out the flames, with magic

 Isaac, you have some splainin&iexcl; to do!!  And &iexcl;splain he does   Isaac is a very powerful witch, Josh is a witch and now, after having cast her first spell, Madison has embraced her powers and truly become a member of the group


 In order to save Kaylee, the three friends (and later Kaylee too!) form a proper coven and set out to magically protect one another and save Kaylee

 Through this struggle, Madison begins to learn more and more about magic, her abilities, and her feelings toward Isaac

 Though the two struggle to overcome some of the obstacles that face every new couple, they are determined to be together and neither can deny how perfectly they fit together.The fight to save Kaylee turns into much, much more than the group ever expected and the unveiling of the evil behind the drama is pretty surprising
 The big bad not only wields some super serious power but also acquired that power in a most unnerving way


 When the truth finally comes to light, it takes all four of the coven members, a surprise visitor from Madison&iexcl;s past and, Scooby Doo-worthy plan to shut down the big bad and restore everything to its proper place and form

 Seriously, the last battle is pretty spectacular!The Bottom Line: Though Embrace was a slow starter for me (hence the 4 star rating) once it really got going, I was reminded of why I love this genre


 Colyer has produced a fine YA+ read about witches and witchcraft that is quite different from a large number of other reads currently available in this genre

 I particularly enjoyed reading about how witches in Colyer&iexcl;s world come into their powers, how they can use their powers, how they can acquire powers and how those powers manifest


 I enjoyed reading how the Fearsome Four (my name for the coven) work as a team yet are led by Isaac because of his greater powers and experience

 Each of the F.F
are fully-developed characters I honestly wanted to know more about and Colyer absolutely delivered
 On to book two

A murderer without conscience, without regret, without a second thought, is on the loose.Silently deceptive, cool and calm, the Ladykiller is both cunning and efficient. There are no obvious clues, no clear patterns and no easy answers for Detective Dave Dillon. A haunting mistake from the past makes this his last chance for redemption. The son of an Irish cop, Dillon is stubborn, intuitive, and dead set on solving the case. The Ladykiller is just as determined, systematically eliminating those who deserve to die. Each victim is eradicated in the same brutal way. Lured to a deserted location, no witnesses and by the cover of darkness, the killing takes place. Another murder and yet another, public and internal pressure on the Ladykiller taskforce intensifies. Time is running out and the answers are elusive.Over and over Det. Dillon reviews each case looking at the photos and the facts. What do they have in common? What is their final expression trying to say? Where is the link? The experienced officers are determined to unravel the facts. When new tidbits of information shed light upon past discoveries, things come together. The link perhaps, but how? Persistence and resolve will find the answers, or does it? A confession or a bid for notoriety, half truths or just more lies, where will it all lead?The Ladykiller is ruthless and shrewd, deceiving everyone, but for how long? Will there be another murder or will the taskforce arrive in time? Matters of the heart make it complicated. When reason is left behind, desires, passions and reality become a lethal mix. Only a level head and a clear mind can discover hidden secrets. Who is really in danger, who is hiding the truth and who will snap first?Armchair Interviews says: The Ladykiller is addictive, intense and not for the faint of heart!

$review_text.: This is the fourth chapter of the Monster Squad series, in this Heath Stallcup brings us to the finale of the Big Battle with the Sicarri. There will be some spoilers in this review and its going to be quite a moaning one too.The buildup was great as all the MS personal are slowing bringing different &#8220;good&#8221; monsters into the fold, the strategy in planning the big battle is pretty awesome, even for a non military lay person like myself, HS does well to explain the technicalities without boring me stupid, but has enough guns, ammo and &#8220;shop&#8221; talk  please most hardcore nuts.Some of the new inventions were pretty amazing and well thought out.The mixture of monsters was good and I really loved the introduction of some critters like the Gargoyles, I do hope that Grimlock makes another appearance soon, but feel they could have been explained more in this book too, not just literally popped up out of the ground, do something very minor then fly away.The Laura Youngblood storyline did not feel true or well thought out to me, would she be able to leave so suddenly? And I saw no evidence of the burn out she claimed to have. I can understand that the Tufo character needed to have a place in the chain of command but surely a squad of this size and nature could have had a hands on CO and a more background caretaker role which is all she seemed to have for me anyway.That said, all the humour comes from Tufo,  and his facial hair and the dead squirrel piece had me giggling for ages.There was an immense love story wrapped up in the middle of all this with some really intense sex scenes, but to end it so suddenly also felt rushed, and I felt cheated out of a good showdown between two amazing characters.The final battle, hmmmm&#8230;what happened? It just sort of went pop with no bang. I would have loved this section of the book to be so much bigger, all that build up to such a damp squib.The Sicarri was supposed to be some major player, some intense bad guy. So surely he had his own Generals, if so where were they? where was all his planning?  He just came across as a broody old man with no actual power. At the pinnacle of the battle the vamps were just allowed to just basically charge into a (excuse the pun) bloodbath annihilation. There was no sense of drama for me, no suspense element, so seat of my chair edge to the battle, it seemed very one sided.The only element of danger seemed to come from the (rolls eyes) &#8220;Jolly Hockey Sticks British Bloke&#8221; trying to kill someone on the good side.Then there is poor Dominic who spends 99% of this book trying to remember something, when he finally does a) it was not fully explained why it&#8217;s so important b) it was destroyed as an afterthought c) did not appear to be that important to start with.Lots of little threads of future stories were strung out but I felt that this main one, that started in book 2, just went nowhere.The writing is, as always, flawless in my opinion and I really enjoyed reading it, I just felt that it was rushed out to quick with not enough beta reading feedback (for those of you unsure of what this is &#8211; basically a  small group of people that give their opinion on the book before it gets published, to iron out any inconsistencies, timeline or story errors).So, am I still a Monster Squad fan&#8230; yes of course I am, 100%. The monsters are still there, the squad is basically hubba hubba, the humour is brilliant and the scope for great stories and spin offs is immense.Heath Stallcup is a phenomenal author and has some amazing ideas, just in my opinion he needs to slow down a little, make use of his skills and not disappoint his fan base, maybe even utilize them more.  Even the great SK has had his duds, and yes I would put HS up there with him.Final, overall opinion; well worth a read but remember that HS is still learning his art and that all reviews are good reviews!

I would just really prefer to keep what goes on between them, BETWEEN THEM. It's just that it is always a shock to open one of these books.But if anything, I feel that I would have been more absorbed in the story, if I were on the side of the fence it was written on. The subject matter was pretty good. I like the idea behind a human slayer and a vampire combo.

At first he isn't sure what's going on with the closet case but once they're both able to sit and talk over a violent misunderstanding, They're good. And take it one day at a time to overcome they're obstacles.I freakin LOVED how jealous and possessive Stitch was. He was almost psychotic about it and definitely rabid about it too. You hardly see a physical reaction from a jealous male in books, but I was so happy to see Stitch was NOT one of those and reacted to every moment even if it wasn't the greatest thing to do. The scenes with officer Cox always thru him over the edge, especially when it came to his Zak. I think the last situation with Cox was unfortunate and wish he hadn't been blinded by his feelings for Zak and hatred of Stitch. Anyways another thing I ABSOLUTELY LOVED was that Stitch was faithful to Zak. When it comes to bikers that almost never happens, but Stitch completely committed to Zak, which was why he wanted nothing less from Zak in return and man did he Make Zak see that and got what he wanted.This was totally freakin awesome and I can't wait to read the next. Hopefully it will be a guy from the Nails MC. they were really violent and on their A game at all times. Recommended.I also hope there's a sequel to this one and we get more of Zak and Stitch cause I was left wanting more with that ending. I want see how they settle down completely and start new.***ARC courtesy of K.A. Merikan in exchange for an honest review***

$review_text.: Another fun story from Adrienne Giordano. I really like the way Adrienne tells a story. She makes the characters very believable, in this case Lucie is a mob bosses daughter trying to leave the idea of her family behind, including the one she loves, Frankie. While trying to recover from loosing her job, she starts a business walking dogs and making accessories for them. Along the way, the unsavory circumstances she has tried to leave behind keep trying to catch up with her. She loves Frankie but thinks as another child of the mob, he is too involved in the life to separate his life for hers. I enjoyed the way the characters interact together and could really feel the "family" ties that Lucie is trying to get away from. I kept pulling for her to choose love and work with Frankie to create a future. I enjoyed it as a light summer read.

$review_text.: Book: A Vision of LucyAuthor: Margaret BrownleyPublisher: Thomas NelsonExpected Publication Date:  June 28th, 2011Source: Copy in exchange for review from booksneeze.comStar Rating: 5 out of 5I enjoyed this book and many different levels. This book came to me in a time I am grappling with trying to find employment and have turned to God many times to help lead my way. Her journey mirrored mine exactly and it helped me want to continue on my journey and not give up like I have headed towards many times.From the characters, the setting and time period everything was developed nicely and I felt instantly like Rocky Creek was my home away from home.  I have found a soft spot for historical romances, especially ones with as much character and thought has this one.Lucy, a budding photographer is met by accident after accident when attempting to shoot the perfect photograph. One day on an adventurous shoot she meets a man named David Wolf. This man ends up turning her life and the rest of the towns lives upside down. We discover dark secrets that have ripped families apart and discovered budding romances hidden but discovered by photographs taking by Lucy.I recommend this book to anybody looking a book that celebrates love and needs a little guidance in trying to find your place in the job world.

It's fairly interesting, but a lot of the things he talks about probably didn't really happen.  I'm fairly certain he and his band mates didn't really murder a group of border patrol guards (at least I hope not).  And there are some other incidents that are a bit hard to believe.  But it still makes for an interesting read, even if you can't tell what is real and what isn't.  Dee Dee's fans should enjoy this book.Thank you, Dee Dee, you're very wonderful.

$REVIEW.: The Be Care series by Angelia Vernon Menchan has quickly become a hit dramatic sitcom. We can wait for the next installment (episode). In this episode titled Sustainable Relationships, love is in the air all around. However, some shady things are taking place. Deep wants to marry Janice so badly he is willing to break his word to Alicia, Janice's mother to get his wish. Will he break his word and go against Alicia to have Janice say, "I do" sooner than anyone expected?Aquanetta has decided who she wants to be with. She is leaving her husband for her child's father, Charles. However, she is keeping her own secret. However, no one is a fool and Aquanetta has some explaining to do. But when her back is up against the wall, she will do what she has to do to move out the way of the firing quad of Bradley women. How far will Aquanetta go to keep from having to answering their questions?Kim and Winston, Jr are passing for a couple in a solid relationship. Both of them would prefer to be with other individuals, but unfortunately for them the people they are in love with are enjoying life with the ones they love.  Is this arrangement enough for the both of them?Sustainable Relationships have a few other people who are dabbling in new relationship connections. Some looks promising while others are rocky with no future at all. Ms. Menchan creates characters with strong interesting personalities. Even the needy ones have something good going for them. I recommend Sustainable Relationships and the other books in the Be Careful series to readers looking for a quick read that will leave them wanting more.The author provided a PDF copy for review purposes.Jennifer CoissiereWords Mosaic Reviews

$review_text.: There are so many superlatives about this book, I&#8217;m not sure where to begin
Author Niki Jilvontae has that rare ability to make you feel every human emotion and she won&#8217;t let go
The character development is amazing

The main character Lakea pulls at your heartstrings like you&#8217;re a marionette.Lakea has that most precious of human attributes; passion

Passion is what makes her love deeply but it is also what continually gets her into trouble

We know and feel there is a big and loving heart inside her but due to circumstances far beyond her control, there is a coat of armor around her heart
It&#8217;s a gripping, emotional rollercoaster from the first to the last sentence

Warning: there may be a few parts that will make you teary eyed.It starts out intense and builds from there
There is also a story within a story here


There is the story of a beautiful child who loses her innocence in the most brutal way
She spends most of her young life trying to navigate a brutal environment while carrying this emotional baggage


The story within this story is the romance between Lakea and the only love of her life, Jeremy


The romantic and the sexual parts of the story are real and among the best I&#8217;ve ever read

I highly recommend this emotional page-turner.

$REVIEW.: What a wonderful resource! I have been struggling with back pain and shoulder pain since I was 15 years old, and always searching for natural ways to relieve the pain. Especially for someone who works all day at a computer, this pain can be a constant nuisance. This yoga book is great for people who want something they can do on their own time. The poses are explained in very easy to follow language, and there are very clear pictures that illustrate each move. It tells you how long the exercise will take, and the exact benefits you can look to receive from using the specific exercises. The book is divided into the areas of the body in which you are experiencing problems or pain, so you can go right to the sections you need very quickly. It's well-written and easy to follow. Simply put, love it!

$REVIEW.: Incredible.That's the first thing that comes to mind reading the first few pages of Scott Kelly's `The Blue.' And why wouldn't it be? The protagonist, the artist named Derek, is being stalked by someone who may be--in all probabilities--planning to do him harm (to put it mildly). Derek's terror is many times made more sinister and intense because he happens to be one of those people afflicted with the rare condition of "face blindness." He might be face-to-face with his stalker, and he would not even recognize him.It begins with an accident. A car crash that's so deftly written you're left with a lurch of panic and a deep unsettling sense that something's about to slide downhill. `The Blue' does not disappoint--things do quickly slide downward, not downhill, but into a vortex of madness and terror. Thanks to Scott Kelly's kind of narrative, you feel as helpless and horrified, sensing (because you're no longer able to "see" people's faces) disaster at every turn. And as if that's not enough, as if trying to live life with face blindness is not unspeakably horrifying per se, here comes a stalker who, in Derek's increasingly agitated mental world, seems more frightening than death itself.Obviously, not something you might want to read at night--the mounting sense of panic might leave you wide awake until you've finished the book in one sitting. `The Blue' is something you can call a "tour de force" because it immediately sweeps you away and leaves you clinging desperately on the edge of your seat. It also introduces readers to the bizarre neurological condition called face blindness--yes, it exists--and this is something "fresh," because it opens a rich possibility for a new kind of terror--which is something the author so skillfully exploits.Add to that is Scott Kelly's tight, sharp language--his story-telling is such that your mind, as you read the novel, is laser-focused on the impending terror, which only adds to the story's exceedingly suspenseful plot. But more than that, this is a joy to read--almost like a literary novel--in the way the author weaves words and imparts his vision. Get a copy of this book now and experience it.

$REVIEW.: Review featured on www.books-n-kisses.com4.5 Hearts Such a charming story. I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. This is about a second chance at love and making the future right after messing up the past. The connection is immediate between Gwen and Ace, probably because they never stopped loving each other. And while you can understand that he had good intentions you wonder how he could have walked away so many years ago. This couple is just so sweet together. I would have loved more pages and wish there had been more to this story. I could have kept on reading for another 100 pages. While complete as it is I wanted more time with them. I hope we are given the chance to see more of them as the rest of the series unfolds.This is a great story to have ready between novels. To take an hour to yourself and sink into their lives. Great job by Marissa. Bring on the next in the series. I can&#8217;t wait.

$review_text.: This book has the wonderful original English text. Although much is lost in translation, the German translations by Antonie Zimmerman are very good. For example, Chapter 10, The Lobster Quadrille, is mostly English puns. German puns were substituted for the English ones, and therefore the two languages don't match up. Also, sometimes the German misses the humourous English turn of phrase, but at other times the German actually improves on the English. Overall the German is very accurate and straightforward, and it is helpful and enjoyable.This is a good book for students at the beginning-intermediate level. The alternating English and German is, in my opinion, the best way to practice reading German. Say goodbye forever to flashcards! Beginners will want a to keep a German dictionary open for study purposes while reading this, but intermediate students can mostly just read right through.I don't have one, but I understand that if you have a Kindle you can install a German-English dictionary and then just click on any German words you want to study and the English definition will pop right up. I have the PC Kindle program and the Android Kindle app, and you cannot do that on those.Special thanks to Joel Lehman for putting the English before the German and doing such a good job keeping the German and English up to the highest standards.

$REVIEW.: Lovelier Than Daylight by Rosslyn Elliott is the third book in the Saddlers Legacy. Susanna is on her way to Otterbein College when she stops to check on her sister. Only her sister is not at home. Neither are her sister's children.But her sister's husband is. He tells Susanna that Clara has run off with a man and has put all their children in an orphanage. Susanna can't believe her sister would such a thing and sets off to find them all.  With the help her aunt and uncle she searches until she finds them.That is the basic plot line of the story.  A sub-plot is a romance between Susanna and Johann Giere. Johann's family owns a brewery, which supplies alcohol to the man wanting to open a bar in the town of Westerville, where Susanna is attending college.Westerville has long been a dry town and they do not welcome the new establishment, and they work to drive it out of town.I know romance is not my preferred genre, and I am not especially fond of romance that is predictable. I am less fond of romance, or any genre, that has the name "Christian" on it that is as far as the "Christian" theme goes.I did not like this book. I thought Christians were villainized for not wanting the saloon in town.  Let's try and forget about Susanna's sister, Clara, who does have an affair, runs off with a man because she is pregnant with his child. Let's forget that she leaves her children at an orphanage because she chooses her lover over her children.I can not give this book any turning pages.

$review_text.: When Abi was small the Apocalypse happened. Her father and mother and some close family and friends went into a fall out shelter. They had enough provisions to last years but with resources running out they are now finally about to hit the topside. They are excited and nervous all at once but a few days before they are scheduled to leave something happens to make them scared. They can receive messages from other hives and they are told that when the Nuclear Fallout happened the government made &#34;vaccines&#34; but never tested the product properly. A side effect of the vaccine was that they created these mutants that are now topside. What will the family do? How will they manage to go to the Government safe zones which are surrounded with thousands of mutants? What will happen if they get there?I have to say that I loved this!!! For me Abi and Finn made this book so much better. I loved their relationship. They have been best friends since they went to the shelter and always have each others back. They would do anything for each other. I loved seeing their friendship develop into more.Abi was kick ass with a side of kick ass!! She is the hives best shooter and rarely misses. She is well able to pack a punch too. They were taught how to shoot and fight since they were old enough to hold a gun. She is thrust into this unknown world with these things and she really shines. She is the first person Id want on my Zombie fighting team. She is a strong, intelligent character and was by far my favourite.Finn is Abis best friend. Its only by accident that he ended up in the hive but Abi would be lost without him. He keeps her sane and they know each other so well. Finn was also kick ass and someone else you would want at your side in a Zombie attack. He looks out for Abi and cares deeply about her. He is kind, honest and hawt ;)For the first half of ARV-3 we see the gang struggling to reach the government safe zones and having to fight the Arvies. It was action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat. The time they were in the town was so scary and heartpounding. The author had a way of describing the scenes that completely emersed me into the action and had me breathless with anticipation.The second half has not as much action but plenty of anticipation. Are the safe zones really safe? Will they be the best thing for the group? Who makes it? Well you will have to read it to find out!!!Overall ARV-3 was awesome. The authors writing style just grabbed you and pulled you into the story. Its the type of book that when you are reading it you don't want it to finish. Its a pulse pounding read and one Id highly recommend. I cant wait to jump back into the lives of Abi and Finn and see what happens.

Following the calls she gets from men looking to be titillated, Leila, or &#34;Shawna&#34; as she's known to her callers, the story takes an intriguing turn when she breaks the cardinal rule: no emotional attachment to who she talks to.  Will taking a chance on a real-life connection cost her more than she's willing to bear?  Or has she found exactly what she's been seeking all along?  Definitely a must-read to find out this and be turned-on at the same time.

$review_text.: Why compete head on against competition in an already crowded market? Instead, create an entirely different market for yourself by reducing cost of your products and services while increasing value to the customers. This, of course, is MUCH easier said than done and it certainly has been written before.How does one implement the blue ocean strategy? There are four things:1)Eliminate the products and services which the customers do not want.2)Reduce factors which does not provide high value.3)Raise factors which adds value to the customer.4)Create factors which add value to the customer.Again, nothing I haven't heard or read before. The real value added by this book is its emphasis on the need to "think out of the box" and occassionally focus away from the narrow boundaries of comparative competitiveness, marketing, technology, and strategy. Rather, some attention should always be given to the dominant strategy of creating an entirely different market by offering different types of products and services to fulfill a yet unmet demand.

$REVIEW.: i've been reading a lot of books about innovation and leadership lately... the importance of creativity and ways to express it despite unsupportive conditions... mechanisms and disciplines neccessary to successfully navigate the powerful tides of change sweeping through your day-to-day business life... based on the description, Jolt! seemed to fit the bill and it certainly lived up to that billing... and though i didn't know who Phil Cooke is, i was pleasantly surprised to learn that he also penned a book called Branding Faith which i haven't read, but have been intrigued by since its realease...Now, on to Jolt!... let me first say.. i found a typo on the first page... the FIRST PAGE... this isn't uncommon - i find typos in books a lot, it's kind of a knack... unfortunately, it's also a huge distraction that often prevents me from concentrating solely on what i'm reading... i took it as a sign and bore down to focus on the book and not the typos (yes, i found more)... i'm glad i did...the book breaks things down into different areas of life and a journey to success... the introduction offers many interesting facts and trends that set the stage for our need to adapt to the changing world around us... which leads into our need for direction, priorities, creativity, fanbase, and focus... these are not new topics but it was refreshing to have them discussed in new ways because these types of books can become repetitive...Jolt! manages to avoid the stereotypes and offer real, personal advice to help motivate and navigate the twists and turns of life... it's spiritual without being condescending, practical without being simplistic, and motivational without being trite... also of note, the quotes interspersed throughout the pages complement the message nicely and really add value to the book... all in all, a great read - one that's hard to put down when you're reading and harder to walk away from without changing...- from trudatmusic[dot]com[slash]raw

$REVIEW.: I've never read anything else by Mike Resnick, & now I know how lucky I used to be. As a student of western history & an avid reader of steampunk fiction I was hoping for something really good here. The potential was there & the idea was good but in spite of all that, this was one of the most boring & poorly written excuses I've ever read. Virtually devoid of action, it relies instead on endless, dragging dialog & lame attempts at humor. Turning Bat Masterson into an actual bat isn't inventive or funny, it's stupid; & the whole "metal whores" (robots...big deal) thing was beaten right into the ground. Much is made of brass buildings(?), electric stagecoaches, streetlights, & bulky guns that are little more effective than the ones they're made to replace, etc. as so-called technological wonders. The illustrations don't even match up to the text - Ringo is described as missing fingers but his picture clearly shows him with all ten intact, and Doc Holliday "frail" & "sandy haired" looks alot like Frank Stallone, black hair & all. If you want a western that's long on conversation that works along with the action, Robert B. Parker's 'Appaloosa' series is very good, & for steampunk out west, Cherie Priest is a fine choice. I won't waste any more time or money on Mike Resnick.

$REVIEW.: I, like a lot of people, was slightly nervous about this book because I've never really read M/M romance, but as always Tina Folsom did not disappoint.Thomas has always been a character I loved. From his first appearance in Samson's Lovely Mortal where he was sadly betrayed to my favorite moment in Amaury's Hellion when he had to rescue Amaury from the confinements of his bed. (I don't think I'd ever laughed so hard!)Eddie is a softy at heart. He's sweet and caring, but his obsession with worrying about what everyone else would think is frustrating. I wanted to smack some sense into him!I loved how their relationship evolved from mentor/mentee, to friendship, to more. Much, much more! This book held my interest to the point that I couldn't put it down. Thomas and Eddie had me hooked.Let's not forget about the sex, because as always in the Scanguards Vampires series there are some very hot sex scenes. And this one is no different. Thomas's Choice is filled with scenes that range from WOW to HOT DAMN and everything in between.I loved it!

$review_text.: After reading the very last sentence on the very last page, my first reaction is WOW.  I say this for a couple of reasons.  First, I am not ordinarily a shifter reader and second, how in the world can a shifter who turns into a Yorkie be sexy?  This is where the "wow" factor comes in.  Never have I read a book  that has thrown my preconceptions out the window as this book has.  Very early in the book, the first shifter scene actually, it is evident how being able to turn into a cute little dog works to Drake's advantage.  His reaction to what he turns into was priceless and made me laugh out loud. A very important part of the book is the beginning.  Although the pacing does seem a  little slow at first, this is where the foundation lies for the rest of the book.  No worries though, when the book does pick up, it is a very fast paced action packed book.Drake Martin and Kady Harley have a relationship like none I've ever read before.  It was fascinating how Mike and Cynthia Arsuaga have developed these two characters in such a tender way.  They are able to bond in a way a normal couple never can.  The loyalty that Drake shows toward Kady touched my heart and made me just want to say aww[...]  As the book develops, so does the relationship between these two exciting and funny characters.  The heat level between Drake and Kady soars and I'm more than surprised that my book didn't spontaneously combust!  I am a die hard romantic suspense reader who loves humor sprinkled throughout the pages of whatever it may be that I am reading.  My Life as a Dog had me laughing out loud at moments and holding my breath at others.  This is, hands down, a book that captured my attention and kept it there.I would like to tell Mike and Cynthia Arsuaga BRAVO!  It is not very often that I can say a book changed my opinion about an entire genre.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in paranormal romance.  Please keep in mind that some scenes are very erotic and may offend those who aren't interested in erotic.  Otherwise, I suggest you run out and buy this book.  Read at your leisure because you don't want to miss one thing.  I enjoyed my time spent reading My Life as a Dog and look forward to reading more from these authors.

$review_text.: The Baker's Wife is a true page turner, full of action, suspense, and mystery. It brings up some of the challenges many of us face today in our own congregations as a Pastor Geoff is fired from his job after some horrible accusations from Sergeant Jack Mansfield. Geoff and his wife, Audrey, are then led to open a bakery . One early morning on her way to work, Audrey hits a scooter belonging to Julie Mansfield, Jack's wife. There is blood everywhere, but Julie's body can't be found. There are a few things that make Jack believe that Geoff and Audrey are involved in some sort of foul play, but there's not enough evidence to convict them. Now Audrey must find out what happened to Julie before Jack decides to take matters into his own hands. This was one of the best books I've read in a long time! It was filled with just enough mystery to keep me reading but not too much that it made it hard to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery along with a reminder about judgment, forgiveness, and compassion!I received this eBook free from Thomas Nelson publishing through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

$review_text.: The 5:2 diet cookbook is a great book to introduce people the intermittent fasting type of diet. This cookbook covers the history of how this diet came about and some of the different cultures that practice this diet and have for many years. It is very interesting to learn how long this type of diet has been active in some cultures and further more why it is healthy and works well for people. The diet does state that people may eat whatever they like on their non-fasting days, but the book also offers healthy options for the non-fasting days that are just better for people&#8217;s diets in general. Great recipes and lots of beneficial information on how to start this diet easily and right away. I can&#8217;t wait to give it a try!

It's a good book, very different, very entertaining
Justice is swoony as f*ck
You really don't figure out his deal until like the very last part of the book
This book is funny, but also obviously sexy


Ally is awesome
I would've liked to see a little of her POV, but I really enjoyed the whole book from his POV

I love the male POV in books

The reason this book is not getting 5 stars is the ending
It felt off, incomplete maybe? It's a good ending, I enjoyed the way the question was asked

If you could only..


The reason for 4 stars is what happened next? Can I get an epilogue? You can't build up to that, let all that happen, then just blam be done


This book was definitely not as &#34;erotic&#34; as I thought it would be reading the description
There are some pretty smexy parts, but all in all it's not over the top.

$REVIEW.: What do I think... ?First: I LOVE the cover art. It reminds me of something my dad used to have hanging on the wall back in the 70s. Truly is beautiful.Second: I truly enjoyed the theme of the book -- a young woman is forced to make a HUGE change in her life and journals it through her hair. I'm not sure how many of us are consciously aware of what we do to ourselves and how it correlates to the state of our heart. Mahogany Brown's journey from rocking weaves to afro puffs was emotional (I've been transitioning for a few years and have yet to do a Big Chop despite a strong desire to). Although the moment of the BC wasn't a surprise, and the appearance of the sagely, bohemian sister-in-law a bit trope (I have one of those, too), I found these women 100% relatable.Third: Mahogany's romantic situation was believable. I can see how she was with Vinny. How they managed to stay in a relationship as long as they had. It actually kind of made me scared for my daughter who is a college freshman (not that I'm trying to marry her off); I don't want her to be with someone by default to look up in ten years and realize the truth about them. That's what happened to Mahogany (ugh. That name grated on me until she explained the reasoning behind it towards the end of the book).Fourth: This is what didn't earn the book more stars for me. Trent. Mahogany goes through this huge break up, and rightfully, she's worried about her cubicle-mate who has the reputation of being a bit of an a-hole. Maybe I nodded off or something, but aside from her internal narration about her struggle to keep it together in front of Trent, I felt nothing pass between them. Sure, he was aloof, but the whole tension between them felt forced. I understand it was the result of a misunderstanding, but it needed a little more finessing. When Trent's actions reveal his feelings to the reader (a little too quickly, IMO), he's more of a sad sack than hardened man.Yes, Mahogany lets her defenses down with Trent a little bit, then he's all in love, but she's hung up on Vinny. And then Vinny's sister shows up. Then Vinny shows up beating on his chest. Yeah... I could live without love triangles.I wish there was more time getting to know Trent. He's not a major player in the book--her hair is. The haircare tips are cool. I want to try some of the styles suggested, but I wanted a little more connection with Trent. His family was great, but all of that was so rushed. That's saying something for me, the non-romantic romance reader.Perhaps my issues with the book lie in that it is a first person POV and I prefer third. Trent is an interesting character. Mahogany is too, but out of them all, I'd rather spend more time with Trent and the sister-in-law.Fifth: The author sets scenes nicely. There was minimal time wasted on clothing details, although I rolled my eyes at some brand name dropping. Ms. DuBois did an excellent job painting a clear picture of the people and places in Mahogany's life.All-in-all: I liked the book. It isn't a bad use of time or three bucks. It is cleanly written with minimal grammatical errors. Above all, it's a cute, fun read, but I only 'liked it.' I really wanted to 'love it.'

$review_text.: Harry Nichols is the best of the CIA paramilitary men available to the country, but with the bombing death of CIA Director David Lay he is going to find himself on the back side of a threat and deception that is unbelievable.David Lay left a message for Harry, get my daughter to safety and keep her there.  Harry will do that and find out that it has far more danger and mystery to it than it should have.  Who wanted David Lay dead?  Better yet, why do they also want his daughter dead?  Is it the Russians, the Iranians or some other foreign set of bad guys?  Or could it be people from our own government?  Why?Stephen England develops a classic novel with classic good guys verses bad guys and you don't always know which category some of those people fall into.  It also involves Harry having to bring in past recruits to help him solve the crisis and keep David Lay's daughter alive.  These people are "dysfunctional" or are they?  Maybe Harry knows things about them that the Clandestine Service of the U.S. has written off.The intrigue of this novel is that the deceit goes all the way to the Power Centers of Washington D.C.  Even the President will have a hand in some of the action, although it is very quiet and behind the scenes.My only disappointment in the book is that many good people get killed off.  Many good U.S. agents who are loyal to the U.S. get hurt or killed because of the Power Hungry Narcissist who run our spy agencies, FBI and other government agencies.  I have always wanted to have good hero's who can take care of business without hurting the innocents, but in reality that can't always happen and Stephen reminds us of that in his novel.Harry will inspire you, scare you, intrigue you all at the same time.  You will cheer for him, you will despise him, you will want him to win and then you will want him to loose, all at the same time.How will Harry survive?  How will David Lay's daughter survive?  What about David Lay, why did someone want him dead?  Oh, and finally, will our hero be able to save the day or will we finally see a novel where America looses and the good guy goes down in flames.Enjoy!

Bennett did a terrific job not only keeping me on the edge of my seat wondering what the hero and heroine would do next, the quality of her writing is good enough to be on par with many of the full length, bestselling novels I have read.

My only negative is from an editorial standpoint -- when the husband's ghost begins to take over the story there should have been something to divide the transition such as a line, or even a new chapter. I was three paragraphs in, confused and lost in what happened to the story, when I realised that it was the ghost speaking.

$REVIEW.: Overall, I really enjoyed Fusion, the second and final installment in The Patrick Chronicles. Personally, I liked the first novel in this two-book series slightly more, but I still really enjoyed this story. The main reason I enjoyed Fissure slightly more than Fusion was because Patrick and Emma spent a lot more time together in Fissure than Fusion. Because of the way that Fissure ended, Patrick and Emma were separated for the majority of the first half of Fusion. Another thing I noticed while reading this novel was that their relationship matured a lot. The fun and flirty relationship that we all fell in love with in Fissure becomes a lot more serious in Fusion. I really enjoyed watching them become a "serious" couple. It was the necessary step for them to take, but at the same time, I missed the fun, flirty banter that I fell for in Fusion.Like I said in my review of Fissure, I love Patrick Hawyard. He's a fabulous character! He's charming and sexy and he doesn't alway think before he speaks! His mouth sometimes gets him into trouble, but I really like that about him! I loved watching him mature in this novel. For the first time in his life, he really learns what it's like to put someone else before himself. In the end, I really respected him for the choices he made.I'm very surprised with the direction the author took with this book. I don't mean that in a negative way at all. I'm just shocked with the way things turned out. I guess I had predicted for things to turn out a certain way and they didn't turn out that way at all! It's a really good ending. It just wasn't the ending I was expecting. I definitely give Ms. Williams lots of points for being able to shock me! It's not the easiest thing to do, but she was able to do just that!I gave Fusion (The Patrick Chronicles #2) by Nicole Williams 5 STARS. My advice: read the Eden trilogy and then The Patrick Chronicles. You can't go wrong with either series!-XOXOREADING, EATING AND DREAMING

However, her past isn't making that easy. She's waking up in the middle of the night with nightmares and is barley getting any sleep, not to mention she keeps having flashbacks of things she'd much rather forget....Then, she meets Marcus.......Marcus has the worst reputation, but is intrigued by Amber. He keeps bumping into Amber everywhere, but she won't give him the time of day. But then Marcus offers to help Amber with her math, and suddenly he doesn't just want to have a hook-up. He finds that he wants to know her more and wants to finally share his painful past with someone...Tell Me When is told from dual points of view. It is an amazing story about two damaged people, trying to move on from their pasts. This story deals with some very heavy subject matter and my heart broke when I discovered what happened to both Amber and Marcus. I loved Marcus' character. He was very supportive and patient with Amber and really helped her deal with her issues. I thought their relationship was great and I enjoyed watching them fall in love.It's hard to believe that this a Stina Lindenblatt's debut novel. I thought that the story was very well written and I had a hard time putting it down. I really enjoy story's about broken people searching for their happily ever after and this was well done.

$review_text.: I sort of want to give this book 4 stars because I love Ruthie Knox and I love these characters... but this book was so long and scattered that I can't! I mean, it took me a month to finish it. A MONTH!I think this book probably works best in serial format. There are 10 serial installments that make up &#34;The Complete Adventure,&#34; and reading them back to back shows just how varied in quality each installment is. At 516 pages, this is a loooong read, but it feels much longer due to the fact that some portions drag and others are repetitive.Which is a huge bummer because these characters are fantastic.I loved Roman and Ashley. I got such a complete sense of who they were, what drove them, what inspired them, and why they gravitated towards each other. Ruthie Knox did SUCH a fabulous job of making them realistic and fully fleshed out.The dialogue was also great. Witty, surprisingly sexy, and endearing.I wish this book was cut down by at least 100 pages because then I could give my 4 stars, which I'm dying to do because Ruthie Knox is one of the few M/F contemporary authors that I like to read.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**

$review_text.: I bought this book because I liked the projects pictured in it. I've been knitting for a couple of years, but mostly I've made socks, and I was going to use this to branch into making hats and sweaters.It seems to me that the patterns themselves took a distant second place to making the layout and design of the book &quot;hip&quot; looking. All the patterns are lumped together in paragraphs instead of stepped out into easily discerned rows. There seems to be plenty of room for pictures, white space, and whimsical design, but I bought the book for the patterns, and they're hard to read.In order to make the instructions clear, I have had to take the paragraphs the patterns are lumped into and turn them into steps that make sense and actually have a beginning and an end. For a more advanced knitter, this might not be a problem, but when I'm doing something new to me I like the instructions to be clear and stepped out. (I write documentation for a living, so this may be a personal quibble.)I also think that the designer makes assumptions that the knitter using the book can read between the lines and fix things or understand things that are not expressly stated in the pattern. In my case, at least, that led to having to rip back several hours worth of work because I did exactly what the pattern said without reading between the lines to something it should have said.I still want to make the things in the book, and I'm going to keep trying and working with it, so I'll give it three stars. I don't hate it. I would just warn anyone who is a very beginning knitter not to approach this book without the help of an experienced knitter to make the unwritten instructions clear.

Even though Jonathan Quinn is not a killer He is hired to clean up and leave no trace evidence of what happened, no matter what.  In this short story we learn alot about Quinn and the mold he is cut from.  I realized Quinn was much more of a kinder gentler human than I oroginally thought.While his Mentor Durrie appears to have no heart, Quinn chooses to remember he is a human and treat a man caught in the crossfire with kindness. While I love a full 300 + pages of Quinn, this is a must read shortie. I loved every bit of it, of course it left me longing for more Quinn but the full novels do that as well.

$review_text.: When it came to Jesse Walker, it was tight jeans or no jeans.-Loc 635What can I possibly say to express my love for these characters??? I can tell you that the minute I got my ARC, I dropped what I was reading to read this one
I'll tell you that Jesse Walker is possibly one of the best book boys ever! And Rowen...she's pretty darn fabulous! NEAR & FAR was clearly one of my most anticipated reads
I loved every minute of this book!I'm going to start with Jesse

I feel like this was Jesse's book
He's still solid, charming, reliable, sexy, and one of the most honest guys you'll ever meet
But, Jesse has a really dark past
One that he's managed to overcome with the help of his family

While things seem to be going great for Jesse and Rowen, there are pressures and stress that surface that cause some of his darker side to reappear

Trying to manage a long distance relationship is hard enough, but suffocating by memories of his past are nearly debilitating
However, Jesse and Rowen make sure to figure out ways to see each other regularly
The problem is, Jesse wants Rowen to see him as the sturdy, positive guy she fell in love with


He doesn't want her to see the wounded soul beneath."...Men like him weren't put on this planet so that women could keep their hands to themselves."-Loc 161Rowen is awesome

In Lost & Found, we met a girl who was ignored and mistreated her whole life

She had some pretty dark secrets of her own

She was distant, appeared to be indifferent, and she was most definitely self destructive


Not only was Jesse a great support for her, but his family was too
She was able to open up and let people care about her

In this book, we see a more confident Rowen
She's at art school pursuing her dream of becoming an artist

And honestly, she's doing great


She getting interest in her art and she's met some good friends
But, she really misses Jesse and his family
What stood out the most for me in this book with Rowen was how solid she has become
She has become the one to stay strong

Rowen was really there for Jesse, once he let her in, and I felt proud of her and the woman she's become


I know that might sound cheesy, but Rowen has come a long way

It's always nice to see a character's growth.While Jesse and Rowen are battling demons and trying to find a way to get through it together, we also have Garth Black

Ok, here's the thing about Garth; I wasn't all that impressed with Garth in the first book

He wasn't exactly a likable character

But, the author let me post a teaser last week and it featured Garth


I loved his banter with Rowen! So, I said to the author "You're going to make me fall in love with Garth, aren't you?" Sure enough, I did
Garth and Jesse have patched up their relationship a bit


Garth still isn't very nice, but his intentions are actually good! He played an instrumental role in helping Jesse and Rowen with their issues in this book
 He and Rowen are a lot alike

Garth Black certainly has a tale to tell and I can't wait to read it!Overall, I absolutely loved this book! I was laughing, crying, swooning, and crying again


Basically, I was all over the board with the feels

I'm a bit sad that Jesse and Rowen's story has come to a close, but I couldn't have been happier with the ending


This couple truly was made for each other
They balance one another superbly
I feel like I'm forgetting something to share, but really all you need to know is that this is a must read series! Go get started on it now!Quotes:~"Really

Because whether supposed to be flies out of the window tonight, or tomorrow, or fifty years from now, I'm not going anywhere because I'll always want to be with you."-Loc 711~"Thank you for saving me, Rowen
Thank you for coming and saving me."I lifted my hand to his face and traced each fervent wrinkle until it disappeared

"I didn't save you, Jesse


I just helped you remember how to save yourself."-Loc 4204~"There are high points, and there are high points

That was mine, having a man like Jesse Walker to love and love me back, and knowing that no matter what came our way, we'd be ready for it.-Loc 4204

$REVIEW.: If you're new to prepping, this is a great guide to get you headed in the right direction

 It doesn't provide much in the way of DETAILED instructions or information but it absolutely will get you thinking about your strengths and weaknesses
 For example, the chapter on food supplies begins by having you track what you eat

 So many people go out and buy buckets of freeze-dried foods or 50-pound bags of rice and beans


 That's fine if you normally eat rice, beans, and freeze-dried food


 If you don't, you might just be wasting your money and, if you have to get into your preps, you might just be torturing yourself with your own groceries right in the middle of an already-bad situation


 The book also provides insights into making actual emergency plans, first aid kits, and even cooking without electricity


 I heartily recommend this book to new preppers and, in particular, to urban preppers.

$REVIEW.: If this guy ever forms a supergroup, what would it be - the Rules of Justice?Then you could have Law Man, Theorem Girl, Mr Proof, Lady Lemma, Corollary Woman, and Captain Hypothesis teaming up with him.Axiom-Man is a rookie superhero, who operates in Winnipeg. It appears a strange blue guy in a computer delivered him his abilities, strength, flight and energy blasts from his eyes. Axiom-beams?This short book alternates between his origin, and his current situation. That being, he has an average ordinary job in a call centre, and pines over the vapid chick in a nearby cubicle, whose intellectual thought of the day is 'which superhero should I have the hots for'?He has to deal with the nuts and bolts himself, making a costume, hoping not to sweat while wearing it at work, nicking in to the lunch room to check the tv for emergency news. His boss, of course, is telling him off a lot for being late, ducking out of work, all the usual.Everything changes when a new superhero turns up named Redsaw. Axiom-Man discovers he can tell when he is nearby, and there is a strange black cloud around that possibly have something to do with it.A subplot revolves around the activities of Redsaw, and the problems of where he gets his powers from.Needless to say, these two come into conflict over working methods, and the call centre cheerleader is in there somewhere.This is a straight superhero story, the main character, Gabriel, is an complete boy scout type. He is trying to be nerdier as a disguise, and trying to do good, as you see when the US military tries to recruit him.It is obviously set up to continue in another installment, as towards the end you find out that the advent of these two superbeings has religious overtones, and Axiom-Man appears to be on a mission, Blues Brothers style, with Redsaw theologically opposed, presumably.This is all quite well done, except for the odd typos early on (a car has breaks for example). However, this is at a lower rate than some of the huge publisher efforts I have seen recently.Recommended for a bit of old-school superheroing.

$review_text.: Something I've noticed after several years of reading books by Stephanie Tyler and that is a constant

The constant being how easy it is to let go and get lost in her sexy military and black op thrillers and this most certainly holds true after reading Lonely Is The Night, the 5th and final book in the Shadow Force series

I applaud and thank her for gifting us with this much anticipated and final chapter of the guys of Shadow Force

Like all good things, I hated to see it end but knowing each and every tortured hero in the group got his much deserved happily ever after helps to soften the blow.Our couple, Grier and Reid met in the previous book, the attraction was there from the start, and they hooked up fairly quick


Problem was, she wasn't ready to admit to herself or him that there was a real connection and not just sex

Plus, there wasn't a whole lot of trust between them for reasons you'll have to read to find out


They were working on the same side of the law but she likes rules and black and white, where Reid worked most of the time in the gray


Grier didn't believe in the gray and wasn't willing to compromise even though Reid saved her on several occasions from an early grave

Grier is a strong as nails type of character and though Reid is quite the alpha, he's also a no nonsense caring kind of guy with a lot of paitence


My favorite thing about him was though he knew he was in love with her and didn't have a problem expressing it, he let her figure out her feelings without pressuring her
She was stubborn to the core but he never tried to change her.Fans of the series will be pleased to know Kell and Reid resolved their differences and are back to being best friends

All the loose ends were tied up and everything and everyone was set to live a happy, successful, fulfilling life in and around Mace's place which now technically belongs to all of them.As with all the others, this one grabbed me from the first page and I hung on until the last page
There is a lot of fast paced action to keep you on the edge of your seat with moving and multiple story lines

With this being a novella, the secondary story in this one is not as detailed, and the epilogue left me in shock, YES, shock when it was over
I can only HOPE with all of my being that there's a future story in the works, some kind of a spin-off because no one could be that cruel


lolIt's always fun to watch an author transform and grow in her craft
Each book became steamier and the characters and stories demonstrated more depth

This series went out with a bang and Stephanie Tyler definitely saved the best for last


If you are a fan you will be satisfied

If you have not read the series or anything else by ST and you like steamy suspense thrillers with mega hot, not so perfect men, and strong likable female characters you should try it

If you're still on the fence, how about motorcycle clubs, Marshalls, military men, black ops, fight clubs and a tattoo artist? And that was just in this book, the others are just as action packed.Enjoy!4.5 StarsReview copy provided for an honest review.

 Instead I found help with the Chi Kung and the flow of energy

$review_text.: Great read, but written in an unusual style. Letters and diaries tell the thinking of a great man in his efforts to secure our independence from Britain. We can see the true character and beliefs of both John and Abigail Adams. While being devoted to each other, they were willing to sacrifice so much of their private life together along with their fortune because of their strong conviction for independence. It also gives you insight into other Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and Ben Franklin through letters that describe actual thoughts Adams had while evolved with them in various aspects of government. Some thoughts are favorable while other thoughts are not.

$REVIEW.: Only those of a certain age will actually remember - let alone have read - Al Capp and Lil' Abner


For those who do, this is a fascinating, extremely well-written and researched biography of Al Capp which I highly recommend

As I did, I suspect you will learn much about him and his impact on American society and slang that you never knew


For those who never heard of Al Capp, it's still great reading as a slice of American history with which the reader will be unfamiliar.

$review_text.: The unique approach to a biblical book used by the authors is a good idea:  there is a pre-quiz to test what you know, followed by the biblical passage, the authors' explanation of the meaning, and the quiz answers

 As I began to read, I looked forward to learning much about this mysterious book.I concluded that three out of the four parts were effective;  the one consistently weak link were the meaning sections, as they typically were more brief that the biblical passage, often either merely restating the passage or offering an unsupported viewpoint

 As an example, in explanation of the meaning of chapter 17, verses 1 through 4, the authors say, &#34;The 'scarlet beast' represents government

 The 'woman' represents religion.&#34;  Repeatedly as I read, I found myself thinking, &#34;How do we know that?&#34;A better name for this book would have been &#34;The Book of Revelation Made Simple&#34; or &#34;One View of the Book of Revelation&#34;, for this great book is made clear only to those who either know no other views or who know other views but believe in a pre-Tribulation rapture


 Only those would find the title apt, as no other views of Revelation are even mentioned, much less considered.This book presents the authors' view in a straightforward and simple way, so their view of Revelation is made clear
 If that narrow focus is what you want, then this book is for you


 If you are hoping for a scholarly discussion, or even one that justifies its viewpoints or considers several interpretations about the book of Revelation, look elsewhere.I received this book in exchange for my review of it.

$REVIEW.: After I tell you how cute this book is and how it's a great summer beach/pool/lake read (it was!), I have to point out that this blurb just doesn't fit the book (of course, I did get the blurb off the back of an ARC but it's also like that on Amazon, so I'm not sure if they changed it for the printing or not). First off, while Laurel is one of the two main characters, she's not the one telling the story. That quote in italics up there? Is from Aspen, the main-main character and the one telling the story (in first person). Now, Laurel, she's the spark plug, the "naughty" (more adventurous and bored than anything) one who drags Aspen into all kinds of trouble over the summer but she's not actually doing any of the telling.Oh, how I love summer books. There's just something about the lightness, the freedom that comes with summer -- heat, sunshine, lemonade, crappy summer jobs so you have enough money to buy the clothes you want rather than what Mom'll buy you, flirting with cute boys, and freedom. This book speaks to all that (though Aspen and Laurel do manage to lose their freedom several times during their summer adventures) and made me long for summer.Aspen reminds me a lot of myself when I was her age. She's got one best friend who she does everything with, she's kind of easily influenced and talked into things that aren't always the best ideas, and she has a hard time standing up for herself and saying no. This gets her in all kinds of trouble with her parents, the police, Laurel, and the local bully-boys (Holy cow, I hate them. Mean as snakes, those boys are! Yes, I'm channeling my inner Yoda.). But she learns from her mistakes and grows as an individual through those experiences.Then there's the boy. Clay. The ginger with the electric blue eyes. He sees her at her very worst (Stinking of pig poop? Check. Busted by the cops? Check. Puking her guts out after too much Jungle Juice? Check.) and still likes her. All throughout the book, we're teased by the possibility of a relationship. Aspen's brother keeps telling her that Clay likes her. Aspen melts when she sees him. But nothing happens for the longest time. So frustrating! (But realistic, especially in regards to this character.)Aspen and Laurel are very cute teens just trying to have a good summer before their last year in high school. A&L; DO SUMMER is a fast, sweet, funny story that had me cringing (uhg, when Aspen drank so much at that barn party -- poor girl. Been there, tossed my cookies like that.) and rooting for the girls. I definitely recommend this one.

$REVIEW.: I use this book again and again. It is more useful than anything I can find online because I can obtain all the info I need in a short amount of time. Chris Gore's help, with this book and on his panels at film-related events, have aided me to no end. When I played my first short film at festivals, the book proved INVALUABLE to me.I post regularly on a messageboard for independent filmmakers and my response to MANY people's questions is usually &quot;Buy the Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide&quot;.One unique aspect of this book is that, in addition to interviewing filmmakers who got their films sold, he also features a woman who admittedly made a bad film and met alot of failure with it. Being able to see the other side of the story really helps you see what NOT to do with your film before, during, and after production when you are marketing it.In addition to buying Chris' book, you should also try to make it to a panel if he is going to be in your area. I saw him twice: once at a comic convention and another time at a film festival I was playing my short at. I was so happy to tell him personally how helpful his book had been. At one of his panels I learned of another filmmaker that was in between success and failure. He had succeeded in making a well reviewed film that played in several prestigious festivals, BUT no distributor would buy his film! So there are some hard lessons to be learned by these examples, but I digress...This is TRULY the best Film Festival related book out there for an independent filmmaker. If you want to succeed, attend one of Chris' panels to ask him personally what you need and BUY THIS BOOK. I swear by it!

$review_text.: An absolutely fascinating book that covers a lot more than just the B-70. The early 1950's were a time when anything could be done by the military. The B-70 Valkyrie was one project. It was a beautiful plane, the culmination of big, fast, high-flying manned bombers.Unfortunately at that time there were simply too many such projects. The whole century series fighter program was under way, several missile projects, the Dyna-Soar project, and unfortunately by the end of the development program the Viet Nam War. At the same time, anti-air defense systems were increasing in capabilities -- witnes Gary Powers and the U-2 incident.This book is truly splendid in its story of the times. While it is mostly on the B-70, it's table of contents reads, in part, as follows:The Atomic Powered AirplaneThe Mach 3 fighter - XF-103 and XF-108High Energy FuelsAll of these projects were underway, not a single one made it into production.Beautiful book, beautifully illustrated with hundreds of photographs, drawings and illustrations of the concepts of the atomic plane and the conceptual drawings that eventually led to the B-70.

$REVIEW.: It's rare anymore that I have time to read books, so if I'm going to pick one up, it has to be very interesting for me to spend the time on it


That being said, I read Seers in about two days because I couldn't put it down


In fact, I sat up all night finishing it because I wanted to know what was going to happen, and then I had to force myself to go to bed rather than pick up the sequel, Demons.Heather does a great job creating characters


Kate is sympathetic in both the loss of her parents and in her stange new "ability" (seeing others' auras)
She can't tell anyone of her ability because they all think she's crazy
Only her quirky best friend Lee knows

Enter her hot guardian, Patrick, who's been sent to protect her against the Demons hunting her


Long, lingering looks and kisses that'll curl your toes punctuate a complicated relationship

Grandpa Henry, the twins, Patrick's partner, the irrepressible Toni, even Aaron who's desperately trying to save his relationship with Kate - all of them play an important role in the story.The book also has an amazing cover

Kudos to whoever designed the cover for Heather
It's fantastic.Seers is a great beginning to the trilogy telling Kate's story, and I'm beyond excited for the next two books in the series
In case you don't know Heather's story, she wrote the entire trilogy during her summer break from school, which makes it even more amazing that not only is Seers so well-written with brilliant characters, but the plot is something that I'd think would take a lot more planning


I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: With only 3 reviews, I was hesitant to buy this book but the price is right and I love this genre of books.  The main character is very likeable and so are his friends.  Like the X-men, each of them possesses a special ability.  This book would make a great movie with all the fight scenes.  It was difficult to speed read this book because of the complicated fight sequences.  I have a hard time picturing it unless I slow down.  Another reason to read more carefully is the scene changes.  The author moves you from place to place within a single chapter and from one perspective to another. I am reading the next book and it is like a mystery novel with little pieces falling into place.  So far I like the first book better.  There are more character development in the first book.

$review_text.: I bought this story after reading about the author on a Facebook posting.  She is friends with one of my Facebook friends (I only have a few) who is respected novelist and poet.  Anyway, I read about Eugie Foster and saw that this story or novella had won the Nebula award.  It is somewhere between fantasy and Science Fiction.  I think a lot of people who like fantasy would rate this 5 stars.  It is certainly and innovative story (although it has some antecedents in movies and perhaps stories or novels that I am unaware of) and is worth buying for the Kindle.  I will probably read it again several times to catch the things I missed on my first reading.So I would recommend it for fantasy fans.  If you want hard science SciFi then you may be slightly disappointed.  However, I don't think there is anything in the story that violates the known limits of physics, chemistry, and neuroscience.

$review_text.: I gave this book 4.5 Stars*I'd like to thank the author for giving me a free copy of this book, in exchange for my honest review.*This book was really good

There were lots of wonderful and interesting themes hidden in it, and I liked the main character
I hated it when I had to put it down, so I read through it in one sitting

It's a great dystopian, with an awesome depth to it.The main character, Ven, was really interesting

She was an imitation, or clone
In this world, only the very rich could afford them, and when they were sent out on assignment to replace their "Authentic", they never came back

This is because once an imitation went on assignment, and served their purpose, they were terminated

Therefore, the day she received her note for assignment, Ven faced death

She continued to face it all throughout the novel, but along the way, she discovered that she had feelings for Linc that were real
It took her a long time to realize that, because she kept wondering how she could have them, when she was just a copy
I loved it, but it also made me sad for Ven, because her feelings were real


She felt for the poor, was thankful for all of the things her servants would do for her, and she just wanted to be free, and live for herself


I think that Ven and all her feelings was one of my favorite things about this novel.The love interest, Linc, was really well-written
As a bodyguard, he was really used to not being treated well by Raven, Ven's Authentic
So when Ven came along, and started breaking down his barriers, it was really fun to watch

Linc himself was a very compassionate guy, and he was very protective of those who were important to him


He was a lot of good for Ven, I think, especially towards the end

I loved watching the two of them together.There were a lot of side characters in this book, but none that we really got to know


Ven's friends were introduced in the beginning of the story, but not much is known about them since she left soon after
I'm definitely interested in getting to know more about them, and hope we see them both in future novels
Titus was pretty awful, treating Ven like a thing, and like she was his property
I hated that, because he was using her as bait, not caring whether she lived or died


And then there's Daniel, who was creepy, and a lot of other things
To say more about that would be a spoiler, but in any case, I think the next books in this series will deepen the side characters a lot more, and I can't wait to see what happens.The plot of this novel was interesting, with Ven having to replace Raven, after people attacked her
There was a lot more action and fighting than I was suspecting, but with me, that's always a good thing

I love that kind of stuff, so it was awesome how quickly paced the book was


Along with all of this, Ven fought her feelings for Linc, and she had to battle with herself whether or not to tell the truth about who she was
I felt really sad for her when she'd think thoughts about how she wasn't real, and she just wanted to be human.Therefore, this book was really interesting
Ven was an awesome heroine, and I definitely believe she deserves that word


She thought she wasn't real, but at the same time, she was really brave, and would sacrifice herself if it meant saving anyone she cared about

There was a lot of action, and a great friendship built between Linc and Ven

I loved the underlying themes of this novel, because they were about freedom, and what it really means to be human

It all added up into one really good and unique young adult dystopian novel, and I can't wait to read the sequel

$review_text.: My first thought when reading the title, was that this book was going to be weird, maybe even funny or comical in some way. I know I judged wrongly before even reading. Gaijin Cowgirl is a mixture of historical fiction, vividly packed scenes and a bite of suspense that will leave the reader on edge.We follow Val Benson as she peruses through Tokyo connecting with old friends all the while making new ones. It is here that she gets her hands on an old map that leads to unspoken treasures. While I don't agree with her methods of retrieving the map, I was a little bit peeved with the artist who made a habit of painting female genitalia; I thought this act of thievery gave the novel a more sinister appeal.And it didn't stop there.Val finds herself hunted by others as she uses the map to seek the treasure in the Thai Jungle. As I do not want to spoil the thriller packed suspense of this novel, as going into more detail will do, I will tell you this. If this had been a movie, it would definitely not disappoint.Jame's writing style is fascinating; he gives the reader a thrill ride type story line before packing them with a heavy punch. He doesn't leave anything left unturned and his book was very satisfying.

$REVIEW.: ...I was hoping for compelling street photography images that exemplified the material discussed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the insightful interviews more. The aforementioned  give a perspective of how nuanced, and based on personality, photography can be; in this case, how a photographer's view of the world functions as a filter through how he approaches the execution of and final editing of his work. The tips at end of the book are spot on, especially the one on overcoming fear. I can victoriously claim a strategy all the vein presented helped me early on.Personally, I wish James Maher would had addressed the issues of empathy and respect more in this book. If you are going to shoot people, you really need to care about people. Many folks doing street have no concern for the people they photograph which eventually shows; they are just out to make a name for themselves, if they can. Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean it's the correct thing to do. Yes, subjective and debatable but food for thought for you aspiring street togs.This book is primarily for beginners attracted to street photography; however, more experienced street togs will come away with some keen guidance. I like that the author wrote nothing in stone: I am so sick and tired of the &#34;20 Rules&#34; and so forth of what is and isn't street photography, and the interviews will confirm this for you. I came away with much to meditate on in spite of doing street photography for several years. Some of my street work has been sold, exhibited, and used in several types of mediums from magazines, textbooks, book covers, and publicity, across the globe. I call it more documentary than street. For me street refers to where the type of documenting is going on. Yes, it comes down to capturing life where and when it's happening.

So far I had been using commercial cleaners, which as we all know are full of harsh chemicals, and really not good for our health. I had no idea I can accomplish great results using very cheap, everyday products. This book shows you how to clean different things in the house from stains to cable ends on car batteries that become corroded over time! This is the way to go for people that want to save money or have respiratory and skin allergies as all of these products are hypoallergenic.

$REVIEW.: Jenny Jasik's life is turned upside down when she loses her son in a driving accident. Her son Mike was in a car with his friend driving while high on drugs. It is a shocking news that leaves Jenny feeling helpless and with the realisation that the streets were not safe for anyone, including her two remaining children, till drugs were freely available. While grieving for her son, Jenny decides that she needs to do something to ensure that it does not happen to anyone else. Once she clears a physical test, she is able to join as an undercover agent with the drug task force. From then on her life takes a different turn. Unable to confide in anyone, Jenny starts living a dual life. But those around her are observant and know that something is amiss... Will Jenny be successful in her job as an undercover agent, or will her other life as a single working mother be in the way?The premise of the story is just so awesome. Not the fact that a teenager was driving under the influence of drugs or the death of an innocent boy, but the idea of an average single mother taking up the responsibility of cleaning the streets free of drugs. I mean, at first you feel that the idea is just absurd - a single mother with three kids and no previous training whatsoever working as an undercover agent - too fantastical. But as you look further, you are forced to stop and think. Everyone knows that a `Mother' can do anything for her child. So why would it be so surprising that a mother who has lost her son to drugs, would want to clean up the streets? On the other hand the story also revolves around about how a family deals with an untimely loss of life. While Jenny goes out hands and limbs, living a dual life, her younger son becomes possessive and rebellious to cope with it. The lies cause an increased stress level all around and while they are trying to deal with it individually, they are also trying to deal with it as a family.The plot is complimented by the constant pace and smooth flow of narration. But Jenny is a character that actually holds everything together. Her strength, her will, her attitude and even her self-doubting moments make her a character who is easy to warm up to.Drama, action, suspense, romance - this book has the right mix of every essential aspect of life.

$review_text.: I had read the reviews about this book and about how people are disappointed. That being said, I still wanted go read it and kept an open mind.The book felt really rushed to me and there wasn't much development. I also didn't like how the two characters go through something where Damon perceives he's keeping his family safe only to completely hurt everyone around him. I also really didn't like how easily Jo got back together  and there was no mention of how badly he hurt her. If it were me, I'd either  not take him back or b  really pissed when he tried  to be  back together. This  book tells young girls that it's okay for men to treat you terribly but if he says he's sorry then no questions asked. I really didn't like that part.The book was  good ending but it was  definitely rushed.I would recommend  people who have  read the other books of the series to buy this book only to know how it ends.

$review_text.: This novella-sized book is the first in the twenty-book Winemaker Detective series that is very popular in France. As a first book, it has some opportunities to improve. Treachery in Bordeaux is long on ambiance and short on mystery.There is little-to-no development of the mystery. No suspense, no hint of danger, no red herrings (is there no wine that goes well with herring?)-- just a simple straight line from Cooker making a decision early on in the book to his stumbling across the culprit at the end.The book also felt a bit stiff and formal as I read it, but I think that is due more to its being a reflection of the main character than it is of the translation, with which I had no problem at all. I found Benjamin Cooker to be rather difficult to warm up to since he can easily be perceived as a more uptight, snobbish version of Felix Unger in the American television series &#34;The Odd Couple.&#34; (In this instance Felix is a rank amateur.) Cooker is the sort of perfectionist that would drive most people mad. He agonizes over each word, each syllable of the critiques he writes because he knows how important his words are to all wine connoisseurs. The man even takes four hours to polish two pairs of shoes so the grain of the leather will be displayed properly.What makes Treachery in Bordeaux worthwhile are its descriptions of this famous wine making region of France-- its history, its architecture, its art, as well as the descriptions of food and wine. This is when the book comes to life, and I appreciated these sections a great deal. I'm glad I read this book, but even though the series has become very popular in its native land, I am in no hurry to read more of Benjamin Cooker's exploits.

$review_text.: Iris Dinitz makes a problem into a storybook and in doing so provides both children and adults with some solutions. She is ably assisted by here illustrator Richie Williams and editor Adi Biler and the result is a book that not only is fun to read but also carries a potent message.Tommy Lomy is the fattest kid in the neighborhood - and that is a problem. He carries around on his shoulder 2 beetles - Mrs. Beetle is called Problem and Mr. Beetle is called Solution. From a very unique manner of interaction talking about Mrs. Problem makes her bigger and talking to Mr. Solution makes him grow bigger.  According to Mr. Solution, Tommy needs to eat correctly and exercise and not pay attention to Mrs. Problem. Tommy goes along, loses weight and Mr. Solution becomes the bigger, hero beetle.From that fun little competition story children learn what foods are healthy and how to eat them and how to avoid sweets.  Choosing a sport they love can be a fun means of increasing exercise and put it altogether it means weight loss! This  is a fun way to `weigh in' to solving the problem of obesity.

$review_text.: I think I have read every book on losing a parent and none of them helped.  I have been feeling like I was going crazy because I certainly felt none of the emotions the other books talked about.  As soon as I began reading The Long Goodbye I felt a wave of relief because someone else went through all the same things and talked about them.I am 40 and my mom died from Ovarian cancer at 65 after a 6 1/2 year battle.  My mom was my best friend.  I was with her when she died; I held her hand and crawled into bed with her as she left. After 6 1/2 years I thought I had prepared myself.  I had not.  Not even close to the loss I currently feel.  It has been three months and I just feel so lost every single moment.  No other book I read talked about all the raw painful and searing emotions you go through when you lose your mom.  This book does.  Megan O'Rourke holds nothing back.She challenges old thoughts on grief (finally someone who looks past the so-called "5 Stages of  Grief"!) and looks at how other cultures grieve and deal with loss.Anyway, I know this is somewhat muddled. I am still having great difficulty concentrating (another way she made me feel like I was normal).I absolutely recommend this book.  In fact, I am going to be purchasing copies for our local Hospice library.

From the moment I picked up the novel I couldn't put it down, which was perfect because I had a nice lazy weekend finishing it :)  The romance in it was believable and the chemistry between the characters was riveting. It had me always guessing and always wanting more, was not predictable at all.  Had just enough details to make me feel like I was right there walking alongside the characters, and not too much description where it dragged the story down. Excited to read more from this writing duo. The setting was what really set me this book apart from other shifter novels.  Overall would recommend this novel to any who enjoy the paranormal :)

$review_text.: &#34;The Dash diet is about healthy concepts and a plan that will stick with you until you reach all of your goals.&#34;  The author suggests you consider if you can actually follow those other fad diets for the long term. The answer--probably not.  Instead, you need to make a permanent LIFE STYLE CHANGE.&#9650; Lots of things to like in this little book. The author offers a lot of encouragement to folks frustrated with all the modern diet fads and tricks. He explains why so many diets fail: They are based on some fad that the dieter should follow for a while.&#9650; The key, the author explains is not short, one-time diet that you follow for a while, then fall off. Instead, permanently change your food consumption to emphasize healthy natural foods, and reject the highly processed junk. And you certainly don't want to follow a &#34;deprivation&#34; plan of semi-starvation.&#9650; Mr Jamieson also notes that exercise is a critical part of the plan.  If you neglect that, you are severely diminishing the liklihood of success.&#10004; Honestly, I can't really find much to criticize in this concise plan.  Recommend!&#9835; A Review by Chris Lawson

Marion Joyce has a very interesting way of writing, which made it even more special. I'll be definitely getting any of her future titles. 5 Stars for this one!
$SUMMARY.: A great mystery!

$REVIEW.: Karme is southern fiction set in Florida's Big Cypress Swamp in the 1960s. I had a really hard time getting into this book, despite my fondness for Southern fiction. Karme, a feral young woman raised in the swamp by her people hating, probably psychotic mother, has a deep relationship with the earth and the swamp until her hormones start to rage and her curiosity about real townsfolk, especially a certain young man, start to be aroused. Mom is long dead and Karme is curious enough to want to leave the safety of the swamp and head for civilization. Civilization in this area is a misnomer since the people in Moonyville are more repulsive than most. I think the reason that I had a hard time enjoying the book is that the characters are all stereotypes and therefore predictable. Although the book paints a gorgeous picture of the swamps and Karme herself is a lovely allegory, the rest of the characters are ignorant Southern crackers, whose stories, prejudices and plain ugliness are better left unexplored. The interjections by Brant, the man Karme loved add nothing to the narrative and are distracting, even though mildly amusing. There was a lot to hate about the South from the 1920s to today and this author managed to include all of it without balancing anything other than its physical beauty against its flaws.

I've seen more writing in a free sample of books than in this.The whole thing can be summed up like this: First person fictional essay on a confused teenager jogging with two people she is friends with that hate each other. A large thing chases them. We don't get a description of this "large" creature. Girls run to parking lot and get in car with boyfriend of Friend A. Fin.

The author might have a good story here, but the actual story is broken in to multiple publications.  You barley get into the premise of the story when it stops.  This trend of breaking books into series is getting rather tiresome.  This particular publication took me less than two hours to read.  I'd at least like to have a book entertain me for several hours - I am will NOT be purchasing the series.

$REVIEW.: Turkey is in one of the more unique positions in the world which, if played properly, could propel it into being a major player in the international arena

 As the West is in a fight against radical Islam, Turkey's influence derives not only from being geographically at the intersection between the Middle East and Europe but, more importantly, being the most successful example of a secular country with a Muslim majority


 An examination therefore is beneficial as a guide for the secularization of other Muslim countries both in terms of what Turkey has done right and where improvements may be found.Andrew Mango is certainly qualified for such an examination, having devoted much of his life to the study of Turkish affairs


 The result is that THE TURKS TODAY is a fairly comprehensive picture of modern Turkey though one that is, on a bit of a sour note, a tad dry.Part I of the book is a fairly detailed history of Turkish politics since the death of Ataturk


 It is this section of the book that suffers from, shall we say, writing that is lacking in personality

 Nonetheless, if one is looking for such a history with a good but not extreme amount of detail, one will find it here.Part II is more exciting and delves into various aspects of modern Turkish life such as Turkey's developments in economics and education


 Mango gives us concise chapters on the growth of Istanbul and Ankara over the past several decades

 Chapters on the Eastern and Kurdish sections of the country do a good job of outlining the alienation many Kurds may feel in Turkey and how this has led to the development of Kurdish nationalist and Marxist terrorist organizations.THE TURKS TODAY is a good companion read to CRESCENT AND STAR by Stephen Kinzer
 Kinzer's book provides less overall information than Mango but has a better feel to it, more personality


 Mango's book provides the reverse


 Together they give a reader good working knowledge on what may prove to be one of the more important nations around.

All 3 books were a very enjoyable read.  Don't talk about it be about it and I suggest all fans to cop all 3 books for a roller coaster that dives head first.  You will fall in love with the Young Fly, Smurf, and Iris in book 1.  You will admire the strength, beauty, and leadership of Falisa in book 2 and hate the young, trifling, and conniving actions of the beauty Amil. In the final book you will be in awe as Papa Bear and Pig Man hold down the only family they have ever known.  You will find yourself in book "Heaven!"

A friend recommended me this book about Atkins diet which I ultimately find it different from any other diet plans I've attempted to try but got uninterested in the long run.  I got the information I needed in order for me to have a good head start on my Atkins diet plan routine.  There are good meal recipes suggested that could ultimately help me break down the carbs and unhealthy junks from my daily set of meals. This is a highly recommended diet plan!

$review_text.: 3.5 StarsI really enjoyed this book and I think it was the main characters that did it for me. I really liked how both of the main characters were so broken and had such tragic histories, but the author didn't rush the two getting together. They fought their attraction, especially Danielle since her attraction to Malachim terrified her for a variety of reasons, and that made when they got together that much better.I wasn't sure how the author would deal with Danielle's past. Sometimes writing the character of a severely abused and terrified woman doesn't translate well on the page. It's a sensitive subject (obviously) and for me, deeply personal, but I'm happy to say that the situation was handled well.The only issue I did have was with Malachim's 'father' and when he approached Danielle. I didn't understand why she kept it to herself. Given how terrified she was, I expected her to either tell Malachim or run of the hills. Instead she just left things unsaid for a bit and that bothered. I get she was scared of Christopher (and her ex) but when Malachim came to the hospital at a pivotal point in the book, I thought she'd let her guard drop then and there. (Can you tell I'm sometimes impatient?! LOL)Anyways, I really liked this author's writing style and the way she wove the pieces of the plot together. She definitely can write a suspense plot really well! The only other issue I have is that I had no idea this was part of a series. Had I known, I'd have read book 1. It's not required to get the gist of what is going on but for me it did bug me knowing there was a book 1 out there with an apparent epic plot to it. (And I noticed here on GR that the books don't have listed #1, #2, etc. Not sure how to go about fixing that, but the author or pub might want to do that so readers don't get ticked when reading out of order. You'd be surprised how many readers are OCD about that!) Looking forward to going to back to read the first and then, hopefully, subsequent, books!*I received an ARC of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.*

$REVIEW.: This book absolutely requires that you continue to the next two in the series in order to make it a coherent story
The narrative is a bit plodding, and it is all background detail, nothing about the virus except hints, and nothing about that creature depicted on the cover


I realize that the author is trying to set the stage, but that's all this section has: background, although the scenery is amazing and the descriptions are great
It tells of William's life and feelings; if you can ignore the frequent typos and grammar errors, it's not bad in itself

I did expect more doomsday scenarios, though


Probably they will show up in the next book


There are a few hints of crises to come, but no details

The style here is to make a mysterious statement, then proceed to explain it


Hmmm........I'm going to read the second installment now.

$review_text.: This book is surprisingly entertaining, though somewhat predictable.  It is refreshing after so many immortal romances, but still the same in a couple of ways. Aimee and Alan both have a special power that helps them to save a friend after the spirit takes over her body, but that you can tell from the beginning. The story does seem a little drawn out at some parts, and a little looked over at others. Some of the things that could be more descriptive doesn't get as much attention, but nevertheless, it is an entertaining story about two teens overcoming what even grownups couldn't do.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the supernatural.Publisher-Bloomsbury USA ChildrensReview Score: 4 StarsReviewed by~Patti

Unfortunately the author's grammar and misuse of words has not improved since then and actually drove me to distraction this time round. I think the problem was that the story wasn't as good as the first book, so the grammar just added insult to injury.The English h set some Scottish captives free before they were due to be executed by her brother. She has to escape her home because she knows she has committed treason. The h helps her to get to the highlands and their relationship develops along the way. The premise of the book was good but the execution was weak.I read the teaser chapter for the next book (at the end of this one) and I won't be buying it because already the author is describing the H as a 'widow' in the first couple of pages.

$REVIEW.: If Streets of blood is not the best of the Dead Man series it is definitely in the top three

 This one is actually scary


 The story is set in a small town in Virginia that Matt drifts through


 It all starts when he gets a job at an assisted living home
 There are some genuinely scary moments in this one that I think any Dead Man fan will love
 In fact, I can't remember any of them being scary before.The thing I like best about this installment is the fact that it doesn't feel like the same old same old

 I love the Dead Man series but to be honest the last few have felt just like they are running together


Don't get me wrong, this one goes by the same formula there isn't anything different about it but somehow it doesn't feel stale and repetitive.Streets of Blood is why I read this series

 Chapters this good are few and far between but you never know when the next one is going to be

 It has been a while.Barry Napier should write the rest of the series!!!

My kids are 3 and 6, so still a bit young for this book, but I'll probably buy a copy now for my own pleasure, and another for my brother.I have always loved books that lead you to another book, and I just had to read "Gulliver's Travels" after reading this one.

$review_text.: Not at all what I expected from the title, Tidal Surge is a paranormal tale of a woman who enters the thoughts of another and, once inside, can also make suggestions&#8212;for good or bad


As a new wife, Liliha shares her secret ability with her husband, Oliver, who encourages her to use her talent for the good of those she influences
Liliha has no control over the episodes that take her and, like an advancing tidal surge, she is swept away into a vortex of jumbled thoughts time and again throughout the novel
The story pivots from third person to first each time she is thrust into the mind of another
I was a little confused the first time that happened but adjusted quickly and enjoyed the perspective shift.Liliha derives her power from an ancient Egyptian moonstone ring, and the ring has two associated golden bracelets, one of which is in Liliha&#8217;s possession

The bracelet, like the ring, bestows on those who wear it an ability similar to Liliha&#8217;s but there is a difference


While the ring encourages good, the bracelet brings out the worst

Kaelyn, Liliha&#8217;s daughter, happens on the bracelet while rummaging through her mother&#8217;s things and is swept away into a dark world inside the mind of people intent on evil deeds
Encouraged by the bracelet, Kaelyn&#8217;s destructive nature blooms, and the sullen, insolent daughter becomes even more hostile.Amid the chaos of good vs


evil as Kaelyn and Liliha battle each other within the minds of predators and victims, Oliver&#8217;s sexy ex-girlfriend, Beatrice, schemes to recover her relationship with Liliha&#8217;s new husband

Beatrice flees the witness protection program to add her physical beauty and lustful soul to the eternal battle being waged by Liliha and Kaelyn.The plot is highly entertaining, the ending is unexpected, and the book is masterfully edited
I enjoyed the English writing style and vocabulary


Francene Stanley also walked the fine line between enough description of people and places to embed the reader into her story, but not so much to slow the reader&#8217;s momentum
Here&#8217;s an example as Kaelyn reacts to the bracelet: &#8220;She took a deep breath, and then slid the bangle up her arm

The gold clamped and settled on her bicep
Shudders of guilt-tainted pleasure flowed through her

Suffocating, sweet essence invaded her psyche

She slid onto the void with an expectation of delight.&#8221;Having raised two teen girls myself, I applaud the author for capturing the aloof nature, lack of forgiveness (for almost everything), and haughtiness of a young woman striving to come to grips with the world as it is


Overall, I believe Tidal Surge is a five-star read.

$review_text.: I usually read YA books with a little skepticism because so many of them have threadbare story lines and superficial characters. I was happily surprised when this book came through with a unique plot, a very strong and believable heroine, and cool supporting characters. I agree with another reader that having so many love interests made the story a little unfocused but I didn't mind at all. I look forward to reading the sequel.

$review_text.: ISLAND PERIL is my first exposure to Jill Sorenson's work....and WOW!...I LOVED IT!  I'll definitely be reading the rest of the AFTERSHOCK series.Ella Hammond is on a kayaking, hiking, and camping trip with her sister and 17 year-old niece...and things are going along well, right up until Ella and Paul (the sexy, apparently out-of-her-league) guide who takes the 3 women a 4 mile jaunt across the Pacific to San Miguel, an uninhabited island, to explore caves, hike, and see the wildlife.  Abby and Brooke (sister and her daughter) have to turn back, leaving Ella and Paul alone.The suspense and intrigue built beautifully as they find evidence of smuggling and are soon on the run for their lives.  I'm not giving anything away here-- all of this information is in the book blurb.  I so enjoyed watching the intensity of their situation bring Ella and Paul together.  Seems like the crush of fight-or-flight responses do a lot to bond people together, heighten chemistry that's already there, and make attraction move into the fast lane.  It's completely believable that they'd keep each other warm, that the rescue came when it did, that the smoking hot encounters happened so &#34;quickly.&#34;  Yep.  I'm a believer.While the story is told in Ella's point of view, I found understanding Paul to be easy.  We never really knew his thought process...but it showed in his actions, his expression, and Ella's ability to read him.  Yeah, some of it was guessing, but Ms. Sorenson did a splendid job writing that male character.  He seemed true and consistent to himself throughout.  He was simply too noble, too real, too decent to not have any angst over the chemistry between them.Can't wait to read the two full length novels  in the Aftershock series.  Kudos to Jill Sorenson!Sensuality Rating: HotLanguage: Rated R (but nothing overly crass or offensive....just language one would expect from a contemporary with drug smugglers and bullets flying)Highly recommended to fans of romantic suspense who don't mind hot sex scenes and language.

$review_text.: I had to force myself to finish this book, but then the ending got me hooked.While I was reading Beautiful Disaster. I was seriously wondering why there were so many good reviews for this book. It needs some serious copy editing. A copy editor would've helped in making the copy clear, correct, concise, complete, and consistent. Things that are lacking greatly in this book, but it doesn't mean that the story is bad. I believe there is something good there. It just needs some work to get it there.All in all, I will read the sequel of this book. Like I said, the ending got me interested and now I want to know what will happen. And this is why I came to the conclusion that this yet another case of an ending boosting the books rating.I don't believe that this book is worth more than 3 stars, but I'm sure many gave it more than that because they loved the ending and now it's all they can think about. They want to see what will happen. So, to that I will say, congratulations to Francette Phal for writing an excellent cliff hanger ending that has managed to hook the readers.I am hopeful that the sequel will be better. The premise of the book is good. With some editing, it will be great!

$REVIEW.: I LOVE NAP! Seriously, I liked his character from the beginning. I always thought he was a fun one. But now... Love. Him. There's so much more than meets the eye. I got to commend the author. She writes each book from with a 1-person POV and she NAILED Nap. His thoughts and feelings all there exposed for me to experience - his personality shines through. His emotional roller coaster journey to NYC and planning his future had me between laughter and tears. Now on to Sixten. I'm not going to lie; I hated him. When I read M.O.N.0 (What's a `M.O.N.0' you say. Read the book!) I wanted to bash his face in for hurting and manipulating Nap. Nevertheless, somewhere along the line, probably somewhere around the time M.O.N.3 came rolling around, something changed. Something drew me in changing my hate to confusion. Going through their journey, with the help of Moused and a few other secondary characters I began to see the light. By the time the end of the book came rolling around my AHA moment struck. And what an ending! No spoilers here but I will say WTG NAP!!!I have been a Pierced fan from the very beginning. It was the cover that initially drew me in. In the see of near-necked covers, the simplicity Ms. Mells caught my attention. What keeps me coming back for more is what is underneath said cover. Napoleon is no exception. Now I know the author says this book can be read and enjoyed as a stand-all, I beg to differ. I liked Nap's character from his first introduction, but after finishing his story, I absolutely ADORE him. I don't think I would have if I hadn't been exposed to him before. Go ahead and read NAPOLEON, but if you want to come to the appreciation I have for them then you'll read the whole series.I received this book from the author for the express purposes of an honest review. The opinions and rating of this review are solely mine and in no way was I compensated.Stars- 5, Flames - 1

I think she just wants to write to soon,sell to many books at once,and she are not really caring,stoping and really thinking what shes writing,at some point she stoped care about what her fans want,because her last couple books is getting lower,nd lower stars and ratings,not many 5 stars anymore,and a lot ,1,2 ,and 3 star

Clair is abused, controlled and beaten by an LDS returned missionary.  I can't see the purpose of it.  I usually really like Jennie Hansen's books, but was pretty disappointed with this one.  I like books that make me feel good and want to read more.  This one left me feeling like I had watched the news where there is sadness all around.

$review_text.: I was only mildly interested in reading this book, and the reviews on Amazon seemed to support my reaction.  Then I read the review in The New Yorker, which was much more favorable, so I said to myself that if The New Yorker liked it that much, I should give it a chance.  My gut instinct was right.  The premise is interesting, and some parts of the book were nicely done, but overall it was really no better than so-so.The book's problems include that (1) the basic premise, while interesting, is somewhere between real and alternate history, so it's not possible to suspend disbelief; and (2) major aspects of the plot (womanizing young Jack Kennedy falls for a gorgeous, mysterious and very tough broad) and the dialogue are so trite that it seems like something out of a bygone era (and I don't mean that as a compliment).A minor point, but a cardinal sin as far as I'm concerned, is that in one critical scene, the wrong character is referred to.  Why did the editor not catch this - or, phrased otherwise, did anyone even bother to edit this book?  It's like a glaring typo or non sequitur - how can you take this book seriously when neither its author, its publisher nor its editor took it seriously enough to catch that glaring error?

$REVIEW.: This book is short and to the point and provides great info on toning up. I always hesitate to lift weights, because as a woman I'm afraid of &#34;bulking up.&#34; Which, yes, I know isn't very likely to happen, but it still worries me.That's why I enjoyed this book--it's more about toning (obviously) than becoming a meathead. The exercises the author provides are varied and easy to follow. Several different moves for each different part of the body.The pictures were a nice touch. This will be my go-to when I need a quick fix!

I love, love that book and was actually rooting for Tony. lol I didn't really like Ryan until the last part of that book.. I just couldn't connect with him, I didn't think he was really in love with Liza.. but oh boy! After reading this book, I was sorely mistaken! RYAN HUNTER... YOU ARE DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE YA HERO EVER!Gosh! In this book, it was purely Ryan's POV and to invade his mind was so effing HOT! The way he think was more fun to read.. he was horny, patient, sweet, persistent, sarcastic and alpha possessive in a YA genre way that made me swooning all over him! I'm 28 yo. but reading this book made me feel so young and giddy! lolNow, my one tiny bit complaint is the cover for this book! I mean, come on! Ryan is one of the best swoonworthy book boyfriend out there and to have this boring cover is not fair! The cover looks kinda cheesy and trashy. I'm so sorry. I feel like it should be sweet and sexier in a Ryan Hunter way. ^_^Anyways, I don't like reading a story twice even if it has a different POV's but the author did a great job on this that I devoured every page of this book! There is just something about reading a story from the guy POV.Ryan Hunter is every woman's dream!

Not once.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not quite that bad but there have been a lot of times (a LOT of times) where I really, really meant to say &#8220;no&#8221; but what I said was &#8220;yes&#8221; and then I wanted to kill myself because I&#8217;d just committed to spending a big chunk of my almost non-existent free time doing something I really, really didn&#8217;t want to do.This book by Charlene Richard could have been written just for me. With chapters titled things like, &#8220;The Thought of Saying Totally No Freaks Me Out,&#8221; I immediately got the feeling that she knew me and knew exactly how hard it was not to be the one saying &#8220;yes&#8221; all the time. The author is a therapist who has seen many, many women ignore their own needs and &#8220;stuff their emotions&#8221; in the name of taking care of their loved ones. More than anything else, this short book is a blueprint for a new architecture of communication&#8212;a way to breaking through when people don&#8217;t seem to be listening.Richard&#8217;s common-sense advice feels &#8220;real world&#8221; and her gentle nudging toward learning how to communicate emotions feels liberating. &#8220;Stop Reacting! Start Responding! she says and it makes sense. We don&#8217;t feel like we&#8217;re getting &#8220;bumper sticker&#8221; philosophy here but real tools that are simple (but not necessarily easy) as they are transformative.If you have problems saying no, this book may explain why. Saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to the advice here will (at the very least) make sure you never commit to making five dozen cupcakes for a school bake sale because  you&#8217;re everyone&#8217;s go-to-gal.

$review_text.: As the Crow Dies, eISBN 9781611940312, Bell Bridge Books, e-book by Ken Casper is "a Jason Crow West Texas mystery story".Jason Crow, a former local star quarterback with dreams of a professional career, returns from Vietnam minus both legs and newly acquired prostheses. Added to these horrendous problems is being greeted on arrival home with the announcement that his father has committed suicide. Although all evidence points to the suicide conclusion, too many small details, plus his belief in his father, make Jason believe that instead, his father was murdered. With the help of his good friend Zack, he proceeds to attempt to prove that he is right, but to do so, he must  interact with persons with whom interpersonal activity in the past has generated multifaceted feelings including not an inconsiderable amount of animosity.The story is well put together with numerous side issues surrounding the gradually revealed, deeply held, dark secrets that exist in the small town where most inhabitants have lived and known each other for many years. Included are a lawman with more than one reason to dislike Jason, an interrelationship between Jason's sister and his father's partner's black son, the involvement of his mother with oppressive activity by the members of a splinter church, the rumored existence of oil on disputed property and a drug problem that involves Jason's brother as well as others.Ken Casper has indeed presented a most believable picture of the frustration that would be demonstrated by a six foot six football player who suddenly must face even the simplest tasks from an entirely new viewpoint. It is a presentation that would appear to stem either from close association, or an acute ability to equate with such a person.In conclusion, it is unfortunate that some of the facts presented in the concluding action-packed climax do not equate completely with the earlier description. However, As the Crow Dies is an interesting read for the unique plot, and perhaps more specifically for the aforementioned unusually empathetic presentation of the protagonist's physical problems and required mental adjustment.

"The Secret Diary of Elisabeth Leseur" is unique because it is the spiritual diary writings of a married woman
There are many married women today seeking holiness in their lives as wives and mothers


This is a book for them! They will find profound and useful spiritual direction in the words of Elisabeth Leseur, whose love for God gave her a steadfast, faithful and fruitful love for her husband

More importantly can they unravel the mystery her husband left behind before it's too late?Collateral Damage is a complex story with many twists and turns that keep you riveted. Jack and Lauren share beautiful chemistry. The journey they go on showcases both characters' strengths and weaknesses. It is very exciting to watch these two navigate this scary world together.There is quite a bit going on in Collateral Damage. I was thrown a bit at the beginning when the story kept going from one place to another but I recovered quickly and got into this fast-paced thriller. Jack and Lauren may be the stars of this book but I was just as into the relationship between Roger and Mari. I cannot wait to see where their story goes.Collateral Damage is fraught with international intrigue. J.L. Saint has crafted a rather electrifying premise. Collateral Damage is a sexy, enticing thriller that packs a punch.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$review_text.: I found this book fascinating. For each chapter, the author picks a bird or type of bird that has some attribute or characteristic, and then he relates that to humans and other animals. Along the way, he gives you facts and stories about the birds that are both amazing and delightful. While I was reading it, I kept bombarding my wife with bird facts (she took it well). He also writes well with a most engaging style. If you like birds, nature, or things of that sort, I think you will really like this book.

$review_text.: JOHNNY HAZARD is one of those great adventure strips that should be better known and certainly more celebrated than it is today. For its entirety from 1944 through 1977 both dailies and Sundays were written and drawn by just one man, Frank Robbins, a superb draftsman with an eye for perspective (and beautiful women) and a storyteller easily at home with either humour or drama.Many strip historians tend to dismiss JOHNNY HAZARD as a sort of second-rate STEVE CANYON, a charge that is truly unfair to both the character and his creator. Because in many ways JOHNNY HAZARD was always superior in my opinion. Both Robbins and Milton Caniff were inspired by the same premier aviation illustrator (Noel Sickles) and both created titular heroes who were aviators (although Robbins' came first if one discounts Caniff's TERRY & THE PIRATES).But whereas Canyon was a civilian (a returning vet) who eventually rejoined the Air Force and never left, Hazard began life as a combat fighter and transitioned to civilian within the first two years of his strip. As such, he could go anywhere and work any job whether it was private pilot, airline troubleshooter, or even (in the strip's last decade) agent for a secret agency that assists the United Nations.Which translated on printed page as foreign locales, colourful characters, and lots of femme fatales all wrapped up (again) in dynamic art and stories that were alternately humourous or edge-of-your-seat thrillers.Hermes Press' JOHNNY HAZARD collects the first years of the daily strip (the Sundays had their own continuity) from June 05, 1944 through November 19, 1945, presenting the first 5 continuities. It opens with Hazard stealing a plane behind German lines and rarely lets up afterward. Along the way in this book we are introduced to Brandy (a feisty and beautiful war correspondent) as well as the first of several major supporting characters that populate the world of Johnny Hazard: The Admiral (a navy brat forced to become a top pilot due to his seasickness) and Side-pocket Sam, the loquacious (but honorable) racketeer with an eye for angles (whether in black market or in bank shots).Art-wise the earliest strips are a bit too "fine line" (and Hazard himself a bit too generic) but by volume's end there's definitely the transition to the sharper linework and heavier use of black contrast that would become Robbins' trademarks. What we have then is a ground floor introduction to everything that would make JOHNNY HAZARD the long-running strip it deserved to be.I give this book 4 stars, primarily for its production values. The fifth star unfortunately is lost due to both its title and its price. Despite what the title and footers say, this book only contains the 1944-45 run, NOT the 1944-46 strips. Because of its delays in reaching publication, I can only surmise that an executive decision was made to excise the 1946 material in order to get the book out sooner rather than later. This would also seem to bear out by the advertised 288 pages clocking in at 238 pages instead.If so, the decision NOT to lower the price will probably hurt it in the long run. At $49.99 that's a steep price to ask new readers to buy in. (Older readers like me who have the older reprints from the 1980s can perhaps rationalize the superior paper stock DOES improve the reproduction quality!) Although Amazon has it currently discounted at $27.70 [making it a REAL bargain!], I can't see many non-Amazon customers buying it as full price at their local comic shop or other online retailer.Which is a shame because JOHNNY HAZARD truly gets better with every year of its existence. If you want to discover one of the best strip characters ever invented, do yourself a favor and buy this book at its current discount. Not only will you have some enjoyable (and affordable) reading, but you might help entice Hermes Press to follow up with a second volume soon.A number of more famous strips like DICK TRACY and BUCK ROGERS began life as crude renderings that improved later on -- once you could suffer past the failings. With JOHNNY HAZARD THE NEWSPAPER DAILIES VOLUME ONE you get what made the strip so memorable from the start.A masterpiece that deserves some recognition.

$REVIEW.: I liked this book for a lot of reasons that other people have already cited - beautifully written and touching.I will only add here that the author needed a native Spanish speaking/writing editor.  There was a lot of use of Spanish parsed into the otherwise English text and often there were glaring errors in these phrases.  I am bilingual in English and Spanish and have to say that these errors broke up the reading experience for me - particularly jarring were the errors in concordance.

$REVIEW.: The young face of Tokyo comes alive in this glossy paperback highlighting key fashion leaders and the trend setters and followers.The book covers the vast array of goth,punk, and shows how these Tokyo youngsters have fallen for western culture, hook line and sinker!The styles are a myriad of Asian meets American style-It's obvious that western movies magazines and music have Japan enthralled.I came up in the East Village of New York in the early 80's and this has that influence throughout the many color photos in this book.Yui Mamabe photographs the subjects well enough and shows the colors attitude and personality of these young mavericks.Fashion is really a carnival in this Tokyo youth depiction.Strangely enough nothing seems to be truly new here,as references are apparent in almost every photograph.I guess fashion is a derivative subject. Cyndi Lauper would be proud to see her disciples decked out in garish eclectic combinations that would make your mother cry(if she is prudent)!"The stylish female" section is a bit more conservative and presentable to the older viewer.Generally the majority of the book looks like a used awning shop,zebra,spandex,and post punk combination wardrobes. The models are eager to be seen,proud and intent on the photographer's lenses focusing on them in their narcissistic glory."Young men at work" has the blue to white collar looks and spotlights creative self expression to standard suit and tie. The models are cute and nonthreatening no matter what get-up they are cavorting in.The models are refreshingly imperfect,and would appeal to those that love fun over glamor.Generally I find this book entertaining and mildly interesting.Personally I feel that these fashions are a bit retro for this man's taste. Enjoyable in a harmless amusing way,but not as creatively exploited as it might have been.

The villain, is so evil, I don't think I've come across such a vile person, so bent on his purpose and unfeeling
Kira is a great MC, a good, believable heroine with her own troubles, she's down to earth, not perfect, but determined as well

There are a host of great characters throughout the series and the story line is so probable it's scary


The novels are action driven and fast paced

The writing and the technology are just enough sci-fi to feel techie but not enough to lose you if you aren't used to sci-fi
I highly recommend the set!

It was a story of a young man growing up in the hood with his family and the choices he made growing up leading to jail time. Then the choices  made once he was released trying to be the man that everyone expects him to be. I would like to read part 2 to see what the outcome was.

$review_text.: Romantically satisfying. I love m/m romances set in the Regency period, and this one is a lovely addition to the genre. Having not read the first two books in the trilogy, I can say that you do not need to read them to understand what is happening in this book. The characters are different.Linus and Rob are likeable characters with real fears and passions. Given the time period, both men are very aware that they could hang for their love of other men. Throughout the story the two men change in their attitudes towards each other and become aware of just how they feel about each other.I enjoyed this book immensely. It is the first book I've read by Ava March, but it will not be the last. I intend to go back and read the first two books in this trilogy and then anything else she has out. Her writing is spot on for the time period and the dialogue between the characters is not only realistic, but it's heartfelt as well.

$REVIEW.: My rating was arrived at by averaging 5 stars and 1 star  because I thought aspects of this novel were superb while other aspects were not.  The story brings to light the escapades of John Brown leading up to and including his raid on Harper's Ferry.  "Onion" - a twelve year old slave, Henry Shackleford is freed by John Brown during a raid in the Kansas Territory; Misidentified, Henry spends his time as a girl - Henrietta.  He also serves as the narrator of the tale and claims to be the only surviving member of the Harper's Ferry Raid.  Humor, good dialouge and Onion's narraration are where this book excels.  It falls a little short in pacing and at the intersection where real characters like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman meet the fictional characters in the book. Historically, it was an accurate account.  Addressing the issue of slavery through humor and satire is no small task.  Talented author - worth the read.

$REVIEW.: From a small, adorable ring to a cover for an IKEA ottoman, there's something for all levels of ambition here

I really like the modern style of the designs
Some of the projects start of with something you've knit yourself while others have you start with a recycled wool sweater


I have to admit I like the looks of some of these recycled projects so much that I'm considering knitting my own sweaters just to recycle them into laptop sleeves or chair cushions


I really love the use of both color and texture in these projects
There's a nice span of techniques to get you there as well..
texture is accomplished through shibori or cabling, color is added through knitting, needle felting, or surface embroidery to name a few options

The felted objects are either shaped through knitting or the felted fabric is cut into the desired shape

I really like the tone of the book too


I think this book and I are going to spend a lovely winter together.

$REVIEW.: There can be no question more important to a person than this one: "Do I know God?" Those who do know Him have the privilege of being adopted into the family of God and being assured of an eternity in His presence


Those who do not have no such privilege and no such hope


In America the vast majority of people claim to be Christians and claim to know God, but so many lives simply do not bear this out


People may know about God, but they do not know God as He is


And so many will perish, going to the grave with some kind of false assurance, thinking they know God when really they do not

It does us all good to ask not once but throughout life, "Do I know God?"God wants us to know Him and not only that, He wants us to know that we know Him

He wants us to be able to find certainty in this most important relationship
This certainty, the certainty that allows us to have confidence that we are saved and that God loves and will preserve us, is the subject of Do I Know God? by Tullian Tchividjian
Though not a household name, his full name provides some important context: William Graham Tullian Tchividjian is the grandson of Ruth and Billy Graham
As a young man he rebelled and ran from the faith, but was radically saved in 1993 and has since entered the pastoral ministry having first graduated from Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida

In 2003 he founded New City Presbyterian Church in Florida where he serves as pastor.Tchividjian wrote this book to show that we can have assurance of our salvation and to teach the reader how we can have this kind of certainty
"The Bible makes it clear that if you're confused about which group [those who know God and those who don't] you belong to, you don't have to remain confused

If you do have a relationship with God, he wants you to know it


And if you don't have a relationship with God, he wants you to know it."This book, then, is his attempt to give credible answers to any sincere spiritual seeker who may be asking that all-important question." Of course we live at a time when doubt is the highest absolute

We can believe what we want, but we always need to maintain a "healthy" doubt, admitting that we could be (and perhaps probably are) wrong


God's assurance flies in the face of this doubt.The format of the book is as follows


Tchividjian first looks at what a relationship to God actually means and how we are to enter into one that is genuine

He identifies six ways that people deceive themselves into thinking they know God when in fact they do not and then seeks to assist the reader to examine himself through a kind of rigorous personal inventory


The purpose of such an examination is to determine if the reader really is showing the traits of one who believes


And finally, he suggests three practical spiritual disciplines that maintain the relationship with God and cause it to flourish.The book is pastoral in its tone and is laced with stories and anecdotes from Tchividjian's pastoral ministry and from his own testimony

The endnotes show who has guided Tchividjian in his understanding of this most important theology: Packer, Sproul, Stott, Piper, Ryle and others all make appearances
The book closes with a Study Guide suitable for personal or group use
Tchividjian is a capable writer and one who makes a good personal connection with the reader

The book is suitable for any audience.Do I Know God? is a helpful and biblical response to that all-important question

With the answers grounded in the character of God and built upon the testimony of Scripture, this book will serve anyone who may be wondering or wavering

I'm glad to recommend it.

$review_text.: First off, I think this premise is a really cool twist on the shifter story--you've got the female lead, Chloe, who is able to communicate telepathically with animals. I don't read a ton of shifter romances, but this wasn't something I'd seen before, and the idea intrigued me. Then you have Jorge, the shape shifting jaguar who comes into her life. Their first meeting is cute--Chloe finds out she can read his thoughts, which completely throws her off because she's never been able to read the thoughts of a human before. One night, when trying to investigate a possible dog fighting ring on her own, Chloe once again comes into contact with the mysterious Jorge, and this eventually leads to the two hooking up.Their relationship progresses very quickly. Jorge was awesome male lead. Chloe, I had mixed feelings about. I found myself frustrated with her, particularly in how she treated Jorge (C'mon sister, he COOKS for you!!!), to the point it left me wondering why he even bothered with her. I didn't like many of the decisions she made and couldn't relate to her reasoning behind them. That being said, when they were together it was sweet, and the chemistry was hot. Their love story is woven in with the plot to save the dogs, which added an extra layer to the story that I appreciated. Overall, this is a nice quick read, and worth a shot if you're an animal lover who also happens to love romance with a shape-shifting hottie :)

I am so glad I did!From the first page of the book I was hooked. Just when you think there is a break from the action, it takes a turn and keeps going! The plot twists are just enough to keep you from being bored and not too much to make it unbelievable.Even though this book is all about the paranormal, it was all believable to me. I am a skeptic when it comes to paranormal books because I always think, "No way, that is just stupid." Not so with this book. Maybe because characters in the book were just learning of the paranormal and I went along for the ride with those characters.A great read and I am looking forward to reading more about Craig Lockman.*received copy from the author for review*

$review_text.: The Man Cave Mardi Gras Cookbook: More Than 50 Awesome Mardi Gras Recipesis the latest from Matt Thompson, author of the Mancave series of Kindle cookbooks.  Matt has gathered together a very nice selection of recipes specifically from New Orleans and the surrounding area that will allow almost anyone to throw a Mardi Gras party at almost the drop of a pin.  BTW, today is Mardi Gras, at least for those who do not have to work tomorrow.  If you are not among them, then just skip the extensive section of Mardi Gras beverages, everything from Hurricane Punch to traditional Mint Juleps, with a whole lot in between.Matt does sometimes (not all or even most) use a mix or canned product rather than one made from scratch, but not so often as to become assembly rather than cooking. I am particularly enamored of his recipe for Muffuletta Dip - various olives, pepperoncini, a couple of kinds of cheese and some fresh veg chopped small, marinated overnight and served up with crostini.  Matt says you can store leftovers for about 5 days, but I wouldn't have any leftovers of this one - at least not past breakfast the day after.The author has done a very good job with the formatting.  I particularly liked that he thought to include an individual link to each and every recipe as part of the Table of Contents and was thoughtful enough to place a link back to the Table of Contents following each recipe.  Now, if he had only thought to make that Table of Contents show up in the Kindle navigation menu I would be a very happy camper!You'll want to add this one to your shelf.

$REVIEW.: I was very excited to dive into a new Trilogy, and the reviews for this book made me even more excited

But I was pretty disappointed after finishing the book, and I have no desire to finish the trilogy
The different view points in the book are clever, but poorly carried out, and there's a lot of confusion

There are no real character developments, and the story is just not believable

I'm very disappointed in the lack of character development the most, I think


Especially when told in third person through multiple viewpoints, the characters need to be well thought out and organized, and I just don't get that from this book.Kinda SPOILER:The ending with the school gym is too over-the-top
Everything just happened without explanation and it was a really pointless display on Sam Hain's part
It was stupid

I was just ready to get it read so I can move on to another book
I'm going back to my Amanda Hocking books where I know I won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: I didn't know of the author's acclaimed background when I bought this for my Kindle (mainly because it sounded intriguing and was cheap)
 In the first 10 I pages I felt like this novella was written by an inexperienced author who really could have used a good editor and a more spare writing style..


it just seemed so full of itself
 But the story grabbed me and I'm glad I read it

 The writing style also seemed to calm down as the story progressed and the characters evolved

 In the end, it haunts me, I'm intrigued..

and I love the kindle full cover art--gorgeous


Worth it by a long shot
I also loved the author info/photos at the end

 I was surprised by his background and, due to how I ended up loving this book and his well-respected novels, I have already downloaded another one of his books.

$REVIEW.: A story about love, music, and friendship that will tantalize all your senses with its rich descriptions and alluring plot and will leave you happy, sated and curious about what&#8217;s next for this so very different but great group of characters.This book is not a clich&eacute; story about a &#8220;whorey&#8221; bad boy musician that meets a sweet girl and changes his deviant ways


It&#8217;s not even just about a boy and a girl


It&#8217;s a story about rock band that loves music and wants to make it big
It&#8217;s also about a career minded woman with ambitions of her own

It&#8217;s a great telling of what happens when Deacon McCoy, bassist for Oblivion meets Harper Lee, chef for their tour.Harper is an independent, carefree woman that grew up with roadie parents who were constantly on the road


Besides being solely interested in staying unattached, she has build an immune system to artists mainly because she understands what happens in that lifestyle


&#8220;Women are a commodity, a vice, and a temptation.&#8221; Focusing on her career working as a chef on tour won&#8217;t be a problem

Or so she thinks.Deacon McCoy &#8220;is the definition of a Boy Scout.&#8221; &#8220;With a merit badge in hot.&#8221; And underneath his tall, tatted and talented exterior lay a patient man, &#8220;the backbone for everyone,&#8221; determined to lead his band to success.They didn&#8217;t expect each other, but once they came across each other it seemed like they were destined to be together.&#8220;And now this man that had torn through her like a summer storm was beside her, steady as a rock
She&#8217;d seen it in his eyes

Forever

As if he could actually inject it into her veins like a drug, with the passion between them.&#8221;&#8220;There would be an indelible mark on her, no matter what


A Deacon tattoo that branded her heart as his.&#8221;Even when &#8220;his career and hers were on completely different trajectories.&#8221;Besides giving us great characters and plot, Taryn Elliot and Cari Quinn have crazy writing skills


Rocked is funny, flirty, swoony and oh so darn sexy


It&#8217;s also filled with beautiful descriptions and analogies that will make your mouth water when their talking about food,&#34;You gotta tell me your name.&#8221;She stuffed a hunk of potato in her mouth


&#8220;Why do you care?&#8221;&#8220;Because food orgasms are personal, and I need to know who&#8217;s giving me one.&#8221; &#8230; the man was lethal.&#8221;Ok so that was Deacon and Harper flirting because of food, but food does play an important role in the story.Their metaphors will make you picture all the sights the characters witness, imagine the great music they produce even when you don&#8217;t know the tune or lyrics, and overall it will make you experience touch and intense emotions through their words.&#8220;Every single time he touched her, the sense of belonging strengthened
They were like layers in a song he&#8217;d never hoped to create
Words were only one part of them
The harmony of their bodies moving together, the underlying melody of humor and rightness he felt around her, it all made up a composition he&#8217;d happily give a lifetime to figure out
She was his ultimate song that would never have an end.&#8221;It&#8217;s also safe to say that I will never go to another rock concert and not think about this book and these characters
It gave me new perspective and appreciation about everything that goes on stage and behind the scenes even when I&#8217;m sure this was not the book&#8217;s main intent.I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on their next Lost in Oblivion book.** I was given an ARC of this book for an honest review from Netgalley

$review_text.: I have mixed feeling about this book.  There are many things I liked about it.  To start with, the story is good, keeps your interest, solid action and I like the length--it is a book not a fluffed up short story.  The editing is poor but not that distracting (I expect the editing will improve over time and I'm not a frustrated writer looking for a reason to bad mouth a book).  I will buy the next installment from this author.  The book has plenty of action and science.  My disappointment in the author comes from the less than artful sex scene and needless (juvenile) references to female features.  It was unnecessary and detracted from an otherwise good story.

$REVIEW.: I was absolutely hooked from the first page!  The main character is a smart ass with a bad habit of getting herself into some serious action- and the writing is so intense I found myself on the edge of my seat, not able to put the book down.  This book definitely is a thriller mixed with erotic and humor.  It's hard not to love Marnie and her seriously screwed up life.  I most certainly recommend this book and am looking forward to many more great reads from Aj Aalto! :)

$review_text.: I'm a social worker, and I used to work in a psychiatric hospital.  Part of that job entailed writing short biographies of the new residents based off of their own accounts of their lives and then also interviewing their family members for accuracy.  It was one of the more interesting parts of the job, imagining what their life was like before mental illness, what their relationships with their families was like, etc.  So, I figured this book might be similar, only even more involved and interesting, given the length and first hand family member account.Based on the title, I figured the book would be about Barb, who develops schizophrenia around her early 20's.  The book is written by her sister, and in my opinion is really about her sister and her sister's relationship with her father.  I suspect that this is because the book was written shortly after the death of her father.  Barb is more like a background figure that never really evolves into much of a central character. As a social worker, I wanted more descriptions of Barb's symptoms; her hallucinations and delusions.  More of a picture of the stark contrast of how her behaviors changed before and after the development of her mental illness. I would assume that most readers would also, since the book is supposed to be about someone with schizophrenia.I found the book hard to follow as well, with the timeline seemingly jumping around and in a manner that was confusing and did not flow at all.  Most chapters were only 3 pages long, and for no particular or discernible reason.  Overall, I did not find the book well written, and would describe it as 'average'.

My first two authored books deal with similar aspects of misconceptions about God and how our whole environment taints our view of Him
I am so glad that I am not the only voice out there that is calling for reasoning and perception change

I highly recommend you glean all that you can from this book
 A second or third read will also bring out deeper aspects of what John is trying to convey
Good job, John!

$REVIEW.: Although I have great respect for Jeavons and enjoy his seed catalogs, this book was a total disappointment

 If you want practical gardening advice, please save your money to buy his seeds but don't waste money on this book


 Yes, the book contains interesting information - a fascinating history about the "roots" of bio-intensive gardening - but otherwise it is devoid of information I could actually apply to my garden

 In places, the writing is so bad as to render simple techniques completely incomprehensible
 Jeavons spends 7 pages describing "double digging" and after reading twice I still had no idea what he was talking about
 The book "Starter Vegetable Gardens" by Barbara Pleasant explains the method in 2 pages which I understood perfectly


 Jeavons' book contains 43  pages of charts


 Trouble is, the "keys" and "codes" to the charts are so complex and annoying that I will never use them and have no idea what they are for


 Jeavons mentions cool concepts like "companion planting" but then fails to give any practical advice on how to do it


 If your needs are geared toward survivalism - i.e
working with people in developing countries or if you are a backwoods survivalist here in USA - you will find this book more useful than I did

 If you just want to know how to make your yard as productive as possible and learn some good gardening techniques - there are many better books
 For PRACTICAL how-to advice on growing organic food in limited spaces, "Grow Great Grub" is inspiring and well-written


 "The Urban Homestead" is not specific to gardening but full of practical good advice for anyone who wants to grow lots of food on a small space

 I wanted to like Jeavons' book, because I really do like his seed catalogs and his philosophy, but it is badly written and not very helpful except in terms of survivalist philosophy.

$review_text.: STORY BRIEF:Cyn is a former Los Angeles cop, now working as a private investigator.  She's tough, cool, smart, and rich (inherited).  When she was a cop, she saved a vampire's life, so now they hire her when they need human help.  Alexandra is a vampire who lives with Raphael, lord of the vampires in the western U.S.  She is kidnapped by a group of vampires and humans.  Raphael hires Cyn to help find Alexandra.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was labeled paranormal romance which implies a couple gets together at the end.  But the couple was not together at the end.  Also, there was no romance.  Raphael's actions were those of a guy making booty calls.  There was lust, but he never indicated any feelings for Cyn.  After sex he coldly left her without a word.  At the end of the book, she was hurting.  The last words in the book are "To be continued."  On the author's website in the description about the sequel (Book 2), is the following.  "Running from L.A. and its seductive Vampire Lord, Raphael, Cyn sees the Houston job as a welcome refuge, a place to get away and heal her broken heart."  In Book 2, Cyn interacts with Jabril, an evil Houston vampire.  My frustration is wondering how many books will there be before I can see Cyn end up with Raphael?  Then I find a mini story on the author's website about Cyn and Raphael spending Valentines Day together - written as if they have been a couple for awhile.  This scene occurs after Book 2 which I have not read.  I wonder if they get together in Book 2, but I don't know.  Too many other series have frustrated me with the guy and girl still not together after several books.  So I'm going to pass on this series.  If you want to read the mini story, go to DBReynolds Wordpress Com, Vampire Vignettes #2.An example of Raphael's emotional distance was when Cyn says to him "You're right, I do want you.  But there's a difference between wanting and having.  And I won't have anyone who doesn't want me."  Raphael says nothing.  Another time Cyn says to Raphael "You don't want me.  You just want to f___ me."  Again, Raphael says nothing.  That's no fun.Now, if I can forget about expecting romance, I will say that the story and characters were good.  Cyn is a neat character and does some smart things which I enjoyed.  We don't see Raphael being smart, but he doesn't need to be since he is so powerful.  He simply exudes his power to control others.  There is good action, mystery, and storytelling about solving a mystery, hurting the bad guys, and saving the victim.I had a problem with one scene.  Raphael tortures and kills a human in such a way that another human soils himself and is in such fear that he is willing to confess everything.  But the author didn't show or give any details as to what Raphael did to the first guy.  I wanted to know.  I'd prefer showing not telling in this case.DATA:Story length: 240 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual language: strong.  Number of sex scenes: 4.  Total number of sex scene pages: 6.  Setting: current day primarily southern California with some back stories in Russia and France.  Copyright: 2009.  Genre: paranormal mystery with sex.

$REVIEW.: 4 1/2 sweet peas!In Thorns, Feliz Faber gives a sweeping and richly detailed glimpse into the often unseen world of horse racing, and the larger-than-life characters that inhabit it. Reading the blurb is like reading the menu at a fine restaurant-you get a dry,brief description of a fillet mignon. To really appreciate the fine meal you must taste-or read-it for yourself.As a character driven story with a smoothly flowing plot, this book is populated by characters who are very complex,vivid, dramatic, and solid. Watching the characters grow and change as they overcome betrayal, pain, misunderstandings, and sabotage to bring their dreams to life, and the honesty, loyalty, passion and hope they display makes this a very richly satisfying tale. The backstory is utterly fascinating and lays a solid foundation for the storyline. With handsome men, beautiful backgrounds, and passion galor, the sex is hot and steamy.The author's writing style is unique, eloquent, concise, and straighforward. The author has done a skillful job of pulling back the curtain and giving an in-depth and up close look into the seldom seen world of horse racing. The autor displays a well researched knowledge of the horse owners, trainers, grooms, jockeys, and various others who are part of this fascinating sport. I absolutely love the vivid details of the characters, backgrounds, and pageantry that go wirh this sport. The book has a HEA ending after a surprise twist that I didn't see coming. If you're looking for a fantastic and enthralling way to spend a few hours, then this is a book you should definitely check out.This review originally appeared at Mrs Condit & Friends.

$review_text.: I have read the books before this one in the series and really enjoyed them, these books are fun reads. This one though has to be my least favorite. I knew right away when they mentioned in book 4 that trevor was married to chassie something bad was going to happen.It seemed when Edgar came into the picture Chassie really didnt matter that much but Trevor told her she did. It was extremely hard to connect with this book becuase(yes i know this is more or less a fantasy book but none the less) it was unrealistic the way she had the characters react. Chassie got like 5 seconds to feel hurt than she was pretty much forced to deal with it. No real back lash for Trevor. It seemed he felt bad for about 5 seconds than wanted to have sex with Edgar as soon as possible. Chassie got the shaft a lot in her life and got it again with her husband and just went with it like no biggie. It was somewhat annoying and it seemed like that Edgar and Trevor were closer and she was more or less an outsider the whole time.If your like me you will get annoyed with the book alot with the way the author lays out this story. I felt it could have been done differently. It seemed Chassie was just a filler so it was okay for Trevor and Edgar to be together and find some kind of acceptance from there peers instead of being "that gay couple" to everyone. I think this could have been an amazing book (I was hoping she would do a book for Trevor and Edgar but this was a let down) but the way Chassie deals with things and how things are dealt to her just is annoying and some what unfair. You'll see some onse sided-ness with Trevor when it comes to Chassie liking someone else and he freaks but he can have his ex-lover? Yeah alright. He can be really rude to her for no reason and be forgive the next second, Chassie can't do a thing though, just be a good wife.So definitely not my favorite book at all, but I made myself finish it, if someone reads this sorry for the length, I think it just shows how disappointed I was in the book though. So just beware, a lot of people enjoyed it, but I can't see how no one felt bad for Chassie who was stuck in the position, "deal with it now or leave but dont think I wont take your man if you leave". So who knows, you may hate or loves this book, took me about 60% into the book before I could handle it without rolling my eyes too much.

Davis herself

I'm having so much fun reading it that I'm being very careful to ration myself to just a few pages a day.I too have been inspired to start rereading the series (after all, 20 years is a bit long to remember a plot...)


Thank heavens I've saved most of them and won't have to find and/or pay for them again!The only thing I'm not liking about the book is that Ms


Davis leaves a tiny bit of doubt that she will be writing another, but at least she's left us a real body of work, unlike the marvelous Ariana Franklin and Kate Ross.

$review_text.: Monica is a school teacher that finally overcame a traumatic experience when she was a teenager. She&#8217;s ready to try a relationship. Victor is an ex-military man. He has issues and is upfront about his inability to commit. He&#8217;s willing to offer Monica sex and no more. Even his time is limited. Monica agrees to his terms. She wants to get as much of him as she can. However, Victor has secrets. He never talks about his family. He can only see Monica one weekend a month and one night a week. What is Victor hiding? Can Monica handle a relationship with Victor without losing her heart?I had mixed feeling about this book. I did end up enjoying it. It had some very hot scenes. However, I found the beginning to be hard to read. I found Victor&#8217;s dialogue to be&#8230;Hmm&#8230; I guess cheesy is the only word I can come up with. I really didn&#8217;t like the way he spoke to Monica in the beginning. Some might find it sexy or erotic, I didn&#8217;t. I did continue to read and the book did definitely redeem itself. I loved the twists and turns the author threw at us. There were times I wanted to just slap Victor silly. I hated the way he only thought of himself. He was very selfish. I was overjoyed when Monica finally stood up for herself and realized she deserved to be put first. I was happy with the ending. It had a great conclusion. Overall, a good read.

$review_text.: Billy Bean from his earliest days faced a life of challenges, and despite his natural sporting prowess and unconditional willingness to try and please others his sexual preference remained a matter of personal worry until after his baseball playing career ended.It seems that some social perceptions, rather than laws, influence views of homosexuality, which is conveyed in this book on the grounds that being homosexual isn't a crime, yet some views assert that it is wrong regardless thus overruling law. Subsequently, discrimination is a stronger currency than the laws that supposedly protect the rights of citizens. Notwithstanding such social barriers Billy Bean stepped out of the shadows of prejudice, and he has provided an inspiring account of finding oneself.Sections of the public need to appreciate that whilst they have a right to comment on a baseball player's skills, which they pay to watch, they don't have a right to pass judgment on a person's sexual or political preferences. It is an insatiable appetite to know the most personal details of public figures, which is sometimes perpetuated by the media that denies privacy and hinders the right to personal choice. Choosing homosexuality is a matter of lawful personal preference and that's where public opinions should start and end.Billy Bean has bravely offered his story and we can all certainly learn a lot from his courage.Nicholas R.W.

$REVIEW.: When I first saw the title of this book, I immediately decided it was a must read for me.  You see, my husband and I parent an intelligent, cute as a button, energetic, life loving "wild thing".  In addition, he's lovable, loving and likeable.  Our "wild thing" is the light of our life.When I began reading Jessica's book, I was soon drawn by how her honest and truthful accounts resonated with me.  I giggled to myself, shook my head in total agreement and was stopped mid-sentence by chapter two's title:Children are aliens, not criminalsAlien, what?Yes.When our children enter this word, they're new and everything is new to them.  Our responsibility as parents, is to teach out little aliens how to live in their new world.  I love how Jessica explains it:"Young children are literally new to this planet. They don't know the rules or the language or the social etiquette. They want to. They like to learn and be included in what everyone else already knows, but it's hard. It's hard to be a little alien. They're not acclimated to our big person atmosphere yet so they get tired easily. Just living is exhausting because every chair is above their chest, every step is above their knee, and every counter is above their head. Every word spoken, and object touched, and interaction tried is exploratory; a grand experiment (and, judging by the reactions of all the grownups, one they seem to be consistently failing)."  Bowman, Jessica (2011-07-27). Parenting Wild Things (Kindle Locations 139-143). BookBaby. Kindle Edition.After reading her thought, I thought back.  How many times did we "assume" Alex knew what to do when what we asked was completely foreign to him.  Something as simple as "Alex, take out the trash" needed a teaching moment.  I was beyond excited to share this insight, my light bulb moment with my husband.  Jessica's word has helped changed HOW we instruct our little man.Something else which spoke into my heart specifically was the amount of time, real-time, spent with Alex.  I love the real life reminder Jessica shared about her own experience parenting:"More often than not all that our children need or want from us is our attention...I have wanted to bend them to my selfish will so that I wouldn't be inconvenienced. I want them to go to their room, or go outside, or just go away so that I can get things done. I want them to be quiet during a movie so that I can watch it uninterrupted. I want them to pour their own drink so that I do not have to get up from where I sit to help them. I want them to show me what they're so excited about later so that I don't have to stop my train of thought right now. My motivations are always selfish. Always."  Bowman, Jessica (2011-07-27). Parenting Wild Things (Kindle Locations 245-251). BookBaby. Kindle Edition.Wow, cut right into my heart!  It embarrasses me to think back on how many times I let my selfish wants and desires trump time with my little man.  I'm so thankful God uses the words and lives of sisters to speak directly into us, into me.Although there are MANY wonderful thoughts shared by Jessica, I'll leave one more with you.  She asks her readers, "Why is it so hard to say yes to our children?" Bowman, Jessica (2011-07-27). Parenting Wild Things (Kindle Location 388). BookBaby. Kindle Edition.If I'm being honest, it's easier to say "no".  By saying "yes", an action is expected.  So, when I'm in a selfish state of mind, the last think I want to do is say "yes".  Additionally, saying "no", especially without taking time to think about what is asked, has the potential to squelch their creativity and excitement.  Again, something I don't want to do.I gladly recommend this book and give it a 5/5 stars.

Their glaring reminds her of her Aunt Judith.  While at the mall with the aliens, the aliens suddenly sit down.  Now the problem is finding out what caused them to sit down.  Meg hooks up with Calvin Ledbetter, a choir director.  Together they must unravel why the aliens are finally responding to something.After a few pages of introductory exposition the action starts up, and doesn't end until the book does.  Willis is a master at capturing the fun of the old madcap romantic comedies of Hollywood's golden era.  The only problem is the brevity of the work.

$review_text.: Without Purpose, Without Pity is a fantastic novella with the backdrop of an isolated Las Vegas and the surrounding desert
 The characters were all very real to me--their motivations and emotions true to their situation

 Brian Hodge remains deliberately obscure as to the strange force isolating the city
 In this regard, we know as much as the characters, and are able to immerse ourselves in their world that much more easily.Another remarkable aspect is that there wasn't a dull part in the story


 Each individual scene was a well-crafted addition that furthered the plot along


 The climatic conclusion was, in my opinion, simply outstanding!  I will be avidly searching out other books by this author.

$REVIEW.: Lynn Raye Harris is well known as an author of sizzling, contemporary romance.Readers who are already familiar with her work and romance readers who are longing to try out a new writer would certainly enjoy this short but action packed read.  Many novelists find the short story form rather daunting, but Lynn Raye Harris packs a lot into this novella meant especially for e readers.  The result is a short ebook which will satisfy readers who enjoy contemporary romance.When Maddie and Ryan meet on the neutral territory of Hawaii, the not so distant past comes to mind.  She, as a news reporter, gave out an unflattering story which cost Ryan some of the sweetest moments of his career.  The tough Marine finds it difficult to let bygones be bygones.  But the sparks of attraction are flying between them.  Can this pair bury the hatchet and get to work on that attraction?When I say it's a hot read, I'm referring to the sizzling hot chemistry between Ryan and Maddie, rather than to sexual descriptionn.Recommended for fans of contemporary romance.

I can truly see why he said that now - the book is awe inspiring, and I don't say that lightly.There are passages that read as if someone living in 2013 America was writing them, they are that pertinent and powerful


Take into account that it was written around 1300 years ago, and that - that is amazing

As I read this I thought of some recent books I've read and rated kindly.  This book makes me realize I need to at least give more 4 Star reviews and be choosier about my 5 Star reviews as this story ... *sigh & grin* - Just love it!  The love between Nicola/Collete and Gilliam grows gradually and has such depth and richness.I'm looking forward to the next 2 books in this set, but almost reluctant to begin as I sort of don't want to leave the world Ms. Domming created in this one, though I always enjoy her work.  She is one of my favorites as just like this book the heroine has strength of character and her behavior fits the times or as in this case explained to a point that is it believable and only adds to the story.  You can almost see and smell the environment.  You come to understand and appreciate the main characters.I love the stories Ms. Domming weaves for us and I was particularly taken with the H/h in this book..... More later (if I remember) on others and then I'll just edit the whole, but I couldn't seem to wait to write a review.

 Jonah Woldermariam, born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, is the son of Ethiopian immigrants, Yosef and Mariam


 As the novel opens, he has separated from his wife, Angela, and left his teaching post in New York, where they live

He embarks on a road trip to Nashville to retrace the inauspicious journey that his parents took years ago when his mother was pregnant with him.Jonah is critically isolated from others, implacably at times--and until he met Angela, he lived in a bubble of one
 He was never close to his parents, whose relationship was destructive and toxic

His unhappiness has a root of violence--familial and ancestral--and Jonah is irresolute and melancholy, unable to climb out of his dread


 He discovered that reconstructing and revising stories about his past allows him to cope with the present


 Angela joins with him in this, like a parlor game, but when she realizes that his coping mechanism has become pathological, as well as detrimental to their lifestyle and intimacy, their marriage starts disintegrating.Jonah's trip to Nashville is a starting point to exploring key events of his parents' life and ultimately gaining understanding of his own

There are several narrative threads interwoven--his own history, his parents' struggles with each other and their turbulence in Africa and America, and his relationship with Angela


 Jonah has refined the art of embellishment so well that sometimes he doesn't know where the truth left off and the reconstructions begin
 Revising history has served him for many years

 He is like a functional alcoholic whose powerful addiction (anesthetic) gives him fuel to carry on day-to-day while it gradually destroys him

At first, it was a healthy outlet for him to accept and control his existence and gain some personal identity

It even helped refugees at the center where he worked for a while by assisting them to amplify their personal histories with acute poverty and violence, sometimes when it didn't exist


But now the past has urgently infringed on the present and threatened his future, and his imagination is now eclipsed by volatile and sobering realities.Mengestu's prose is tender and beautiful, and he creates an atmosphere of foreboding that is palpable and deep


 I felt Jonah's pain on every page, and there are poignant moments of his parents' past that cut like a blade


 However, it became a bit tedious after a while; instead of moving forward, the story was stuck in the same gear for many pages and meandered in a revolving door

He  also skimmed over some details that left me puzzled
 One sentence that bothered me was that he went to stay with a friend in Brooklyn for a period of time

 That may seem like a throwaway line, but Jonah didn't have any friends!  The whole point of this depiction is to illuminate his isolation and inability to effectively sustain a relationship
 That small convenience of the author felt like a betrayal of the authenticity of the character.An ick factor crept into Jonah's revisionist history, too, when his fabrications went over the top and seemed unnecessary, and instead of rooting for him I wanted to scream


 Perhaps that was the author's intention, but it impeded the pathos and I wanted to shake him out of his self-indulgence, which I felt droned on too long

The revelations are hinted at early, and the major revelation, by the time it came, felt anti-climactic.Despite these drawbacks, I was moved by this heartrending story of redemption

Jonah's lifetime crisis was depicted with gentle insight, and Mengestu's sensuous prose is radiant, even when the story occasionally falters.

$REVIEW.: Oh Maggie! This book made me laugh out loud, in public.(should have taken pictures of people's faces) There were points if I could have I would have grabbed the main character's shoulders and shook her.  It was an excellant read. Set up with a diary entry at the beggining of each chapter and then the story behind the entry. A sweet, easy to read, and mostly clean romance and so enjoyable. The main character's "in the clouds" thoughts were wonderful. There were points I felt so attached to Maggie and she pulled some very female antics(like trying to make boyfriends and crushes jealous.)  I will be reading this book again!*recieved book for an honest review

$REVIEW.: I got this book from the author in return for an honest review.  When I started this book I did not realize it was part of a series, and even though this is book 2 I did not feel left behind on any of the action.  I enjoyed the Egyptian history that was revealed throughout the book but wish there had been more world building in the book (there may have been more in the first book, will have to check it out).  Even without the world building I truly enjoyed the premise of this book and will look forward to more from this author.

When his brother ends up dead, Artemus feels compelled to start his own investigation, as no one else seems concerned with his death. I love the characterization in this book.  Each one seems thoughtfully planned out and each personality is distinguishable from another.  Especially Artemus.  He's someone I'd have fun hanging out with for sure.The read was smooth and the storyline easy to follow.  I love M. Cid D'Angelo's ability to paint a picture with his words.

$REVIEW.: Involuntary Witness is the first book in a series featuring Italian trial lawyer Guido Guerrieri, who lives in Bari, Italy
 The book is a translation from the original Italian into British English, at least my copy of the book was in British English.The author, Gianrico Carofiglio, is a former Italian judge, so the legal aspects of his novels are very accurate, and are interesting in their own right due to the complexity of the Italian Justice System, which the author explains clearly for the reader.The book has a first-person narration by the protagonist, forty-year-old civil and criminal trial lawyer Guido Guerrieri, who recounts the events that make up his mid-life crisis, including the lost-cause court case that contributes to his redemptive recovery.The author has filled his protagonist with a wicked sense of humor, which makes the book very entertaining


 Dialog is often embedded in the narration, reminiscent of J.D

Salinger's Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye.If you have read any John Grisham novels, you might recognize the pattern of the down-and-out lawyer wracked by self-loathing who redeems himself by winning an impossible case for a just cause.Are you a Nick Hornby fan, author of the novels High Fidelity and About a Boy?  If you are, you might recognize the spoiled, self-indulgent man-boy protagonist who suffers a crisis that pushes him to mature out of his prolonged puberty into full manhood.Did I enjoy reading Involuntary Witness?  Yes, I did, mainly because of the Italian cultural setting and because of the humor in the book


 The first-person narration worked well, too, letting us into the mind of the protagonist, no matter how awkward it was at times
 Personally, I found his strong attraction to masculine women a bit odd, but to each his own, and it fit with Guerrieri's passivity

 And the frequent petty references to people's weight were out of place.However, there were times when I had flashes of other books or films pop into my head, suggesting there was some borrowing going on that wasn't necessarily credited

 And knowing the torture that a passive-aggressive can inflict, I found it difficult to feel much sympathy for Guerrieri
 For the same reason, I found ridiculous the suggestion that one conversation at the end of the book (which we are not privy to) with his ex-wife could take away all the pain Guerrieri's behavior caused her.Lastly, I think the book could have been better if the central legal case had been resolved completely; but I will leave it at that, to avoid spoilers.Oh, if you are a former smoker, avoid this book
 The protagonist is constantly smoking.Please read my full review at Italophile Book Reviews[...]

$REVIEW.: To tell the truth I didn't want to like this book.  You see, I am a Imperial guard player and the idea of a commissar not wanting to be commissar just didn't sit well with me, but I sucked it up and gave the book a try.  I then opened the book and was even more irritated because the book was written in a first person point of view, which I obviously don't like, but then again I sucked it up and read it.  And I am glad I read it too!  This book is such a wonderful book, filled with action, humor, mystery and the most usually commissar, Commissar Cain.  Being a guy who is supposed to instill morale and courage when in the mists of battle, doesn't ever want to be there and will do anything to get out of action makes a pretty usually character.  For the Emperor, is a must read for fans of the 40k range in the black library.  It's one of my favorites, right up there with Gaunt and his Ghost!

$review_text.: Marley in Chains by RG Alexander is the third book in the Smutketeers naughty Christmas trilogy. Marley was orphaned right after she graduated from high school, and subsequently ran from her family and two dearest friends, Michael and Carlos, as far and fast as she could. While she did accept a job with her cousin Holly over a decade after that, she's locked herself away from everyone intentionally, and is ready to sprint again at even the possibility of reconnecting. She recognizes that Holly needs something though, and takes her to an old neighborhood haunt to tie one on to celebrate Holly's impending milestone birthday.Michael is stunned to hear through a friend that Marley's back in town. He was devastated when she disappeared without a word seventeen years ago, and he and Carlos haven't been quite the same since. Especially after Carlos returns from an overseas tour in the Marines a shell of the person he was before.Marley can't believe her eyes when she opens her door to a Christmas past--Michael is even more appealing to her than he was years ago, and she cannot turn down his request to help Carlos. The feelings they'd shared as teens seem a mere spark compared to the passion that threatens to engulf them all as Michael and Carlos orchestrate a visit to their Christmas past--one that might turn out to transform their Christmas present into a very remarkable Christmas future...Ms. Alexander pens a story that is both emotional and kinky. Marley, Michael, and Carlos have some pretty deep-seated issues to face, and Ms. Alexander ably deals with those as well as bringing them fulfillment as they reconnect both physically and with their hearts. Look forward to enjoying some holiday healing as you curl up with this read!

$review_text.: I loved this book, and I was sad when I read the last words. Diamond has created such an interesting world, complete with complex pack politics and an engaging mystery, and nestled it so neatly within our own. I feel like I could walk out my door and find a new shifter friend, or enemy. What I appreciated most about Shifting Pride is the care Diamond takes in interspersing shifter info and lore into the story, be it with a book Nickie finds or folklore other shifters share with her. Diamond is very thorough in her world-building and it definitely adds to the overall realism of this shifter tale.Diamond does a fantastic job keeping the pace snappy. She gives us just enough information without overloading the reader or making her plot predictable. With each new revelation, I was anxious to see how she manipulated the information and was not disappointed. I kept hanging on to each word, each sentence, each paragraph, each page, hoping right along with Nickie that she would soon be reunited with her dad.Shifting Pride is a must-read for anyone who enjoys an engaging story. Even if one strips away the shifter element, we're still left with a great book about a daughter who will stop at nothing to bring her missing father home.

$review_text.: This was one of three books I received for Christmas two years ago
I was able to complete this book in a little over a day because I was on Christmas break


Being a teacher certainly has its perks


I learned about Respectable Sins from Piper's Desiring God site and thought what Bridges had to say was something I needed to hear and something I would enjoy reading


I am a dirty rotten sinner, and I do not like how we gloss over the topic of sin


Sure I am a new creation in Christ, but that does not mean I no longer have an old nature to battle


Many people are quick to point out major sins of society such as abortion, drug abuse, and homosexuality, but sins like anxiety, pride, and worldliness are also an abomination to God


I struggle with some of these "respectable" sins on occasion, but I am thankful for men like Bridges who help us better understand how to combat the ugliness in our hearts

I would recommend this book to all believers
It is not a book of condemnation, but a book of hope that speaks truth in a gentle way.

$REVIEW.: This novella gives us a glimpse of life in the Box between the events ofAftertimeandRebirth.  It's very short... less than 30 pages, but it manages to maintain the feel of the full length books.The story begins with the arrival of a young boy and his grandmother to the Box.  The old woman is dying and the boy, Feo, has no one.  Cass and Smoke open their tent to him for the night, while Dor decides whether the child can stay.  At first Cass fantasizes a little that Feo will join the family she has made with Smoke and little Ruthie.  But the boy latches on to one of the guards, making her realize that he needs things she can't give him.There's not a lot to this, and you don't need to read it for Rebirth to make sense.  Feo is present in that book, but the events of his arrival are given in clear enough language that you won't miss anything. Still, I'm such a fan of this series, I wouldn't skip any tidbit that Littlefield offers. 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: I loved the beginning of the book, but as I continued reading I liked it less and less. I won't discuss the grammatical issues as several reviewers have already done that. I liked the plot of the novel and the fact that the hero saw through her outer appearance to the woman inside. Melissa had low self esteem because of how she has been treated all her life by friends and her mother because of her weight. Caleb the hero did help her to work on these issues and to see herself as worthy of love. However,then she became too dependent on him and allowed him to ride roughshod over her in their relationship. He told her that he wanted her off birth control; no discussion about her readiness to have a child took place. She was just told he wanted to breed her so to stop taking her birth control pills. She was also made to get a tattoo without being asked if she wanted one. She was wearing some kind of collar that showed that she belonged to him  also which I was a big turn off to read about. I felt as if she was losing herself in this relationship. Although the story had promise I was really turned off by the hero's domineering personality.

Cherry St. Croix has hit bottom and she is clawing her way to revenge in this wonderful new addition to The St. Croix Chronicles.Cherry's husband was brutally murdered on her wedding night by a secretive rival collector. Running from the imprisoned life her mother-in-law has imposed, Cherry leaves her life to return below. With limited resources, Cherry's only safe haven is the Midnight Menagerie but something terrible and sinister lies in the eyes of her savior, Micajah Hawke. In need of cash and her next fix, Cherry focuses on Jack the Ripper's collection. To top it off, Cherry's opium habit, caused by her father's betrayal, has become life threatening...leaving her in a constant drug induced haze or withdraws.Corroded was a difficult story for me, I couldn't put it down yet was saddened by Cherry's downward spiral. I have to admit that I was thrilled by the hope of change proposed at the end because I don't think I would want to continue Cherry's story if her hopeless take on life continued.That being said, I still found this story memorizing. So many things were exposed, incredible revelations revealed and absolutely shocking...mind blowing twists!This entire series has been a fast paced thrill ride, containing non-stop action and heart gripping emotion.

It takes a strong stomach to read, it brings tears and angst to the reader, but it indemnifies the west's push for human rights, for equality and most important respect and dignity for people.

However, the dead man's spirit doesn't depart this world, and Martin, the medical examiner, is the only person who can hear the man's ghost speak.  Not believing in ghosts, and having no evidence that a crime occurred, Martin's sanity is questioned by himself and his co-workers as he works to sort out reality from the impossible paranormal activity.This story relies on the ghost's somewhat sarcastic personality to keep the reader's interest, though the ghost's appreciation of the female anatomy is not lost on the audience.  The clues and the reactions of the people Martin encounters would be relatively mundane if there were no ghostly observations of a ghost who understands the underworld works.  After a while, the ghost's wandering thoughts get a bit long, but the story continues to provide clues that mystery readers will be compelled to continue toward solving the murder and figuring who did what.An OK story, there are some editorial issues with grammar;  perhaps the few issues are due to the translation.  The first in what promises to be a series, this story introduces several characters that are unique enough to be one of a kind--but also general enough that the readers will identify with them and understand what motivates each.  This book will never be a classic, but it is a good read for the person wanting a bit of light reading imbued with a solve-able mystery of the paranormal kind.

$REVIEW.: Finding Claire Fletcher is a great suspense thriller. I found I couldn't stop reading once I started. Claire Fletcher is kidnapped at age fifteen and even through all the pain and abuse she keeps pushing forward never giving up, but never going home either. Every two to three years she reaches out to let her family know she is still alive hoping they never forget her. The fear and torture the kidnapper installs in Claire by threatening her family, kept her within his grasp and will make your heart ache to reach out to her.  What I found most interesting about the book was the mother's resolved that her child was still alive even after ten years missing. The emotions this book evoked was wonderful. One minute your heart is pounding the next tears are falling. The story line is strong and keeps the reader entwined with feelings and concerns of what will happen next. Even though some of the chapters seemed short and did not add to the story line; the book over all is fantastic. I look forward to additional books by Lisa Regan.

I know God would have provided some kind of comfort for him.The story&#34;Nine Seconds&#34; is good also, although it is remake of the sub-story in &#34;Saving Brooksie&#34; I still enjoyed it.Only reason I give the book 4 stars is that it is too short.

$review_text.: I think the second in the series was even better than the first. They all leave you wanting more and so I rushed out and downloaded the third one as soon as I was done with this. A little more sexually explicit, this book started to go down the path of a romance novel more than a fantasy novel. Not a bad thing, unless you are really against romance novels. It was definitely more about love than survival. Still a good, fast read.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love the "faking a relationship" plotline. Don't ask why; I probably have hidden issues. Give me a story where the leading couple have to pretend for one reason or another that they're in love and end up falling in love for real and I'm in. So when K told me about Her Accidental Boyfriend I said, "Yes Please!"After reading the final words...I'm on the fence. I enjoyed the story enough that I read the whole thing with minimal breaks and never thought twice about coming back to read more, but I had some issues on a few different fronts.1-Character names, particularly the heroine. Kagan? It took me forever to figure out how to pronounce it in my head and until that happened, it was extremely distracting and only served to make it difficult to connect to the leading lady. (Note: I'm not 100% sure but I believe it's pronounced "Kay-gan")2-The blocking. Oh the blocking! Every time Kagan and Shane came anywhere close to kissing or sealing the deal, something inevitably interrupted them. It got to the point where I was expecting the stoppage before it even happened and didn't feel entirely realistic. Example: Kagan and Shane are hanging out at her place one evening. They lean in to kiss...and there's a knock on the door. It's the neighbor boy bringing his fish by for Kagan to babysit for him that she conveniently forgot all about until that very moment! The boy leaves, the fish stays, they lean in again...and the phone rings. Oh no, family emergency! It just felt a bit forced. When they did finally seal the deal, it was a very uneventful fade to black with little lead up. Didn't leave this reader feeling like it was worth all the wait.3-Forced drama. Interruptions aside, the dramatic twists and turns to the story also felt a bit forced to me.Shane was sweet and I really liked him. The only thing I didn't like was that he was painted as some "bachelor playboy" when he never once acted anything like that. His comments about being terrified of commitment and never wanting to get attached to a woman didn't match up with his actions. At all. The man also needs to seriously consider filing a sexual harassment suit against his employer. The woman was totally creepy, bordering on unrealistic. Veiled threats that he wouldn't get promoted unless he remained a bachelor? Not gonna fly.I liked Kagan too but again, she had me confused from time to time. She left New York to escape her controlling father. She seemed very immature and timid...then she'd have these moments where she was a confident sex kitten trying to seduce Shane. Where did that come from? I also had a hard time believing that she was a high ranking executive in a Fortune-whatever company prior to leaving New York. I loved her tribute to her mother when she found her new venture and felt like she did fit into the life she was making in Cascade, so that's the important thing. I do wish she'd grown a little more of a backbone. When faced with her father again, that immaturity came right back. She wonders why her father doesn't respect her wishes and let her live her own life? Maybe because one demand from him and she's back to doing exactly what he wants.I really enjoyed the characters and their relationship, but there were pieces about these two that just never fit for me and those pieces always took me out of the story for a moment. I loved the supporting cast and the community feeling the author was able to create. Made me want to fly west and visit Cascade; to stop and grab a drink at the Crown & Anchor. Shane's family was loving and adorable and I love how they made Kagan right at home. Charlotte was a great friend to Kagan and I love how she was integrated from start to finish.Overall, I gave Her Accidental Boyfriend three stars. The love story itself was sweet. I really enjoyed the scenes with Kagan and Shane together and their gradual shift from casual friends to fake boyfriend/girlfriend to something real. In the end, I'm glad I read it and walked away feeling uplifted. The above mentioned reasons kept me from loving it completely.

Other than that I liked it, the glimpses of character from previous books was fun, and the sex was really really hot!

$review_text.: I've been on a mission lately, purchasing several different bibles, and this one was recommended as a good literal translation. So, I've been using it as one of the books for side-by-side comparison.I have to say, in most regards, it's very good. But then, I came across some things I had to absolutely disagree with because the publisher/author bias was just too evident and I've pretty much shelved this book as a guide. I still use it as a comparative, because it's helpful to see other points of view, but, I would not base my beliefs solely on this book.It's good for a scholarly study. Not so good for a theological basis. For a good solid theological basis, stick with a KJV or NABRE (or both to get the most from the words of God :)The book itself is well done, good binding, etc. The included extra notes are very helpful, from a secular point of view.I'm not one of those fanatics who'll tell you only certain translations are the "true" or "inspired" word of God - because none of them really are (Jesus didn't speak english :P)It's more helpful to try to understand the underlying principle (eg, love thy neighbor & enemies) and strive to live by Jesus' example and admonitions, than to take the bible as some kind of excuse to shun each other, give up improving the world around you and waiting to be removed from all this messy world (ain't gonna happen folks. Read the bible, Jesus said that's not how it's gonna be :P)Off my soapbox now :)

In this book the hero and heroine are both heroin junkies and murderers...  something I've never seen before in a novel.  I'm sure a lot of the stories are based on fact, and Allen creates an interesting perspective on a world and subculture that main stream Americans are very unaware of.

$REVIEW.: The Bayou Stix series is one of my all time favorites
Book 3in the series is Alluring Temptation and is just as amazing as the others
It might even be the best one to date.Skye gift for details is present here bringing back all the same well loved characters for Liam and Clove's story


Clove is Dade's little sister who has come home after rough break up in LA

Dade leaves her in Liam's care while he is out of town


Clove is subjected to Liam and his revolving door of women but admits he is totally hot
Liam can't believe he starts to see Clove in a new light and that she might just be worth changing his man whore ways for

The journey is filled with twist and turns that will make you cry and laugh


You see the real man in Liam and become a champion for him and Clove.I really enjoyed this installment of the series

It gave me the emotional level higher then all the others in this series at the perfect time in the continuing Saga of Bayou Stix

 Another chart buster of a hit for Skye Turner! Can Not Wait to see the next story with Dade-- it promises to be really a show stopper.

$REVIEW.: Thomas Dyja succeeds at a wealth of literary and historical feats in &#34;The Third Coast: When Chicago Build the American Dream.&#34;Among them is something I personally thought impossible: with his beautifully written and impeccably researched book, he has proven that my now (only sometime) nonfiction writerly hero A.J

Liebling could be a lazy, hack fabulist

I am referring of course to Liebling's own &#34;Chicago: The Second City,&#34; his long ago tome which bludgeoned the city, for reasons based totally on Liebling's own ability to sway with well chosen, if not always exactly truthful or fact-filled words.Dyja has lots of well chosen words, chapters and chapters for that matter, a book's worth, that accurately portray this most American of megalopolises at the center of American life at a time when this was still &#34;The American Century.&#34; The range of hundreds of characters, from Mayor Daley, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Nelson Algren, and even the train station--yes, I'm counting Chicago's hugely important train station as a character--provide a mother lode of stories beautifully told

Woven together, Dyja has created a tapestry as rich and fathomable as the story of the city that until now has been as unfathomable (to outsiders) as it has been fantastic (for those who live and lived there, or understood why it was sui generis, simply unto itself.)There is Ben Hecht's Chicago, Studs Terkel's Chicago, Irv Kupcinet and Mike Royko's Chicago--and now we have to add to the pantheon Tom Dyja's Chicago, and his portrait of not just a city, but a time and place and people
Thank God he got there to put it all together for the rest of the country that thinks the story of big city America are tales of NY, LA, and Washington

Besides great history, Dyja adds the special treat of making the book a great READ


The books doesn't come off  as a dry urban history lesson but rather a true-to-the-footnote fable of a different America expecting different things from arguably its greatest city

Growing up in Minneapolis, Chicago was my New York: Dyja's book reminds me why the greatest thing I could ever imagine doing was someday living in CHICAGO

This is a great book.

$review_text.: TL;DR version: Better than average world-building concepts, reads like well-written Mass Effect fanfiction, Dinosaurs In Space! (+1.5 stars just for this), MC is not a convincing soldier, MURIKA!Longer version:Of many, there are three things that, I believe, characterize good science fiction stories:1. The Concept(s): good concepts are about technology, about looking at the Universe a different way, about something new born out of the minds of men (or aliens). And ultimately, the concept must be expressed in human terms, must shape and warp and define the narrative in a deeply meaningful way. This book delivers on the concepts it promised. +1.5 stars.2. The Character(s): 3D. Familiar-and-yet-unfamiliar. Heroic, whatever the author defines that word to be. Convictions, moral or immoral, chaotic or otherwise, but *convincing* convictions.3. The Arc(s): Growth or decay. Change. Not just in the story, but in the *reader*.I have never encountered a truly *good* science fiction story from which I didn't walk away a changed person, in a small or a large way. Because we - our hopes, our fears, our technologies, our worlds - are mirrored in the story and the character.Conversely, of the many things that characterize first-person-shooter/shooter-rpg games, there are two that are pertinent to this book:1. Playability and repeatability: To be able to mow down enemies in a satisfying way, in a way that is just familiar enough to feel comfortable, and in a way that's changed just enough that we keep coming back to mow down said enemies on new terrain.2. The ability to disengage from the character - play in their bodies, but not their heads. Kill 10,000, turn off computer, kill more tomorrow. Headshot! Awesome! Laggy. Damn. I mean, if you grant violent FPS games the ability to truly *change* or *affect* the player, you have to grant that kids are being brainwashed into mass-school-shooting perpetrators because of video games, which is hogwash.Both games and novels are awesome things in their own right, but when your gameplay is nothing but cut-scenes with a dude reading to you, it sucks. And when your novel reads like a dramatized version of UT....In this book, there's a few good things. Firstly, it's well written - the author had a clear, consistent and strong voice. Secondly, the plot moves along at a fair enough clip (despite there being, in parts, too much shot-for-shot narration, enough that Clancy would get bored). Thirdly, two of the concepts developed - Earth's only export being Mercs, and the endless death-revival of said soldiers - are refreshingly original.Caveat: they're refreshingly original *if* you look at the book as a book, and not video-game fanfiction. The author gives it away a bit too, at the beginning.This book is a gamer's fantasy. The plot can be boiled down to this: entitled gamer-kid realizes family doesn't have money to send him to school, enrolls in a mercenary outfit, battles ensue, he finishes all his missions, dies and gets revived a couple of times, a couple of cut-scenes explain the larger universe. At the end, we find out there's Politics. And Bureaucracy. The Earth is at risk, and low-level grunt will somehow save the day, eventually, buy the expansion pack and find out how.My biggest gripe isn't even the lack of *other* world-building concepts, I mean, FTL is somehow there and isn't even hand-waved, it's unlikely you're going to get lizards with blood similar to humans on a silica-poor world, blah blah blah. Whatever, I've read and admired worse world-building in books.My biggest gripe is the Main Character - already forgotten his name, Jarvis McCain?Firstly, he's a dick. A caricature of what people think teenage gamer guys are - unsympathetic to their families' plights, unmotivated about carriers and schools, arrogant and self-entitled. Okay sure, let's wait and see how this guy grows and changes...and wait...and wait...The End.He's not a convincing solider, or a convincing Merc. After much training and supposedly life-and-death bonding experiences, his concept of camaraderie begins and ends with off-hand insults traded with a lacky. His unit-cohesion with his squad is nonexistent. He obeys orders when he feels like it, rebels when it suits his surly, arrogant self. He's *exactly* what an entitled-dick-gamer-caricature-19-year-old *thinks* a soldier is.A real marine would pop this kid one in the teeth.And he's the hero.This could have played very well - real opportunity for meaningful character growth right there. I suspect, however, that the author is *not* aware of how very un-soldier like his &#34;solider&#34; is.At least there's women fighting alongside men, equality in the forces and all that jazz, right? Well, there's 4 major female side characters. Kiwi, squadmate (sexed by MC). Natasha, squadmate (clumsily romanced, rescued and then sexed by MC). Anne, biomedical officer (shown to be incompetent under fire, unfairly blaming MC, then rescued by MC, now friendly. To be leered at in 3 separate scenes out of a total of 7 encounters). Thompson, another biomed. CRAZY BITCH out to kill MC. The 2nd in Command of the entire mercanary fleet. CRAZY BITCH - Hillary Clinton in Space, out to KILL MC but leered at by MC the moment he sees her. Petty jealousies, because they're all fighting, one way or another, over MC's ass.Oh, and he's the most popular guy around, got a mouthy sidekick that's more comic relief than friend.If this was a real person - or even if the author was doing a character interview, I'd like to ask him a couple of questions:1. Solider, did you ever miss your mother, she of the shaking-hands who tried to keep you in elite-gaming-rigs and university with the last of her money? Did you ever write home? Send back some of your pay? MENTION family even once? What about all the guys you played basketball with (we're led to assume he has excellent physique because he plays tons of basketball)...your gaming clan (he's clan/guild leader. Because of course)...anybody at all? Do you realize mercenaries are people too?2. Soldier, why didn't you react AT ALL when you killed someone for the first time? Yeah, they're aliens. But they bleed like humans, they are an intelligent starfaring species. The most stoic hunter *reacts* when he shoots even a dumb animal for the first time. I'll buy adrenelin and heat-of-combat as an excuse. What about after? And what about your mouthy sidekick? His first time out, he's convinced he's getting kill-shots, and he's bragging, calmly. You're too manly to react, what about him?The characters didn't think about this because the author didn't. This is a video game.And my biggest issue? It's the MC bitching about the raw deal he's getting, rebelling against the &#34;system&#34; - his superior, the galactic laws, what-have you - then going back to eating chow and extolling some virtue of the same game that keeps getting him killed. Like the rifles - that struck me - they're mass-produced for an &#34;average&#34; humanoid, don't have friend-or-foe ID. Weaponeer mentions that if Earth made it, friendlies *would* be identified, dammit, so they don't keep killing their own guys. MC agrees, has a 2 paragraph internal monologue about the system that keeps earth from manufacturing their own, superior, weapons that wouldn't kill his troop-mates. Then he says (paraphrased) &#34;but these guns are a damn fine weapon&#34;. WTF?All this *could* have worked, you know, if we'd been shown MC as an unreliable narrator. But he's in deadly earnest. We're *supposed* to accept his reality as the Right One.This is the first book I'd read by this author. Tempted by the concepts offered in the blurb (and, to be fair, the conceptual promise was delivered as advertised), but I won't be reading any more.A counter-recommendation: if you're looking for something that tastes like this - space-marine flick - read Elliot Kay's &#34;Poor Man's Fight&#34;

$REVIEW.: Childress' "Mystery of the Olmecs" is a good quick read

It explores many theories regarding Olmec history


He mentions the Olmecs custom of flattening their heads


Childress also makes note of  drilling a whole in ones head to become more psychically powerful


David Childress thinks the remnants of elongating heads through headwraps may be found in turban wear.The Olmecs as well as many other cultures, consider elongated heads more handsome and represented higher intellect

Having been called a "bean head" growing up I wonder if there is any truth to this.Childress makes some pretty interesting connections between the Olmec and Shang Dynasties


I don't buy into the theory of an army of Chinese eunchs representing the Olmec in any way


And I believe the hallucinogenic mushroom angle a bit far fetched.Childress definitely supports the diffusionist theory vs the isolationist, and so do I

He makes comparisons of the writing script of the Shang & Olmec Dynasty and brings out many similarities
This book is one of the most well illustrated with many Olmecs images in Guatemala never seen before
I enjoy Hatcher Childress' Lost cities series and place this book right along side them.

$review_text.: A well-written and detailed account of the worst human beings in society, Without Conscience is based on decades of case-studies and psychological research. Despite this technical and esoteric foundation, Hare has created a very readable and engrossing tome of psychology's recent discoveries in this arena.Alongside a gruesome and terrifying introduction (in which Hare briefly describes the most iniquitous, egregious and brutal crimes of psychopaths) is Hare's clarion call for awareness and action. Not only do they blend in among society and appear more "genuine" than human beings with a conscience, but they can manipulate even the criminal justice system into paying them exorbitant sums for revealing the bodies of their victims (this is not in any sense rare; one villainous woman who murdered her children to be with a man who did not wish to raise children attempted to paint herself as the victim). Unchecked and manipulative psychopaths tend to end up as puppet masters in their own despotism, and having a democratic government is no barrier to them, as the 20th century proved all too well.Chapter 1 details Hare's experience with a psychopath who was, perhaps, the best liar in the world. While the pranks he played on the then-greenhorn Hare were generally inconveniencing as opposed to violent, they still revealed an inability to empathise (or even an interest in empathising) with others. Years later, when Hare met Ray while he at a university, Ray's silver tongue effortlessly glided from one lie to the next, claiming to have been Hare's assistant. Ray's versatility and lack of even a remote sense of guilt allowed him to deceive everyone he came into contact with.Ariel and Alice feature prominently as twins with polar opposite temperaments and behaviour. While Ariel was a perfect angel by any metric, Alice was delinquent, violent, impulsive and saw her parents as nothings more than crutches to lean on and people to exploit. Cigarettes and marijuana were normal for her in high school, and she gave up on college after less than two years.Chapter 2 defines psychopathy in objective terms, from glibness and charm to anti-social behaviour to indifference in the face of others' suffering. Being manipulative and charming to nearly supernatural (and certainly incredulous) extents enables them to indulge in another trait - social parasitism, being waited on hand and foot by individuals who believe their every word (at least for a while).The following two chapters describe the characteristics of psychopaths in superb detail. As Hare mentioned in his introduction, everyone has dealt with these individuals, and after a thorough read, one might suspect which acquaintances and "friends" are psychopaths, although a definitive diagnosis is impossible without substantial training or access to an fMRI device.Predictably, psychopaths often turn to crime, their manipulative and deceitful talents being excellent for manipulating others to do the deeds and enable them to keep their hands clean. Their invariable egotism and arrogance makes them almost certain to defect in prisoner dilemma scenarios, going free while hanging their temporary partners out to dry.In addition to case studies, Hare analyses films and novels based on psychopaths, with biting insights from his work in the field. These not only provide a wealth of information into the minds of individuals and why some can become utterly enamoured with the monster within, but also into how society views these monsters, contrasted with what they actually are. There certainly is no stereotype for the face of a sociopath, and anyone from any race, culture or ideology could be one. Fortunately, they are a minuscule minority, and it is possible to detect these aberrations.The most crucial and important tools I gleaned from this book were two very simple but effective ways. Firstly, one must be watchful for stories that seem too good to be true, or almost too conspiratorial or alluring to believe. It is easier than one might expect to crosscheck these tales, especially if they slip up and mention the name of an alma mater they did not actually attend. Their yarns will almost always have an air of plausibility about them. Secondly, discard your intuitive naivete about people. Trust must always be earned, never granted as a default. Psychopaths are always all too willing and able to exploit this tendency.As Hare describes eloquently in his final paragraphs, as the technology of society progresses to include home-made explosives and automatic weapons, identifying, isolating and treating these anomalies becomes more crucial than ever before.

$REVIEW.: Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon is an action packed middle grade science fiction adventure.What I liked:I enjoyed the strong themes of friendship and forgiveness that run through this story. Josh and his best friend Troy have each other's backs and don't bother with holding grudges. I found their dispositions refreshingly angst-free for teen characters. The overall concept of the story is one laden with fun and adventure. It has super powers, space ships, aliens, planetary exploration, and an unexpected number of tacos. It's the kind of story that will likely spark a youthful imagination, as it holds so many possibilities.What didn't work for me:My main issue with this book, and what ultimately didn't work for me, is that I could never feel immersed in the world or the action. The descriptions were rather sterile, and while I felt as though I should be marveling at strange and wonderful alien worlds, I could  never really picture them. I want to smell those alien flowers, awe at spectacular landscapes, feel the character's heart pumping in his chest as he flees from enemies. However, the narration was too sparse to engender such reactions.For most of the book, the protagonist flits from crisis to resolution so swiftly that I, as a reader, didn't have time to generate either concern or relief. At times, the action is so hurried and nondescript it felt like summary.  Josh's emotions, up until the climax, are barely described. I would have liked to have felt his fear and his pain more. I would have liked to see more consequences for his actions and his failures.The plot itself seemed to be entirely reactionary and built upon happenstance. It begins with a desire to explore and then becomes a long chain of Josh helping people with problems that we didn't know existed until it's time for them to be dealt with. I wish that more of the momentum of the story had been in Josh's hands. The plot felt like a series of small, unrelated quests that didn't build up into any grander purpose.

It has normal aspects like new school and no friends and bullying.  But then it starts to get weird and weirder with all sorts of supernatural happenings.The cover alone is enough to get the book in their hands and get them interested.  The 3D effects are amazingly well done and the idea of such a teacher must be thrilling to contemplate. There are simple pictures throughout the book to coax along the reluctant readers.Girls also might like this book but the main readers might be boys from around Grade 5. I can see them reading and discussing it and looking forward to the next.

Gabi, was a super cute little girl, and Rutherford was really sweet and took the time to get to know Maren genuinely. Elsa, was a very wise woman, and had a fun saying for practically everything :)I really loved the character interaction, and how the relationships felt natural. And the story had a great theme, and storyline. I would definitely recommend this sweet novella.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Thank you!

$REVIEW.: The product page says 23 pages.  So going in I knew it was a short story and therefore didn't need to  invest too much into the characters.  The description says she walks in on him pleasuring himself, so I was hoping that would lead somewhere and it did.Looking through the 1-3 star reviews, I feel many of them missed the point of short erotica. At least for me, erotic shorts should be a snapshot, a peak into a very intimate moment between a couple.For some there wasn't enough back story, but in my opinion the author gave enough for me to know that Blake was a soldier who had been burnt while in service and is now a writer.  Erin was a college student trying to earn money by working as a maid.  She had worked for Blake long enough for them to become friendly enough to hold long discussions and debates.Blake was probably in his 40s and had developed deep feelings for Erin and he felt due to his age and physical condition that he was not worthy of her beauty and youth.  I felt for a 23 page short that is a lot of information.Other arguments against the story include "too short", "just sex", and "not my cup of tea".  For me it was just the right length for a short story, as erotica it was hot sex with just enough back story to become involved with characters without being too much to take away from the zing.  Finally I do enjoy erotica so this cup of tea hit the spot.

$review_text.: This is an interesting, insightful and ultimately depressing book about what may, or may not, happen at the 2012 winter solstice. I much preferred the first half of the book: The author investigated the Mayan and Aztec archaeology and legends, then applied modern scientific research to predict what version of the "apocalypse" we might get. I won't reveal his conclusions, but if he's correct you'll want to buy a nice warm coat -- and get off the electrical grid as much as possible.However, the second half of the book is mostly based on the work of Edgar Cayce. That's not a negative if you're into Cayce, but for me it was too esoteric and suppositional. I'm not a student of, nor a believer in Cayce, so I basically skimmed the second half, paying it little attention. I did notice, though, that in reference to the Statue of Liberty, the author places it on Staten Island. (It's on Liberty Island, once called Bedloe's Island, near the New Jersey side of New York Harbor.) If he could make that error, how many others did he make that I did not recognize? It left me with a less-than-sterling opinion of the book.However, the first part is interesting.

$review_text.: Well I think Elle Aycart topped herself when she wrote this one.I loved More than Meets the Ink, but I think I loved Heavy Issues even more!Both Christy and Cole have plenty of baggage! These two had heavy issues, pun intended! They end up together as part of a no-strings-attached, sex-only bargain that ends up being so much more. Turns out when they took away the pressure of a regular relationship, they freed themselves up to caring and trusting each other. They confided their deepest, darkest secrets and in the process they formed a relationship. Something neither one of them wanted or thought they needed.I really loved Christy. She struggles so much with her demons in the past and was ashamed of her problems but she continued fighting and never gave back in. Cole helps Christy work through her insecurities and find some self-esteem. Christy, in turn, helps Cole deal with his abandonment issues getting him to open up more emotionally.Of course all of this started with the sex! Let me tell you, this was one of the steamiest reads I have ever read! It rivaled Fifty Shades of Gray, in my opinion! Cole was possessive, bossy, intense, demanding and ran the show! Very alpha-male.I'm officially an Elle Aycart fan-girl and can't wait to read the next Bowen brother's story. Max is going to be a difficult one to tame!

$REVIEW.: Montana Women Homesteaders: A Field of One's Own is an anthology of testimonies and vintage black-and-white photographs following single women who filed on 160 or 320-acre homestead plots in Montana. Some were single; others were widowed, divorced, or deserted; some had children; and they varied in age, educational level, and ethnic background. Some were ultimately more (or less) successful than others, particularly as the Great Depression closed in. Yet all of them tested themselves on the land and contributed to Montana's rich history. An absorbing, often deeply personal account in the words of women determined to make it on their own, highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I'm just going to throw it out there from the start. Searching for Moore is one of my favorite books this year, so I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next part of Schooner and Mia's story. I just assumed it would pick up where the first left off, and we would get the fallout of Mia's accident. I must admit, I was a little disappointed when I found out this book was going to be about the missing 24 years of Mia's life. I wanted Schooner! After reading Moore to Lose (Needing Moore Series), I have to say that I almost loved it more. ;)This book is almost all Mia, and it is brilliant. We already know what Schooner was doing during those years he and Mia were apart. Those years with Mia was a complete mystery. Her story was so captivating that I honestly forgot about Schooner for a good part of it. There I said it! I felt guilty, almost like cheating on him, but I couldn't help it.The first man in Mia's life after Schooner was her professor, Tom Sheehan. Tom was good looking, smart, charismatic and a player. I think I was able to like Tom because I knew she didn't end up with him. He was a person that helped her over her heartbreak and helped bring the old Mia back to life. He made her feel desired again. Their relationship was definitely hot, and I kind of loved him even when I shouldn't have. Tom made Mia laugh.Tom's exit from Mia's life was exactly how I figured it would be. The actual scene was so great that I highlighted the whole part. Mia's words and actions were so her and so hilarious. The part of her life after the breakup was anything but funny. I think I knew deep down that Mia's rape was going to come back to bite her eventually. How she dealt (or didn't deal) with it was extremely painful for me to read.The other man before Schooner was the one that I fell in love with. Michael was such a sweet guy. He was everything Mia needed at the time. He didn't push her, but was so patient and attentive to what she needed. I knew she clearly wasn't going to be with him in the end. I just didn't want him broken by her. I wanted Julie to write him a HEA and everything work out for both of him. I had a feeling about what was coming, but it didn't prepare me for what happened next.You probably don't know this, but Julie Richman is a stickler for details. She researches her books almost to the point of being obsessive, but I think that's why her books are so amazing. If you don't believe me, wait until you get to around the 60% mark. The emotion and the conversation that takes place in the next pages will be with me for a very long time. I still get goose bumps when I think about this section.Schooner does make an appearance at the beginning and the end of Moore to Lose, and  I have to say that I am not too happy with him right now. I can't tell you why, but I hope Julie doesn't make me want to junk punch him in book three!I think this is one of the best series out there, Hookers! It is an amazing story, it is full of emotion, and it is real. The relationships are complex and the characters are unpredictable. Julie will wring you out emotionally and leave you craving Moore!
$SUMMARY.: A fantastic second book in this must read series!

$REVIEW.: Robert's day couldn't be worse. The night before, his on-off girlfriend suddenly dumped him for good and couldn't even give him a reason why. The next morning, he gets fired, out of nowhere and for no apparent reason. To make matters worse, he leaves his umbrella at work on a rainy day. At home, his landlady complains about his wet shoes because they ruin the floor. The only thing that could possibly help now is a long, hot bath. But then a dwarf suddenly drops in Robert's beloved bathtub. From then on, everything goes rather neatly to hell for Robert.&#34;Stiltskin&#34; doesn't take itself too seriously. That much becomes obvious as soon as you read the typical &#34;praise for this book&#34; by various stars and starlets. Miley Cyrus swears she'll never sit naked on a wrecking ball again because of this book and Angelina Jolie stopped saving the world one adopted child at a time just to enjoy this book. That's the first time I nearly fell off my chair thanks to Andrew Buckley's mean sense of humour.I usually don't particularly enjoy funny books, so I was admittedly a little dubious whehter I would like this book, but I absolutely loved &#34;Stiltskin&#34;. I downloaded the excerpt and just couldn't stop reading. It's definitely addicting. The plot takes countless unexpected twists and turns and I was hooked within minutes. It was full of suspense and utterly hilarious at the same time. &#34;Stiltskin&#34; is an insane book, full of crazy ideas, but I never felt like it was ridiculous.I really enjoyed the world building. You get to meet well-known fairy tale characters such as Stiltskin and the Mad Hatter, but they don't quite behave the way fairy tales want to make us believe. Because what humanity doesn't know is that there are actually two worlds. &#34;Othaside&#34;, the world we live in, and &#34;Thiside&#34;, the world where so-called fairy tale characters live. Fairy tales are just made-up stories that are based on remarkable people from Thiside. That concept allowed the author to give his protagonists real depth and a unique background story.To sum it up, &#34;Stiltskin&#34; is not your typical fairy tale. It's hilarious, insane and absolutely addicting. I enjoyed every single second of it and I can't wait to read the second part, especially with that completely unexpected twist at the end. Read it!

$review_text.: With all the people stating the usefulness of this book in their faithwalks I thought it would help me. I am a very reflective person and naturally hoped this book would help me pursue God.Each chapter starts with a verse and ends with a prayer. There is no active table of contents. The counter arguments to certain beliefs are vague. I had trouble getting into this book because it seemed to be wordy like much Christian advice writing.The best part was the chapter on meekness, about being childlike and finding contentment with who we are. &#34;The rest He offers is the rest of meekness, the blessed relief which comes when we accept ourselves for what we are and cease to pretend&#34; (83).That said, if you want to pursue a deeper relationship with God I suggest Ann Spangler's The Tender Word's of God instead,it is less wordy and more powerful.

$REVIEW.: There is a distinction about this book;  it isn't the worst book we've ever read in our lives, but awfully close. Merman's life has already been revealed in several other times (most notably her 1978 autobiography and the Bob Thomas' solid 1984 I Got Rhythm); here author Geoffrey Mark promises to tell the truth. Really? Where? Merman's alleged lesbian love affair with Jacqueline Susann has been documented already, as has the tragic death of her daughter Ethel Jr. and her very brief marriage to Ernest Borgnine. The book needs major editing and proofreading. Any book boasting lines such as "Romantically, she thought with her vagina" deserves to be slow-roasted, then spit out.

I plan to bring my big book of quizzes to Christmas Eve when my sister is in town so that we can drink wine, laugh and see how we measure up.The book is sectioned into 3 parts-Your Inner Life, Your Relationships & Your Career.Interested in finding out whether you are a perfectionist? How wordly you are? Whether you are a leader or follower?  You'll find these in the "Inner Life Section".  Want to find out if you can keep a secret?  How well you read body language or what your coping style is?  That is found in the "Relationship" section.  Want to know what motivates you or how ambitious you are?

$review_text.: At 1st glance this book looks like all the others, but it's truly in a class of its own. After you read enough art books, they all seem to be saying the same thing just with different pictures. This book is unique in that it expounds on topics that others gloss over and does so with fully commented, detailed, step-by-step photos.Take for example, the topic of value pattern. Many books mention it. Some even show a few examples. This author goes the extra mile to explain how to develop and use strong value patterns. Detailed and well documented demonstrations include the development of 2 entirely different paintings both starting from the same abstract value pattern. Conversely, working in the opposite direction, she shows how to start with your average (nothing spectacular) photograph, "message" its existing value pattern to create a strong design, and end with a gorgeous painting.Bottom line, by page 42 I had learned more from this book than from dozens of other books, many with similar titles. I recommend this book highly. It's exceptionally informative. The demonstrations are excellent. The artwork is beautiful. The book is an inspiration.

Sadly, they don't, and most users end up under-utilizing their gadgets. Fortunately, there are independently written guides, like this one from Darren Nelson, that really go to great lengths in terms of helping the end user reach the full potential of their gadgets.Indeed, Nelson's `Kindle Fire HD Tips and Tricks How-To Guide' has opened my eyes to the exciting capabilities of Amazon's Kindle Fire HD--who knew this nifty tablet could actually do all these things? For example, did you know you can actually purchase apps that are not in the Amazon app store? Or how cool the Xray feature is as it provides in-depth information about the movie or TV show you're currently watching on the device? Moreover, most instructions in the book come with a link to a Youtube video clip that allows the reader to see how it is performed in action.Overall, this is a great guide and I highly recommend this to all Kindle Fire HD users--if all you ever do on your Kindle Fire is watch movies or read books, then download a copy of this book and unleash your device's full exciting potential.

I liked the characters and the chemistry they had together.  Love how they both complimented each other and both were strong in their own ways which made them strong as a couple.  the friendship evolved and was great how flirty and sexy they were together.

$REVIEW.: I must say Mr. Weaver has most definitely done it again!!! After dealing with so much throughout her life, Veronica completed her time only to get things thrown at her once again. Her whole situation with Jacky was crazy! Memra was willing to help Veronica and even though there was another side to him, I can honestly say he was trying his best to be there for her. Who would've thought that the one ride Veronica wanted to take would cause people to blame her for something she didn't do, even the ones that were suppose to be closest to her. Caymus was so underhanded in everything. She was too much and her so call plan only backfired. I hope Memra and Veronica are able to do what's needed to be done to avoid any other obstacles thrown their way, including prison. I also, hope they handle Jacky B before doing anything else. Oh yeah Kyla!!! She most definitely needs that livewire now!!! Hopefully there's another part about Ms. Bitch, but until then I mostly definitely can't wait until that Bankroll Squad 4 drops!!!

$REVIEW.: "The fastest way to fill your head with lots of dots is reading


If you want to be successful and get ahead, you'd better be a voracious reader..." ~ pg
5David Silverstein has written a very short book that presents a lifestyle choice

Basically this book explains how to be more intellectually curious

It is well written with interesting stories of how companies succeeded using the methods in this book
You may think a trip to a museum would not inspire a new business idea but it just might
So this book focuses on exploring the world for new and creative ideas.~The Rebecca Review

$REVIEW.: Between the commas thrown around where they don't belong, use of quotation marks when not needed, lack of quotation marks when needed, incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, double negatives, improper use/lack of punctuation, etc. this story was a very tough read, and I cannot form an opinion on whether or not the story is any good.I understand that self published authors often do their own editing, but I don't understand why, if they know that English/spelling/grammar is not their strong suit, they do not buy a friend (who IS a grammar guru) a case of beer and ask them to proofread an advance copy? Most of the stories here on Amazon are short and could be proofread in a couple of hours, if not for content at least for spelling and grammar.

$review_text.: In her introduction, Neal promises to "...provide trustworthy information". She does not. She misquotes Romans 14:5 as "Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind." The actual verse says: "One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind." The verse, and entire chapter, deal with freedoms in Christ.She tells how kids become "Fully engaged" into Potter, saying " Kids who love Harry Potter take it personally when someone opposes these stories." "Hate Potter, hate me." She also states "If we care about a child who is already inot Harry Poter, we must realize that these stories have already become part of that child's psyche"Yet she still sees these books as good for children. "The Harry Potter stories do present potentially confusing messages" she says, and adds "Children need our help in distinguishing between the "literary magic" of a fantasy world and corresponding real-world occultic practices the Bible forbids". Just because magick is portrayed in a fantasy setting doesn't make it "literary".Neal states further on that "I believe God has given me insight that can replace this confusion with clarity..." However, this insight never shows up in her book. And what about the other thousands of parents, teachers and leaders who have prayed for the same? Is Neal special?Neal tells us that Hogwarts is an "out-of-this-world place". It is, however, IN this world, it is just unseen by, and inaccessible to, non-magical people.She tries to put the characters in a good light, leaving out information that would be contradictory. We are told the Hermione "consistently acts as the conscience of the group." This is only true for a brief time. Hermione soon gives up trying to disuade the boys from doing wrong and begins to help them.Throughout the book, Neal take to the all too common tactic of comparing the Harry Potter books to other fantasy books, The Chronicles of Narnia and JRR Tolkiens books. These arguements don't add up. She never goes into any detail, and, although she mentions Tolkien, never uses his books as an example.What we must realize is that the magick in dispue here is NOT the literary magic of wands and silly spells. The mains issue is the uses of REAL occultic practices, such as gazing (crystal ball), devination, reading tea leaves, palmistry, transfiguration, astrology,and more. Neal misrepresnts magick history and lore, softening it up so we can swallow it without discomfort.Later in the book, the author attempts to reach our spiritual side. She seems to take a balanced approach, but to any person who doesn't already support Potter 100% can see that she doesn't.According to her, reading the books can be a sin for some people, and ok for the rest. If that weren't bad enough, those who choose not to let their children read the books are, according to Neal, building a wall around them. She then accompanies this statements with a list of cons for building these walls. On the other hand, those who find it not a sin to read the books can profit greatly. They can be blessed, and can use the books to bless others.Connie Neal draws too many parallels where none exist. She wishes us to believe that we can learn Biblical truths and lessons from a series of books that was not written for that purpose. She compares several characters to important Biblical figures. one of which is Lily Potter, Harry's mother. Because Lily took a magical blast from Valdemort's wand that killed her to save Harry, Neal equates her to Jesus. The flaw in this?Jesus Christ was imortal. He chose to live the life of a mortal man, along with all the pains, trials and temptations. Lily was a mere mortal. Death would come to her eventually. Jesus gave his life on the cross to save all humanity, even those who put Him there. Lily died to save her son. What good mother wouldn't?...

Master and Ella were so great throughout this whole series. They had a connection. Their were times when Master questioned Ella's submissive side, thinking she was only doing it to make him happy. In this final book, Master finally opens up to her and tells her about his past. I found myself feeling his pain. Now its time to say goodbye. One last thing that has to be done.

$review_text.: When I heard that Deseret was publishing Kiss It Good-Bye, I had to read and review this book, as I've been a huge baseball fan since my Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 1958.John Moody was a 6 year old in Pittsburgh when the Pirates won the World Series, especially winning against the usually unbeatable Bronx Bombers, the New York Yankees, but 1960 was the year for the Bucks. They scrapped their way to their first Series win since 1927. and not last. The unlikely Pirate to help earn the Pirates their first World Series was pitcher Vernon Law, a very down to earth Mormon farm boy from Meridian, Idaho. Vernon had the nickname of The Deacon from his teammates for his strict Mormon upbringing.In the early days of major league baseball, players were close to their fans, knew how to really play the game, unlike how they play today. There were no free agents, million dollar salaries, high performance enhancing drugs or egos.Pittsburgh was the Steel City because of the steel mills that caused a gray cloud over the city for many years. It took some years to clean up Pittsburgh so that the citizens could breathe. They built skyscrapers, cleaned up the rivers. In the 40's, they were using electric lights, as the Steel City was in the dark during the day, and people had to cover their mouths and noses because of the contaminants around them. Some well known people couldn't wait to get out of Pittsburgh, like Gene Kelly and Edison. John Moody couldn't wait to move to Chicago.The Bucks in 1952 had the worst ever record of any Major League Team with a record of 42-112. They finished 54 1/2 games out of first place. They were constantly the cellar kings.In the 50's, segregation was rampant, so the black athletes couldn't be in the same restaurants with the other players, which was the norm in those days, but so unfair. The blacks would have separate restrooms, drinking fountains and have to sit at the back of the bus. This segregation was felt at the stadium. Vernon had been raised to treat everyone with respect and he did everywhere he went.Vernon married his high school sweetheart VaNita, who gave him children with V names: Veldon, Varlin, Vaughn, Veryl and Vance, who also was a Major League player.Vern won the Cy Young award and was the most valuable player in that momentous World Series, but he never regained his pitching arm after an injury to his ankle after they won the pennant. When all the team were on the bus celebrating with champagne, a member of the Pirate contingency got carried away and injured his ankle. Even while pitching his two games in the Series, he played with excruciating pain and in the next few seasons, because of that ankle injury, overcompensated and c aused his pitching arm to change. He never complained once. After retiring, he became a Baseball Coach at BYU.One nice thing I enjoyed about this delightful book is that each chapter is called an inning and the last chapter is entitled Extra Innings. John Moody brings the last game of that Series to a very exciting climax. I think the 7th game of that 1960 World Series was one oof the most exciting series of all time. An unlikely team, if ever, beat those great Bronx Bombers that had the best Yankee players ever to play the game: Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Moose Skowron, Whitey Ford, and Roger Maris. The team that beat these guys were scrappy guys, such as: Vernon Law, Bill Mazeroski, Dick Groat, Bill Virdon, Joe Gibbon, Dick (Ducky) Schofield, Bob Friend, ElRoy Face, Bob Skinner, Joe Christopher, Hal Smith, Gino Cimoli, George Witt, Bob Oldis and the late great Roberto Clemente.Forever Friends Rating 5 Stars by TeriUntil Next Time, See You Around The Book Nook.I received my review copy from Deseret.Published by: Shadow MountainDate Published:ISBN: 978-1-60641-149-0

$REVIEW.: I received this set as a gift many, many years ago when I was 8 years old

With this book, I was able to teach myself to knit within a few days
I made all the projects in the book numerous times.This book provided me with the skills I needed to begin knitting in a very user friendly way

 The step by step instructions and easy to follow pictures help in the learning process
 Since using the book, I have gone on to teach myself more knitting techniques and create much more advanced projects


However, recently when I wanted to create a few quick hats to donate as chemo caps, I pulled out the old book and used the hat pattern included
The book was definitely worth the investment.As for the included materials, I still have, and wear, the hat I created with the included yarn

The bamboo knitting needles are still one of my favorite pairs to use.Although I used this book as a child to learn, I have since loaned it to a few adult friends, and they were able to learn from the book as well.I would recommend this kit to absolutely anyone interested in trying their hand at knitting.

$review_text.: I have difficulty believing other reviewers read the same book I did.On the positive side:The spelling and grammar are impeccable.The female hero is not wimpy, nor dependent and she accomplishes great things with a lot of help from new friends.The general setting for the story was intriguing: a fantasy world where the deity puts its people to sleep every night and devours particularly wicked men, and women are considered to be generally less capable than men.On the negative side:Many characters' actions and responses didn't make sense; the incredibly powerful bad guy lets the good guys just walk in and check things out because they say/act like someone he used to know? A character views torture victims but is magically prevented from having an emotional response, then much later when the magic is removed she is nearly overwhelmed by the emotion?Many references are made to Gill's upcoming 23rd birthday as if it's significant, but the only explanation comes when she decides to follow a secret map because for her 23rd birthday she's allowed to take the year off - no reason is given as to why. The implied "Tradition" is not enough.It's difficult to keep track of the various characters because once introduced, they're referred to only by name, never by description or other hints of their significance, and some characters are given more than one name and personality. Characters remain flat with little background or depth. For example, a minor character in the beginning of the book is sought out near the end referencing only her name, no reminder is given of what happened earlier.Action is often too brief and boring because descriptions were bland and lacked colorful word choices. Then it's followed by stilted dialog to explain what happened and why. Or the dialog covers all the actions they can't take.It took me 10 days to read this novel rather than the usual 2-3, mostly because I didn't care whether or not I finished.  It's not a bad book, it's just not really worth the trouble of reading it.

$REVIEW.: Shamati (I Heard) is a unique and fascinating glimpse into the legacy of the greatest modern Kabbalist who fervently believed that the time had come to share the wisdom of Kabbalah with the entire world.  The bulk of these selections are from the period of time during which Rav Yehuda Ashlag, (Baal HaSulam) was completing his seminal work on the Commentary to The Book of Zohar.Shamati has a sense of intimate connection to the author.  It is as though we have been invited in Baal HaSulam's home and he has just chosen to share with us the deeper meaning of a specific phrase or concept from a Kabbalistic perspective.  Each selection generates the feeling of being the precise person for whom these words are intended resulting in a deep, open, vulnerable, inclusive, joyful connection to All-That-Is.

$review_text.: The author tells the tale of Hardwick, Vermont, once a thriving granite town (80 years ago), that had a long period of decline. Over the past 15 years, however, local food producers have begun to breathe vitality back into this struggling place; they provide money, jobs, and the ability to scale into even more work.While the story sounds wonderful, it's less about the local food movement, and more about how local, small town providers can make specialty goods to sell to bigger markets. Yes, by differentiating their products, and selling food that isn't corn, beans, or cornbeans, this town has created jobs. As the author says, and fights with, however, this isn't necessarily "local food." It gets shipped around the world (cheese), or to the big cities nearby. While there are some locals willing and able to purchase the food, it seems more are content to shop like every other american.This book is more a blueprint for seeking and creating value-added food decisions, and less about how local food saved the town. For what it is, it's a very good book, but it's wrongly described.3.5 stars. Rounded down to 3, since it doesn't deserve 4.

$review_text.: In the past year I have felt like I have been on an emotional roller coaster. I feel my own emotional storms within me, and those of co-workers and perfect strangers in the mall as I rush to get my shopping errands complete. As i wrestled with sleep each night I wondered if there was a peaceful and calm solution for this madness without going postal on myself or others. Enter Cyndi Dale, a bestselling author and expert on subtle body energies, chakras and so much more.In this book Cyndi shows you how to identify your physical, emotional, spiritual and relational boundaries. She teaches you how to determine if you are weak in any of these four areas and how to personally take steps to strengthen your energy. The instructions can be applied to any area of your life and bring you a sense of peace and renewed confidence.  This wonderful no-nonsense book will help you plug up your energy holes and become a balanced, confident and happy being.I highly recommend this book and all books and CDs by Cyndi Dale. I have found all of them helpful and books I turn to again and again when I feel off balance.

$review_text.: I thoroughly enjoyed this story

I was hooked from the very beginning and read straight thru, except for a sleep break!!Damaged but not broken


Alice has had to endure so much in her life
And it killed me slowly reading how no one ever helped her


Until she met Seth, her hero.Seth James was absolutely a swoonworthy.4.5 Huge Stars for this pleaser!I am hoping that there is more depth with Alice & Seth in the future from the Tears Of Sin series.

$review_text.: Okay, it was a free download but I have a number of complaints about this book.  1.  The introduction was a word for word lift of the introduction of another book I'd downloaded recently (Smoothie Weight Loss Secrets: 101 Delicious Smoothie Recipes For More Energy and Better Health (101 Healthy Recipes)and in fact the author hadn't even removed the word "smoothie" and substituted it with "vegan recipe."  I know the information is valid, but I think it would have been more to the point to include an explanation of vegan eating and perhaps the best sources of protein and vitamins for a vegan.  2. The recipes gave measures in a mix of grams, cups, fluid ounces and sometimes all three in one recipe.  I don't know how you were expected to follow the recipe accurately. 3.  It's supposed to be a book about healthy eating, yet an onion soup recipe calls for a tablespoon of sugar!  It's really disappointing as this could have been a great little book with more thought and attention to detail.

$review_text.: A very sweet read. The characters were interesting, the plot familiar but well written, and the love story came to a satisfying end. Lisa was pregnant when she came to Sweetwater to open an antique store.  Her former boyfriend wanted her to have an abortion and gotten violent when she refused. She meets Eric, an attorney, who is recovering from a tragedy of his own. With a little help from Eric's mother and the townspeople, can the two of them overcome their circumstances and find true love?

$REVIEW.: It isn't often that a novel's characters can produce such strong emotions in me. I experienced intense sympathy, admiration, and concern for young Cornelia, who struggled to understand love. And no wonder she struggled--she lived in a home where love was both conditional and meager. I resented her father for his lack of appreciation for this warm, intelligent, and innocent adolescent.  He berated her for speaking and learning about God and for kissing a boy, but he had no problem giving her alcohol to drink. I rejoiced over Cori's finding God's unconditional love as well as the human variety, through what appeared at first an unlikely source. This story affected me on a deeply personal level, and although it may not do the same for everyone, it is a worthwhile read.

$REVIEW.: Excitement was an understatement when I finally received my ARC copy. I've been dying to read what happened to Brooke and Jett right after I'm done with the last page of Surrender Your Love. Finally! Finally! I had my hands on Conquer Your Love and OMG! Was it worth the wait?! Hell yes!From the cover right down to the last page - I was hooked.The story started just right after Brooke left Jett after what she discovered. She packed her suitcase, put off her phone and flown to Bellagio with her Sylvie. She decided that she should move on. Trusting Jett was a mistake after he betrayed her. But forgetting and forgiving Jett would be harder than she expected especially when he finally found her and decided that he wants her back.Jett Mayfield on the other hand...He may be an a** in not being honest with Brooke, but he's making up for it. Okay, he may have to work to get on her good graces again, but he's willing to do it. He even flew straight to Bellagio to find her. He's still the super-alpha male we all loved in Surrender Your Love. He cares about her and willing to risk his life for her. Jett is finally beginning to open up to Brooke, not totally, but there's progress. How can she say no when one smile, one look from Jett made her defenses weak?Why I love this book more than the first one?Don't get me wrong, I love the first book. But the second book holds the title of my favorite among the series (or until the 3rd book comes along).Who doesn't love the setting?Bellagio, Italy! Just the perfect place to rekindle old flames.More intense, steamy love scenes... (make-up sex are indeed the best, even in writing.)JC Reed has more to offer in this book than an amazing love story & hot steamy scenes. I love the mystery that surrounds the Luccazone Mansion and Alessandro, as well as the old man's relationship to Jett's father. The mansion may not be the only thing that Brooke is inheriting once Alessandro is dead, but all the secrets that may be life-threatening to both Brooke and Jett.The thrill of the chase, the adrenaline rush...There is no boring or dull moment in this book, over 300 pages and yet I was done in one sitting. I'm sure like me, you will be hooked to and will have to demand that the third book be released right away. Yes, this is a trilogy. But unlike the first book, I like the ending of Conquer Your Love better. Now, I just couldn't wait for them to have their HEA. (Expected Date of Publication is September 2013 - Can I have this book for my birthday???)

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC of this book for an honest review.I will admit, that I was one of those people that was worried about reading this book because Jude, Q and Sabrina just totally grabbed my heart and attention
 I didn't see any way that lightening could strike twice

 Well, was I wrong!  Cross, Gemma and Izzy didn't kick the others out of my heart, but they pushed them over a little and created their own little niche.I love a tortured hero and Cross was all that and more

 I loved how all three of them learned something about themselves and came to accept that compromise can work and what they want isn't wrong


 It's a story about three people coming together and finding where they belong
 At turns, it's sweet and funny and emotional and ridiculously sexy.Leia Shaw, Sorcha Black and Cari Silverwood do an amazing job at creating a true and wonderful story
 I can't wait to see that they have in store for more books in the series

 Cause I know that they seem to create magic when they come together to write a book.

I don't mind though since I read very fast it didn't take me any time at all to get back to the first in the series (darn it!).I am always happy to find a new author that I anticipate their next book. It take the pressure off my other favorites!Kate Serine is excellent. I love her sense of humor and her characters talk like real people.

I can say that it is a good book for beginners

However, as usual, Carolyn spins a tale that you can't put down


The characters endear themselves to you quickly


The story is intriguing
Science, magic, monsters, warriors with honor, and romance, this series has it all
I personally can't wait until the next book in the series


We need to know how this saga plays out!!

$review_text.: Talk about overcoming something! Aleesa and Miles sure went through a lot!! I liked their story a lot! Their story exemplifies the meaning of a strong and loving meeting and later marriage! But I must say in the beginning I got a little lost with the storyline, but things got clearer by the middle of the story! Had me kind of worried, because it seemed like the story was finished.  I was like &quot;Ok the story is solved, then why do I still have half of the book yet to finish.&quot; But Riley showed me that things are not always as they seem!
