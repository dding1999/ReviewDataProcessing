$review_text.: Only Java Davis could write this unexpectedly refreshing tale with its unusual characters and make it seem plausible
With a protagonist who is smart and tough, vulnerable and feminine all rolled into one, and her two suitors&#8212;one a menacing looking biker with a heart of gold, the other a handsome, hard-drinking ladies&#8217; man with irresistible charm&#8212;it would seem an impossible task to put it together without sounding trite, but Davis is equal to the feat and manages it with ease

Woven into the comedy of errors are many heartwarming scenes and enough surprises to keep the reader&#8217;s interest throughout
I am now a full-fledged Java Davis fan and eagerly await her next effort.

Let me also mention I do not know the author at all

Some how along the road I liked her page from most likely through another author
I know how frustrating it can be to see reviews not verified..I was given this book yesterday


I started reading the story around ten pm

I was done with the book by 12:30

I was hooked after the first chapter

Aria does a fantastic job of keeping you entertained and bringing you into the story


I will definitely be looking forward to reading more of her work
I was also offered a copy of her other book, Heavenly Hell but I truly enjoyed Banished from Grace that will be buying it the second I am done with this review

Now please hurry up with the second book! I need to know what happens next!

$REVIEW.: No Show starts up at a very upbeat tempo with Terry Sheffield arriving in the USA to start a new life with his wife.  Then the story takes a dark turn and keeps on going for a very thrilling ride.  Very nicely written story by Simon Wood with strong characters that blend nicely with the story line.  A kind of whodunnit but with a twist and an ending that is not expected!This is the first book that I have read of Mr. Wood's and I will be buying more of his novels.  He has me hooked as a fan and I am sure you will be too if you like your books with lots of actions, suspense and thrills!

$REVIEW.: ....And not soon enough.  I've really missed what author Brett terms "the old reprobate" Charles Paris.  This time the often down-and-out (and unemployed) actor has landed two small parts in a new production of Hamlet.  Ambitious and temperamental young stars, an over-the-hill director, a powerful and ruthless producer and assorted other characters make for a long list of suspects when two "accidental" deaths occur backstage during the early days of production.  Charles's sharp eye for details, not to mention his past experiences with amateur sleuthing, come to his aid when he intuits that more was going on than meets the eye and begins doing an investigation of his own.As always, there are some humorous moments.  Most hilarious for this reader are Charles's reviews for past performances which are inserted when he recalls a particular play ("As the Detective Inspector, Charles Paris was about as menacing as a kitten" - Coventry Evening Telegraph).  What is sad and depressing, however, is Charles's continuing alcoholism and the shattered relationships and isolation his dependency has caused.  I keep hoping that Charles will receive help with this in a future entry in this series - who knows? it might make him a better sleuth than ever.
$SUMMARY.: He's Back!

I read this book and enjoyed it so much that I had tears running down my cheeks I was laughing so much. The antics that the aunts get up to in order to keep Nathan a virgin are great. I really felt bad for Aurora at times although she gives back as good as she gets sometimes. A great book with a lot of humor and a surprising amount of deep insight into the sensitivity of peoples private insecurities as well. All in all, a rather deeply insightful book for such a short story and a humorous one at that. This is a nice short story to get you in the mood for Halloween. Maggie Shayne is a great author and I love her books.

$review_text.: To make the most of this recipe book you need a few things: a juicer, a Vitamix blender , a food processor, a mandolin, coffee grinder, nut milk bag and a dehydrator. If you don't have these items you won't be able to make some of the recipes. The recipe I liked the most from this cookbook is called "Fruity Sunrise." It is a blend of pineapple, orange, strawberries and a wedge of lemon. I've put lemon juice in fruit juices before but realized that it is better to put a wedge through the juicer as it extracts some of the lemon zest and therefore tastes better.If you are new to raw foods this book has a good introduction. It explains what cooking does to food and why you should consider eating more raw foods. According to this book eating raw foods will make your body stronger and you will get sick less and maybe even lose weight.The authors of this book grow a lot of their own foods - you can tell from all the pictures. They also give detailed instructions for sprouting.Now from personal experience I'd advise you not to make the "Radically Radish" drink. I personally can not handle anything with radishes in it, it won't stay down long as it is much too spicy.To make some of the smoothies in this book you will probably have to order a few items like camu camu berry powder, spirulina, buchu powder, hemp oil, cacao nibs and goji berries. Or you might find these things at your local health food store.The chapter on nut milks will interest anyone who is avoiding dairy. This chapter also has instructions for making nut butters. This is why you need a good blender. Who knew you could also make nut cheeses? The chapter on soups is also interesting and includes recipes for broccoli and leek soup, butternut soup with carrots and ginger and wild mushroom soup. But don't go foraging for mushrooms yourself unless you really know what you are doing. The same goes for the salad chapter. Knowing which flowers are edible is essential. There is a list of edible flowers in this book which might encourage you to grow your own.Mmmm, the snack chapter talks about dipping dried figs in nut butter. Something I still haven't tried. There is also a recipe for raw cookies. Now the recipe I really want to try is the Mango-Gooseberry Cheesecake. It is made with a base of nuts and topped with passion fruit, raspberries and agave. It looks like I will have to buy a food processor after all.To end the book there is a chapter on chocolates which includes a recipe for medicinal chocolates. Then there is a chapter on hot drinks like chai and hot chocolate.Well this cookbook will probably appeal to the gourmet in you. The recipes in this book look so delicious but you need the equipment recommended to really make the foods presented.~The Rebecca Review

That's what they were both counting on until tragedy struck leaving Sloane barley alive and Killian left with nothing but hatred and anger. Sloane is shattered by Killian's abandonment of her until he comes storming back into to her life four and a half years later demanding her surrender in more ways than one. Is what Killian believed to be true all these years.. is that what really happened? Read this book and find out if they can get past the secrets and lies of the past and present and heal each other from heartbreak. When I read this I felt hatred for Killian and the way he treated Slone and heartbreak for the her as she was consumed by guilt and loneliness.

$review_text.: ANYTHING by Michael BaronPublished by The Story PlantPrint ISBN-13:  978-1-61188-021-2EBook ISBN-13:-  978-1-61188-022-9At the request of the publisher, a PDF was sent at no cost to me, for my honest opinion.Synopsis (from back of book):  With Anything, Michael Baron again draws readers into a world of deep emotion, compelling relationships, and heartfelt humor, and this time he adds a touch of fantasy

Ken and Melissa are at the dawn of a magnificent life together
A passionate romance has led them to the doorstep of marriage


While searching for the perfect wedding present for Melissa, Ken stumbles into a mysterious shop

There, he is given an extraordinary opportunity - to look in on Melissa when she was a girl

Ken has always wished he could have known Melissa from the day she was born and this seems like an incredible blessing.Until he discovers a terrible secret in Melissa's past, one so awful she has found it impossible to mention to him.Now Ken has another extraordinary opportunity
He can go back in time and change the horrible event that has left an indelible mark on Melissa
He can free her of this burden - but doing so could change things so completely that they might never meet.Ken has repeatedly told Melissa that he would do anything for her


But would he truly do anything?My Thoughts and Opinion:  I was introduced to this author back in December of 2009 when I read and reviewed his novel, Crossing The Bridge, and instantly became a fan
 Since that time, I have read the majority of his books and have yet to be disappointed


 Matter of fact, his books are like a fine wine, they seem to get better with time


 I was a bit skeptical when asked to review Anything, especially after reading his last book Spinning, which I rated 5/5
 Could he do it again?This novel had all the "Michael Baron elements" that first grabbed me, but then it also had a slight spin that had this reader wondering about once the last word was read (do not want to include spoilers)
 Mr

Baron's tender, masterful and descriptive writing style allows the reader to be transported and become part of the story line

 The characters come to life with the ability not to just read their emotions but actually feel and experience them
The vivid descriptions of the scenes provides the reader the ability to create their own life like story line that carries the reader side by side with the characters, like a mind's movie.As for the premise

 Haven't we all said at one time or another these words,  I would do anything for (fill in the blank)?  But would we?  At what cost?  Not only is this book  poignant, emotional, with a little suspense, and even a bit of fantasy but it is also thought provoking long after the book has ended and the reader is sitting there and now wondering, Would I do anything?  Just like a perfect performance by a concert pianist, I say to Mr
Baron, BRAVO!!!!!!My Rating:  5

$REVIEW.: Reviewer: MarissaSource: PublisherMarissa's review was first posted at Romancing the Book's blog.Training Tristan is a short read (took me about an hour) that had a bit of a moral issue I had to hurdle
Here we have a cop who falls for the victim of an abuse crime, then decides to take said victim home and "keep" him

But the keeping was mutual consent so okay
The area I had a problem with was the "training"
If Jed fell for Tristan the way he was, why does he feel the need to change him?Being a short story, we don't get as in-depth into the characters as a full-length novel would take us


Jed is a closeted gay policeman who dates women to keep his straight cover

He even has sex with them

Even though he falls for Tristan, he's embarrassed by Tristan's girlie ways - his use of toenail polish, lip gloss, and women's underwear, and his swishy walk


While I can understand being embarrassed by someone you love, I have a hard time with the fact that Jed tried to change Tristan rather than try to accept his idiosyncrasies
But then, that is part of the story...Tristan is shy to the point of being withdrawn and it is easy to see why Jed was immediately attracted to him
However, we don't see inside Tristan's mind in this story which almost makes Tristan a secondary character


Other than what he relates to Jed, we don't know what he is feeling or what his thoughts on being taken in by his rescuer are

That's something I would have liked to read - Tristan's point of view.Training Tristan is one of those cute little stories that you can read while on the bus or in between full-length novels


It is well-written (especially considering it's in short-story format) and I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next as I read each page.

$review_text.: I just loved Wingman. Such a cute storyline, there were so many lol moments.Tia meets Reign in a club, she's on the prowl for some lovin' for Mrs. Mufflepuff. She spots Reign sulking at the bar and goes in for the kill. They get along so well and the conversation takes such a turn that Tia tries to hook him up with someone else instead. After that success, Reign is good looking enough but when he wants sex he wants a sure thing, he doesn't want to be bothered with the song and dance of being charming to pick someone up. His ultimate goal is to win back his ex-girlfriend, Slutena...I mean Selena. From there hilarity ensues and feelings develop. What a fun ride!There were two things that irked me a bit where I couldn't give a full five stars:1. I don't think I could ever be with a man if I have seen with my own eyes him having sex with other women. No matter how I felt about him at the time. It would forever be burned in my brain.2. I didn't like how Tia waited patiently for Reign to choose which woman he wanted.But still a very enjoyable story. I highly recommend!

I now will have to buckle up and read these books in the order they were intended. I am amazed at the way this author tells her stories very intriguing very involved at least for me I get all my emotions involved, half way through I always end up reaching for the box of tissues. I fell in love with Alex and Audrey. So special so sweet, and so much love. I never want to give away spoilers because just like with any book we read, everyone's journey is unique, do yourselves a big big favor and get this series. It will leave you speechless, awestruck, heart broken and strangely uplifted. A well rounded read for sure. Every time I read one of The Color of Heaven series I come away with a little more hope in my heart and soul. Bravo to the author. Well done. Highly recommended.

I had written one book and briefly considered "vanity" press in order to avoid the hassles of setting up a publishing company, obtaining ISBNs, etc


But I read this book and the author covers all of the steps necessary to set up your company, legal requirements, promotion, fulfillment, etc
He explains everything in a step by step fashion including a timeline that tells you when to complete each step
In short, he made it very easy for me to set up my company and get my book into print

$REVIEW.: *growls in frustration*Why did it have to be a cliffhanger? Why, why, why? *sigh* Ignore my whine, lol.All in all, Yes is a wonderfully written suspense romance. Liza is damaged&#8211;physically, mentally, and emotionally&#8211;by a past she&#8217;s tried so hard to forget. She&#8217;s not trying to move on; she&#8217;s simply existing in a world she built that is familiar and safe. But safe doesn&#8217;t keep the nightmares at bay, nor does it bring the closure she needs. Even after becoming involved with Reid, there was a huge wall blocking her from experiencing true happiness with him and it wouldn&#8217;t come until she reconciled her past completely.Reid is an enigma. He&#8217;s patient but not, caring but jealous, all before he actually solidifies his place in Liza&#8217;s life. He pursues Liza relentlessly, never giving up even when she attempts to stonewall his efforts to get to know her. For that, I give him a loud round of applause. See, she wasn&#8217;t a challenge to him. She was everything to him, and he knew it after just a short period of time.Ms. Jellum built a world so dark, so filled with secrets, it was impossible to guess what was coming. The identity of Liza&#8217;s stalker was unexpected, as was the agonizing pain Liza, Reid, and Liza&#8217;s best friend Eli endured toward the end. What was even more surprising was a secret Reid hadn&#8217;t revealed to Liza. Now that he has, I wonder what&#8217;s to come for this couple. They survived one near death experience just to be thrust into another.It seems that, aside from books, Reid and Liza have one other blaring thing in common: they both come from psychotic families.So what is going to happen next? I don&#8217;t know, but I can&#8217;t wait to find out in Book 2: If I Say No.***Received from Tasty Book Tours for an honest review***

$review_text.: This is a terrific read, not the least for the pleasure of its intricate and solidly constructed plot. The author has done a masterful job of weaving together two separate mysteries, the possible assassination years earlier of Pope John Paul the First and the shooting death of a writer (the police think a mugging gone awry) said to be writing a book which will prove that past murder. Detective Marco Fontana is asked by the dead writer's partner to investigate the shooting and in no time he finds himself ensnared in a web of deceit and violence that threatens to add him to the bodies accumulating.There's plenty of fast paced action, the tempo picking up nicely as the pages turn, plus a generous sprinkling of humor to lighten things up just when the tension becomes horrific. The author has a gift for the pithy phrase and while some of the secondary characters remain insubstantial, the principles are all deftly brought to life. The protagonist, Marco Fontana, is particularly engaging.The author has as well an especially keen eye for his settings. If you've ever been to Philadelphia, you'll recognize it in an instant. If you haven't, you'll feel as if you've been there, smack dab on the cobblestone streets, by the time you finish reading.Oh, there's a secondary thread running through the story: our detective also manages a line of male strippers. Yes, this business does sometimes get in the way, but not so as a lot of folks are going to mind.The burning truth of the novel, though, is the inseparability of past and present, and the inevitability of your sins catching up with you. Time erases neither our mistakes nor our misdeeds. We may think we have put them aside, have left them safely behind, but they are always just outside the door of present consciousness, the sleeping demons, and who can ever know when they will awaken once again to bring us grief? For evil, there must ultimately be atonement. Our lapsed Catholic detective Marco Fontana retains far more of his childhood's faith than he cares to realize, and he's a far better character for it.All in all, this is a stellar effort that will leave readers eagerly awaiting the next book in what should prove to be a popular series.

$REVIEW.: Yes, I read both books and sort of enjoyed them. So, I give it three stars.But.....While there are some very interesting and inventive features in the story, there are also some grave faults. The spelling and grammar is as good as some published paper books I've read although they do need some work. The ending is weak and looks like the author just gave up to get on to something else.Perhaps, the most disturbing thing is the intrusion of modern items and figures of speech into what is supposed to be a medieval setting. Refrigerators, freezers, postcards, battery, trenchcoats, chill (as in &#34;chill out&#34;), and a host of other items and sayings tend to be shockingly out of place. None of which contribute to the plot.If you can overlook these shortcomings, then you should be able to enjoy the two books in this series.

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately my socks are still on...like with super glue and clamps.  I wanted to like this book.  The sample was promising.  However the heroine was just so stubborn and contrary for no reason.  I just couldn&#8217;t find it in myself to like her.  Additionally, the hero apologizes constantly for no reason and comes off a little needy.  Not sexy.  The sex scenes are the same throughout the book.  My morning shower was steamier than their so-called love scenes.  I read these books out of order &#8211; hoping that the second book (that is actually the first chronologically) would be better because the author would have that much more experience.  Wrong.  Disappointing.  Had a hard time finishing it. Where can I find a hot paranormal author who can actually write!?

$REVIEW.: Aleshia Brevard was born Alfred Brevard Crenshaw in 1937. Christine Jorgensen's sex change (as it was generally called then) in 1952 was headline news throughout much of the world. Alfred Brevard Crenshaw had his own gender reassignment surgery in 1962, after stints as a kept boy for a Catholic priest and a female impersonator at the famed Finnochio's in San Francisco. What followed was a life of some surprising successes--as a Playboy bunny, a Vegas chorine, and a sometimes actress in movies, television and on stage.The book is slight, in every sense of the word. There isn't much depth here. It's mostly of the, "and then I did..." and "then I went..." variety. Aleshia comes across too often as somewhat self absorbed and at times downright silly, like a caricature of an Auntie Mame type, herself a caricature. On the other hand, she also shows herself repeatedly to be generous and kind, to her peers, her students, even her enemies. And more than once she displays an admirable resilience, even courage, in standing up to adversity. Which is to say, she has her faults, like all of us, but plenty of redeeming qualities. By the time I had finished this book, I felt that I knew her pretty well, and liked her.The chief interest here, however, is not in reading about the ups and downs of Aleshia's volatile career or her several marriages, but  in watching a self-admitted sissy survive a hazardous childhood and an adulthood punctuated, not surprisingly, with a great deal of bias. This is especially refreshing in the current epidemic of childhood suicides as the result of bullying. Alfred, and later Aleshia, suffers no end of bullying--not only from schoolmates but domestic partners, even from an emotionally hobbled father--but she finds her own kind of triumph and eventually comes to terms with the woman she is. And though she fusses a great deal about aging, if the picture on the back cover is to be believed, the beautiful young starlet turned out to be a handsome septuagenarean.In short, this is a sort of print version of the "It Gets Better" videos currently going viral. This publisher bills itself as "books by women, for women," but if I could have my wish, I would personally hand a copy of this to every young person suffering today at the hands of bullies, so they could read this story of how one individual's life did indeed get better. In the best of all worlds, every one of those unhappy youngsters would benefit from reading Aleshia's story.That won't happen, of course. It seems our society would rather protect them from the positive encouragement they would find here than from the negative discouragement that leads to those suicides we keep reading about with dismaying frequency.Still, I give this woman a hearty high five and a tip of the cap. She deserves it just for getting through. Lots of others didn't.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book I have read by Lilly Maytree and look forward to reading more.In wanting to find the divine appointment that God has for her, Meg sets out on an adventure that was more that she could have imagined. Her venture was based on the exploits of Mary Kingsley an explorer from the 1800's. I like how each chapter begins with a quote by Mary Kingsley. The details to the characters, plot, scenery, and culture of West Africa draw you into the story and I could picture everything. It is action packed and love how the romance evolves. Well written. Really enjoyed this book.Also liked the historical information Lilly gives us about Mary Kingsley.I received this book from bookfun.org for my honest opinion and review.Review by Donna Mcginnis

$review_text.: OK, I admit that the cad-reformed-by-a-good-woman plotline is a guilty pleasure of mine, even though I know that in real life, as Dr. Phil says, the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour.  However, in fiction, my rule is that the worse the cad behaves to begin with, the more satisfyingly he has to grovel at the end, or do something noble that really proves he's changed, or better yet, both.  The "hero" of this romance never really does either.  Yes, at one point he secretly semi-rescues her, but it's by spending money (which he has plenty of), rather than making an effort of some kind.  Instead, he keeps acting like a jerk towards the heroine to push her away because he feels she's too good for him.  I was thoroughly tired of this tactic by the two-thirds mark at the latest.  Plus, the heroine kept rescuing *him* almost till the last chapter while he wallowed in self-pity.  Not my idea of a hero!  Also, it seemed as if the good old sexual double standard was not only alive and well in this book, but had never been seriously questioned since the 1950s!***Spoiler below***I understand that the fictional Whitman University is supposed to be a college for children of rich parents, not something I'm terribly interested in to begin with, but my interest really faded when I read that the hero had a measly TEN MILLION DOLLARS left over from his tennis-playing days to start his own business with.  Poor baby...  All in all, a good start, but all downhill from there.  I returned this one to Amazon even though I only paid 99 cents for it.

$review_text.: As a victim of quality metrics, balanced scorecard, and other 'help' at companies over the past 20 years, I second that the unintended consequences are horrific and even exacerbate a tailspin into plant closing. While she talks mostly about huge companies, it's worse than she thinks; this stuff trickles down, is all its ill-fitting and inappropriate glory, to companies of under 200 employees.She points out one aspect that never dawned on me, a real head-slapper: the annual manpower devoted to documenting, collecting, analyzing, publishing, and beating up perfectly good employees over metrics that add absolutely nothing to the product line or customer satisfaction. Then the strategy meetings to improve the metrics that cause a faster decline in all the unmeasured aspects of business. At one company the balanced scorecard became 50% of someone's job. Someone who had a full job before that, tasks that were shrunk into the available time.There's no evidence anything is improved by all the contemplating of the navel. In hindsight I know what would have saved a company that implemented all these consultant tools in a big way and died. It had a great product line but didn't pursue all the niche opportunities, the other uses for it, which would have required buying new manufacturing machines and partnering with businesses making gadgets to mesh with our product. When the bottom fell out of the main use, there was no diversification. We could focus on quality, efficiency and all that crap but it is pointless if no one is willing to tool up for a 50% increase in business.Management by numbers is not a substitute for bravery. She said the most vital insight early in the book, numbers are predicated on a steady sloping upward growth curve. Eureka! But nobody gets that enchanted gift.  It is the least likely of any future curve. Maybe 3 years in a row tops for that curve. Companies that look like they have it, don't, because they achieve it by acquisition. Buying other companies. That curve does not exist for a product line. So improving quality at the cost of 10 cents each can destroy market share! I'm not against improving quality, I make a living doing that, I'm against improving at any cost, quality improvements beyond what the market needs that exceed 2-year savings.Watching metrics instead of looking at the market and customers and new developments in the field is like believing keeping one's navel clean is the way to attract girls, because the opposite can be repulsive. However, if girls aren't attracted by something else, the clean navel will not matter, there will be no getting to second base with anyone. And if you have enough interesting stuff going for you, guess what, the girls will overlook the dirty navel.This book should be mandatory reading for every MBA.

The book is set up alphabetically by genus, but the wonderful photographs are just as valuable indentification.  The book is filled with good growing and collecting tips.  It is set up more like a field guide than a gardening book, something I find quite useful.  The photographs are of good quality and when ever possible, show the plant in bloom.

Tommy and Holly are two very amazing characters.Tommy is the perfect description of this book&#8217;s title and I found myself wishing men like him existed in real life.  Holly is the epitome of strength and resiliency.  Sloan Johnson has an incredible talent for putting the reader inside the characters&#8217; heads.  This couple&#8217;s story was incredible, and I can&#8217;t remember the last time I was rooting so hard for fictional characters.  I was completely hooked.  I was so hooked in fact, that when I got to the cliffhanger at the end, I almost threw my kindle across the room.  Well, maybe I wasn&#8217;t quite that mad, but I did let out a string of curses.Ultimately, the cliffhanger is what brought my rating down.  I&#8217;m not saying I didn&#8217;t like the ending that is leading into the next story, I just felt disappointed about some of the stuff that was left unresolved.  My rating of four stars is due to the fact that as pissed as I was about the cliffhanger, the rest of the book was phenomenal.Read more reviews @ rawbooksonline.com

$REVIEW.: 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed reading this book and cant wait until the next one comes out.  Now, I must say the writing style threw me off a little bit.  It felt like the main character (or writer) was British or foreign. When you read books written by folks in other countries, their writing style is typically a little different and this one felt different to me.  It actually threw me a little at first and made it a little harder (not much) to get into the book. Not because of the story line but most likely because I was trying to figure out how a girl (main character) from America thinks / talks like this.I saw some low ratings simply because of the subject matter and I dont agree that should take away from the ratings if the story is good, the book well written, etc.  If people were going to be offended, they should not have read the book!  I dont necessarily agree with a 17 and 30 year old but hey, its a book!Anyway, this book took its time in allowing us to see exactly what the two main characters saw in each other! I love that...I think that element is missing from so many books these days.

$REVIEW.: This is another spectacular erotic romance by Selene Grace Silver. The setting is very unique--you don't find many erotic romances set in the late 70s. The author's choice of setting is brilliant and the perfect backdrop for this story. It's a classic case of opposites attract. Brianna never expects to find herself attracted to a cop with traditional values. And, Jack is already in a relationship with someone he thinks suits his needs. But, when these two characters collide (literally), magic sparks between them. I love the light paranormal elements in this story, but for those of you who aren't fans of paranormal, I would urge you to give this book a try regardless. The magical aspects are important to the story, but do not overwhelm the plot. The sexual relationship between Brianna and Jack takes front and center. And, it isn't just sex--though this book is full of mind-blowingly steamy scenes. There's romance too. These characters are made for each other, though they both try to deny it. You want to know the best part about this book? There are more stories to come!

$review_text.: *What Ashley Thought*The book centers around a couple named Damon and Lily. They head back to Damon's hometown to solve some murders that happened. Damon has to deal with hostility from the community because he has been announced as there new alpha though he has been gone for years. The other significant characters in this include Damon's best friend Hunter, local shaman Wilton, and of course the bad guy/girl, I let you decide who they are.When the boom started I felt like I was dumped into the middle of a book no start just bam here's the story. The book started and stayed slow, I hoped that once the action started the book would move but it never did it just stayed slow. Also there was a lot of back story included within the story which was slightly confusing. The story itself was very good but despite how slow the book moved it felt like it was missing components that could have made it all the better.Good story but missing the key components to take it over the edge.

It felt as though I was right there with them

I felt the  pain these two characters were going through
I felt for Richard also

The whole time I was praying that these two got their HEA

I read a lot of books

$REVIEW.: When the highly contagious virus hit the shores of Australia, working its way through the country with a speed that stunned, the people who didn&#8217;t die immediately sought refuge wherever they could. They were called the survivors; Rohan and Shannon were two such people. The brothers had lost their parents to the disease, and were fortunate to have a cabin deep in the woods which their father had built for such an emergency.Day and night they kept watch &#8211; they couldn&#8217;t trust a soul, knew that if anyone came close they could possibly be infected &#8211; and that would mean the end. They were vigilant, their shotgun and rifle always close at hand. While Rohan slept Shannon kept watch, quietly strumming his guitar in the stillness of the night. Shannon slept late while Rohan was keeping watch. They had it under control, had been doing it that way for months.So when suddenly their privacy and solitude was violated it created tension between the brothers; whose fault was it, who wasn&#8217;t keeping watch properly? After they discovered the young woman had been watching them for some time, was starving and alone, they reluctantly allowed her to join them. But things changed &#8211; trust wasn&#8217;t something to be shared under the circumstances. The brothers became tense and angry with each other &#8211; but they were drawn to Denny in a way that surprised them both. With the survival of the three living in the cabin paramount, what would happen next? Rohan&#8217;s priority was to keep Shannon alive &#8211; wasn&#8217;t it?What a brilliant psychological thriller! I could not put this down! I have read a couple of Aussie author Honey Brown&#8217;s novels now, and realizing this one is her debut meant I needed to read it. And I am so glad I did! Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Marilyn Monroe died a few months before I was born, but her popularity has lasted all of my life. She was always sensuous and glamorous, and the camera loved her even in her drugged-up final years.  Because there have been hundreds of books and articles written about this complicated, intelligent woman, including theories about her death, I wasn't sure there was anything else that could be added.  I even wondered if this book would be an invasion of Marilyn's privacy, even though she's been dead 50 years.Alma Bond's Marilyn Monroe: On the Couch is a partly factual and party fictional account of her analysis sessions with Marilyn Monroe during the last years of her life.  Taken from the tape recordings she made of the sessions, and also from letters Marilyn wrote to her, she reveals many unknown sides of Marilyn.  Despite being a deeply disturbed woman who couldn't move past the abandonment in her childhood, Marilyn was also funny, quick witted, sensitive, self centered, in awe of her fame, demanding, vain, humble, insecure, promiscuous, and forever looking for love.Marilyn tells her life story in flashbacks, including intimate details about her marriages, her family, her rise to fame, and her dalliances with President Kennedy and his brother.  We all know it ends with her death of a drug overdose, but learning what made Marilyn tick kept me turning the pages until late at night.The only thing that would have made the book better for me, is to know for sure which parts of the story were fiction and which were factual.  I received a complimentary copy of On The Couch in exchange for writing an honest review, and I give this book 4.5 stars.

$review_text.: I fell in love with Cuba Hudson in Very Bad Things and about fell over when Ilsa Madden Mills announced that he was getting the next novel. He is so sexy and arrogant, I loved it! Imagine me doing back flips when I discovered there was also a novella!!!!!!!! More Cuba&#8230; YES PLEASE!!! With Very Wicked Beginnings we get a glimpse into Cuba and Dovey and what shapes them into who they are in Very Wicked Things. Without reading it first, you would lose some of the background story. It&#8217;s a journey and you need to know the beginning before you get to the end. This novella is also something that is near and dear to me as well as it deals with depression and suicide. I also love that 100% of the May proceeds from the prequel will benefit the Keith Milano Memorial Fund for Suicide Prevention. So for those that think this is just a ploy to get more money for the author, STOP! This is for a very good cause and since I personally have been affected by suicide I would tell you that this makes my heart happy that there are people out there like Ilsa that raise money for such a worthy cause.For Dovey Beckham there is just one love, ballet. She lives and breathes ballet. She is on scholarship at Briarcrest Academy and has hopes one day to become a ballerina in a top rated program. She doesn&#8217;t do relationships and has only one close friend Spider. Unlike the other students at BA, everything she has she has fought for. Nothing is given to her on a silver platter. She is her own unique self and she doesn&#8217;t conform to the norm.&#8220;Love didn&#8217;t matter. Only ballet.&#8221;Now what can I say about Cuba Hudson&#8230;. Lord have mercy! He is that alpha male athlete with the body and attitude to go with it. He knows he is God&#8217;s gift to women and take full advantage of it. While at football practice one day, something catches his eyes&#8230; a beautiful dancer. He is mesmerized by her. He cannot take his eyes off her, until an offensive lineman lays him out flat! He knows he has never seen her before and is curious to who this mystery girl is. Imagine his surprise when he heads to class and sees her.&#8220;My world&#8230; my f***ing life... altered when her eyes connected with mine for what seemed like a long time but it only had to be a few seconds.&#8221;If you have to pick up the novella to see how their story all starts! And again, in May 100% of the proceeds go to an amazing charity! 5 huge stars!

$review_text.: Overall this is a fairly standard &#34;feel good&#34; m/m romance novel.  If you can get through the first 30 pages or so where it is like walking in late and the movie has started, then it is a very enjoyable read.  Sam is a very likable character from the start.  Quirky and funny, he is a romance novel reader and looks at his life through that filter.  There are some very good laughs from his doing that.  As I'm sure the author planned, Ian is not very likable in the beginning but as he grows, you of course begin pulling for him.  Watching his &#34;education&#34; in all things gay is also humorous.  This is a fun read which is what I was looking for and would recommend it.

$review_text.: Grace, discovery and promise radiate from the pages of this most recent novel in the Freedom series. In "The Deliverer" former slave Mara Jimenez struggles to recover from the horrible abuse she suffered for more than a decade. Will her past forever taint her present life? Will she learn to trust, to find love, but even better, will she find faith?Former child sex slave Lawan flies alongside the missionary Joan to her new life in America. How will she react when she meets the Johnson family and her biological sister, Anna Mali? Will the girls accept each other? Will Lawan adjust to her new surroundings?Jonathan and his sister Leah continue their education at Bible College. Will Jonathan discover God's plan for his life? Will he figure out which girl God wants him to marry? Will Leah's friend, Sarah, succeed in her bumbling efforts to engineer her heart's desire?The villain, Mara's uncle Jefe, attempts to hold onto his position as boss of the jail yard. Will he succeed or fail? Mara's parents in Mexico, Rudolfo and his battered wife Cecelia, struggle in desperate circumstances. Will Cecelia survive to see her daughter again?Throughout, "The Deliverer" Jesus Christ, although unseen, walks alongside the Flannery and Johnson families. Will they and their friends discern God's will for their lives? Will they live faithfully in their efforts to follow Christ?Set in San Diego, Mexico and Thailand, this book pulls together the threads of the previous two novels, "Deliver Me from Evil, Freedom Series book #1", and "Special Delivery, Freedom Series book # 2, and like those two books, it compels us with the plight of slavery victims. Unlike those two books that drive us to the end wondering what will happen, in this book, we see how slaves can recover to live a free and normal life. Filled with God's mercy and grace, this book oozes hope. I heartily recommend it as the perfect wrap-up to the series.

$review_text.: Osama Tezuka is a legend, often called "Japan's greatest cartoonist."  He is worthy of this praise.  His detailed black and white drawings are moving, vivid and cinematic.  In this wonderful volume, he tells the tale of young Siddharta, a prince born into wealth and leisure, who struggles to determine the meaning of his existence.  Despite the philosophical depth of the book, Tezuka is able to keep the action moving.  His art is so engaging that it appears to move on the page.The secret to Osama Tezuka's power is his story-telling ability.  His tales are like the Arabian Nights fables, stories within stories within stories.  He astounds readers by his raw story-telling finesse.  Throughout all of his work, he advances themes of environmentalism, the dangers of modern society, redemption, and the simplicity of Buddhism.  What is remarkable is he is able to do this while entertaining; as readers, we become spellbound by his picture-perfect drawings and fantastical settings.  Even though this second volume of Buddha is largely expository in nature as he lays the foundation for future volumes, it is more engaging than most graphic novels.  Even if you are not a fan of Japanese manga, try this one; Tezuka may win you over.

$REVIEW.: I am a great fan of medieval mystery books and I always read them in order.  As the series continue, most of them become a bit repetitious.  They spend too much time rehashing who is who and/or descriptions of where they are, how they met, etc.  I have learned to skim through those bits.  Not with this series!  Each book can stand on its own, but does do enough background so the continuity is maintained.  These characters are interesing people and there is always some new aspect of their personality to be discovered (like in real relationships!). The story lines are fresh, too.  I am on the ninth book and don't want the series to end.

$review_text.: Extremely well-written and delightfully witty, Loving Liz is the book you give to someone who says good lesfic just cannot be done. This is the kind of novel that puts 80% of others in its genre to shame! If you love music, or Broadway to be more specific, you'll be even more thrilled.Sexy and sensible, Bobbi Marolt's fiction works best because it knows all good romance fiction is based largely on timing and a couple knowing that waiting for the big event (or that special first night) is not only alluring, but practical and good for the heart. What it sometimes lacks in believable plot (some events are just too conveniently coincidental), the story more than makes up for in style and sass.A reviewer on Good Reads called Loving Liz "adorable" and it so is! It stays in your heart for a good while after the last page is turned. I cannot recommend this enough!! :)

$REVIEW.: Is karma real?  Do we reap what we sow?  Do we get what we deserve?Often, it doesn't seem like it.  Marcy is a single mother whose only sin was working to support her husband through professional school and bear his child only to then be turned out to fend for herself, when he capitalizes on the education she paid for and then finds himself a younger, shapelier, better-connected trophy wife.Marcy and their daughter have been thrown to the wolves, when she sees an opportunity literally fall at her feet to help herself to a little good luck at someone else's expense.  It's a fateful fork in the road that will reflect her inner strength or her human weakness and possibly change the remainder of her life, as karma watches her decision and then seizes her destiny and that of her little seven-year-old daughter Katie, for good or ill.Marcy is barely holding their lives together, earning just enough as a bartender in a Las Vegas casino to afford to share a small apartment with two other casino employees in similar straits, when a series of circumstances conspire to make her hard life ever harder.  One of her roommates moves out.  Her crappy little car dies.  Katie breaks her arm.  Marcy's reduced to working extra shifts at the casino job she hates just to make ends meet instead of spending that precious time with her little girl.It's not fate, but her own actions which bring her to the attention of Andr&eacute; Chevalier, a character who has appeared in several other of Nikki's stories. If you have met Andr&eacute; before, you will know that he is charming, completely irresistible, and completely dominating.Again, Marcy has to choose.  The comfortably familiar life where she has complete control and where she has long since decided to swear off men forever, or an anxious new path with obstacles, opportunities, and perils of its own?  She works at a casino, but does she have the right to gamble with her life and that of her little daughter based on nothing more than a tiny choice she has made?Marcy's life is about to be filled with liquor, big money, fast cars, hidden cameras, revenge, sexual deviance, domination, submission, voyeurism, pool boys, cowboys, big boys, betrayal, and challenges to her most deeply-held beliefs.  This is a story which from the first moments arches Marcy's life into the unknown and unfamiliar, and eventually completes the circle of fate, like the mythical snake eating its tail.I just love Nikki Sex's stories; her characters seem completely real to me, which sets these stories apart from anything else in this genre that I've encountered.  This is (I think) her longest book to date, and (I know!) her best so far!  It's a great story, and not coincidentally, really hot, kinda kinky, and hard to put down.  Nikki has built a karmic machine here, and it's great fun to watch the cosmic gears move and mesh based on Marcy's revealing initial choice.Highly recommended!

$review_text.: This is one of the rare works which seem to explain new realities in a way which no one else before has grasped. It is the kind of work that gives a ' whole new picture of what is happening'. And if for this alone this work would be of great value.I am by no means a media expert and cannot really comment on many of the claims of the work .Its virtues are in calling attention to the new media( mainly television) and understanding how it changed our perception of the world, and of ourselves.The basic MacLuhan distinction between hot and cold media between those which give us a lot of information and those which require our own greater participation in creating the reality , seems to me sensible to a degree. But where MacLuhan lost me was in his celebration of the present reality, the new culture.I for one have the old- fashioned sense of the superiority of the reading world to the television world- the superiority of the kind of minds it produces.I too think MacLuhan was over- optimistic in seeing the ' global village' as a kind of positive development for mankind. The fact is our world today is tremendously complex politically, fragmented in not necessarily wonderful ways.It is possible to argue that this work ' foresaw ' the Internet, but even if this were the case it seems to me that we still have to consider the overall question of the meaning, value and virtue of the Internet.Mankind's situation I want to suggest is much much more complex than ' the media is the message' in the ' global village' suggests.I do not again think I have even begun to do justice to the richness and variety of MacLuhan's insights.I just here would like to register the view that I do not believe that he really has given us ' the key' to understanding our world. I would even go farther and say however rich the understanding he provides about the media, and their relation to each other- he too is far from the last word in this. The questions now raised by the Internet world I think are in many ways outside those he considered.Like all important thinkers he too is limited by the Time which has come after, bringing developments and problems he could not be expected to foresee.

If you've not yet read THY KINGDOM FALL, you can enter STARS AND SCORPIONS and still understand it; but I.would suggest reading in order if at all possible.This series, which could be categorized as DYSTOPIAN in all capitals,  always puts me in.mind of the Dystopian &#34;In the Year 2525&#34; (Zager & Evans, 1969) and of Dante 's proscription,  &#34; Abandon hope,  all ye who enter here.&#34;  Deliver us from the type of society presented in this series.I reviewed an ARC provided to me by the author, for the sole purpose of my honest review.

$REVIEW.: Castle of Sand by Bella Forest4.5 out of 5CharactersDerek makes some tough choices.  All to keep Sofia alive, and with him.Gregor is a mean SOB, and truly deserves to be punished.  What he did to his family, to the humans of the shade and what he did to Sofia makes him a real ass.Sofia still seems so hesitant at the beginning of the book with who she is, what she is capable of.  But, then the lightbulb goes on and she becomes a powerful force to be reckoned with in the Shade.Everything ElseSo we start that the end... Or rather we start this book out with a glimpse of the future that makes us ask, "What the heck is going on?" and "Who will survive?"  Actually, that is a pretty common question that I keep asking :P.I keep trying to figure out how Vivienne's memories play a role in everything that happens.  Is it setting up the pieces or is it the prophecy itself?I loved how Derek proved to Sofia that she was different, that she is special.  Every girl should be made to feel like that by the man she loves.I think when the light bulb went on for Derek about what he would do for her, it was awesome.  But when Sofia realized what she is capable of with Derek, it because a pushing point for the novel, and was incredible.Derek's proposals are both so sweet, but I liked the second one.  It wasn't planned, it wasn't fancy, it was just pure love pouring out for Sofia.OverallA culling, a revolt, an invasion, a war, and the questions on fulfilled prophesy... there is a lot of stuff crammed in this book.  And I love that!Overall, I think this is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend this book!

$review_text.: Blind Hope By Kim Meeder and Laurie Sacher at first glance seems to be a story about a rescued dog.  When you read the title again in it's entirety you see "Blind Hope--An Unwanted Dog & the Woman She Rescued."  This story is less about dog rescue and more about learning to follow a master that we cannot see.  It is the telling of how a woman's life and relationship with God was changed forever by the blind dog that she helped.All in all, I enjoyed the story.  The accounts relived in this book brought tears to my eyes.  I can definitely say that I would recommend it for the people in my life who love animals and are willing to take in the fact that sometimes the best lessons do not come from other people, but from one of the humblest creatures--a dog.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishers in exchange for this review.

When you get to three it says, &#34;It's okay.&#34; I agree with that assessment

This book was &#34;okay.&#34; Nothing really special


An interesting couple of evening's read
One thing that got my back teeth to aching was Blackie doesn't seem to know how to spell &#34;current&#34; which can mean either &#34;now&#34; or a path or flow of electricity or water
Both meanings were in the book but he spells them &#34;currant&#34; which is a small, seedless raisin

$REVIEW.: Comments from my ten-year-old daughter: I liked the book and give it 5 stars.Comments from Mom:  My Friend Suhana is a colorful picture book that shares a young child's experience of assisting in a special needs class once a week.  It is in this class that the child meets her new friend, Suhana, who has cerebral palsy.I adore the illustrations. The message is one of friendship, love, patience, celebrating differences, and working to understand someone who is unable to communicate in ways that most children simply expect. Picture books that help young children learn why others act in ways that may initially scare them or make them nervous - for whatever reason, make me happy. The unknown may be scary for young children.This colorfully illustrated book is authored by a mother-daughter writing team, and is written in the first-person. It retains the young writer's personality, which gives the book a lovely and innocent voice.We received an electronic copy of  &#34;My Friend Suhana&#34; from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. We received no monetary or in-kind compensation for our honest review.

 While on an assigned mission, her teammate tries to kill her

 She is forced to defend herself and kills Matt instead

 Before she kills him, Matt tells her that she is the bait for the mission and he was to wound her to setup the people on Dreagan.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the real goal was

 Matt&#8217;s mission was to leave me behind so I would be killed by you
 I was told we were to do reconnaissance on everyone at Dreagan after we found whatever was in that cave.&#8221;Kellan had watched and listened as Denea had fought for her life

 He had been impressed by her skills and called for help to heal her wounds
 He had taken her back to the Manor where they would question her to find out why she was on there


Denae explains her mission and what the outcome was suppose.&#8220;As I already told you, while in the water, Matt tried to kill me

 I wasn&#8217;t ready to die or be used as bait, and I was angry at being betrayed
 Only one of us was going to come out of the attack alive


 I made sure it was me.&#8221;Kellan had been asleep for thirteen hundred years and he still held the hatred of humans strongly in his heart


 He is asked to keep an eye on Denea and learn everything she knows about M15

 He unwillingly agrees to get close to her and learn all that he can

 Little does Kellan know that an unholy alliance has been formed between the dark fae and an unknown adversary against the Dragon Kings

The dark fae want Kellan.Taraeth&#8217;s smile was cold and calculating

 &#8220;You&#8217;ll let me have a Dragon King?&#8221;&#8220;Take as many as you can capture, and use them as you see fit.&#8221;Taraeth considered the new plan for several minutes before he folded his arms over his chest

&#8220;There is just one I want.&#8221;He nodded, &#8220;Ah, yes
 Kellan


 Why him?&#8221;The manor is about to come under attack and Denae must be moved before M15 arrives


 So a new identity must be secured and Denae moved.&#8220;How close are we to getting the new ID for Denae?&#8221; Kellan asked Rhys


 Rhys checked his phone
 &#8220;In a matter of hours.&#8221;&#8220;It needs to be faster,&#8221; Henry said

 &#8220;you need to make sure there&#8217;s no trace of her when M15 comes looking.&#8221;Kellan is fighting his fascination with Denae and Denae wants Kellan.Rhi&#8217;s smile widened when she noticed how the mortal&#8217;s eyes softened when she looked at Kellan.Hero &#8211;Kellan &#8220;Bronze Dragon Lord&#34;:  4 starsHeroine &#8211;Denae Lacroix: 4 starsSteam: 3 starsPlot: 5 starsCliffhanger: YesWould I recommend this book: Yes!

$review_text.: My first thought after flipping through this guidebook was that apparently not even Lonely Planet can find information on making a trip to England more affordable

It's an expensive place, I get that, but at the same time I felt like too much of this guidebook focused on fancy hotels and restaurants (as in, diamond-studded and Michelin-starred) rather than giving suggestions for places to stay and eat that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg.Just to get the 'cons' out of the way, another issue with this particular guidebook is the index
Basically, they were a bit stingy in picking and choosing what subjects/places/etc


would both be in the guidebook and listed in the index as well


On top of that, as some other reviewers have mentioned, there's a severe lack of pictures


I've used LP guidebooks before and have noted this about several of them, though, so it's something I've come to expect from their guidebooks...just figured I'd be another reviewer to note the lack of pictures in case someone considering this guidebook feels that a lot of pictures is necessary.On the other hand, they did cram a lot of information about traveling to England in this book, and most of it is detailed enough and fairly reliable that if you didn't want to have to buy (or lug around) several guidebooks for a trip to England, this one would do the trick
Hence my rating of "it's okay" - I think this guidebook would work just fine for some people, even if it's not particularly what *I* would want out of a guidebook.

$REVIEW.: Fairchild finds and creates beauty in surprising places: factories, backyards, and small towns, as well as people and objects. Many of his poems are able depict events without becoming overly sentimental, as in "The Machinist, Teaching His Daughter to Play the Piano," with a comparison between the playing the piano and operating machinery, " the gestures of voice and hands/ suspended over the keyboard/ that moves like the lathe in its turning." Experience, particularly work experience, is an important part of the poems in this collection. Some of the other poems in this book that I enjoy include "The Himalayas," and "Airlifting Horses."

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately, since the beginning of gender relations, men have been encouraged to control, and society often accepts and rewards their control, having placed women on the back burner for most of their natural born lives. For women to find a man who isn't controlling is much like finding a four leaf clover. Resisting it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, and sooner or later, most women realize that it's futile to try and change it, and simply find ways to ignore it, much the way men find ways to ignore the nagging of females. If women were to design their ideal man, it's unlikely that he would look like the ones that are most common, and oddly enough, some of the best ones never had dads to teach how to be men, but figured it out on their own, offering the women they attach themselves to a little more freedom than might occur otherwise. While it doesn't cure the problems of society, it often makes life more bearable personally. If men were ever to figure out exactly how easily women can make their lives more content and more productive, they might have an incentive to devote significant time to examining how they might make one a part of their lives. Until then, they usually get closer to their dogs, than to their women. If men know the meaning of intimacy, most don't know how to accomplish it, and few bother to try, leaving most women singularly alone trying to figure out how to make their lives more meaningful without it. Since most don't play sports equivalent with the guys, they will never succeed in that manner and often must be content with the sporadic, and unforseen sprinkles of intimacy they do receive from year to year. Over a lifetime, it has the tendency to build into at least a semblance of real value, and therefore, most think it's worth the ride....if one lives long enough to have the benefit of hindsight. Few women today make it that far, and it's not surprising. After all, who wants to be subservient to a commander all of the time? Even soldiers get R &amp; R on occasion. If men continue to insist upon being commanders, the world should encourage them, and teach them to be better ones.

Polished and fast-paced, it tells the story of two lonely people who after an enforced ten-year separation just may get a second chance at love. Unfortunately, Michael has been cursed for past grievances, and his appearance now when Abby so desperately needs his magic is at odds with Abby's fanciful dreams.  Physical appearance aside, Michael and Abby share a connection both baffling and comfortable.Michael, in a melodramatic and satisfying manner, thwarts the dastardly villains' plan to ruin the heroine - earning him hero status in her eyes - in spite of  his small stature and ludicrous attire.  Using his talents and his considerable persuasive skills, Michael demonstrates that he is indeed a reformed leprechaun willing to do whatever is required for the chance to stay with his beloved Abby forever.  This lovely fairy tale with a modern spin is sure to leave you smiling, too.This book was provided by the author in exchange for my honest review.Reviewed by Laurie-J

$REVIEW.: Grace Warren lives a mellow life
Some would even call it boring; mundane, if you will

She's a physical therapist--one of the very best in her field, but aside from that, her life mostly consists of taking care of her paraplegic brother.Grace's life changes when she's convinced to attend a charity event to help out a friend


At this event, Grace is kissed by a complete stranger
A handsome, suave, great-kissing stranger--but a stranger all the same
Grace doesn't even care to get more than his first name as she storms out


She just tries to forget about him and move on.Moving on turns out to be a pretty impossible feat when, not more than days later, Seth ends up in her physical therapy office due to a skiing accident.And doesn't remember her.Grace is beyond frustrated

He's gorgeous, sarcastic, and stubborn

Everything he says is suggestive

Everything he does makes her want to screech


And yet..

Grace finds herself attracted to him.Thus, their whirlwind of a relationship begins.- - -This was my first read by Rachael Renee Anderson, and I was insanely impressed! I had my doubts because I normally don't read clean romance, and when I saw that this was LDS Fiction, I went into it with even more reservation

Imagine my surprise when I ended up falling in love with this story and the characters inside it! I guess I was expecting it to be something it wasn't--I don't know what, exactly


Maybe lack of flair, spark, or excitement? No matter

I was put in my place! Working It Outwas fantastic!!!The first thing that really stuck out with me was the romance, of course
I usually like my books down and dirty, which this book is very far from


And yet, it's now one of my most favorite romance stories
Anderson gave me intensity, she gave me sexy, she gave me electricity
Working It Out is a clean, fun romance, yet passionate and sensual at the same time

There are definitely some intense physical moments between Seth and Grace, but the focal point is their emotional bond; their connection aside from physical attraction

The author balanced it all out quite perfectly.As a side-story, we learn that Grace feels responsible for her brother's paraplegia
When they were in high school, she was the one to convince her brother, Alec, to skip out on class one day and go skiing--a venture that ended in his accident and paralysis


This is originally what makes Grace take an actual liking to Seth
Upon seeing her wheelchair-confined brother, Seth immediately invites him to play wheelchair basketball with he and some friends
This turns into a beacon of hope for Grace; hope that her brother will come back out of his shell

So not only do we have a romance plot, but we have this familial healing as well
I very much enjoyed Alec's character and seeing his journey back to life.Okay, before I go on, let me get to why I didn't give this book 5 stars


Grace
You see, Seth is into extreme sports

Heli-skiing, mountain biking, sky-diving, etc
Grace lives in fear that he will end up like Alec, paralyzed, or worse--dead

This is something she struggles with all throughout the book
She wants him to stop being so reckless, but doesn't want to ask him to change who he is for her
She battles herself constantly


My problem came in here

It began to get whiny and a little too repetitive for me

I may have even rolled my eyes at her a couple times
But it's really a minor detail when laid out next to the good things this story has to offer.All in all, Working It Out is a winner! The characters are beyond lovable and relatable

The plot isn't too heavy, but not too fluffy

This would be a great beach read! It's about family, friendship, and love

It's about moving on and coming to terms

It's about seeing what's important in life and embracing it
It's about acceptance

The romance is clean, yet still passionate and emotional
I was very much moved by this book and I have no doubt it'll be the same for anyone else who reads it


And to top that off, there is a lot of humor and fun mixed into the story as well--so it had me laughing and smiling all over the place
It's an all-around great book
I recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance story

$REVIEW.: A new kind of sheriff is in town.  She's a feisty, shoot-from the hip dairy farmer and she rides a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  In this engaging, entertaining debut novel, set in rural Pennsylvania, the hard-working folks who supply us with the food we mostly take for granted get their due.  Here's a take-no-prisoners woman with real attitude. Stella Crown is her name and she owns a productive dairy farm in Pennsylvania.  It's a fresh-air, marginal kind of life, but she loves it, knows her product is important to the nation, and she's not about to give it up anytime soon.But the vultures are circling in the form of land developers and Stella sees farm after farm among her neighbors being closed down and new homes going up on what was once productive crop lands.  New problems arise and Stella finds her own farm the target of a series of mysterious "accidents."  In the small nearby town strange illness takes the life of a small boy and several others are oddly sick.Author Judy Clemens takes a complicated plot, a raft of engaging characters, and an often overlooked setting to craft a fine entertaining novel.  She nails the setting and most of the characters.  Her protagonist is a fine example of a whole individual, although I thought Stella over-reacted to some situations a bit much at times.  She always seems to be slamming and spinning around.  It's a small cavil.  The pace of this novel, especially in the early going, is just right for its rural setting, and it leaves the author sufficient room to jack things up as we near the climax.There are suprises and emotion a-plenty in this handsomely packaged mystery.  Based on this entry, Judy Clemens is a new author on the block and definitely one to watch.

$review_text.: This is the second book in the Christian Encounters seris from Thomas Nelson Publishing that I've read

 Much like the other title I read in the series, "Saint Patrick," this book about the life of Saint Francis is short, touches on most of the key events in St


Francis' life, and provides an excellent basis for further study of this wonderful saint.The book opens with a seemingly disoriented Francis shouting the good news that he heard about God

 It then goes into the life of the man who longed to be a noble, spoiled for a good fight, and actually belonged to a street gang


 From his wealthy early life and struggles with responsibilities to his complete embracing of poverty and the Lord, this book covers a good amount of ground.I was particularly shocked when I read about St
Francis' early life
 Having known him only as the meek and gentle leader of the Franciscans (which I also learned was not quite a fitting image for him), it amazed me to see how much of a fighter and playboy he really was

 Of course, that fight translated into an even more fierce love for God and defender of the faith.Author Robert West has a lot more to go on in this book than he did with "Saint Patrick," and uses quite a few references throughout this biography


 One thing I did notice was that West tends to downplay the miracles attributed to the saints
 In particular with this book, he only mentions Francis' stigmata near the end of the book, and immediately goes after it with a number of sources that debate the factuality of the miracle.West also goes into decent depths on the lives of people surroungind Francis, in particular, he pays special attention to St

Clare of Assisi.With a bit of irony, West ends the book with praise for Francis from Lynn White, a history professor from the University of California whose work entitled "The Historical Roots Of Our Ecologic Crisis" drew quite a bit of heat from many who saw the lecture as anti-Christian and a poem written by Giosue Carducci, who had a strong hatred for the Catholic Church.Overall, a good brief look at St

Francis' life, but the man himself is a much more interesting study.

$review_text.: I finished this book yesterday, and I was quite amazed, amused, and appalled all in one book.  It was quite the feat.Never before have I read the bizzaro genre, but I will say, I am in the market for a bit more.  This was humor that i felt bad about laughing at, and thrilled to death about reading.  It took me to a completely different level of reading enjoyment.  Some things just are not laughed about in public, but man, when you get to get that guilty laugh in, it is soooo nice!!The book starts out with a startling discovery:  Billy's pride and joy (and no I'm not talking about his kid) is missing.  At first, he is simply too tired to worry about it...until he realized he leaked down his front when the baby cried.  Yes, he is lactating, and for good reason.  His chest is now covered with his wife's breasts.  Looking back into his bedroom, he is laying on the bed still...the day just gets stranger from there.I honestly don't want to say much more about the book, because there are too many jokes that will be ruined if I say anything else.  The humor is dry, the jokes are raunchy and sexist, and some of the situations are just flat out WRONG, but darn it, we all deserve to laugh at the unmentionables when we know it is only in fiction.  I would suggest this to anyone with a dirty mind, or at least anyone who can laugh out loud at fart jokes....
$SUMMARY.: In your face humor!  Get your copy!!

$review_text.: The book I want to tell you about is A Quaker Christmas, pubbed by Barbour. This book contains 4 novellas, each written by a different author. I enjoyed the varieties of stories in this collection. The first one by Lauralee Bliss is set in an inn run by a Quaker family. One of the guests doesn't seem to like being there when he first arrives, then later stays around. Could the innkeeper's daughter have something to do with that?The second story by Ramona K. Cecil is centered around a pregnant widow and her husband's friend who comes to her aid.  But he bears a secret he thinks will drive them apart if she ever finds out. Can they both find and give the forgiveness they each need?I've never heard of pirates and Quakers joining, but Rachael Phillips combines them in a fun story about a man from a pirate family who rescues a Quaker maiden, leading to her falling for his brother before she finally is rescued by the first man from another mistake.The final story ups the tension with a newlywed wife of a Quaker who chooses to lead a pregnant slave to freedom on the Underground Railroad while her husband is out of town.  All of these stories take place during the Christmas season, and I found it interesting to read about the various ways and extent some Quakers joined in Christmas celebrations.
$SUMMARY.: A Fun Christmas Read--four stories in one!

$review_text.: Looking at some of the other reviews, it's obvious that this book polarizes readers, being rated either very highly or very poorly.  I'm not surprised.  The high ratings are to be expected - there's a real shortage  of good quality material for former Christians.  That, too, is  understandable since America frowns so mightily on unbelievers.  That  brings us to the negative reviews, frowning mightily.Personally, I  appreciate Barker very deeply.  I came to the same conclusions via a  slightly different path.  I was also a devout Christian, though never a  preacher.  I was Washed in the Blood of the Lamb at 16, Sanctified and Born  Again.  I had a personal friend in Jesus.  I also had a thirst for  understanding, so I studied the Bible for years and took everything to the  Lord in prayer.  I studied and prayed until one day I realized that I  didn't believe anymore.No tragedy; no rebellion; just realization.It was only after I came to grips with this change in worldview that I  came to understand just how much Christianity warps a person's thinking,  denigrating reason and elevating faith.  It's been a long climb up from the  muck, but it's great to be clean now.  Christians reading that will be as  outraged by the thought as they would be by reading Barker's book.  Former  Christians know precisely what I'm talking about.This is an excellent  book for recovering Christian.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 STARS!!!Nicky's Review&#62;Characters- Loved Loved Loved Ben so freaking much!!! Loved LJ too.&#62;Plot/Storyline- Oh my goodness. PAGE TURNER!!! The mystery of the curse and the way the story pieced together was done brilliantly.&#62;Steam Factor- Very steamy in a YA kind of way, but one can definitely use their imagination with the scenes (wink, wink).&#62;Cover- Beautiful as always. Love the Red Dress, which I'm thinking is the dress LJ wore to the party. The photography and editing is beautiful.&#62;Cliffhanger- Nope. This is their story with a PERFECT and BEAUTIFUL EPILOGUE!! Thank you for that JM Miller!! XO&#62;Overall- I really really really loved this YA Romance. This is the perfect book to conclude Ben and LJ's story. The mystery of the curse keeps you turning page after page just trying to figure out the solution along with the characters. I love how the curse has historical roots and we are on the journey with Ben and LJ to uncover and dig up the puzzle pieces that will possibly put an end to the suffering. The story flowed effortlessly and perfectly and the love story was so great!! I will forever be a Ben fan. He was written so perfectly and I love how amazing he is for LJ. I LOVED this series!!! Thank you JM Miller for weaving this beautiful piece of art and sharing it with me. I am so honored and happy to have been able to escape into the world you created. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! XOXO :)So, let me just say that this is the PERFECT sequel and conclusion to THE LINE THAT BINDS. This book picks up RIGHT where The Line That Binds left off. We get to see LJ and Ben's relationship battle some trying ups and downs. Along this rocky path I fell more and more in love with Ben. He proves himself to be LJ's Knight in Shining Armor and I couldn't be happier with how committed he is to LJ through all of these rough situations she has to deal with.I must say, this book had me connected so much to Ben, like heart and soul connected. My heart felt every emotion he went through while trying to support LJ physically, mentally, and emotionally. My heart broke for him when he was struggling and begging and my heart swelled for him when there were little shimmers of hope that presented themselves to him.  I just wanted to crawl into his arms and lose myself in the beauty and love that is Ben.This book is such a page turner because we are still on the journey of trying to figure out the curse. The way JM Miller weaves the pieces together, tying the past and the present, is executed flawlessly.  I found myself, nose-in-the-book until I couldn't keep my eyes peeled any longer at 1 am. I regretted having to attend to my basic need of sleeping.The Line that Breaks provides the reader with an adventure and a journey of love that we feel a part of.  This book was the PERFECT and I mean PERFECT conclusion to LJ and Ben's story. The Epilogue was just SUPERB!! It was like the pages wrote themselves and flowed into the best Epilogue ever, but I wouldn't take that credit away from JM Miller and her hard work, because I know she put her heart and soul in this book and I felt so lucky to be one of the firsts to experience this wonderful story and beautiful HEA. Thank you so much JM Miller. I will be looking forward to more of your work. Fantastic!! XOXO :)
$SUMMARY.: 4.5 Star-PERFECT CONCLUSION to The Line that Binds!! Fantastic YA Read!! Highly Recommend this series!! XOXO

$review_text.: This book is terrific.  It captured my attention from the very first words and kept it throughout the book.  It is a story of the role of true love in a person's redemption.  The main male character is a person who thinks only of himself.  Success to him was get all you can anyway you are able. If he had to break people or tread on them so be it.  The main female character is an abused disheartened woman who-because of a rare blood disease- lost five babies to death.  Her husband became distraught and began taking his frustrations out on her.  When the two main characters meet it is under less than good circumstances (someone tried to kill him) she wound up saving his life.  His life began to change and people started noticing.  He wanted to be with her for she had changed his whole life. He found new meaning for his life.  Instead of being all about money he began seeing how he could help others having financial issues.  She gradually began to trust and love him as he helped her deal with the abuse she had suffered.  The story is one that shows money can not buy happiness or love.  I look forward to reading other books by this author.

when i do, it is for one super easy vegan chocolate cake recipe (but i have since found better recipes elsewhere)

i guess i just really appreciate cookbook authors that use more creativity and come up with recipes themselves

$review_text.: The main focus of this short book is the photographs of these lovely birds. They are all taken from a habitat in a shelter for birds, so the behavior the photos document might not be entirely natural, and the text does not go into more depth than one needs to satisfy curiosity, so it's definitely not a definitive work, but it is a very appealing one.Some wildlife photographs seem to exude appreciation of their subjects. Whether there's some underlying factor that could be measured or not (or if I'm just reading something into them), these photos have that quality, so it really is a delight.

$REVIEW.: The Wandering Falcon by Jamil Ahmad is a beautiful story set in the remote and dangerous Middle Eastern border areas we hear so much about on the news.  I don't want to discuss the plot in too much detail (no spoilers) but the fact that the story takes place in such a different culture is of enormous interest to me.  This book allows me the sensation of 'travelling' to this region to witness first-hand some of the complications that make the area such a hotbed of drama on the world stage.  The other point I'd like to pass along is the length of the book -- nice and short.  I say this with high praise as I find so many books would benefit from 'being shortened' to find the essential story.  This book hits the mark beautifully.  The cover, by the way, is a work of art.

$review_text.: FIRSTLY,  I WANT TO SAY THAT THE BOOK WAS AN INTERESTING READ & A PLEASANT WAY,TO KILL A FEW HRS.SECONDLY, I BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT, IF I WANT A CHRISTIAN BASED BOOK, I'LL BUY ONE!  IN NONE OF ITS DESCRIPTIONS, SYNOPSIS` NOR REVIEWS, WAS I TOLD THAT I WAS GOING TO GO TO CHURCH, AND PRAY IN GENERAL TO GOD, SO VERY OFTEN
 THE BOOK SHOULD'VE BEEN LISTED UNDER CHRISTIAN...THAN UNDER MYSTERIES AND COZIES
 AGAIN I'LL SAY THAT I'M IN NO WAY "OPPOSED" TO GOD


IT'S JUST THAT ALMOST EVERY PARAGRAPH, HAD THE CHARACTERS "PRAYING TO GOD", "THANKING


GOD", "THINKING OF OR BEING IN CHURCH AND REMINDING THE READER THAT THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL (SUPPOSEDLY) "GOOD CHRISTIANS.

$SUMMARY.: COZY MYSTERY WITH NO WARNING/S OF A BLATANT CHRISTIAN THEME

$REVIEW.: Yes you are seeing that right, I give 6 stars to Enticed. Every once in awhile you come across a book that speaks to you on level like no other. Enticed is one of those books for me. I loved everything word in this book. Ginger Voight captured my attention with her Groupie Trilogy so I jumped at the chance to read her new series. I love her writing!! I don't want to go to work today because I want the rest of the books right now!!This book is full of heartache, tragedy, and the effects of divorce on a young boy who has had to grow up too fast to be the buffer for his parents. Rachel is a school teacher who is offered boat loads of money to tutor him exclusively. She gets a weekend visit to determine if she could help the child. From the 1st moment she met Jonathan, they had a connection. There was no way she was saying no to this job offer. So she packed up her belongings and moved in with Jonathan and his father Drew.One of my favorite lines in the book is when she takes Jonathan to the library and he says to her I thought we were going somewhere fun? Her reply is:&#34;Books are a passport limited only by your imagination&#34;Rachel knew a broken child when she saw one and made it her mission to make sure he was well taken care of. Rachel has a past that is pretty brutal and I won't say what it is because you need that impact while your reading to feel the emotions as I did.  She responds and reacts to what Jonathan wants and needs and soon he opens up to her completely. These words broke my heart:&#34;If they're yelling at me, then they're not yelling at each other.&#34;Everyone is impressed with her abilities in making progress with Jonathan and of course everyone makes assumptions that she is a gold digger looking to make bank with Drew and nobody drove that home more than Alex, Drew's younger brother. He made sure she knew he wanted her gone from the beginning.Only then we realize there is so much more to the Fullerton family than meets the eye. I want to scream from the roof tops &#34;Go read this book now!&#34;Ginger Voight is an author to take notice of, she is easily one of my favorite authors. I've loved everyone of her books that I've read and can't wait to read more from her.

$REVIEW.: Some people did not like the banter and at times there was a bit too much talking. I was totally for the main character and related to the stresses she spoke about. I rooted for her and questioned if what the amazons did was necessary. Spoilers!I also was not sure how or why Maya feel in love with the queen. It seemed sudden and a bit unrealistic. I felt she saw her more of a captor for more then half the book then one chapter later it was like, take me! There could have been more or better description there. I thought Nori was almost better suited for her and thought why the author didn't make a love triangle to add a bit more interest into the story. There's good feedback from other reviewers about the length and time spent on describing each and every conversation like the bidding.The end chapters with the most bulk of the story seemed too quick and the main points could have taken up a better portion of the story. I think there could be a continuation as to how the amazons deal with the demons since now at the end Maya knows so much.The concept was exactly what I wanted but I think it could have been better. It is still worth the read!

$REVIEW.: The Savage King starts where The Dragon Lords series left off.Ulyssa, kidnapped and held hostage in a harem by King Attor, is an agent for HIA.  But when Attor dies, King Kirill takes over.  Kirill and Ulyssa both are bound by their duty, and neither wants a permanent relationship.  The problem is, they can't keep their hands off each other.I really enjoyed the Dragon Lord series, and The Savage King is a great start to the Lords of Var series.  Pillow did a great job of making me really like Ulyssa.  She was funny and tough, and very likable.  Kirill was a hard man, but vulnerable at the same time.Can't wait to read the next in the series.

$review_text.: A friend recommended this novel to me, and I loved the idea.  I always love inventive ideas that are deeply involved with women, but this Meg Wolizter.  All I can say is, to call this writing mediocre is being far too kind.  It is so thin, there's nothing to it -- no subtlety, no substance, no character development, nothing you could really call a plot.  There are plenty of so-called "popular fiction" selections that would just leave this drivel in the dust.  Try Stephen King.  He's a masterful writer, and his latest brilliant novels are not horror.  Or try Sophie Hannah, poet and mystery writer.  Her mysteries are brilliant, odd, surprising, twisting, and are full of characters you will never forget.  I still dream about some of them.  Or read _Amity & Sorrow_, absolutely brilliant first novel by Peggy Riley.  I won't forget that one for a long time.  There are so many fine novels being written now, that do not require you to be a great intellectual or anything, but that will teach you things, through pleasure in prose and image and character, books that will sing in your sleep.  Please make that tiny effort to find something better than Meg Wollister.  And I'm sorry to be so hard on another writer, but man, she really needs to learn what writing is.  It is not makng outlines and then filling in the gaps with a few sentences.  Perhaps all this criticism will come to me when I finally publish my first novel -- that would be just I guess, and if what i write is even half this bad, I would be happy to receive it.
$SUMMARY.: This is what passes for good writing now.

$REVIEW.: Ash started seeing things her senior year of high school. After researching the black voids that follow her, she decides they are demons. Ash ends up going to a small college in the country where she learns more about what is going on with her and the world around her.I was not a huge fan of the book. Overall, it had a very unique plot, one that I have not read before. And I will admit that there was a huge twist that I never saw coming right at the end, yet that most likely is not enough to make me want to read more.The characters lacked depth. All the side characters were one dimensional, with no real personality, just kind of blah. Ash was the worst though. She had no personality, just went through the motions of having a life. She had a best friend, yet never talked about her or why they were best friends, they just were. What? There were too many things about her that &#34;just were&#34; without any explanation or back story. I found I could not like Ash because I did not know who she was. She went through the actions of daily life but never really felt anything. There were surprises that happened to her, but really she never responded how I think she should have. There was a bad guy in the book, who pretty much had a neon sign of his evilness, yet Ash was surprised when she found out. I just wanted to shake my head at her most of the book.I was let down by the book, but maybe my expectations were too high since the plot sounded really interesting. Without character development, I can't really enjoy a book, and that is what I experienced with this book. I received this title from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

$REVIEW.: I recently started chen taijiquan  with a local instructor.  Though I've studied other martial arts I was at a loss on how to determine a good taijiquan teacher from a wanna-be.  This book is true to its intent.  As the author puts it, "...this is the book I wish I had when I started taijiquan."  I'm glad it's available to us newbies to the world of taijiquan; especially Chen style.Future readers should know the author's school is no-longer operating, at least as far as I can tell.  This is unfortunate.  I would love to be able to interact with either the author or his disciples to get some questions answered.  Otherwise, this book is an invaluable resource to those embarking on a journey into Chen Taijiquan.

$review_text.: My &#8216;Blogging Reader&#8217;s Review&#8217; after reading &#8216;THE EDUCATION OF SEBASTIAN&#8217; by Author Jane Harvey-Berrick (via: Booksmoviesfandoms.wordpress.c o m):I actually read this story of &#8216;The Education Of&#8230; Series&#8217; last year before starting my blog book reviews but it was one of my favorite book Romance/New Adult novels that I had to go back and do a review on it because it deserves the praise.  The story follows a woman by the name of Caroline &#8216;Caro&#8217; Wilson and a young guy named  Sebastian &#8216;Seb&#8217; Hunter. The story is written in Caroline&#8217;s P.O.V. but regardless, you still get the full effect of this emotional and enthralling story.You&#8217;re first introduced to Caroline &#8216;Caro&#8217; Wilson, married to a Naval Officer named David Wilson, she had become robotic in many ways thanks to their marriage.  Her husband always seemed to find something wrong with every and any little thing about her and instead of standing up for herself, she conformed to him.  Her marriage was going on 11 years, both loveless and unhappily is how it felt to Caroline. Her husband had been assigned to San Diego, California and that is where she first met eight-year old Sebastian.  He would come over to her home to talk about his day at school and she&#8217;d talk books and other fun things with him.  Both shared an unhappy homestead and they seemed to find a small bit of happiness in their friendship.  Eventually, David was reassigned to North Carolina, and Caroline had to leave a sad little boy named Sebastian behind.Sebastian &#8216;Seb&#8217; Hunter&#8217;s home was anything but warm and loving.  His mother, Estelle was a drunk mean-spirited woman and his father, Donald was any angry-hateful man who was stationed at the Naval base in San Diego.  Sebastian enjoyed going to Caroline&#8217;s home, to escape the dread of being at home with the parents that never really showed him much love.  Somehow, he was able to not become the monster that he easily could have become, which would have been the result of his parents relationship with him.  He was saddened to hear the news of Caroline moving away but he would remember all of the times he spent with her, giving him the only happy memories he had to hold onto.Most of the story of &#8216;The Education Of Sebastian&#8217; picks up about nine years later when David and Caroline are assigned back to San Diego.  Living in the same military base, Sebastian, now an older teenager and Caroline, newly 30, meet again.  So much has changed, yet have stayed the same. This story is truly intense, intriguing and will leave you torn with feelings of love and heartbreak by the end.  I highly recommend this novel and it&#8217;s follow up because of the strong connection these characters share.  The bond that is formed and the relationship they share, will pull you in and if you let it, you&#8217;ll fall in love with these character&#8217;s imperfections and their story. Check this one out. One of my all-time favorites indeed!Make sure to read the second novel to complete the story of Sebastian and Caroline:THE EDUCATION OF CAROLINE. :)MY STAR RATING FOR &#8216;THE EDUCATION OF SEBASTIAN&#8217; (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)
$SUMMARY.: My 'Blogging Reader's Review of 'THE EDUCATION OF SEBASTIAN' (One of the Best Stories
Highly recommend!)

$REVIEW.: In my book "Write with Passion...Sell with Power" I used what I called a 'formatting diary' for explaining the tangled mess that has to be uprooted in order to self publish on various sites. A similar style was used in this book to explain the use of the Amazon KDP promotion.Very cool. Hers reads more like a blog but effectively it is the same thing. I was attracted to this guide because of the title.(who isn't)? Anyone starting out in this business should take note of this whole process. While the writing is a little repetitive, it serves its purpose. One take away from this is that those numbers work if you have a lot of content. She apparently had some other published books which benefited from her promotions. With that said, based on an average of 1-1.5% conversion rate...the numbers add up!Thanks...enjoyed it.

$REVIEW.: Secrets Exposed:Great read!! I really liked Lindsey and Mark's story. I liked the added element of a serial killer who focused on Lindsey- it added to the suspense. The sexual tension between Lindsey and Mark- wow their attraction was instant. Lindsey was very reluctant to return to her father's firm, but she had no choice. Her old case haunted her daily. I felt her apprehension and indecisiveness not only with Mark, but with returning to practice law. She was strong character- very independent, smart and feisty. Mark oh wow I liked the hottie in a suit!! I liked that he was not so afraid of his feelings for Lindsey and he went slow and allowed her time to bring down her walls! He's a keeper!! One steamy story for sure!! On to the next one!!Hot Secrets: Great story!! Oh man these Walker brothers!! So hot. Royce is no exception he's one sexy alpha male who fell for Lauren the second he saw her! Lauren is smart, beautiful and determined. She feels drawn to Royce and can't fight it. With his vow to protect her, he has deceived her and he's afraid she won't forgive him. Their scenes together were steamy!! Glad to see Luke and Blake and Mark and Lindsey!! The story flows good and conflicts and issues are resolved.Dangerous Secrets:Wow!! Great read!! Luke- what can I say other than he's hot!! Luke is a super tough ex-seal with a heart of gold!! I like Royce and Blake, but Luke there's something about him that pulls at my heart strings. He's so caring and loves Julie so much that he's patient so that she won't run! Of course, Julie is in some serious trouble and only Walker Security can protect her. She's hesitant to get her heart broken and let Luke in, but her feelings are too strong to ignore. The story has action, suspense and very bad, ruthless men!! Julie, Luke and Walker Security get thrown in midst! Everyone was a suspect and I was waiting to see who was behind everything and I wasn't disappointed! I do have to say that Julie's reaction when she met Kyle and Jesse was grand I mean it's obvious all the male specimens working with the brothers are hot!!

$review_text.: I loved this book for many reasons. first, I like books about relationships and not only the "getting to know you part". I like books about gay men and not "am I straight or not" angst. So reading about a couple who have been together for 6 years was fun and heartwarming. the book is not easy, most of ot is not "fun". Alot of parts are frustrating as you see the couple get tangled in their own shells, but its frustrating in an intersting and good way.I would have liked to see Kyle at his work environment more, and the ending was not totaly satisfying. I thought there needed to be more clearing up that there was.

$REVIEW.: Set during Ohio in the 19th - century. Ann Miller was proposed to at the age fifteen by Eli Bowen, who comes from a prominent family. Ann's father said she was too young to be married and must wait until she turned eighteen years of age. Three years go by; Ann catches Eli eying another girl. She wonders if his heart has found someone else. She accompanies her father on a business trip to Pittsburgh, but her mind is on Eli.To her surprise, she meets a young man who will change her life. His name is Will Hanby, a saddle-maker's apprentice. His parents died when he was ten years old, and at six-teen his signed away his freedom for five years as a worker (more like a slave) to Master Good, who is cruel to the boy. By the time Will meets Ann Miller, his faith/spirit is broken. Ann feels a connection to Will and so does he. But Ann and her father are soon to leave for home and will is determined to follow her.Most of the historical fiction that I read is just `fiction" set during the past. The main characters in Fairer than Morning are based on real people. The real William and Ann lived in Westerville, Ohio in the mid-nineteenth century and had eight children. The author has done a remarkable job telling the true tale of the couple, of course the author used her imagination to fill-in the gaps in the history. This is the first in a new series and I can't wait to read the sequel. I recommend this book to romance readers.

$REVIEW.: I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour in exchange for a fair and honest review.Taking place during the reign of King Henry VIII, Lady in Deed by Ann Montclair is a charming period romance which takes place between a young woman raised in a nunnery and her rakish nobleman cousin. With likable characters, good dialogue and a light touch of emotional angst, Ms. Montclair's story grabbed me from the first page. While the pace was occasionally slow, the romance is well developed and sweetly spicy.An orphan being raised in a convent, Lady Mary Rutherford believed she'd be taking vows as a nun. When King Henry VIII reforms the church in England and banishes the Roman Catholic faith, Mary discovers her distant family has been paying for her existence and now wishes for her to move to their home. Unaccustomed to life outside the convent, Mary finds herself having to learn to run a manor and attracted to a man she barely knows.A soldier for the king, Lord Trenton Stanley returns home after a decade of service to find his mother dead, his father ill and his family's estate in shambles. Adding to his woes is his father's ward, who he accidentally mistook for a whore. Falling in love with the young woman, who previously lived in a nunnery, is definitely not a part of his plans.The scenes between Mary and Trenton are full of quiet attraction and emotional tension. Mistaking his father's plans, Trenton assumes Mary is there to become his stepmother and becomes jealous of his aging father, while Mary fears she might be forced to marry a man not of her own choice. Ms. Montclair did a good job developing the relationship between Mary and Trenton, while raised in two completely different settings, they both understood their duties to family and the crown.The secondary characters from Lord Henry Stanley to the the household servants and even the manor's tenants, all contributed to both the romance and the story's plot. A dangerous time, when one's loyalty to the king was continuously questioned and practicing one's religion could end in the gallows, Ms. Montclair did a good job keeping things historically accurate.Will Mary learn how to become the lady of the manor and will her attraction to Trenton lead to more than illicit affair? Read Lady in Deed to find out. I enjoyed it and I think you will too.

$REVIEW.: After reading the other readers reviews I think I might have a different impression of the book had I read the prequel to this story.  However, as it stands, I am left wondering where the HEA in this story is.  I must admit that threesome stories are not my cup of tea because I always feel someone is getting the short end of the stick and it is usually the h.  In this one the h definitely got left with a toothpick size stick.  (SPOILER)  She is left with a husband that IMO is not all that spectacular.  The guy hands her out without talking to her first or taking her into consideration at all.  He seems completely self-absorbed during the entire book and then doesn't even defend her when she is called a b***h.  This author is a real hit and miss for me and this one was a miss.  I wish that the h would have left her husband and find someone to cherish her.  Isn't that what romance is about?  Geesh!  If you want to read a threesome book where all the characters were on a more leveled out playing field I would recommend Laid Bare (Lauren Dane).
$SUMMARY.: No HEA here....

$REVIEW.: Ok, ok I admit I read the books in this series backwards

Lol

I couldn't help myself


I love Kate, and well Sway was just to tempting to resist


I went in un biased because I had yet to read Natural Harmony

The great thing is these books can be read as stand alone.So, if you ever read my reviews you know I give you more of my feelings than the books story


I hate spoilers

We have two people who carry a lot of baggage from the past that keep them from fully committing


Yet a part of me thinks faith had a hand in this too
Beau and Whitney are meant to be with each other


They are two pieces of a whole

They fell in sync so beautifully


It didn't hurt that her night routine of Madonna films gave them the in to connect


&#128521;The sparks you can feel through the pages from this two is so great I instantly felt it


I love the connection, and well the steamy scenes between made me want Beau more

Whitney is a lucky girl to get the chance to see and touch him
Age difference definitely was not an issue

They touched each other in many ways, and gave each other what was missing to let go and move forward
They did have struggles, insecurities, and just plain envy involved.I loved reading Sway because it pulled so many emotions
This book stayed with me for days and still does

Beau has definitely nominated the spot of book boyfriend, and replaced my Christian Grey from FSOG..


So, if you haven't picked it up yet, I suggest you do.Kate has become that Author that I will read any and all her books with no prompting

She is a must have for me

$review_text.: This was a stunning debut to a series that promises plenty of action and adventure.There were many exciting plot twists that saw a girl go from being orphaned and poverty stricken, to harnessing a unique power that was thought to have died off with her kind. Add to that the mystery of who was trying to overthrow the Prince Heir, and why, and I was enthralled.I was intrigued by the different types of power and magic found within the pages of this book. They were all very exciting and written in a way that made them unique to anything I've read before. The entire idea of the Patron Hunt seemed a bit barbaric, but again, it was refreshing and made this book stand out from the rest.Although this book was an action-packed, adventure thrill ride, I wish there had been more romance (because who doesn't love a bit of romance, right?!?); at least the budding of a romance between Ciardis and one of her patrons, or someone else entirely. I think things may develop a bit between Ciardis and Sebastian, but because he is so young I cannot see him as the gorgeous hero of this story. I'll have to dive right into the next book to find out. I have high expectations, and am looking forward to being pleasantly surprised. Who knows, the Prince Heir, now that he has control of his powers, may just grow into the swoon-worthy hero who sweeps Ciardis off her feet. Or they may remain friends who live an adventurous life together. One things for sure, there promises to never be dull moment where Ciardis is concerned and I'm looking forward to continuing the journey with her.

$review_text.: What an awesome series that will totally send chills up your spine.  I love supernatural horror! So of course this series caught my attention. I purchased the first book and had to have the second one to see what happened. Although this is a different story, I'm sure it's tied in with book 3. And now I have to have book three to see how book 1 and 2 are tied together. What a lovely mystery this is.  Not to mention I got chills, goosebumps, and shivers! It made my hair stand on end as shivers shot down my spine.Clay Purvis had an experience in his early life that "unleashed" the evil waiting in his soul. He can't stop killing and now he has found the perfect victims. If he kills a widow, (a pretty woman in her late thirties with bright blue eyes and long brown hair) her ten year old daughter, and fourteen year old son, then he will achieve his lucky number 13. It's almost too easy as he lures them in with his fake kindness, something he is all too good at. He holds up his guitar and tells people he loves to play and write songs and that he served in Vietnam. This is exactly what makes him such a great killer.He moved to the boonies of Hope Hollow on the north side of town. It's nothing but dying family farms, woods, and fallow cornfields. He rents a room at 32 Welcome Street, in a Victorian home, where he plans on taking down 3 victims. But there's a supernatural force at work and the twists and turns will make you keep turning page after page, glued to your reader. Especially when Clay finds a shocking secret in the attic!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's like something out of X Files!An eerie tale spun with deceit, mystery, and a surprise ending that will leave you gasping! Filled with drama and suspenseful action, this novel will transport you to a mysterious place you won't believe exists. This is an awesome weekend read. I read most of it sitting at the pool while my hubby and kids played in the water all day long. 5 stars without a doubt! Now I have to patiently wait for book 3. I'll tell you one thing for sure; this supernatural mystery is at the top of my summer reading list.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome series - Send chills up your spine with these spooky reads!

I don't know but all I know is most this stuff already! It's an easy read, but gets annoying to see the word 'lazy' in nearly every sentence. And I quote: "If you have been lazy and want to get out from that habit, this article might be of much help to you. Laziness starts at dawn. This means that if you want to fight laziness, you have to kick start yourself as the day begins." It's a great concept....just no new ideas here.

$REVIEW.: We are raising rabbits for food. I actually got interested in this and saw it as a possibility because of one of Bob Bennett's other books: "Raising Rabbits Successfully", which our library had. When I saw he had written the Storey's Guide on the subject, I felt pretty confident that it would be a good reference for the bookshelf. I also expected it to be a more updated versionThis book may be adequate, but I found it difficult to chase down specific pieces of information - such as age for slaughter, age for weaning, etc. Mr Bennett is a font of information, and this book does contain valuable information, but falls short of his previous work. Storey's is generally the place to start when learning about livestock. In view of his previous work, I found this book a little disappointing.

I am probably naive, but I would a book titles "The SAS Mental Endurance Handbook" to be written by someone with SAS experience and to be laid out as a ...handbook.  This just is not.I am always fascinated to read how different groups approach the problems of mental endurance and performance under stress.  I wish I could say this was a valuable addition to my library, but it's merely an OK read for people looking for general info and no actual training methods.

The one thing I found difficult when reading was the beginning when it took the read back to previous books and the start of their relationship.

Once the book caught up to their &#34;present day&#34; I found the story captivating and enjoyable.

 It was well worth the read, to say the least!  I seldom ever read a book twice, however I am starting my second read as soon as I finish writing this review
 Jennifer Lyndon did a fantastic job writing this book by portraying the powerful attraction between two women in such detail and depth that I could feel it myself


 The characters were likable and entertaining


 It was a nice long book and I savored every page

 Several intense, passionate scenes with just the right amount of sex between two women to represent their incredible, deep connection
 The title of this book doesn't do the story justice


 What actually unfolds between these two women is so much more than what just "An Infatuation" implies


 A must read, truly remarkable, undeniably beautiful love story.

$review_text.: Book Info: Genre: Urban Fantasy Reading Level: AdultDisclosure: I picked up a free copy on Amazon; later I found it offered on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I was more than happy to get the excuse to read this book sooner, so took up the offer.Synopsis: It's hate at first sight.Jasmine Farah and Rocco di Angelo are competing for the same job in a dusty office in a secret Federal agency run by the mysterious, menacing Jefferson Davis Crawley - "Creepy" Crawley, as he's known.When Crawley is murdered in front of them after their first day on the job, Jasmine and Rocco are left to figure out who killed their new boss, and exactly what a job in the so-called Department of Magic entails. And magic, it seems, is nothing like it seems in children's books; it's dark and bloody and sexual.What follows is a nightmare gallop through a world of ghosts, spooks, vampires, demons, and the minions of South American and Voodoo gods hell-bent on destroying the world and subjugating all America in the year 2012.Only Rock and Jazz, in the company of a ragtag team of urhobos - homeless guardians of the District of Columbia- can prevent it by resurrecting "Goddess America" in a mystical ceremony on the Fourth of July, as the story reaches its bittersweet and unforeseen climax.My Thoughts: I got the biggest kick out of the excerpts from The Federal Bestiary that open each chapter in this book. Kierkegaard has a sly and dark sense of humor that I found very appealing. I was also very amused by the idea of the Goddess America; it put a whole new perspective on Goddess worship, that's for sure! It was interesting and refreshing to read an urban fantasy in which the main characters had no particular specialness - no powers, not monsters of any type, not even particularly good fighters, just regular people put into strange circumstances. Highly recommended for fans of urban fantasy and good story-telling.

$REVIEW.: Tethers is an exciting story set in the Victorian era, with a fabulous blend of mystery, adventure and fantasy and an engaging pair of lead characters. We follow thirteen-year-old friends Karl and Esther as they discover a cryptic journal in their neighbour&#8217;s house, which leads them into a bigger mystery surrounding a gemstone with strange powers. The plot carries the reader along at a nice pace, and there are plenty of surprises and twists along the way. Karl and Esther are sympathetic protagonists with a great spirit for adventure and a sense of humour.The Victorian setting is well-researched and atmospheric, and the author does a great job of bringing the setting to life whilst also telling a compelling story. I was completely drawn into the book and found it to be refreshingly free of many of the clich&eacute;s of YA literature. This is an imaginative and strong debut which works both on its own and as the first in a series, and is a must for any fans of Victorian-set YA &#8211; or for anyone just looking for a great adventure with a dash of magic.

$review_text.: Wow, this book was packed full of interesting things.  I want to call it a historical thriller but it wasn't really fully historical because obviously it's fiction and it wasn't really a thriller because it wasn't scary or anything but it thrilled me.  :)  Hum, is that clear as mud?  Historical Thriller.At first I was a bit confused because there are quite a few different characters, all in different places doing different things.  It took me awhile to get to know the characters enough that I felt like things were coming together in my head.  I really did love how all these characters are all on different paths taking them to the same place where they all collide in great climactic force.  It was, well, thrilling.I love books based on historical things, even loosely.  What an amazing job Ms. Moore has done with research, making this book feel so believable.  I loved the Queen of Sheba story that was interwoven through the book.  I feel like that could have been stretched even longer to a whole book of it's own and I would have gladly bought into it.This was just a very satisfying read.  I loved it.Content:  some violence, including a human sacrifice that was somewhat graphic.

Each word or phrase has a quick paragraph summarizing the original language and if possible, a bit of history about the word. It was easy to read and easy to go back and find specific words when I wanted to share a specific detail.It is a perfect book to keep with you and read whenever you need to kill a few minutes (or more.) Although I read it cover to cover, it is separated into chapters such as Fine Arts and Religion, Household, Growing Things, etc.Even chapters which covered subjects that don't interest me had intriguing stories.

$REVIEW.: I am having a hard time knowing where to start with this. I've read other books from this author, so the style was familiar. What was new is the heat in this book! WOW!!Katie is just waiting to be done with school and on to the rest of her life. While working in her Aunt's shop a new shipment comes in with an invitation her best friend just cannot pass up!The adventures that happen and Kaleb coming into her life make this such a roller coaster of emotions.I can tell you I am normally pretty good at figuring out who my target &#34;bad guy&#34; is, I was not able to do that with My Soul For You, it had me until the end.If there will be more to come from Morgana, I'm IN 100% all in!

$REVIEW.: Calm, cool, collected. I really liked the Dom in this one. He cared and it showed. Caring did not lessen his status or make him come off in any way as not in control. The sub's inexperience was kind of, well, cute to read. It was kind of like "awwww". Kim Dare is also someone who interjects humor nicely into her work - and so it is here. Quite a nice exploration. Nothing too much - not too fast somehow even though it was short. I enjoyed it!

$REVIEW.: At just over 20 pages, this short story had heart and it was highly erotic


Erin has worked for Blake Morris for a while, loving him from afar

He's a former soldier, who was badly injured in battle, and has the scars on his face to show for it
He thinks he's hideous and definitely doesn't feel like he's good enough for a young woman like Erin

One day she catches him masturbating
Before she can escape, he moans her name

Could it be that he has feelings for her?When she makes him an offer he's not strong enough to refuse, they spend a passionate afternoon in each other's arms


Then his guilt settles in and he tells her that he's relieving her of her job as his housekeeper
She's heartbroken but finally tells him the truth about her feelings

His self-deprecating words fuel her anger, so she decides she'll just have to show him that her love goes deeper than just what can be seen on the outside.This was way too short
I loved their connection and would have loved to have read more about their time together
It's obvious they both challenged each other mentally, and that they both had a healthy dose of respect for one another

Perhaps the age difference between them is what made her appear a little naive in the beginning? We just know she's of college age and he's "older"


Despite the heavy dose of eroticism in the writing, this still spoke to the romantic in me.

$REVIEW.: This book was quite a disappointment for me: the blurb caught my attention but the execution was a far cry from what I was expecting.Darcie is a survivor coming from a totally messed up childhood, at the age of 14 Reggie rescues her becoming her older brother
She always refers to him as her &#34;knight in shining harmor&#34;.The problem is that Darcie is an annoying 17 yo bordering to flat-out stupid that passes her time in fight and suspensions from school


Suddenly she decides that she's always been in love with him, an goes on throwing tantrums nod being insufferable.Reggie is a far cry from a knight in shining harmor, more of a psychopath with anger issues and murdering tendencies.The story is quite unbelievable and most of the times it appears nothing more than a series of scenes without a real logical connection between them.Also the writing wasn't very good: too minimal without a real deepness to the characters and the situations that appear to be flat at best


Sometimes it stemmed to me that the author was more concerned in hurrying to the next scene than doing well the current one.

$review_text.: I knew generally what this book was about, and put off reading it because I wasn't in the mood for something depressing.  It's not. This is one of the most beautifully written and structured books I've read. The world of Darby and the Kid is so intensely real, you can taste the dust of the desert, hear the thwack of the dodgeball and see the bright sun shining in their darkest days.  O'Connor perfectly describes the magical thinking that occurs after a profound loss.  It breaks your heart open again and again, but by the end of the novel, you are hoping that pages will keep generating under your hand. Darby and the Kid are with me even weeks after finishing the book.  If you like the intricate structuring of books like "Cutting for Stone" or the absolute realness of place and voice like "The Help," then I think you'll savor this novel. In some ways, it reminded me of "Let the Great World Spin" by Colum McCann, with complicated characters who aren't special or even different than any of the rest of us.  The Kid is my favorite young adult/child in literature since I don't know when. The Kid is at that age when rationality kicks in, but it's in competition with pure innocence.  You cannot help but see the world as the Kid sees it, and grimace as you re-live the especial horrors of middle school. The Kid is the best eleven year old in literature, bar none.This is a book that will make you remember the magic of storytelling.

$review_text.: Veganism is not just a diet, it is a culture and belief system -- essentially it is a cult. Eventually every vegan must come to terms with her health problems, both mental and physical, as a result of the vegan diet and ideology. The Vegetarian Myth provides an insider's perspective on how that might be accomplished, mostly through an honest explanation of a human body's nutritional needs and the tunnel-vision ethics of vegan philosophy. You may think you are saving lives by refusing to buy products that are obviously made from animals, but the reality is that buying products that have no animal involvement is nearly impossible in the civilized world, and plant agriculture is at least as destructive to the environment and deadly to life on earth as animal agriculture.The Vegetarian Myth probably won't change your mind if you are a true believer. However, it will start you on the path to sanity and health -- it'll get you to think about a lot of issues that vegan propagandists ignore or obscure. How many bugs, worms, rodents, and birds are killed in the maintenance and harvesting of a field of soy or wheat? How will plant agriculture feed a vegan world without animal fertilizer? How can you justify the destruction of a prairie to plant a field of corn to support your vegan diet? How many diet-related lives do you cause to end as a vegan, compared to the typical omnivore? The Vegetarian Myth will strongly challenge your beliefs about diet, health, and the ethics of sustainable agriculture.

$REVIEW.: If only action packed sword and sorcery fantasy novels are to your taste you should carefully avoid the trouble to look for this out of print book which I happened to purchase for a rather outrageous price.It is extremely slow paced, with longish descriptions of magic theory and magical duels and little action. We find here the coming of age story of young Jessex (the real main character), an anonimous adolescent peasant boy drawn into a civil war he hardly understands by a dim premonition of a long lived priest.As it is always the case in any fantasy novel, Jessex turns out to be far more important than everybody expects.He falls in love with his liege, gorgeous and long lived prince Kirith Kirin, learns magic and finally save his beloved, his kingdom and prevents an apocalypse.Sensitive readers should not get alarmed: sex is mentioned but never graphically; Jessex is very young but his love for the centuries old prince is authentic and mature, a little more than it is to be believed of a teenager.Mr Grimsley seems to be interested in creating a strange, melancholic, sensuos atmosphere; a world full of wrecked ghost cities populated by evanescent wraiths. The characters seem to partake in this misty setting, they seem to live a half life made much more by different shades of gray than by crude black and white. Even the main villain, though despicable, is only half alive. Much attention is given to the landscape instead: we get many (perhaps even too many) details and the land of Arthen seems to be the only character really alive.The writing being fine I only feel like complaining about the overabundance of invented words: it looks like an alltoo easy device to create an exotic setting; we are given a full glossary at the end of the book, together with some appendices regarding various aspects of this fictitious world, but why hinder the reader with strange sounding names when a well chosen common word could have served just as well is something I have not come to explain.At any rate this novel is beautiful and should not be out of print.

$REVIEW.: This book has a very promising idea.  Though climate change is global, its effects are local.  Change affects different people, wild species, and crops in specific ways, both good and ill.  Why not use regional (heirloom) chile peppers as a window into some of the effects of climate change on farmers and communities?The story starts well, as our gastronauts visit Sonora's wild chiltepin peppers and Florida's datil pepper growers.  But the third chapter, on habaneros in the Yucatan, is just more of the same: these are three regions exposed to hurricanes and the potential for warmer temperatures that will harm their peppers.  Residents are worried, but they adapt with a mix of strategies, and they all like hot chiles.The next chapter on the Tabasco pepper and its namesake sauce provide some thematic variety by looking into a global pepper business.  Climate change loses its importance in this chapter, though anthropogenic land subsidence poses a major challenge.Then it's off to New Mexico and more peppers facing climate change.  It seems there are some interesting institutional stories beneath the surface, but the authors don't really explain the aqueria system, water rights, or other questions of political economy that are clearly important here.  Then a final chapter talks about some scattered chiles.The authors include some recipes throughout.  All are based on hard-to-get local chiles (except for habaneros and Tabasco sauce), so it would have been nice to include substitutes.  They all sound great, though.All in all, it's a neat idea but one that was hard to sustain, even through a short book.  Greater variety of analytical themes from one chapter to the next would help.  Still, I enjoyed being introduced to some chiles, like the chiltepin, that I hadn't known about.

$REVIEW.: This is the story of Karin Reid, a hospital nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Karin is not a Christian but her brother, Phil, came to the Christian faith, and would really like Karin to become a believer in Jesus as well.  Karin has survived an abusive childhood, and believes life consists of doing whatever a person wants without moral restrictions.Jason Garcia is a fairly new emergency room doctor in the same hospital Karin works in.  He is a strong believer, has high moral character and refuses to date anyone who isn't a Christian as well.Karin is shanghaied into attending church with Phil and his finance, Allison.  Jason attends the same service, and assumes Karin is a Christian as well.  The two of them feel an immediate attraction.Jason and Karin date, however, Jason is shocked to find Karin is not a Christian.  At this point, he already likes her a lot, but attempts to pull back once he understands Karin's faith, or lack thereof.  This story explores Karin and Jason's up and down relationship, the betrayal of Karin's best friend, Karin's faith journey, and the effect childhood abuse can have on an individual's life.Serenity to Accept is the third book in the "Grant Us Grace" series.  I have not read all the books in this series, but enjoyed "catching up" with characters from the other book I did read.  This story can be enjoyed without reading the previous two books.  The author writes well, and my interest was kept in this book.  I thought that all the things that happened to Karin were very believable.  It was frustrating, however, to read about some of the choices Jason makes.  Also, Karin's decision about faith seemed to come too fast.  Lots of time passing and events were squeezed into the last few pages of the story, so I thought the ending felt rushed.  None-the-less, I enjoyed the story and recommend it with four stars.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Hope Springs Books, in exchange for a free book review through the  [...] book review program.  All opinions expressed are my own, and I have not been compensated in any other manner. Despite my receiving the book free, it has not influenced my judgment, and I have given an honest opinion.

$REVIEW.: This brief, simple book towers above what most people will read in their lifetime.  Like his earlier masterpiece, "Life and Fate", this book takes you to every corner of despair, of cruelty, of evil.  Even more than his earlier work, "Everything Flows" is absolutely ruthless in its account of the sheer evil of the Soviet Union, particularly during the 1930s.  You will never forget Grossman's description of the pogrom against the Kulacks.  His account of the Ukrainian Famine has got to be one of the most chilling accounts you'll ever read.  The steady drumbeat of Grossman's dispassionate words and sentences only emphasizes the horror of these times even more.  There is no discernible plot here, only a portrayal of one of the cruelest regimes ever to exist.  Lenin and the murderous thug Stalin, are revealed in all their limitless perfidy.  The whole point of the book is a plea that freedom is the most important thing in life, which the protagonist Ivan Grigoryevich realizes only after having been imprisoned for 30 years solely because he was falsely denounced by an opportunist.  This is truly a remarkable and unforgettable book.

$REVIEW.: Review of Carter Reed by TijanBook provided by author for honest review.I'm honestly not sure where I should start with this review. The first few chapters of the book left me feeling a bit indifferent; it wasn't that the story wasn't good- in fact it was gripping. And it's not even that the writing style wasn't good, it's different, but again not bad. I guess it left me a bit lost, confused, and unsteady. As the story played out I found I was completely and totally invested in the outcome for all of the characters. Not to mention that I couldn't read it fast enough to see if there could ever possibly be a HEA for them.As I read on I started to wonder if maybe the beginning was meant to make the reader feel off balance and that maybe Tijan is some kind of evil genius. I'm fairly certain evil genius is accurate... because now that I've finished it, I realize that the beginning was crazy, well, much of the book was crazy, but those feelings that I was feeling those were how Emma felt. Tijan managed to make me FEEL the character's feelings without my even realizing it! Unheard of.I am not going to tell you much on the plotline because I don't want to jip anyone of the opportunity to connect with the characters like I did. Just know this, it is messy. There will be moments when  you are thinking what the heck just happened. Just when you think that the story is going to wind down you look down and realize you are only 39% into the book- then 54%- then 75% - then 82%... there are so many places the story could have ended. Things seemed to be heading in the right direction, but then the author sucks you right back in reminding you that she owns your butt until SHE decides to let you go.If you are looking for a sweet romance, this is not the book for you. If you want to be gutted time and time again, be left on the edge of your seat, feel the need to throw your Kindle at the wall, and have so much built up sexual tension you think you could cut it with a knife then Carter Reed is your man. I give this book 5 stars for one of the most original stories and writing styles I have had the pleasure of reading in a very long time and I will gladly give Mr. Reed 4 pairs of drenched panties, although he does inspire a girl to forget her panties at home. *wink winkReview by the Head Whore at Mommy's a Book Whore.[...][...]

$review_text.: I've always liked planting these around Christmas time, and this has been an absolutely invaluable guide to doing so. It is truly everything you need to know about them, how best to grow and nourish them, what diseases they may get and how to protect them from these. There is a whole chapter devoted to the different diseases of Poinsettias, which is fantastic because this is always a concern.On each plant is included a chapter on its history and origins, also (depending on the plant) information on hybrids, new breeding trends, indoor and general care requirements, ideal outdoor growing requirements, new cultivars, plant shape and proportion, miniature varieties, commercial propagation, outdoor care requirements, and of course propagation methods etc - and much more besides. There is a wealth of information on each plant! This is definitely all you need to know about Amaryllis, Paperwhites and Poinsettias. Also included at the end is an additional resources section for more information on each plant. If this was a paperback version it would be "well-thumbed!" Highly recommended!

$review_text.: This is a short story but I really like the idea behind it

I think the author needed to spend a little more time working the details, descriptions and emotions into it
Generally though, the plot was good, the characters likable and the sex hot
I'd LOVE to see the sex described more with a lot more emotion and maybe even more words between the couple

Overall I really enjoyed it.

$REVIEW.: Let me begin by saying that Katriel is beyond gifted in painting a Victorian picture


 From his descriptions of buildings, homes, and even his vernacular you were instantly drawn into this story
 I had been dying to read it since it came out,I finished it in just a few hours, and that includes re-reading certain parts

 I wanted to love this book, everything about its description drew me in, but the story itself was confusing to say the least

It shifts between points of view, it jumps around in time, the whole story does not come across fluid at all

There wasn't any character that I could connect to, mostly because such short and vague descriptions were given

Only one character aside from Salazar was even given a detailed family back story...but then it wasn't brought up again
Even Helena, who I would consider a "main character" was flat


I couldn't tell you what anyone really looked like, aside from the "haunting" image of Alatiel

I wish the story had been more character driven, then I would have been upset when something bad happened to them
 Instead it was like 'another one bites the dust.' This easily could have been a full on Gothic novel if the characters had been touched on more

 It's a decent read, and I don't feel like I wasted my time, I just wish I had come away creeped out, or even upset by a character's fate.

$REVIEW.: I'm picky about mysteries; I tend to lean more towards procedurals than &#34;softer&#34; mysteries, and often find myself annoyed at the way authors try and force their amateur detective's day job into the story. This book suffers from none of the faults that usually turn me off from stories like this one. Anna, our main character, is a therapist by day and a burlesque dancer by night. Both of these things could have easily been used as stereotypes and caricatures; instead, they enhanced the story wonderfully, as the author carefully wove an intricate tale with several misdirections and blinds, without ever making me feel like I was being manipulated. There is a sub-theme here about femininity and power that is beautiful, and I'm excited to see how it develops in further books in this trilogy. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes murder mysteries with strong female characterizations, which easily passes the Bechdel test, and finishes leaving you desperate for more.The last line is wicked, by the way; I'm hitting submit on this review and then immediately going to see if I can buy the sequel yet.
$SUMMARY.: I'm picky about mysteries, but this one was a winner.

$REVIEW.: The reason there are no reviews for this book is because no one has finished it?  I tried it twice because I liked the characters and the setting of the book.  Although it may turn out to be a good story, the writing was soooo full of words that the story progressed very slowly.  I don't need that much description or so many explanations while I'm reading.  There are a lot of mysteries that can be solved if someone will keep reading, but by the time I got to the third chapter I was more exhausted than curious.  And, I was tired of reading about Puck's genitals.

$REVIEW.: This is an odd little haunted house novella since for some reason the main &#34;character&#34; --the house--is missing. It's not described much at all so you never have a sense of being in the house. And there are zero scares. As an homage to HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, Blatty lifts the pounding in the hallway / door knob turning / &#34;It knows we're in here!&#34; scene from that classic, but it's simply that, a knowing acknowledgement of Shirley Jackson's classic.And his &#34;humor&#34; falls flat as his characters. The gay man simply says &#34;darling!&#34; and &#34;marvelous!&#34; so we know he's gay. The female real estate broker...nothing there, really. The female medium is...quiet. The professor is...kinda mysterious.Heavily padded at a little over 200 pages, I think this would probably have made a much better long short story.Blatty's great book about his Mom, I'LL TELL THEM I REMEMBER YOU is a much better read.

Now don't get me wrong it is a good introduction but i felt left down after reading it. it just kind of touches on the sutras than quickly goes off.  and  on top of that it does not give complete translations and with the translations them selfs something is lost in them . anyway  it spends more time talking about the discovery and where the original texts are now like in some  french guys private collection , and the taoist pagoda and christian monastery etc but even that felt was just a superficial glance at  it  all . i would have liked to know about the nestorians and their connection to thomas dydimus  but again just a quick blurb .  like i said its a ok introduction but it will leave you wanting more . i wish i didn't buy it and saved up for the lost sutras of ye su instead but oh well .

$review_text.: If anyone dislikes the Beatles... I'm sorry, but we can never be friends. Ever. I will not understand you. That being said, I want to meet Abigail Kelly. She has made it onto my list of fictional characters that I'd love to meet in real life.Abigail Kelly started college wanting to go into the Fine Arts, maybe being a painter or something of the sort. But by a complete accident, she was working at her summer job at a record studio, and was helping her boss test out some new equipment and BAM! Her voice was discovered.Fast forward a few years and she's an international superstar -- but with major anxiety issues. The paparazzi are after her every move, and she's lost her brother... after a breakdown, she's decided to take a full summer off -- not something her agent is fully ok with, but he's a skeeze.Abby finds herself staying with her sister in a small community in Florida, where she finds herself breaking into a store to keep from being recognized by teen girls -- and in this store? Todd.Between Abby's love of Beatles music, Todd's love of the Rat Pack music, and the majority of other awesome music mentioned in this book, as an audiophile and bibliophile, my mind was fully satisfied. Each chapter is the title of a Beatle's song. And I repeat, I want to meet Abby in real life -- the real Abby, not the fake one that the world sees -- and when you read the book, you'll understand what I mean by that.And you should definitely read the book, especially if you have a love of good music, good writing, and complex characters. You won't always like the two main characters, but that makes them more human and real. I'll add that I also want to meet Abby's personal assistant and best friend, Molly. As a secondary character, Molly is fantastic, British and hysterical.When you find a book that's relatable, even when the main character is so huge and you're just an average person... it's pretty awesome and well worth reading. And I think every woman should wish for a Todd. A guy who won't settle for less, who will push you to be better -- not different, not changing who you are, but simply a better version. And whose name isn't Jack.

$REVIEW.: I loved this book!  The Book Description was just enough to give me the gist of the story without giving too much away where it wouldn't be worth reading.  I don't like too many detail in a book.  I like to have to keep turning the pages to see what is going to happen next, especially if the story grabs me from the beginning.  I love a book that does that where I keep on turning til I have finished the book.  This book did all of that.  I love Tox and Grace's story from beginning til the end.  It's a good read, one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic!

Even though I know I will probably never face most of the many scenarios outlined in the book, just knowing I have been given some idea how to handle them gives me some peace of mind. It really opens your eyes to just how it is the little details that can make the difference between life and death in an emergency situation. I already have a bug out bag ready in my house in the event I need to evacuate in a hurry, but I have now added several items suggested in this book.Whatever the scenario this book has some useful advice, so if your into surviving the coming social upheaval and inevitable breakdown of our society get your hands on as much information like this as possible.

$REVIEW.: I was incredibly impressed with this book. It critiques much of the scholarship on the Great Depression, ranging from Paul Krugman's NYT rants to Milton Friedman's Monetary History of the United States. Murphy provides complex economic analysis in an understandable and readable way. The book explains how the depression was largely caused by easy money policy of the federal reserve in the 20's, and how Hoover and FDR's interventions into the market prolonged the crisis. Murphy also draws parallels between the current crisis and how Bush/Obama policies have repeated many of the same mistakes. There are  helpful suggestions for further reading in every chapter.  I would recommend this book as priority reading for anyone wanting to understand the Great Depression or the current financial crisis more thoroughly.

$review_text.: Well, I met only disappointment in my purchase of this book, despite high expectations

I have come to expect only the best from White Wolf, and this product is definietly below par for them


It seems almost that they lost  their touch on this one

It lacks the edge of previous releases such as  Vampire and Werewolf


However, the best products to compare it too would be  the other individual Hunter titles like The Inquisition, Project Twilight,  etc
Granted, they set out to have a common man Hunter title, but it comes  off contrived and weak in comparison to the aforementioned titles.I would  refer the discerning gamer to the other Hunter titles for a good game of  hunting down the monsters of the WoD, and to pass on this one.

$review_text.: This book contains much evangelical preaching and bible quotes. The story is almost lost in all the sanctimonious holiness. Basically, an unmarried woman allows an acquaintance to adopt her infant. Sixty years later, the daughter tracks down the elderly birth mother who has kept the birth a secret. She does not care to meet the daughter. The daughter sends numerous letters and photographs that are ignored.  She eventually  sees a newspaper obit. She boldly attends the funeral and later writes to the family. She should have had more respect for the wishes of the two mothers instead of imposing on an elderly woman after the adoptive mother died. And of course, she used the excuse god led her to act.

$REVIEW.: This is a simple book written with the warm and joyful style that only a loving mother can master. I enjoyed flipping through it, reading here and there of the author's experiences in life, smiling over the humorous incidents which Christine brings to life via the pages of this book. She has three children, she loves animals, she has a natural joy and zest for life. Most importantly, she loves God and wants to find His blessings in every portion of life.I must admit that although each incident (chapter) ends with a praiseworthy note to God for the lessons learnt, afterwards I was able to remember the incident told but had a difficult time recalling the application.This book reminds me of a pleasant blog. The chapters can be read at one's leisure; perhaps one a day to bring a smile to your day.Some of the book will not be relevant to homeschoolers since the author doesn't teach her children at home. But as I discovered through a comment she made in one chapter, she does think highly of full-time mothers and the reader can still relate to most of the incidents in this wife and mother's life.From the publisher's description:Using true life stories from the author&#8217;s everyday life, Glimpsing Grace in Ordinary Days reminds us that God is always at work, even when it&#8217;s hard to see His hand in our daily routines. It helps readers pull out often-elusive glimmers of grace out of our chaotic world, examine them, and rest in the assurance that we are loved by God. Whether we&#8217;re struggling with a divorce, remodeling a kitchen, or chaperoning a field trip, glimmers of grace are there, free for the taking, but we do need to reach out and grasp them. This book helps us remember we can.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a Review Copy free from the publisher through the BookCrash.com book review program.

$review_text.: I feel like I need to preface this post by letting you know how much I dislike writing negative reviews, because I know how much effort goes into writing a novel, and I know that it's close to the author's heart, and I'm about to stab her in it..... sigh."It's not you, it's your book..."This is the first of Ashley's novels that I've read.  While I've purchased Nets & Lies and her quite popular Proposition and Proposal, I haven't read them yet.  I have to say, honestly, that I might not even bother with them now.So, forgive me for being so blunt here, but Music is simply a poorly covered up remake of Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster, mixed with bits of the Rockstar love stories that have become ever popular on the Indie romance scene.Why is it that when something good comes along, everybody thinks that they can change a few things and re-do it and viola, it's a hit?  You want to know why?  It's because we let them do it.  And we buy that s***.  How many Fifty Shades knock offs are there in the world right now? Obviously somebody is buying it (although I'm certainly not).  And yeah, yeah, all that crap about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery and all that... but I hated it when my art teacher in high school used that one on us, and I hate it even more now.  Seriously, if you don't have an original story line, then don't write the book.  Or, at the very least, change it enough that people can't tell that's where the idea came from.While I loved (luuuuuuuuurved) Beautiful Disaster, Ashley has not only copied the story line - beautiful virgin, Abby (the female protagonist's name in BOTH books) falls into a relationship with a hot bad boy by entering into a bet and inevitably, they fall in love, but also, among other similarities, are the use of a pet nickname given to Abby - "Pigeon" in Disaster, and, the uncreative "Angel" in Music.  Suffice it to say, I am not impressed with the premise or the plot. Also, that horribly PhotoShopped cover is just... bleh.And, okay, I'll play Devil's Advocate here for a minute and say that maybe, KA had the idea long before JM published Disaster.  But if that's the case, then go back and make some more changes before publishing.  Or, maybe KA's assuming that her readers haven't read Disaster.... Or, maaaaaaybe, KA hasn't even read Beautiful Disaster... Honestly, though, none of those excuses works for me.  Maybe I'm just picky (okay, YES, I am very picky), but does this not bother anyone else...?1 star (because while it was a glaring copy and ever-predictable, it was at least mediocre enough that I finished reading it - mostly while hoping that something - ANYTHING - would be different than I predicted)... (It wasn't.)

$review_text.: If your taste in erotica includes science fiction or fantasy, you probably already know Cecilia Tan's work. This story, the first half of the epic (in several senses) erotic serial she began web-publishing about two years ago, is an intoxicating mix of sex, romance, magic, and political intrigue, with a few fight scenes thrown in. A pampered prince and his whipping boy, who bears the punishment for the prince's transgressions, are separated by a deep-laid plot just as their childhood attachment blossoms into an adult romance, and both young men must spend time with many other partners before they are reunited.Prospective readers should be aware, however, that themes of dominance, submission, coercion, and consent are central to this story. Most of the sex scenes qualify as BDSM, and many of them are brutal and coercive even by the mores of the fantasy setting. If you don't like BDSM fiction, or if you like scenes in fiction as in life to be carefully negotiated, safeworded, and rounded off with cookies and a hot beverage, then The Prince's Boy will not be to your taste.If you do like bondage, flogging, and dubious consent mixed in with your true love and heroic deeds, this story will satisfy. As Tan points out in her preface, it was written as a weekly serial, and thus every single chapter packs a hard erotic punch. In fact, you may find yourself in a bit of a daze while reading it. My only complaint, if I should call it that, is the almost complete absence of female characters; Tan can write strong female characters with sexual agency better than most, but here she has created a stringently masculine world of kings, soldiers, and magic that derives its power from the forbidden lust of man for man. I recommend it for the adventurous reader.

$review_text.: Feminism is a lot less scary than I thought. In reading this book, I took a huge step outside my comfort zone, so I got a lot of unexpected benefits. The first was in realizing that feminists have good intentions, and sincerely want to end all oppression everywhere. Since I've been hoping all my life for a class struggle to promote greater equality, I discovered common ground.For a scholarly book, it's exceptionally readable. By delving so deeply into the theory behind feminism, it covers a lot of ground, which is why it's such a great introduction to anyone who wants to take a serious look at the subject.By seeing such a different world-view, I was able to learn a few things which will improve my own life. The best part of the book was the last part of chapter 8, which describes how being too controlling damages men even more than women, by preventing us from relaxing enough to enjoy life. A good military analogy: there's no lonelier job than the captain of a ship. So while there are likely to be power struggles in any relationship, now I see how damaging excessive control can be. (So minimize control and maximize autonomy.)In this review, I'm not including anything I disagree with. That wouldn't be appropriate for this book, nor do I want to bias any reader in advance. Gender Knot deliberately presents only one side of the story: it argues in favor of feminism. And it does that very well. If you want to consider the other side, books by Warren Farrell also present only one side of the story: arguing against feminism. Let the reader make up her own mind.All things considered, I'm certainly no feminist. However, I can gain maturity and open-mindedness by at least giving feminism a fair hearing, and learning from feminists where they are right.

$REVIEW.: At last, a really good English-language Japanese cookbook.  We actually eat many of her recipes on a regular basis, because my wife uses her Japanese-language cookbooks. For what it's worth, her mom cooked professionally in Japan for 40 years and she praises Kurihara's books too.  Unlike the other English-language Japanese cookbooks I've seen, she doesn't write about what might be served in restaurants, or an American image of Japanese food, but the sort of things that Japanese people actually like to eat at home. Her commentary on the food and Japanese attitudes towards it is also simple and accurate (IMHO), without any grandiose sociological claims about "Japanese culture," which is refreshing.The best part for me? Udon, those thick, chewy noodles. I love the stuff, but we can only get it after a 2 hour drive, and it's expensive here in the US. My wife believed that it takes special flour to make, which we can't get, so even though we could eat it pretty much 365 days a year, we only had it occasionally. But Kurihara has a recipe that mixes AP and Bread flour that works! It requires some bad-ass kneading (like stomping on it for 20 minutes--literally) and it isn't quick (it is cheap, though), but they taste great. Even my wife gave it the thumbs up, which says a lot.

$REVIEW.: "For Women Only" is intended for (Christian) women who are interested in gaining a better understanding of men so that they can better appreciate and support their husband in the way that he needs.  Feldhahn offers seven "revelations": things men wish women knew but don't know how to explain.  She came upon these revelations through surveying hundreds of men from many walks of life.The first chapter lists six ground rules for reading the book: it contains no male bashing, it deals only with how women relate to men ("For Men Only" deals with how men relate to women), there are exceptions to every rule and no man is expected to fit perfectly into any category, the book addresses what a normal man is--not what he "should" be, some of the information in the book might be distressing to your current views of how men think, and this book is supposed to change and improve women--not men.  Judging from many of the negative reviews on this site, many people seem to skim over or forget these rules.Feldhahn's seven revelations are: men crave respect and love, men are in constant competition with themselves and the world and are often worried they don't measure up, men are burdened by their need to provide but also like to be depended upon because providing is a way to show love, sex fulfills an emotional need for men, men notice beautiful women, men want romance but they define it differently than women, and men want their wives to care about their appearance.The book is a very easy and quick read, but it is repetitive and slim.  It contains a few too many Christian references for my taste.  There is a discussion guide available for purchase, and a website for further information (I haven't looked at either).  The practical advice is weak, but that's ok because the revelations inspired me to create my own solutions.I read "For Women Only" in an evening and then had about an hours' discussion with my husband.  It was enlightening and enjoyable for us both, but it is not something that I would take too seriously and not something I would give as a gift.

There is even a heat scale that tells you how many units of heat are contained in various types of chiles.Also, if you want a little spicy history, it&#8217;s in there. In fact, there&#8217;s a little too much talk about the global impact of hot sauce and the various types of chiles for my taste, but the information is interesting if that&#8217;s what you are looking for.The recipes are divided regionally, which is fantastic. There is such a difference between spicy flavors in Mexico versus Cajun spice, and the recipes are curated for your regional and gastronomical needs. Good buy for the novice chef who likes to turn up the heat!

$REVIEW.: The idea held promise: a mother and daughter team solving a mystery. The book just didn't completely keep that promise. There was a lot of rambling thoughts from the main character, scenes and actions described in too much detail that had no real relation to the story line.At first, the two women seemed to get involved in the investigation because it would be something fun to do, which, in itself, I don't find as a good enough reason. The reason for continuing seemed to be that they simply couldn't let it go.I would consider giving the other books a try, though, to see if the writing improved.

$review_text.: Plot Summary:  The year is 1881, and Tombstone, Arizona is a town like no other.  Served by horseless stagecoaches and illuminated by electric lights, this dusty town hosts the premiere inventors in the country, Thomas Edison and Ned Buntline.  The U.S. government charges the Earps - Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan - with protecting Mr. Edison from all enemies, and they send for their friends, Doc Holliday and Bat Masterson.  This dream team will face not just the Clanton gang, but some fearsome medicine men, and a quick-draw corpse that used to be Johnny Ringo.The Buntline Special: A Weird West Tale succeeds with the steampunk, but it never cowboy'd up to the culture.  I think it had the potential to be great, but there were too many misses along the way.  For instance, the dialog was disappointingly bland.  I wanted to hear the Old West come alive in the poetry and cadence of the language, but everyone's speech was far too contemporary for a historical setting.  I kept trying to insert an accent, but it wouldn't stick.  Just a little bit of Mark Twain's voice would have given the whole story a flavor of authenticity.  The only exchanges with any spark occurred between Doc Holliday and his sometime lady-love, Big Nose Kate:&lt;Quote>He was suddenly overcome by a paroxysm of coughing, and sat down again.  She brought him a handkerchief, and he handed it back to her a few minutes later when he was done."That's more blood than usual," she noted, staring at it."I don't know what you expect me to do about it.  Cough out the window, maybe."She stared at him for a long moment.  "I don't know which to do," she said at last, "nurse you or kick you in the balls.""Do I get a vote?" he asked. (241)&lt;End Quote>I was excited to see this Wild West dream team of gunfighters assembled, but the reason behind it was too vague to drum up any further enthusiasm.  We learn that the U.S. Government wants to expand across the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, and they believe that Thomas Edison is their single best asset for overcoming the magic-wielding Native Americans.  The Earps, Bat Masterson, and Doc Holliday are to protect Edison and his partner, Ned Buntline at all costs.  This leads to the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but unfortunately the setup was so generic that it didn't give me much of a mystery to chew on in between.The steampunk elements brought a glow to my brass-plated heart, and here is where The Buntline Special shined.  The descriptions and illustrations were the stuff of steamies' dreams, and I happily plunged into the mechanized world of horseless carriges, gatling revolvers, and, er, metal "working girls."  It was all well done, and by far, my favorite part of the story.Steampunk fans will enjoy the ride, but the west was left in the dust, and I mourn its absence.  This could have been amazing if The Buntline Special had truly joined The Weird with The Old West.
$SUMMARY.: Steampunk fans will enjoy the ride, but The West was left in the dust, and I mourn its absence.

$REVIEW.: I had hoped this book would offer a no-nonsense approach to alternative remedies to common health problems.  While there are some helpful sections, many of the solutions to problems involve more ephemereal suggestions than concrete ones.

$review_text.: This book is a bit different to anything else Ms Roseau has written, although there have been hints of the theme in Familiar and Privateer.  Let me just say that the plot did not at all go where I thought it was going.  It surprised and beguiled me.  Although it wasn't my usual fare, it was well written and superbly crafted.I can't detail the plot without spoiling the surprise, but it was dramatic, intense and even a bit disturbing.  Not the normal escape fiction romance.  Nevertheless it was interesting and fun to read.  I do recommend it, and if you want to know more, read it yourself.

 I was very pleasantly surprised with the turn out of this story, the first book although very interesting, was a bit slow and confusing, but upon reading this 2nd book I am now aware of what was happening in the first, what is happening now and what is to come
 It is very well written and an eye opener.I love that Lily finds her purpose and that Damon finally comes to terms and realizes what his calling is

 Now I can't wait to read the third book in this series.Keep on writing Lynn, this is a great series.

$review_text.: This is a very intriguing book written in a way adolescents would enjoy and relate as well as many adults who are interested in books filled with the supernatural.  I was immediately hooked into the story as the protagonist, Kat, was hooked into reading a "book" entitled "Legacy" that was given to her by her grandmother.  The story was filled with self-discovery and adventure that was steeped in supernatural phenomenon.  I enjoyed reading this book as I thought about my many, many students that would enjoy this book as well.  The story continues as Kat not only learns about herself but life around her.The idea of "Balancers" is an interesting twist on a protector of mankind.This story is mostly told through a journal as it obvious is the beginning of a series.  It places everything in position for the later books.  It is definitely a good read, and I encourage those that enjoy the supernatural to give this story a try.  Just be prepared to become interested and unable to put the story down.Chris Adonn is a budding author that I will watch for many wonderful triumphs with the imagination that was involved in writing "Legacy."

$REVIEW.: Whiskey Island is book 16 in the  Milan Jacovich series  by author Les Roberts.  Milan is a private eye in Cleveland and runs his own business.Milan Jacovich and his partner K.O.  work at solving puzzles in Cleveland.  In Whiskey Island, a crooked city councilman, Bert Loftus, comes to Milan's agency to get some help.  It seems as though someone may be trying to kill him.  Looking at all the possibilities, the list of suspects is pretty lengthy.  Everyone is after this guy and for good reason.  He accepts bribes and then does not follow through all the way and that has upset some people.There is never a dull moment in this book.  From the prologue when Milan ponders honesty and corruption in the smallest things, to his feelings for the lovely Tobe Blaine and then to the revelation of  the bad guys, it captures and holds the interest of the mystery reader.  I enjoyed it.I won this book in a First Reads Giveaway on Goodreads.

$review_text.: This historical mystery is set in Brighton in 1951. The war is over, but the Neuremberg trials are being reported and rationing is still in place. Mirabelle Bevan is still mourning her married lover and the excitement of working in the secret service, even if mostly her work was deskbound. Now she is working at a debt recovery agency and feeling very much that her life is on hold, or even over, when a client appears at her office with a new case. He claims a pregnant woman owes him a large debt and asks her to help recover the money. Mirabelle's boss is away, so she begins the initial investigation and, before long, alarm bells start ringing. Soon, with the help of the lovely Vesta in the next office, the two women are investigating murder, kidnapping and money laundering, amongst other things.Mirabelle and her partner Vesta are delightful and the mystery is fast paced and interesting. There is a wonderful, vampish and murderous villain and a great cast of characters to flesh out the storyline. The novel has a list of questions for reading groups at the end, which is always useful, and the promise of this being the first of a series. I will certainly be reading on. Great for anyone who enjoys mysteries with an added historical flavour and an intelligent and resourceful heroine.

He gives you the understanding of how to modify undesired behaviors into desired ones. I'm a strong advocate for adoption of rescued dogs as I've seen how they can make great family pets.

I felt the author really warmed up to the subject matter and describing the intricate nature of the character's mixed feelings. I eagerly await reading Roman's story.The reason I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars is I really wanted more description of the characters, what they looked like and their expressions. I also wanted to see more interactions between the best friends like in Joey W.

 A small town preacher falls for the new gal in town


 Seems she is a single mother of two kids
 He is terrific, if he were real, more people would be in church


 The story has a little mystery and a good romantic side


 All the characters were likeable and you could relate


 Some you even know people just like them

It was a good quick read and I enjoyed it

 I would recommend it
 It was not at all preachy


 I would not call this a Christian romance
 It is more a story of the romantic side of a man of God
 You will like it.

But some of the recipes the 'ingredients list' is not complete; you find out as you read the directions what more you need
Also some call for more sodium then some people should have.

$review_text.: Reviewed by VRValicentofor TheRomanceReviews.comWhen Phoenix McKay was caught on school grounds after curfew, it should have resulted in immediate expulsion. Instead, it resulted in avid curiosity about the Tall, Dark, and Mysterious Night Student, Demitri.Barinkoff Academy has a strict rule regarding curfew and when Phoenix wakes up in the library after curfew, she has very few options. While trying to find a way back to the dorms, she runs into a group of Night Students that no one knew the school had. This group of students is threatening to taste her flesh and not interested in helping her get back to the dorms. She is saved from being &#34;tasted&#34; by Demitri.Demitri peaks Phoenix's interest because he will not answer her questions, shows her things about her school she did not know, and then drops her off at the dorms. But curiosity may have gotten the best of Phoenix McKay this time. To get answers to her questions, she agrees to be a test subject for the story's mad scientist, Dray. The experiment is intended to save the Zhamvy people. The Zhamvy are flesh-eaters that have not eaten human flesh in centuries, and are dying. The goal of Dray's experiment is to save his people. But it has one great side effect--Phoenix's and Demitri's romance. What started as an attraction or curiosity turned into love.TASTE is an interesting story. It has a lot to offer the reader. It has mystery, romance, royalty, espionage, and action. The characters are an interesting group of people. They might be flesh-eating royals, but they really are just like anyone you know. I really enjoyed TASTE and had difficulty putting it down.If reading about zombies or flesh-eaters is not your cup of tea, forget that it is part of the story. This is a story about a girl that meets a boy. She is curious about that boy, wants to know more about him and his friends, and then does what she can to stay with him.

$REVIEW.: Like the Bonsai tree, haiku and micro fiction evoke primarily contemplation (for the viewer or reader) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower or writer).The essence of haiku is "cutting" (kiru). Likewise with micro fiction and the Bonsai Tree. All three places limits on the author. Done poorly, the cutting produces ugliness. Done well, the cutting process produces beauty that makes the viewer look up to reflect on the impact and implications.Milo James Fowler falls in the latter category. He makes you pause, reflect, or simply revel in the imagery.Listen:ethereal soulsurban cacophonydancing through moonlightNo words of mine can translate that for you. Each soul is different so you will be touched in a way diffent than me. But you will be touched.Or:keeping my head downso little of the day misseduntil you appearA memory flashed before your eyes did it not?  Evocative poetry does that for you. You will not be the same after reading these haikus or his micro fiction.Spending under a dollar to be transformed and enriched is the best buy you will make today. Buy MAIKRO now.

$REVIEW.: The author shares her personal experiences to describe what it means for her to be single, Christian, and female. Much of her writing style portrays that she is Australian (and proud to be one), as she uses humor and national references to emphasize her zeal for living. Overall, her stories, quips, and discussions about faith seem to bring across the point that God is in control of every individual life. In addition, she shows that single women who desire to marry will best find a mate by serving the Lord in the specific capacity He has currently called them to. Though the author does discuss in a brief and indirect way that being single is a gift because it draws the individual closer to intimacy with the Lord, the book is less about living a single and contented lifestyle and more about preparing for marriage by accepting a faithful lifestyle and waiting for the Lord to act. In terms of the discussions on faith and spirituality, some of the things the author writes are very helpful, and some of the topics are not biblical at all. This book would appeal most to single women who are devoted to the Lord, love a good laugh, and seek encouragement from the lives of other faithful women who are not (too) desperate for a spouse.I received a free download of this book in exchange for an honest review.

John Decker spends the whole book being beaten and tortured so there is not much action from him. Daria Buckingham provides moral support to Mark Sava but not much else. Mark seems to mostly bumble through. The plot is ordinary and the settings although exotic are not well described.

St. Claire hits home with this true to life story, and the ending is something most readers do wish for.

Since there are a couple more books in this series I would venture to say that a lot of readers will look for them. reviewed by Heide Katros Winter Haven News, Florida

$review_text.: Reid Webb and Jimmy Grant had been friends since they were children


 Where you saw one, you saw the other


 It was only natural that they would decide together to become firefighters and that they would end up in the same station
 They depended on each other for everything and their families formed one extended family

 When Jimmy's wife died in an accident, Reid and her mother stepped in to help raise Jimmy's young son, Chase
 What they didn't count on was Jimmy dying in a fire under circumstances that leave Reid believing she caused his death

 Now she knows she has to help provide stability in Chase's life and that means dealing with his Aunt Isabel, who arrives to be Chase's guardian
 Reid fell in love with her when they were much younger, but she thought Isabel was straight and she was Jimmy's sister, so definitely forbidden territory

 Isabel has her own feelings about Reid
 When they were children she resented the relationship Jimmy had with Reid and not with her


 Now, she blames Reid for her brother's death, not so much for the accident, but because she drew him into the life of firefighting

 What they have in common is a love for Chase and the determination they both have to give him the best life possible now

 As the two women struggle with their grief and anger, they realize they have to work together and then that an attraction is growing between them
 There are a lot of issues that have to be resolved before they can decide if they want to be "fully involved," maybe too many issues.Erin Dutton does an exceptional job of creating the personalities of her players
 Reid Webb is a strong character - brave, stoic, guilt ridden


 She has the patience to deal with a small child and his hurt, but not with the woman she loves
 Isabel is a study in contradictions, one moment admiring Reid for the courage she shows and how she seems to instinctively understand Chase, and the next hating her for what happened to Jimmy

 Chase struggles to be the "man" he knows his father would want him to be while trying to understand how one little fellow could have so many bad things happen to him

 The strength of the characters' emotions pour from the page and will catch the reader up in the story
 This is not a sad book, but there are certainly parts that will cause tears to rise

 Yet, it is also a story of hope, of how people can put their lives back together after great tragedy and how the definition of "family" needs to be revised for the world today.This is one of the better books out there to read.

$REVIEW.: "Casa de Naomi (volume 2)" by Paula Michelson is an enduring and captivating story of redemption as told through the lives of Chaz and Naomi whom we met in volume one.  You will discover an insightful look at the agony of being someone you are not in order to survive in a hostile world that is antagonistic against whom you are.  How could two people, Jewish by birth, hide within the Catholic Church unbeknownst to each other, run from each other, rediscover themselves and become the couple they both wanted to be?  Can they do it?  Can their marriage be saved?  Will it survive their betrayal?  You will have to read "Casa de Naomi" to find out.Paula masterfully shows how God pursues those who try to leave Him out of their lives.  You will perhaps discover some things about your own journey with God that you have tried to bury or ignore.  I am pleased to recommend "Casa de Naomi" to you.  And of course, in order to really appreciate this beautifully written story, you will need to first read volume one of this saga, "Casa de Naomi: The House of Blessing."

His thrillers are fast-paced, believable stories and the reader develops an immediate and lasting affection for his characters

I am reading Gallacher's stories of the former SAS troopers who comprise the ISP international security company, out of sequence - I stumbled on Savage Payback first - but there's no loss on continuity or enjoyment

These are solid reads - well-written, sturdily plotted.and as unsettling as finding 100 grams of Semtex concealed in your car.

$review_text.: The love scenes are super hot, but the storyline is ridiculous. I am about to throw a serious spoiler into this review so beware... Roth is about as selfish a person you can find. He intentionally goes after Kyrie knowing his past could destroy her. His goal is to make her trust him and she does. She falls for him. Then after all of the emotional bonding, he decides to tell her he is the one who killed her father. He tells her that it was an accident and what a terrible person her father was. THEN...he expects her to be ok with it. Reminding her that he "owns" her. Kyrie on the other hand hears that Roth killed her father and asks for space but brags to her friend how great he is in bed and Layla should be jealous! Does Layla say, HE KILLED YOUR FATHER! No, she says "You would be a fool not to go to him..."The characters in this book have the emotional depth and morals of slugs. The conversations are choppy. Kyrie is enamored with Roth's speaking because he must be so educated. I have a Ph.D. and Roth would bore me to sleep!  He is so pompous and always knows what's right, but in the end he has no insight or maybe he just doesn't care how badly he will damage Kyrie by what he has done. There is no depth to either character. Yes, the sex scenes are super hot. The middle of the book is pretty good actually...but the beginning and the end, the actual plot... is ridiculous.

$review_text.: The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business by Josh Kaufman is one of those "have to read" books
The whole premise behind The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business is the same as for the Redneck MBA

That is, one does not have to go to a business school or even takes courses on-line to have the equivalent of an MBA.Kaufman provides explanations of many different concepts and defines numerous terms in a simple, easy to read, format
The only problem I saw with the book was that 8% of the book was used to tell the reader why they should read the book and why they did not need an MBA.I am an MBA and I could not agree with Kaufman more


The only real reason I see for one to pursue an MBA is to have that piece of paper to show credibility to get one's foot in the door

If a person already has their foot in the door, so to speak, then the credentials aren't necessary.One of the best parts of this book is that Kaufman provides a list of the books he thinks are most important for a business student to read

Most of them I have read and have reviewed on line or will be reviewing


Some others I have had on my reading list for a long time

A few I had never heard of, but do intend to read in the future.Will reading this book give you all the information you need for business? No, it won't, but it will give you some background and provide some resources to point you further down the road.As you get started in trying to learn more about the world of business, it might well be a good idea to read The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business by Josh Kaufman and visit his web site at [...]

$review_text.: Meet Jarrod Seventhborn, or Luckbane, as most people in the universe know him. Jarrod is a lowly janitor in a futuristic world that feels like a mix between Total Recall (updated version), The Running Man, and Minority Report. He&#8217;s also one of the world&#8217;s best players of Impworld, a role-playing game that has captured the attention of viewers everywhere. It&#8217;s the ultimate reality show, and billions have tuned in to watch Luckbane, who is a thief in the game, conquer every quest and beat seemingly impossible odds.The world is run by mega-corporations, and Jarrod is too popular for his own good. Those in power apparently don&#8217;t like it when the common man gives hope to so many. While Jarrod must play with his head on the proverbial swivel to avoid being taken out by a fame-seeking player, he doesn&#8217;t realize that he&#8217;s made powerful enemies in the real world.Through a series of events, Jarrod is invited to take part in a real-world version of Impworld called Otherworld. He is whisked away to another planet that has been constructed to look just like the game he knows so well. Thanks to futuristic technology, the world is complete with all of the monsters, characters, spells, weapons, armor, and intrigue from the game, as well as several other surprises. If you&#8217;re having trouble picturing it, think Middle Earth from the Lord of the Rings on steroids.The action leading up to the game was more than sufficient, but from the moment Luckbane steps into Otherworld, the action amps up to hyper-speed. Most participants in the game choose to play as an avatar, so the person can safely play via remote control. However, Jarrod joins a team of champions who, for the most part, are content to play in person, meaning if they die in the game, they actually die.The first book in the Otherworld series introduces us to Jarrod and his ragtag team of adventurers who set out on a quest to stop the Firelord from obtaining the most powerful weapon in the universe. It won&#8217;t be easy. Dodging assassins is the least of Jarrod&#8217;s concerns. The corporation, GameComm, is bent on earning high viewer ratings so they toss Luckbane and his troop into one dangerous battle after another. Whatever the corporation can dream up, they can implement into the game. But there&#8217;s an even greater threat. Someone outside GameComm wants Jarrod dead in the worst way, and they&#8217;ve hacked into the game to accomplish their goal. I don&#8217;t want to give any spoilers, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that.Luckbane was written by a friend of mine named Tony Breeden, and it&#8217;s his second novel (the first is called Johnny Came Home). Tony is a preacher too, although the book isn&#8217;t &#8220;preachy,&#8221; in the sense of trying to convince you to believe the same things as the author, nor are there any long expositions on the Christian faith. Jarrod professes to be a Christian, but there are only a few places where this seems to come into play, such as a very brief prayer for help. There are a few hints that there may be some more Christian elements coming later in the series. Perhaps the author is giving us a chance to see Jarrod grow in his faith (or walk away from it) as the series progresses.I picked up Luckbane a few days ago and rarely put it down. It is well written, action-packed (that&#8217;s an understatement), very original (to my knowledge), and really fun. If you enjoy fantasy, sci-fi, or action/adventure novels, or if you ever played role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons or Final Fantasy, Luckbane should be a great experience for you. Even if you aren&#8217;t into those genres and just want an original and fun read, pick up your copy of Luckbane today.Five stars. I can&#8217;t wait to read the sequel.

$REVIEW.: Some months ago I learned of Eric Wilson and his novels through another writer whose work I enjoy
I read one of Eric books and knew that I'd found a new favorite author

Since then I've had the pleasure of getting to know Eric through email when I contacted him letting him know how much I'd enjoyed that read


He only had one other book out at the time

Imagine my joy when he told me another one was releasing this year.Over time I learned more about this upcoming novel and became very interested
Last month this novel was released and The Best of Evil didn't disappoint

When I first learned it was written in first person, I have to admit, was a bit concerned

See, I don't like to read those kinds of books


Don't like to play those kinds of video games either


Strange seeing as how reviews like this are written in that very mode.Preferences aside, when you open The Best of Evil to the first page you become completely enveloped in the world of protagonist Aramis Black


Not your typical queaky clean sort, from an early age Aramis went on a downward spiral after seeing his mother murdered

He's carried a lot of baggage since then
One day he is almost killed himself and takes his survival of the incident as indication God is giving him a second chance


He moves to Nashville TN to live with his brother who wants to be a country star
He opens a coffee shop and names it Black's

His deceased mother had loved coffee

Everything's fine
Aramis seems to have out run his demons till one day a man is murdered at Black's and speaks the same dying words of Aramis's mother so long ago

This--along with a crazy idea from his brother--sets him on a course of action to learn the truth about his mother's death
And just how does it relate to the late Meriweather Lewis of the famed Lewis & Clark of American History?As my title to this review says, this novel is the best of Eric

Each novel he writes shows growth

His characters are more real and believeable then ever

His prose is as tight as a guitar string

No fluff at all
His weaving in of history--a staple of Eric's work--never takes you out of the story at hand


And for me, it actually felt more important to the story this time

Without the background of Meriweather Lewis, I don't believe you'd have the same novel.Eric weaves so many elements in this story, a lesser writer would have spun the story out of control


Not Eric


He takes such elements as murder, revenge, a classic novel read and loved by millions, a reality TV show, a family momento, country music and so much more and throws them in a pot, stirring them till a well rounded story comes out.The book is full of human emotion that you can feel

I could especially relate to Black's estrangement from a couple of family members
As well as the love/hate relationship of siblings and the awkwardness of new love
Even the emotion of having lost a mother
Though mine was not murdered, my mom passed just two years ago
I could feel Black's pain from his loss in many passages.The Best of Evil is, in deed, the best of Eric Wilson

I'm already anticipating the next in the Aramis Black series due out next year

$REVIEW.: I'd never read a M/M romance before this one.  There was a time when I thought I never would, but times change.  People change, and I'm glad they do!  Maybe that's why I could relate to Soulless.  It wasn't just about power and romance, it was about change.  OH, and sex.I don't want to give any spoilers, so I'll just say that if you are afraid of M/M romance, I hope you get over it.  This was a passionate, daring, exciting book.  Baggins is a fearless writer and her storytelling skills are nonpareil.  She has the unique ability to know what her audience wants, deliver it, and still bring surprise and the joy of discovery to the table.If you ever wished Jane Austen and Anne Rice had a book baby, then Baggins' Soulless is it.  Enjoy!
$SUMMARY.: Deliciously naughty

$review_text.: Choose Thin: 10 Proven Secrets To Permanent Weight Loss by Elle Garner takes the idea of empowerment about weight loss success stories to a new high. I am so tired of the Yo-Yo gain and loss cycle. I believe that this method will finally get me to cross those uncrossable permanent weight loss barriers I have struggled with for so long. Thank you for not promising everything and being realistic. Her story inspires me. Her step-by-step approach makes goals achievable. All the other books I have bought have told me it is easy. Ms. Garner isn't sugar-coating reality.

$review_text.: Howl of the Wolf, by Diane Rapp, is a well written story involving an indigenous pack of native `creatures' who live on planet Drako and call themselves `people'.  While those `people' maintain watch over all others on the planet; real humans arrive on Drako in an effort to escape a volatile `company' who rules over the star system.  The author's descriptions are immaculate.  This storyline is complex, fascinating, and a smooth read.  Time after time, new situations and characters are brought into the plot to surprise the reader.  It kept me guessing as to what would come next.  Aspects of the storyline include cloning and immortality; both at their greatest and their worst, and the `natives' on Drako are as interesting as it gets.  This is not a harsh read, so if you don't want blood, guts, or cursing in every sentence, but still crave excitement and intrigue, this is the sci-fi book you've been waiting for.  I recommend it to readers who are looking for something out of the ordinary.  I will be starting the second book of this series next week.  I can't wait to read more.  I loved it!

$REVIEW.: The story is very well told, with twists, changes, and unexpected introductions keeping it fresh throughout its 450 pages. Storm Dancer contains well-crafted scenes that are full of intrigue, emotion, and violence. While the core subject of Dahoud's possession, his djinn, commits acts of evil against women, they are not used for pure shock value, but are instead artfully included as part of the story as being a deep part of the plot.The subject matter may not be appropriate for some, but it is not gratuitously thrown about and is well-tended within the story line so that, frankly, only those adults with a background that may cause this subject to be traumatic are likely to have a problem with it.A very good read, this book travels quickly from page 1 to the final chapter. One of the better books of fantasy fiction I've read this year.

Taija Ford is continuing to look thru the research left behind by her grandfather and father. She runs across the journal that contains the case of The Haunting of Reginald Bonner. It seems as if after his wife's death, that strange things have started to taking place around the Bonner's home. Everyone has seemed to take notice, except for Reginald. Maybe he is unaware due to his emotional break down of his wife passing, the new child he has to raise, or the fact that he is too involved in himself to take notice. Either way, things start to take form, and he soon learns what has caused these unexplained occurrences, and that some grudges are taken to the grave. Will this new case help bring Taija closer to the answers she has been looking for?I love this series. The author has proved that she can tell a great ghost story.

$review_text.: Molly Harper by Emelle Gamble is a 2014 Posh Publication.  I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.When we last checked in, ( see the novella- Duets), with Molly Harper she was about to marry Ben, a handsome and popular movie star. Her best friend and former lover, Cruz, who  is about to be a father, was on his way to the wedding when he was in a terrible motorcyle accident.  We are also let in a secret.  Molly was adopted at birth and her parents never told her.  Her birth mother has found out that the Molly's biological father had MS and so did several other members of his family.  Anne must gather up her nerve and find Molly so she can inform her of her family's health history.Now the story picks up a few years later and Anne has gotten in touch with Norma, Molly's adoptive mother.  Cruz has mostly recovered from his accident, is trying to be good father to his son, despite the demise of his relationship with Char,  and Molly and Ben on are the verge of a divorce, due to Ben's constant cheating.Norma is in very fragile health and when she and Anne meet, Norma has a spell  and is taken to the hospital.  Anne finally sees Molly face to face and Molly really likes Anne. She still has no idea who she really is, but Anne's experience as a nurse gives Molly an idea.  Norma needs someone to help her out and Anne seems like the perfect choice.  Anne agrees to stop by and help Norma with her medications for awhile, which gives Anne and Norma a chance to bond.  The two women become friends.  Each has harbored secrets from their family for many years and for many reasons.  Anne's sons have no idea they have a half sister.  So, both women have a lot of explaining to do.Meanwhile, Molly is under terrific stress as she deals with the press and the end of her marriage on top of rumors that she could be pregnant.  Molly and Cruz are still in a state of limbo as Cruz stubbornly insist on remaining just friends and Molly is still helplessly and hopelessly in love with him.  On top of all that Molly is now experiencing some odd health issues and Norma is frantic believing Molly could have MS.As the sins and secrets of the past begin to seep out, the adult children of Anne and Norma attempt to absorb the shock.  But, Norma and Anne are not the only ones harboring secrets.  Molly may have a few secrets she needs to get off her chest as well.I rarely gush over a book these days.  I read at least one, sometimes two books a day and so I can be hard to move.  But, this one really got to me.  Trust me, you do not want to miss this one.  Molly Harper finally achieved the goal she set for herself, which was to become a successful actress.  While many believe movie stars live a charmed life, nothing could be further from the truth.  Molly deals with her dying mother, the revelation she is adopted, meeting her birth mother and two half brothers, the break up of her marriage, and the loss of the man who is her best friend and also the man she has been in love with since her teens, the  possiblity she could be pregnant or have a serious disease, all under the glaring spotlight of the media.I loved the bond and friendship that Anne and Norma forged.  Anne really liked Norma and vise versa.  It as a shame they met so late in life.  My heart did break for Molly on several counts,  her mother's health and the relationship with Cruz were the two most heartbreaking situations.  Cruz can be really frustrating.  I understand, but I don't.  I wanted to like him and I could relate to his feelings about Molly's career, but he seemed to have a hard time understanding that although Molly was an actress, she was capable of real human emotions.  He seemed to thing that everything Molly did or said was some kind of performance.  He didn't believe she ever really loved him.  That was a little hard to take. Cruz hurt Molly over and over  and over,  much more than Ben ever could.  All the same the limbo we feel Molly and Cruz are in is painful to read about.  But, Molly does have time to prioritize and thankfully she decides to examine the possibility of a relationship with Anne, although she isn't too keen on the idea at first.When all is said and done,  I felt like maybe Molly was on the right track with her life.  I don't know how her career will go ,  but her relationships are on a healthy path which should help remedy a lot of Molly's health problems.  You will need a big box of tissues nearby when you read this one.  Emelle really outdid herself with this novel.  I loved every single page and lived every single moment right along with the characters.  This is good stuff!!!P.S. - there were some &#34;Easter eggs&#34; hidden in the book too! If you have read  &#34;Secret Sister&#34;, you will know what I mean- I loved that!A++  (5 stars)

$REVIEW.: Giant corporations like U.S

Steel, Alcoa, Kaiser, Monsanto et al
conspired with the government to stop people from protecting themselves from lethal and crippling fluoride poisoning perpetrated directly by these companies

Sounds farfetched? It's not


Award-winning journalist Christopher Bryson's book is not only rigorously researched and scrupulously footnoted, but his expose of deliberately planned covering-up and obfuscation of fluoride's dangers to human health (as well as to animals and plants) is backed by numerous reputable scientists, including those fully qualified to know the inside story


I think this is categorically the worst story of corporate crimes against humanity that I've ever read about or heard of


 On a personal note, my father worked as a section chief on the Manhattan Project at Columbia University during World War Two


 He used to tell a "funny" anecdote about how the scientists would flee clouds of escaped fluoride gas by climbing out the window and onto the window ledge outside the building, where they'd wait for the gas to dissipate


 Less "funny" was his observation that gas would condense into liquid on the window ledge and drip onto the sidewalk below, in some cases drilling a hole in the skull of an unfortunate victim passerby

Since fluoride remains in the human body and accumulates, I can't help wondering if my father's severe cognitive problems later in his life might have originated in this early exposure to this dangerous poison
Whether or not the cause-and-effect can be proved in his case, it is obvious from the overwhelming evidence presented in Bryson's book, that countless cases of dreadful human suffering, tragedy and death have been indeed clearly caused by fluoride poisoning, and much of this suffering could have been prevented if U.S

Steel, Alcoa and the other corporate criminals had not deliberately obscured the truth


 What good has been accomplished by the Cold-War-justified military industrial complex?  And what evil?

$REVIEW.: I love Gary Fry's style of writing, particularly with his shorter works
 This story centers around Jane, an unmarried, pregnant model, with a strong Christian upbringing

 While there are certainly some extremely unsettling moments in this novella (the house that she modeled at was particularly good!), the story then moved into some more &#34;common areas&#34; that took a bit away from that intensity, IMO

 I didn't find Jane's character particularly believable as she kept contradicting herself on her own beliefs throughout


 Overall, I feel that if more had been said about the history of the Catching family, and the location more centered in the area of the ancestral home, this would have been much stronger novella.

$review_text.: One reads in magazines and such about satanic rituals where children are used and even sometimes killed as a sacrifice, but these articles are usually written from a hear-say point of view.  This story is written by a woman who as a little girl cleaning in the basement of a church with two little girlfriends was captured by three men with masks on their faces and taken somewhere else in the church.  She remembers seeing an upside down cross and a bed and you assume she was subjected to a satanic ritual since she says she was married to Satan.This child is the daughter of a drunken Irishman and a Cree mother who works to support the family.  She has a brother Gilbert but throughout most of the story, she feels unloved and unwanted by either parent, who are in and out of her life as she grows.  Without any adult supervision, she makes a Ouija board out of a piece of paper with the letters and "yes" and "no" and she communicates with an entity who answers her questions, calling himself Fred.  She can never find out whether Fred is an angel or a devil and she constantly lives in fear because she feels Fright and eyes always observing her.  She prays to God to help her and she gets an answer that she will be free when she is big, which to her means age eighteen.  She eventually introduces her teenage friends to the Ouija board and while she is in high school they go to a meditation class, where she works very hard to reach the source of white light that the instructor orally visualizes for the class.  But one night she becomes possessed, frightens the rest of the class and is banned from attending again.  Her life doesn't get any better and the story ends abruptly because there is a book 2 forthcoming.Had Deide come across a true spiritual psychic who worked with possessed individuals, she probably could have been freed of these evil spirits and perhaps that is what is to come in Book 2.  Although Deide did a fine job of writing her story, because she wrote it as she experienced it, sometimes I was a little confused as to the events transpiring. This is a book worth reading for its insight into a world not usually acknowledged or experienced by the general public and is either ignored or feared by the Christian churches to help such individuals.  I recommend it to those who seek to broaden their knowledge of the world of such negativity and evil.

$REVIEW.: I have read all the 'Moreno Brother's series', the 'Fate Book' spinoff, and the first two books in this series, which involved both 'Noah' & 'Gio's' stories. I have loved every single one of them. And while this was a very good addition to this series, I thought it was lacking a little something that would have made it a great read. In other words...I didn't love it as much as all of the other books she'd written in the past. This book sort of drug on a bit too long in certain parts of the story, and I thought there was a little too much internal dialogue that had become very repetitive at times.I did however love the whole story itself. The characters were believable, the story itself was really believable, and all the situations that took place in the story were very believable.I totally loved Hector. He was a very strong character in this book, but he could also be so warm hearted, tender, and a very caring person when he needed to be, too.Charlee on the other hand, came off as a very vulnerable child like character. She was always ready to run away at the slightest little thing that might go wrong. It seems like she was this way through-out most of this story. Yes...she had been badly hurt years before, but she needed to just get over it and move on.Maybe that's why I didn't like this story as much as I did the other ones. I'm used to Elizabeth's female character's being so much stronger. All of her other heroine's had major problems of their own to deal with, but none of them sat around feeling sorry for themselves as much as Charlee did. I love my H/H both to be strong willed and ready to take on the world, if need be.There were a lot of twists and turns in the story, that I really didn't see coming though, and I really like that. A LOT!!Would I recommend this book? Yes! It may not have been as good as the others this author has written in the past, but it's still a very good read.

$REVIEW.: Slave by Sherri Hayes is a unique look into two characters, Stephan and Brianna in the BDSM world


 Stephan a  Dom for 5 years has acquired, no purchased, Brianna, who has been a slave to Ian for the past 18 months

 Stephan considers his Dom lifestyle as a roleplay but for Brianna, her slavery is not an act, it is her reality


Stephan should this slave purchase be revealed, Stephan's career in the philanthropic world would be over
 Despite this danger, Stephan chooses to keep Brianna, who is damaged, broken and has been abused severely in the past by Ian


 Brianna has been trained to be a slave, thinks of herself as a slave and doesn't think of life outside the world she now belongs
 From the beginning Stephan wants to help Brianna to heal and knows that his Dominant lifestyle is a blessing and a curse for them


 Within the world of slave and master, Stephan begins to show Brianna what a difference a little bit of trust can make in her life
Stephan is patient, consistent and compassionate to Brianna

 He devotes his life to giving her self-confidence back by providing her options in her world


 What an amazing amount of dedication and devotion he gives to Brianna to help her while depriving himself of the sexual component of his Dom lifestyle

 The reader knows by the point of view switch every chapter or so, that Stephan is extremely attracted to Brianna but knows that what he really wants is the real Brianna, not the trained submissive and Stephan's sexual components of BDSM is is put on hold to Brianna's her broken life

 I began to wonder how Stephan would make love to her, in his special room or outside the lifestyle entirely

 Brianna seems to lack the thoughts and opinions of an individual, she seems innocent and pure despite her terrifying life with Ian (and possibley before that)

 I cannot imagine swallowing every question I might have or not having an opinion of my own, but this is what Brianna has been trained very well to do

 It is both frustrating and intriguing
 The attraction forming between Stephan and Brianna was hotter than many sex scenes I have read
 It is erotica without explicit sex, it is BDSM without the BDSM!  This book was concieved outside the normal constraints of some of these genres and I could not put this book down
 Well done Sherri Hayes! I truly enjoyed this book

I look forward to reading more!


$SUMMARY.: Not your typical Erotica BDSM book! Absolutely intriguing!

$REVIEW.: [Full disclosure: I received a free ebook from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.]First off, please don't judge Kiya: Hope of the Pharaoh by the tacky cover

 The story is so much better, I promise.Since so little is known about the real Kiya (we don't even know if she really was Tutankhamun's mother), I'm willing to suspend my disbelief at the premise of her being Hebrew
 Okay, fair enough


 Most theories place her as Nubian, but they're just theories and I thought the whole premise of Naomi offering herself to Akhenaten to save her sisters was just too good to pass up

 After being presented with an Egyptian name, Naomi embarks upon a dangerous journey through the intrigues of a dysfunctional court and an even more dangerous harem.Now, this great premise would have been ruined if Katie Hamstead's characterization wasn't as strong as it is
 Naomi/Kiya carries the whole story on her shoulders as she learns to feel affection for and maybe even love Akhenaten, a man she was always taught was evil
 She also makes friends and enemies in the harem, the most notable being her rival, Nefertiti
 Or rather, Nefertiti considers Naomi her rival and the lengths she goes to in order to preserve her place as Great Royal Wife are incredible


 Whenever I picture the real Nefertiti, I can't help but imagine her as the vain, ridiculously beautiful, scheming woman Katie Hamstead has portrayed
 Other notable characters of the time like the ruthless, but oddly considerate Horemheb feel spot-on to me
 The characters don't always appear to be consistent, but the big reveals throughout the story show that they were acting believably the whole time.The details of ancient Egyptian life are generally accurate, although Katie Hamstead used the modern name of Amarna to refer to Akhetaten
 But Akhenaten's fits, the fact he discarded the old religion in favour of one god and his utter lack of desire to make war are well documented and I couldn't spot any glaring factual errors

 In writing about Akhenaten, Katie Hamstead had quite a bit of leeway as there are very, very few records from the time
 Still, I can't complain about the historical accuracy.As for the plot, it was quite fast-paced for historical fiction and kept me reading into the early hours of the morning, far past when I should have gone to bed

 It was really that good

 Naomi was just a fascinating character and her confusion about Malachi and Akhenaten, her hot-cold friendship with Horemheb and the constant threat of Nefertiti's jealousy kept me on my toes the whole time

 Some of the plot twists were predictable, but others (especially at the end) I didn't see coming
 Especially the big reveal at the end involving a certain male character.It's that big reveal that makes me want the next book this instant
 Although we know generally what happens to Akhenaten and Naomi's son Tutankhamun from history, I just can't get enough of Naomi
 She's definitely one of my new favourite characters and I've just found a new author to watch because if Kiya: Hope of the Pharaoh is any indicator, we can expect great things from Katie Hamstead.I give this book 5/5 stars.

The book is much more than I expected, which means that I'm going to read it again. I highly recommend it to all my friends, and everyone else on the hunt to meet-up with heart-pounding dates. It's as fun to read as it is inspiring.

$REVIEW.: Ashleigh Taylor gives birth to twin daughters while she's in Long Beach visiting her father figure, Charles Stuart, the founder of Bentley's Royale. Hours after her birth, Cassie is kidnapped. She has an identical twin, Callie. The setting is the 1990's. TWISTED WEBS is the sequel to WEBS of POWER. I recommend reading it first.Darlene Quinn probes the shock, despair, anger and frustration of parents suddenly missing a child and the long-term effects on a family that has been victimized by such an event. The novel also continues the story lines of Paige Toddman's reunion with her mother and Viviana DeMornay's secret. The main focus of the book is the abduction of Cassie from the hospital right after her birth and how this terrible crime affects their lives.I loved the action and "twists" of the tale, but not sure how I felt about the ending.  It makes you think about being judgmental before you have all the facts. The characters are shown from varied points of view.  It held my interest. It is a saga, and I tend to read these books more slowly - absorbing the characters and the story - trying to understand the dynamics of the family. This family has good days and bad days. There is a lot of family interaction. The corporate world is represented by large department store conglomerates as they compete for customers and manipulate the market. The focus of TWISTED WEBS is mostly the family - how they cope, and their resilience. Darlene Quinn is a gifted story teller/author. I heartily recommend this book and I look forward to the next book in the series.ARC received from the Greenleaf Book Group LLC and NetGalley.

$REVIEW.: Bottom line: Bare bones, extremely straightforward story of initiation into BDSM, flavored with a little romance and interrelationship and group politics for tension. The story mirrors a conventional male/female love story, with the submissive introducing the dominant to tenderness, as opposed to impersonal sex.Trigger warnings: Frank, explicit descriptions of BDSM activities, including bondage, suspension, canings, whippings, and being penetrated while bound, as while as being required to give oral sex while bound. Questionable consent, with character emotionally manipulated into giving blanket consent without knowing the details of what she consents to; power and mind games used to maintain consent. Breaking and entering of a home. Being bound and abandoned for an extended time.How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? The story is set in the present, but no characters (not even minor characters) are men. Some of the BDSM players and relationships mirror conventional gender roles. If you see BDSM as inherently sexist, then the story is inherently sexist.Does it have explicit sex scenes?: Yes, throughout. All sex scenes are matter-of-fact and sparse, but clear. Few scenes go into really out-there BDSM techniques; the only one that comes to mind for me is a suspension scene. Safer sex is *never* mentioned, which was my major complaint with the sex scenes. Safewords are also never mentioned.Would I read it again? No, probably not. I wouldn't yell if I had to.Would I publish it? Yes, though I'd charge less for it than I paid. It's a read-and-toss one-shot romance novel.

$review_text.: You have to accept that certain things happen if you marry a tortured soul. Being in a family whose older sibling has a huge couple of secrets is no fun either.  Spoiler alert--a coordinated child, who is rather good at ballet, falling off of a swing the first time she gets on it is strange and burying a body that's been a week dead and animals have been at it, test my reasoning skills.  Daffodils are not known to have a lot of pollen, and yet, like the daffodils, so many other things in this book just begged for a willing suspension of disbelief.  This was a fair to okay first novel in the fiction category but it was a bit much with all kinds if issues jam-packed into it.

$REVIEW.: I found the first book to be a light, fast read with an almost YA feel to it

To say the second book is darker is a big understatement


There are numerous scenes of graphic violence, which was not an issue for me, but might be with some readers
It also took a more determined effort to finish it


As the plot started to deviate more and more from ordinary reality, I found it harder to suspend my disbelief
Also, I found the characters to be more abstract, losing the flesh-and-blood feel they had in the first book


Finally, I found some of the decisions made by the characters not believable

Despite those reservations, I did enjoy the book, though not quite as much as the first one
I will read the third one when it becomes available.

$review_text.: OK, I realize that Warhammer novels are not exactly tops on the list for deep characters, but this novel brings 2 dimensional characters to a new low. I'd call them 1 dimensional in this book. Iron-Father Gdolkin, the main character, apparently has only one emotion...anger. He is angery at this guy, angery at that guy, angery at this situation, angery at that situation...blah blah blah. I suspect he is even angery at his rice crispies in the morning - I say it like that because it was getting tedious that he was angery at every single encounter. Other then that Gdolkin was as flat as can be. He began to get on my nerves about a third of the way through the book.Other characters were simple paper cut outs to be killed, shot up or used as extras as the situation warranted. The plot was spelled out very early in the book, but quickly became boring. The enemy presented no real challenges and Gdolkin always has the right answer for everything...boring!!! Interactions between side characters was laughable. The writting was also very clumsy.Ya, I was hard on this book. Let me finish on a bright note. Mr Green's knowledge of the 40K universe was very good and he did a nice job of using the different aspects of the 40k universe. That plus the ending was a little different is why I gave it 2 stars.

$review_text.: A cutesy romance between a "mean" boss and an optimistic woman. It's a fun read and because I am likely to read it again someday it gets 4 stars.HOWEVER, this is truly romance lite: kisses and admiring glances only; the characters do not have a lot of depth. Everything is very superficial so even though I enjoyed it, I do want to warn other readers about the fluffiness of this book and the just short of cloyness of its sweet plot and characters.It's not substantial. But the price is low. It's a piece of cotton candy. So please do not expect more.

$review_text.: I have read all of Ann Cleeves' Vera Stanhope and the Shetland Island novels and I am an enthusiastic fan of her writing.  Therefore, I was excited to embark on a new series with Detective Ramsay. Overall, I enjoyed the novel -- it is a solid, well-plotted mystery with quirky but realistically drawn characters.  Ramsay is a bit of an odd duck -- an insightful detective but a bit of a bland enigma personally.  Interestingly, he knows it -- all too well.  His wife has left him; his colleagues don't like him and he spends a lot of time wondering if he'd be a more effective detective (and less lonely) if he could only phrase his questions differently, be a bit kinder, understand people better  -- you get the idea.  He is aloof, often abrupt, but fundamentally decent.  His approach is balanced by his "Jack-the-lad" sergeant who seems not to lack an ounce of confidence and bravado, though he could do with a bit more judgment.  Still, with regard to solving the mystery of who killed the nasty headmaster of a village school in Northumbria (and equally importantly, why he was killed), neither Ramsay or Sgt. Hunter are making much progress.  It takes the grizzled, canny school caretaker and his daughter Patty, a bored but clever village housewife, to extract key information from the insular and secretive inhabitants.  The result of their sleuthing reveals the sordid reality behind the oh-so-respectable veneer of village life and expose the repressions required to maintain the "respectability." What I really admire about Cleeves' approach in this series is her willingness to play with her successful writing formula.  This offering has an experimental quality to it.  Gone are the deep psychological probings of her Vera series, and the examination of the crime from different characters' points of view.  Thus, A Lesson in Dying is a shorter, leaner read.  Cleeves gets down to the basic elements of a good mystery novel -- clever plot, fine characterizations, evocative atmosphere -- but by relying on Jack and Patty to further the investigation, the author is playing with the elements in a fresh way.  There is also a cozy element to this novel that I like -- the atmosphere, the confined space of the setting, the almost genteel aspect of the storyline (relative to the grittier, violent, and more outre novels of, for example, Val McDermid). For my money, Jack Robson is a great character and makes this novel sparkle, while Det. Ramsay is hard to warm up to. I'm wondering if Cleeves intends to develop his character incrementally and show him using the insights he gains about himself in order to grow as a person and as a detective.  I hope so -- that would be fascinating to me.  Thus, I look forward to reading the next offering in the series.
$review_summary.: A good new series by Cleeves,

It contains an introduction and ten stories.- "Introduction" by the author tells the history of his Dread Empire efforts.- "Soldier of an Empire Unacquainted with Defeat" (Berkley Showcase, 1980) is about a deserter from the Demon Guard who is looking for a new life.- "The Nights of Dreadful Silence" (Fantastic Stories, 1973) considers the perils of cheating a sorcerer.- "Finding Svale's Daughter" (first publication) puts Svale into a risky situation.- "Ghost Stalk" (F&SF;, 1978) is the first Vengeful Dragon story, in which an Itaskian sorcerer hunts for the pirate ship.- "Filed Teeth" (Dragons of Darkness, 1981) reveals the quest of a former Itaskian sorcerer.- "Castle of Tears" (Whispers, 1979) follows Bragi on a search for the daughter of Duke Greyfells.- "Call for the Dead" (F&SF;, 1980) is the second Vengeful Dragon story, in which a powerful sorcerer brings the ship and crew back for a mission.- "Severed Heads" (Sword & Sorceress, 1984) takes a headstrong woman after a rapist.- "Silverheels" (Witchcraft & Sorcery, 1971) was slightly revised to make it a Dread Empire story, but is still about a daring kitten.- "Hell's Forge" (first publication) is a new Vengeful Dragon story, in which the gods recall the crew for an unusual task.These tales come from the author's earlier works that led to -- and supplement -- theDread Empirenovels.  The Dread Empire novels are being reprinted after decades of neglect.  Yet only few fans knew of his short stories.  More short works are collected inWinter Dreams.These stories also demonstrate the author's skills in combat stories as well as humorous prose.  Of course, any fan of theBlack CompanyandGarrett Filesseries would recognize these aspects of his style.Highly recommended for Cook fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of magical talents, human perseverance, and a touch of romance.

Then, I saw A Dirty Book Affair was doing a Book Blitz and I had the books and were going to review them so I thought why not. I have to say, unlike some series this book is as good if not better than the first one! I definately give it 5 stars!! It is about Jamie, who is a coworker and best friend with Amelia (who's story was in Distant Myles), and takes place after Amelia finds her true love. After reading the Amelia's story I wanted to know all about Jamie and her past and life!! This did not disappoint! I got to learn more about Jamie and see her fall in love with the man of her dreams...or was it the man of her past? A New Face to Love kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing what would happen next! I fell in love with the characters and definately have my favorite (Caleb). I love how she wrote the love triangle between Jamie, Caleb and Garrit. Definately go to Amazon and order this amazing love story!!! I promise you it will not disappoint you! I honestly have zero complaints about this story. Just so you know there is sex in it so I do not recommend it to anyone under the age 18! But if you are over 18 BUY IT!!!!!

$review_text.: 'A strange light appears in the night sky above the Cherviots. A mist descends, shrouding the hills and valleys. Is it a natural phenomenon or something more sinister?'Sarah had planned to be at a friends house for the night and her two daughters were to stay with a neighbor until her husband Pete returned to pick them up. He and three of his field workers had gone up to Top Meadow to check on Pete's sheep herd. But, unknown to Pete, his daughter Jose came down with a sore throat and Sarah decided to stay home with her children.Sarah had tried to call Pete to tell him that she was with the children but couldn't get through. The only sound coming through her cell phone was static. Apparently the hills were blocking the signal. Sarah wasn't that concerned knowing that Laura would tell Pete that the kids were with her at home. But as the hours passed, Sarah started to worry about Pete absence. It was getting late and he always called when knew he would be delayed. As she stood outside their home watching for his headlights to come up the road, she noticed a strange light hovering over the valley. As the light died out a green mist rolled in. Fear rose in Sarah as she stood watching. Everything was so still and quiet. Nothing was moving, not even the cows in the field. As Sarah's fears increased she went in to check on her sleeping daughters. They had slept through the whole phenomenon but to ease some of her worry and fear she decided to spend the night in their room. Surely, by the time morning came, Pete would be in their own room sound asleep.The next morning Pete was still missing. Sarah phoned her friends and neighbor in hopes that someone would know something about, not just Pete, but also the lights from the night before. But her calls were unanswered. In hopes of finding someone to ease her fears for Pete, she loads the girls into her car and headed down to the valley. She hadn't gone far when she runs across Dave. Dave had been with Pete the day before and informs her that Pete, as well as everyone else from the valley, is dead. While telling her his story, Sarah started noticing that his flesh was melting from his body. His dying words to her is a warning to not touch anything nor anyone.In Sarah's attempt to find someone to help her and explain what has happened she drives to the next town to speak with the police there. Andy, the young constable on duty, actually believes she has lost her mind as she describes what she has seen. But when his superior comes in and hears about the death of Dave, who is one of his best friends, he heads to the valley to check it out for himself. As Sarah and Andy wait for his return, the military show up with full protective suits and weapons. And when they asked for Sarah by name, something tells Andy that he should take Sarah's story seriously. He also fears for her safety with these men and tells the Sergeant that Sarah had gone back to her home and that the woman and children there with him are his own wife and kids. As the military unit leaves, he convinces Sarah that their life in in danger and they must leave immediately before they come back.Follow Sarah and Andy as they are chased by the military all the way to London. See what happens when two unexpected people show up in London after surviving the light and mist. And find out exactly what The Trojan Project really is, who created it and why.When I was a child, my family moved to Utah. I remember two nights that a neighbor came to warn us of the lights in the sky. The first night she knocked on our door around midnight. She was yelling and crying, trying to tell us there was a burning ball of light in the sky. The next night she came to tell us there was a burning rod of fire in the sky. Both nights we all went outside to see these lights for ourselves. And both nights we saw exactly what she saw. I can remember being scared but I couldn't take my eyes off the lights as they moved across the sky. Later we were told the lights were experimental air crafts being tested by the military. I never really believed that story, but after reading The Trojan Project, I think I believe it now .Great book. It will make you stop and wonder what really goes on behind our backs and how much is covered up forever.

$REVIEW.: No ifs, buts, or maybes about it: I love food!I think of myself as somewhat of an epicurean and I delight in trying new and unusual things.I love the sensation that excellently prepared food delivers to the senses

It can really be a supreme and even sensual experience.And I'm not talking about a Boston cream donut!There is however one thing that I'm pretty sure I don't want from this pleasurable relationship.And that's for my food to deliberately want to kill me.I'm not talking about hunting it first in a savage jungle with hoards of spiders and snakes in the way to getting the beast onto my plate.I am talking about the simple act of the food sitting there in the plate and imagining it smirking at me while whispering: &#34;Bite me!&#34;This story is precisely about someone, a food critic no less, who decides that the potentially mind blowing experience of savouring food hell bent on destroying him from the inside out is worthwhile.If you have ever wondered what it might be like to sit in front of a plate of &lt;A HREF="http://haacked.com/images/Fugu.jpg">fugu fish&lt;/a>, then read this excellent story and witness the turmoil of the critic as he goes through the whole experience from beginning to end!You might reconsider your culinary choices in life.

Beginning with the Magna Carta of 1215 and ending with the The Four Freedoms of 1941 these documents speak to what America is about, what it should be, and what it can be.The Kindle version is fine.  Many reviewers stated that there was no Table Of Contents.  There is one.  Press 'Menu'. Then press the 'Beginning' link.  After this scroll BACKWARDS and you will be taken to the TOC.  The TOC works because I tried it at random on every book.Most readers are of course familiar with these documents but having them in one easy to use format is a gift of great value.  Reading these scrolls off and on serves as a good reminder to any citizen of his/her rights AND responsibilities.  Excellent job by the publisher and a superb bargain.

$review_text.: Let me begin by saying I wouldn't consider myself a David Byrne/Talking Heads fan
 I deeply admire and respect Mr


Byrne as an artist and he would be the kind of person I could listen to ramble on hours about music


 Well, this is the closest I'll ever get to that conversation
 Be forewarned, those looking for a tell-all about his time with Talking Heads or as a solo musician will be generally disappointed, I found his personal anecdotes generally the weakest part of the book
 This did not make me want to rediscover his works the way Keith Richards' Life had me digging through every Rolling Stones record ever made.What this book offers are fascinating musings, anecdotes and his personal thoughts (infused with his dry wit) on music that made it difficult to put the book down for any length of time

 The writer of Psycho Killer discusses psychoacoustics (the study of how the brain perceives sounds), how Bing Crosby's love for golf advanced recording technology, and how the record companies' greed forced MTV to stop broadcasting videos and get into the reality TV business.I think there are flaws in this book but from one of the most cerebral musicians working today, it is still a great read and one I'm telling every musician and music geek I know to read this book!

Sort of read like a high school soap opera


I enjoy female characters that are bigger and more realistic
And love reading about the men who like the curvy woman


But the men in this are extreme on both ends of the scale

They are big macho men but 2 seconds later teary little wussies...


that makes it a hard read but I have a tendency to over look some rough plots to have a couple funny one liners and steamy scenes.

$REVIEW.: It was the basic premise of this ebook that interested me.As a thriller this ebook works well, generates tension and generally moves along at a good pace with just the right amount of action and tension. Our hero Tom seems to be a mixture of many things and is delightfully more energetic and interesting than I would anticipate his real life counterpart to be. That probably says a lot more about my personal opinion of top academics, in that I can see them being extremely intelligent and dedicated but running around in a breathless race against time, not so much. I am thinking more Ricky Gervais than Tom Cruise I suppose.As a scientific conspiracy it also works pretty well. There are some good historical perspectives and scene setting that lift the book and give a nice feel to the experience. As with any book of this nature there are aspects that go into the areas of fantastic speculation that will irritate some people and for other will be an integral part of the tension building. There was one surfing vignette that, whilst nicely written, seemed to stick out from the rest of the story and slowed the plot for a few pages, it caught me so off guard that I thought I had accidently switched files on my Kindle.As a part of a larger debate, about the possible implications of dabbling with the basic building blocks of nature and the potential devastating implications if an admittedly extremely low probability event would occur, this work can bring something. Like the plethora of natural disaster and man-made disaster action movies, The God Particle is great entertainment with a serious theme if you want it.In the end though we should not forget the irony that CERN was also the birthplace of the internet which allows us to spread this message.

$REVIEW.: The book description and cover sold me on this book
 I definitely wasn&#8217;t disappointed.I totally did not expect the book to begin as it did and I realized I had perhaps underestimated this author a bit.Set in Norway we  are introduced to our main character (Kristoffer)  and within minutes he is surprised to see in front of him his love (Eva) from twelve years previous.After the chance encounter, Eva is on Kristoffer&#8217;s mind a lot


 He has zero clues as to where she lives in town or why she has returned
 The author crafts this part of the story well and the conversations Kristoffer has with others while often about mundane matters, paint a good picture for the reader regarding Kristoffer and the sort of person he is.This is a story about love, love lost and love found

 It is also a story about people changing (and not changing) over the years and secrets kept and then revealed.This isn&#8217;t &#8220;just&#8221; a romance


 It is a profoundly complex story which is often how life is- complex and full of many, many moments- some quite ordinary and some life changing.Highly recommend this book.

I am not a professional athlete, even not very outstanding amateur one, but challenges, moral, scientific and physical that are described in Tim's works inspire me for my own personal experiments. Life is a never ending experiment itself, and this is the only way to make it full and satisfying.The book is an outstanding summary of Tim's works. Those who have not read any of his titles are highly recommended to begin from this one.Those who (like me) are his constant readers and followers in Internet, will find new and eventually forgotten parallels between his works, plenty of facts, as well as numerous tweaks, memories and latest updates. Also, plenty of information was never published in one place and worth reading in any case.

$REVIEW.: I have some really mixed feelings about this book. I loved the main characters, Sam and Matt and Matt's family, but with the rest of the characters I always felt like I was missing something, was maybe a step behind somehow. As other reviewers have stated, the book is hard to get into. I kept track. I was lost until 22% into my Kindle. The story was told from one of three characters, back and forth, so by the time I felt I was getting comfortable with the background of one character, the story would switch to another and I was lost once again. Some of the chapters were even just a couple sentences in length before I was pulled back into a different plot yet again. I know the author wanted to let the reader in on the secrets of Limberlost bit by bit, but what ended up happening with me was that I was losing parts of the story bit by bit. At the end of the book there were questions I did not have answers to that I am sure were buried within the pages somewhere.The only reason I am giving the book three stars is because of the two main characters, Sam and Matt. Pearson did a wonderful job in giving Sam a unique personality, a woman who can take care of herself in any situation, and she became larger than life as the story progressed. I was wishing more of the book involved her. Matt alone probably would not have been as interesting, but the teaming up of Matt with Sam made for an exciting chase scene and ending to the book as the story of the many different characters was being woven together for the reader. Unfortunately, by end I must have missed some important clues along the way and by the very end, all I cared about was where the book would leave Sam and Matt in their lives.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for a review.

$review_text.: There are hundreds, maybe thousands of books that purport to be the key to becoming a leader.  But what is a leader?  Yes, it is obvious that someone like Winston Churchill in the Second World War was a leader.  So was George Washington.  The leadership supplied by world leaders in government, religion, and even in business is apparent to all.  However, leadership also matters in your local school board, the department where you work, and especially in your family.  Is there a difference between good and bad leadership?  Yes, and it is different than being an effective or ineffective leader.  You can lead effectively and lead people down the wrong path.  David Traversi has given us a book that presents eight principles that he believes drive the ability of a leader to effect the changes he or she desires to make.  It is your ability to be effective in making the changes needed to implement your vision that measure your impact as a leader.Traversi uses a very interesting visual device to communicate how each of these drivers enables the key traits of leadership.  He calls this the Leadership Dashboard, and I think it helps make his point quite well.  As each of the eight traits are presented, and updated dashboard is also given to help you see how it will rev up various traits.The eight drivers are: presence, openness, clarity, intention, personal responsibility, intuition, creativity, and connected communications.  Don't suppose that you already know what these drivers mean even though these are simple words that seem to have fairly obvious definitions.  The author takes us through each of the drivers with stories from his own life, his work as a coach, businessman, and familyman. His goal is to inspire and enlighten and never to try motivating you with threats or fear of failing.  Instead, he wants to invite you to become more in each of these areas, and I like this very much.  Sometimes he gets a bit New Age or Zen for my taste in the early chapters, but never mind that, what he is saying is still quite sound.Chapter 9 includes a 360 degree, 42 question assessment that you can also download online.  The chapter includes information on whom to have take the assessment to help you, how to score the assessment and what the various scores mean.  There is also a section listing the benefits you will realize by implementing these 8 drivers and having more impact as a leader.I liked the book and if you are a leader in some aspect of your life and want to become more effective and more comfortable in your role, this book has good advice you can consider and use as you see fit.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI

Fostered away from her home after her parents are murdered, she doesn't know if her sister survived until a stranger named Gregor has come to bring her to the Druids Glen.  There she must help carry out the Prophecy and unfortunately face the sister she thought abandoned her.  The MacNeil, however, has other plans and doesn't want the Prophecy carried out.  He must kill one of the sisters!  Making the journey should allow him the chance to kill Fiona before she returns to her sisters.  Thankfully, Fiona has Gregor to help her and guide her on her journey.  Yet, she doesn't travel her destiny alone. Gregor isn't just someone to deliver her home. He plays a bigger role than he even believes.Talk about a magical journey! Highland Nights is one of those stories you just never want to see end!  I enjoyed this book and its many characters immensely!  The Druids Glen series is one of those series that is a treat to read.  Donna Grant is a unique writer who can tell a story and pull you into every single aspect of the world.

$REVIEW.: High Treason is an excellent book. It is exceptionally well written and the plots within are very interesting. The whole book has so much going on all the time it's hard to put down once you have started.In a make believe world on fictitious planets the author creates the most believable society.They are corrupt, incestuous, driven by class system, the love for money and status. Social comments are everywhere in this book and a grim picture emerges that mirrors the real world.This is entertainment however and there is such humor throughout the book that the horror is offset.The story begins with a party held for the son of the Emperor and straight away the tension begins. There is a magician entertainer at the party who uses a guillotine in his act, and the reader is drawn into the suspense of the trick feeling all the time something is going to go wrong.The action is thick and fast, horrifying, bizarre and completely engrossing.Amongst the main plots of murder, subterfuge, rape, and attacks are the sub plots of love affairs and court jealousies. The book has you horrified for the wrongly accused Cassia, laughing at and with the character Hammer, who has been waiting twelve years for the woman in his arranged marriage to have sex with him. You become desperate for Mysior who really does love Hammer to have a chance with him and watch the case perverted against an innocent girl with growing unease, knowing that the powers that be hold all the cards.There are some hilarious happenings and phrases. Amongst my favorites is when Hammer visits a woman he knows to give her news of a dead friend; his motives are not entirely pure and the scene is made funny by the woman calling him Hammy his response, "Hammer or Hamm please" he said in disgust. Another funny comment was made by the magician when interviewed by the lawyer Mysior, he asks her if she had ever considered being a magician's assistant after looking at her great legs.This society's irreverent attitude to sex is hilarious and even though there are some raw sexual moments in the book, they are very funny.The way Hammer has to be stunned by his faithful employee Slops is fun even though there is social comment behind it because Hammer loses his temper at the ill treatment of others. I am still chuckling at the way Hammer shoots at a furnace.This is such a good book, if you are looking for action, adventure, intrigue, romance, and fun amongst some serious threads this is the book to choose. It has to be a five star book.

$review_text.: The idea behind The Generals series is to paint a brief picture of the personal lives of these prominent men in history. While a relatively short biography (223 pages in this case) cannot begin to truly do justice to a man such as George Washington, it can serve to provide a decent overview while whetting the appetite for more information.Washington: A Legacy of Leadership deals very briefly with Washington's early life before launching into a rather academic retelling of his military pursuits in the French and Indian War. Most of the remainder of the book deals with Washington's involvement in the events that led to the Revolutionary War and in the war itself. The book ends with a chapter on Washington's presidency, and then wraps up with a few words related to his long-lasting legacy.As a biography, Washington: A Legacy of Leadership is rather weak. As mentioned previously, his personal life is only lightly explored, and very little is mentioned of his marriage or interactions with his wife and children. While Washington's character is explored in relation to his military decision-making processes and interactions, very little of his personality is explored to serve as a background to his military character. Having read several other biographies of George Washington, I know there is much more to the personal life of this great man than was even eluded to in Washington.I believe this book would be better classified as an overview of the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars with an emphasis on George Washington's contribution than as a biography. From that perspective, Washington is a good resource. Were I recommending a good biography, however, this book would not make the list.This book was sent to me by Book Sneeze in exchange for my honest review. A favorable review was not required.

$review_text.: I had the privilege of seeing Heidi Baker with Michal Ann Goll at a Women On The Frontlines conference and she made a lasting impression. She is a straight-forward, genuine, sold-out woman in love with her Savior, and she makes no secret of it. I have never encountered anyone with as much compassion as Heidi Baker possesses. This book is a wake up call to every individual who &#34;calls&#34; themselves &#34;Christian&#34;. Heidi ministers to &#34;the least of these&#34; as if every single one is her own. Her story impacts our comfort zone and challenges us to do more, be more of what we claim to be as &#34;Christians&#34;. It would be a privilege and a blessing to work with this lady! She has touched multitudes with her life and I highly recommend this read to anyone who is tired of complacency in their life, or is just in need of an attitude adjustment. Heidi's story will linger within your heart and cause you to want to be more.

$review_text.: Every girl wishes for the perfect wedding day, even Jen but her one true love Rich starts pulling away just a few weeks before their big day. Without hesitation Rich takes off to Vegas with a friend and doesn't have a second thought for his bride-to-be. I wanted to slap this boy silly and scream at him to make up his bloody mind. So when Jen meets Warren and starts to feel again, it was awesome. Talk about swoon! The sex scenes were very hot and steamy.My stomach was in knots when Jen found the dumb nut Rich in a rather compromising position with a male friend of theirs. This is when I truly wanted to slap the boy and I was praying that Warren would come save the day. Which, he does.I love that Megan and Mark support Jen through out the book, such amazing friendship. Through everything that Jen has gone through I was so happy to see Warren step up and take care of her, even though her mind was all over the place. I am looking forward to more in this series.Reviewed by Amy Davies @ Eye Candy Bookstore

$review_text.: I lost myself reading this book. It was a fun, quick read. I liked it.I have only read one other Ferro Family book (Damaged, Damaged 2) so I know some basic information on the family. I read this book because I do want to know more about the Ferro Family and I heard this is a stand-alone and only one book.  I would love to read the rest of the family but I don't like the idea of having to buy 15 book (The Arrangement) or 5 books (The Proposition) to get one story. I limit myself with three books for each series.With that being said, I enjoyed the book. I didn't need to know much about the family to enjoy the book other than the Ferro Family is powerful. I smiled. I laugh. It was good.

$review_text.: Reviewed by Julie Failla EarhartJ.J. Spencer is on top of his game. He's not all that happy, but he has a good job, and in Manhattan, that means a lot. He is nearing the end of his first year as a lawyer at Greer, Babcock and Drew. The firm buys bad home loans for pennies-on-the-dollar, then forecloses, flips the house, and makes a bundle of money.But something happens to J.J. on this day. The couple that sat across the conference room table got to J.J. While out for lunch, he stops by their table and gives them the one small piece of advice that could save their home. What he doesn't suspect is that the couple will send him flowers as a thank you with a not-so-cleverly-disguised word choice that gives the big shots at the firm reason to fire him and have him disbarred.And so begins Jay Nussbaum's second novel, A Monk Jumped Over A Wall. It's during his disbarment hearings that he begins to question why he even became a lawyer. He's not really fond of it, doesn't have the passion for it that his ex-teacher and now close friend does-and basically feels like he doesn't belong.Told in first person and alternating between the present day and J.J.'s years in law school, Nussbaum manages to pull off an extraordinary tale, rooted in of all things a soup. "A Monk Jumped Over a Wall" is a famous soup, served in few places, and extremely expensive. The myth attached to it is that a monk smelled the soup cooking, jumped over a wall to have a taste, and was changed forever. Because the monk broke the laws of the order, he couldn't go back to the monastery so he went on to live the life he was meant to live. A passionate life.While it's obvious to the reader what J.J. is going to learn and the ultimate question behind A Monk Jumped Over A Wall, it's a rarity that a reader can sit back and enjoy watching the protagonist figure it out.Armchair Interviews says: An excellent book just waiting for you to pick it up.

$review_text.: I think C. Hope Clark gets better and better each time she publishes.  I won't dwell on plotlines, because I want to note that there is more attention to the character and personality of the folks that populate this novel.  I didn't even remember that Slade had a sister, but now I feel that I know her pretty well.  I learned more about the dynamics of her family and relationships in this novel that I had before.  Not all of it is positive (i.e. the depiction of her mother's meddling), but isn't that the way real families are? There is also enough action and adventure in this book to keep us reading until late in the night. Wayne is becoming more real to me too, and I am beginning to understand Slade's doggedness when she is working her cases. Clark also chose a slick way to round out the character of Pamela, Wayne's ex-wife and then effectively get rid of her too.  Well done. I can't wait for the next novel!

You go into it knowing a few people there and leave with some awesome new friends and get your throat slit and your guts ripped out
Wait, no, that's not it


This is a tight anthology


Not a bad story in the bunch


I knew some of the authors going in


If you haven't read "God of the Razor," you need to get with the program
And I came out with some new names I'm really psyched about seeing more from: Edward Morris, Patrick Tumblety, Silvia Moreno-Garcia, in particular


All offered unique variations of the Jack the Ripper story
What happened before? What happened after? What happened in Alaska? (Seriously, Laird Barron, what the heck happened in Alaska?) Ghosts
Mutilations

Just fantastic writing on every page


Don't say no


Say slash, slash, slash.

$REVIEW.: A story about a boy, David, who's family moved from Indianapolis to Kansas City after a tragic event and his dad was laid off.  It is summer vacation and he has to stay at home because both his parents need to work to make ends meet.  At first he has trouble making friends and no kids live on his street until Shelton moves in next door.Shelton is a strange child and is mistaken to be mentally handicapped at first.  Shelton`s mom shelters him and he seems to be able to communicate with the natural world.  David doesn't really like Shelton at first but he grows to almost like him.  David is like most kids who like to play sports and play in the woods but Shelton is more interested in the living things around them.David starts to notice that Shelton`s house is being watched and is forced into a decision on whether to try and help Shelton or not...The characters in the book seem like they could be real Americans with real life problems.  The story is a little slow at times but is developed right and is good start to the series because more questions seem to be left unanswered than are answered in the end.  I do think I will read the next book in the series.The boy

$REVIEW.: I really loved "Faking It" I thought it was an amazing book! When I saw that there was a sequel I bought it before reading the reviews. That was a bad idea. The first book left off on such a high note, and made ME be in a good mood. I think that is what a good book should do for its reader. After reading the first chapter of "Ordinary World" I stopped. I actually regretted buying it. I read the reviews and saw that a lot of its readers didn't like it and that it was a downer, but I decided to give it a try anyway. It ruined the first book for me. I think this is a perfect example of when to NOT make a sequel, and that's a shame. It could have been a great book.

$review_text.: Meet Detective Shawn Danger and his cat Comet. Shawn is a homicide detective--a relentless, detail oriented, homicide detective whose entire life revolves around his job, his trampoline, and his cat. After the murder of a reclusive heiress and her pet turtle, Shawn may face his toughest case ever--that is if he can survive the mysterious cats taking over his house, the earthquakes, and attacks on his home and car. What will happen if he can't solve the case? And, how on earth will he solve the case now that the cats have taken over his trampoline?Detective Danger, if a trampoline can make me half as observant as this man, I'm putting one in my living  room tomorrow. He's determined not to miss a single detail of the crime scene, taking notice of everything down to the type of wood used in furnishings. Surely those skills make for great detective work but they make for some very detailed scenes, but once we move past his initial inspection of the house, the story picks up pace. What I loved about Shawn, was his attitude toward everything. He's a workaholic, yet he takes even the strangest events in stride--a trait that allows him to keep his wit when all else around him falls into chaos.If there was anything I could say the book needed more of, it was Comet. He makes me miss my cat, Hawkeye. Like Comet, she had a way of communicating and a lovable  yet strange, personality (although, I must also admit that Hawkeye also had a vengeful streak and a propensity for attacking my sister, but I digress). Even though the book isn't a comedy, it's not entirely straight-laced either, but what else would you expect from Nina Post?I have numerous excerpts highlighted on my Kindle, and I'm sure my husband got tired of me shoving the computer toward him to read random passages that I couldn't keep to myself. So, I had quite a difficult time choosing my favorite quote to share with you, but I've decided on this mini-pep talk:Pathetic, Shawn. Think of those guys in Homicide: Life on the Streets. Think of those guys on Law & Order. Did you see them on the floor under a trampoline, a giant cat cutting off most of their oxygen? No.Nina Post, Danger in Cat World, Curiosity Quills Press.Nina delivers a wonderful spin on the procedural murder mystery, keeping many of the same attributes I've loved about her other books; witty dialogue, quirky but loveable characters, and insane situations.Check this one out, and add it to your bookshelf.(Disclaimer: I bought the book, and had no choice  but to give it an honest review.)

Angesichts der technischen Fortschritte der EEGs, die sich immer mehr der Erfassung von Gedankeninhalten in den Hirnen n&auml;hern, mag es durchaus plausibel sein.Und was kommt dabei heraus? Vom Ehestreit &uuml;ber den korrupten Berufstr&auml;umer bis zum ausbeuterischen Schiffseigner - die Menschen haben sich in Dresens Geschichte nicht ge&auml;ndert.

$REVIEW.: I did not agree with everything, but the author hit all the key points he needed to make.The only major problems I had were: the bashing of route memorization but the author does admit it is helpful in context as long as the student is thinking for themself; and the descretion of a teacher or student to turn out a student who isn't suited for their studies so they can go on to pursue their talents. That is very hard to discern and could result in a lot of trouble for the student and also the teacher/institution. I like how the author noted ideally the student should judge if he is suited for a certain study.For the most part though the suggestions are genious and I use them daily. Some things sound like common sense like getting enough rest and exercise or making time for hobbies. But it was so nice to have those things alongside the philosophy of learning and reasoning.I highly reccomend this to all, students,teachers,readers, and generally speaking...learners.

Raw is so deep - everything about Twitch is dark, confusing, illegal, he is horrifying and frightening. Once you get over the fact he is entangled in a web of complete misery. You wonder what in the world was Alexa, a well educated professional, smoking (no pun intended for those who read the book) that made her trust him in her life.Like a good song...that gets better toward the end...Its the case with this book. I kept reading that folks were crying and all that and I was seriously wondering what other reviewers read. Then BAM! I was bawling.

$review_text.: ***Complimentary copy provided by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review***John Dreamer was a quick read that I actually liked reading. Some of the characters were annoying but the meanings behind the dreams were what made me keep turning the pages. Seeing how everyone deals with their struggles was truly inspirational and it makes you think of how you can step up and see yourself as something more than what people judge you as.Just imagine waking up in a room with six other strangers and not being able to leave. Then some guy named, the Guardian, tells you that he's going to make your deepest dreams come true. You have so many questions that don't get answered. You're put to the test and everyone around you witnesses some part of you that you didn't want to show or didn't even think you had in you. There is also a romance, attitude, name calling, mention of aliens, and a shy girl.It was beautifully written addressing love, life, forgiveness and choices. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to get lost inside of a good book, preferably YA.It's part of a series and I can't wait to see what happens next.

$review_text.: T.S. Charles sure knows how to compress action...and his lead character Nathan. I'm not new to fantasy stories, but the Zombie thing is one I haven't gotten into. Vampirism was more my cup of blood. In a short space with rapid pace he has recently-divorced Nathan out for a night of drinking with two friends. The last bar they choose to enter brings bad memories to Nathan, so he goes for a walk; not a long one. He's attacked by a...person?...who bites his ear. Nathan runs. And this is just step one! The scene-painting is astounding, the actions pulse-pounding. The finale may or may not be predictable, but in the spirit of good writing, T.S. takes us where the story must. For those who know the term, I found the denoument especially delectable. You owe it to yourself to read "The Attack" during your breakfast coffee, not close to bedtime.

$REVIEW.: I've started writing this review about 50% of my way into this book so that I can capture my irritation. The premise of the story is that the H and h spent a passionate week with the H 5 years before the start of this book. The H is a famous rock star and has every woman throwing her panties at him. When he left the h 5 years previously, he never made any attempt to contact her again and one week after leaving her, she chases after him only to find him with a half-naked woman and he doesn't care. Now 5 years later he realises his mistake and wants her again.+++Spoilers+++As I said I'm 50% of my way through the book and I'm totally irritated because the h is right back where she was 5 years ago, which means she can't keep her hands off the guy. I just wanted her to have some self-respect and keep him at a distance at least for a few days. These type of books make me want to throw my Kindle in despair. Are women so weak and spineless? I'm the first to admit that you have to suspend your disbelief when reading these types of books but I honestly wish this h had had more backbone and been a bit different from all the other women who chased after him. He only has to crook his little finger and she's throwing herself at him again. What are the chances of a true hea for characters like these?

$REVIEW.: First I want to say that I am so dam pissed at myself for not reading this book sooner. Holy Jett this book was incredible. I could not put it down and when my eyes were closing I would force them open so I could keep reading. I eventually had to put it down but I picked it back up this morning and I have to say that I absolutely love J.C. and I need need book like I need air to breathe. I mean who would not love a strong alpha male and a strong alpha female as characters but what makes this book and did it for me was the flow of the book and the development of characters. I have been reading a lot of NA books and I loved most of them I found that some did not have the flow like I needed.Choppy reading is for the birds dude I want a book where I can get into it and I can picture the characters and even relate to them with a song and by the way Rhianna's Stay is Jett and Brooke's song.The words:All along it was a feverA cold sweat hot-headed believerI threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something,"He said, "If you dare come a little closer."Round and around and around and around we goOh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you knowNot really sure how to feel about it.Something in the way you moveMakes me feel like I can't live without you.It takes me all the way.I want you to stayIt's not much of a life you're livingIt's not just something you take - it's givenOoh the reason I hold onOoh cause I need this hole goneFunny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed savingCause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is cavingThis song sums up so much for these two who happened to meet and fall in love but circumstances be what they are come in between them and choices and decisions are made and once they are made there is no turning back. For Jett he is smart, gorgeous and gets what ever he wants. He wants a property but it seems that the owner does not want to sell. The owner rather save the property and pass it on to his family. Jett is determined to get that property at any cost but what he wasn't expecting was falling in love with the heir to that property. For Brooke she has had lot's of tragedy in her life and she keeps her heart and life closed off to everyone so she does not get hurt. Her dream job is to be a top Realtor and work for the top firm but she gets sidetracked by another company who has offered her a job. As she starts her new job she finds out she will be going to Italy to seal a deal that the company she works for is trying to broker.Then Brooke comes home and she finds out that a law firm has been searching for he rand they tell her she has inherited some property but when she realizes which one it is it will change Brooke and Jetts relationship and Brooke will get stronger than she has ever been and does something she never thought she would do but it is for the best interest of both parties. This book has it's highs and lows and keeps you on your toes and the ending from Jetts perspective I just dam near died! I said what a freaking fool what was he thinking and what the hell is up with this estate that everyone wants. Man I have so many questions June can't come fast enough because I am dying to read the second book.

$review_text.: There are some valuable lessons in this book, but combing through the wordiness and fluff is very time consuming. Of course one could argue that you need all of the anecdotal evidence to prove what he is saying and make his observations relevant. But with most of his observations being common sense to a natural leader, you wouldn't need all of the evidence.In the end, as the author agrees, there is no perfect leader for all situations. The right balance of traits and actions will tell how good a leader was only in hindsight. There is no silver bullet that will MAKE a successful team leader.I would have prefered a a distilled version of this book taking up about 50 pages rather than 300. The author is very intelligent and wise, but he is no Peter Drucker. I don't understand the glowing reviews of this book. It is worth a look if you have the time, but there are much better and more concise guides to effective leadership out there.

$review_text.: Yoshi Lomax is in hot water having been arrested for the murder of a federal agent. Her status as an attorney only gives her a better understanding of exactly how much time she's currently facing.  However by novel's end the murder case is going to be the least of her problems.  Yoshi finds herself in several precarious situations being subjected to all types of depravity.  Having not read the previous books in the series Playing Dirty and Notorious I was unable to determine if Yoshi was the innocent victim that she portrayed herself to be or was karma for some past transgressions rearing its ugly head?Author Kiki Swinson provided enough information whereas readers like myself could still follow along without having read the prior books.  Background information was relayed without any tedious rehashing of books one or two.  A common pitfall that some authors make when penning sequels.  The only issue that I found was the ending was too ambiguous leaving a major issue unresolved.  That ambiguity makes it unclear if a sequel is forthcoming or if this is in fact the final installment.  All things withstanding Murder Was The Case is an action filled novel easily recommendable to readers of Playing Dirty and Notorious.Final Rating 3.5 StarsDelonya ConyersARC Book Club Inc.

However,it is very common to date nonmormons or even marry nonMormons. This book appears to have no  depth, and it doesn't.

$REVIEW.: I didn't pay much for this Kindle edition of Hemp Bracelets by Ktkatz and do like the topic of the book.  The Kindle book reading is easy and the topic is covered.  I am visual and the written explanation of what is covered is lacking for me.  This is a step by step process and detailed pictures of performing these tasks, for me, would be enhanced by more pictures, lots more!  I will continue to use this Kindle book and hope I can get more out of it than I have so far.  When the author shows a drawing of a bracelette and then goes through several pages of how to make it, with out a picture, this leaves me wanting more detail.  Nice cover photo of a finished product, and early in the book, the author gives small pictures of how to tie the basic knots and weaves, but I needed this also when a design is produced later in the book.  I will look over a Kindle book closer in the future, maybe just check it out for a while rather than purchase it upfront.

$REVIEW.: I bought this book under unusual circumstances.  The day before I bought it, I complained to my sister I have way more recipes from cook books and newspaper clippings that I could ever possibly make.  And I'm trying to eliminate more meat from my diet.  So with a glut of recipes and a desire to eat less meat, it would only make sense for me to buy a book with 575 recipies devoted to grilling and slow smoking of dead animals.  But I'm really glad I did!Kirk shares a number of his barbecuing insights, which have definitely improved the results of my periodic attempts at ribs and chicken.  The chapter on mustard slathers is a technique I've never seen before and the results I had using mustard slathers with salmon and ribs following Kirk's advice turned out pretty good. The fish marinades for salmon, tuna, and swordfish all turned out well.  The marinades had good flavors, but showed the proper restraint that is important when cooking fish.  The Jack Daniel's Marinated Salmon was awesome, although I smoked it with pecan rather than grill it as Kirk suggested.And that illustrates the beauty of the book.  Paul Kirk really encourages experimentation, and then provides an excellent guidebook to do just that.  There's just a tremendous amount of creativity and originality in this book, and I found it infectious.  There is seemingly no flavor Kirk ignores.  The fact that all the recipes turn out good to great is even better!  I'm not sure this is the best source for an authentic Tuscan Grilled Tuna, and I didn't try this recipe out, but I suspect it's pretty good, and I'm glad Kirk shared it with us.I judge a cook book on how it improves my cooking, and this has made a big difference in my results with barbecue ribs and chicken, and also for grilled fish, and for that reason, it is highly recommended.

It is a book about slowing down, about trying things, about risking failure in order to find fulfillment in gaining physical hands on skills in a world where hands on skills are becoming increasingly rare.His attitude toward DIY is that, for him, it is like the "Slow Food" movement. In the slow food movement, the goal was to slow down and enjoy the process. He decides to slow down and enjoy the process of life, of living with his wife and daughters, of connecting with other people. The method he chooses is to begin DIY projects. He is successful in his goal, though not always successful in his attempts at DIY.Because of his attempts, though, he finds activities that bring a great deal of joy and meaning to his life. He also connects in deeper ways with his daughters, his wife and his community.Highly recommended.

A new character, Beth, hasn't had the best interaction with Jamie or Lauren in there first meeting but, she still wants what Witch Central offers.  Beth has Asperger's (high functioning Autism) and needs a different approach to training.  Beth manages her life carefully and lands in the controlled chaos of Witch Central.  I like this book because Geary isn't afraid to take on a difficult subject.  Given the lack of knowledge most of us have about Autism and Asperger's I found this book enlightening in many ways.A Different Witch (A Modern Witch Series: Book 5)

$REVIEW.: This is one of the best fitness/strength training books I've read in a long time. As a former strength trainer and aerobics instructor myself, I know the importance of keeping fit, including strength training and this continues throughout life. If anything, I think it's even more important to work out regularly, both aerobically and for strength, as we get older.I was very impressed with the work that has gone into this guide. Not only does the author provide some excellent (and doable) strength routines, for all fitness levels; she also provides the interesting story of her own fitness journey. The ups and downs and the setbacks and triumphs through the years, that many of us can relate too.I also appreciated that she included diagrams for the exercises, something that is too often lacking, particularly in ebook fitness guides.There is an upbeat, "you can do it" attitude to this book that really does make a person want to go for it. And to embrace that it really is NEVER too late, to get stronger and more fit.Highly recommended.Geraldine Helen Hartman author of the Groovy Green Kitchen series

$REVIEW.: I'm not even sure why I bought this book; perhaps because it was so cheap at the bookstore (I bought it from the bargain books section). Maybe because it mentioned several local "haunted places" that I'm familiar with (Queen Mary, the Whaley House, and the Hotel del Coronado)? Frankly, I still don't know why, but I did read it. Overall, the "World's Most Haunted Places" is one of those books that makes for good reading for the "little room" - short blurbs on a variety of allegedly "haunted" places located in English speaking countries (with one exception - the catacombs of Paris, France).The book did nothing for me except to help put me to sleep at night. Sure, it was "fun" but really did not have much substance. The writing was stilted and the "cute" little comments that concluded each story grew weary very, very quickly.On another note, I found that the use of "BCE" (before "common" era) and "CE" ("common" era) in place of the traditional BC and AD to be very annoying. I don't know why people who are trying to pretend that they're "scholars" need to use such politically correct (but, to me offensive) terminology. The author's writing style was quite stilted and was often a chore to get through.Would I recommend this book to others? Probably not unless they are seeking a temporary respite from insomnia: oh well.

$REVIEW.: This book offers many examples of tools which leading companies are using to help marketers "mine the unconscious." Examples include developing research questions which speak to the unconscious brain, uncovering meaning through customer metaphors for use in brand communications or better measuring consumer reactions to marketing stimuli. The book will be of particular interest to marketing executives and market research professionals.The book is at times a disorganized or a rambling array of market research techniques and subjects. The author moves from brand development to product development and service experience with little structure or methodology for application. It come across as overly academic at times, rather than a business or marketing book with clear methodology or structured applications. However, marketing executives or research types will find the wealth of techniques and examples compensate for these shortcomings.

$REVIEW.: Derailed is a study of spectacular failures of CEOs in large public companies and what people can do to avoid having a similar outcome to their careers. The author makes the case that to become a successful leader of a large company, you need to pay attention to what derailed these folks and avoid their mistakes. To a large extent I agree with his observations and recommendations.There are essentially three parts to this book. The first one contains the brief stories of six well-known recent cases of CEOs of large American companies who had spectacular meltdowns. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, the companies they headed also suffered so the real danger here is the lives of the thousands of people who were thrown out of work and the terrible damage done to these corporations by their failed CEOs. The most well-known of these is Bob Nardelli who was passed over for the top job at GE to become the CEO of Home Depot and afterwards Chrysler. In both of those subsequent roles, Nardelli is known for his excessive compensation packages ($240 million separation package from Home Depot) and horrible results for companies he headed. Some others are almost as well known including the stories of Carly Fiorina, Durk Jager, Steven Heyer, Frank Raines, and Dick Fuld.After telling the six stories, the author points out the similarities in them and the common failures of character that each of these people displayed when their careers derailed. The third and final substantial section contains some words of advice on how not to find yourself in similar situations.While reading the case studies and the summaries of them later in the book, I was struck by the huge arrogance and self-absorbed nature of these `leaders' which brought about their downfall. The author labels these as their `character flaws' and argues that real leaders should not have these. From my own experiences in the corporate world I would heartily agree with him even though I have not worked in those companies. I see too many executives from the VP level upwards who display the same arrogance, self-absorption, and character flaws that derailed the careers spoken about here. So, for me, the main part of the book was in the second half where the author talks about how to avoid those flaws and how to recognize that you are starting to become one of `them'. That is where the value is in this book.I took away one star from this book because that latter part was not as gripping or comprehensive as I felt it could have been. The author talks briefly about the four dimensions of character that are important: namely Authenticity; Self-Management; Humility; and Courage. However, he does not go to the depths of these that he could or should to give good guidance to those of us who wish to become better leaders in our careers. He does give some advice in the latter chapters, but those are more lists of "five critical lessons learned", and "five critical habits" and there is simply not enough there for my liking.I would still recommend this book to people who would like to learn how to be good - and even great - leaders in corporate environments as I think the advice and anecdotes strewn throughout the book are very valuable.A bigger story that needs to be addressed is how companies should avoid the promotion and grooming of people like the ones described in this book so that you cull out the people with flawed characters before they get to the point where they can cause so much damage. After all, none of the executives described here were in these positions as their very first job. In other words, there is some mechanism in American industry that leads people susceptible to these character flaws to be driven upwards and upwards through organizations until they make it to the CEO ranks - where they fail spectacularly. That, however, is the topic for other books.

$REVIEW.: There is no need for me to rehash the plot of the store here; it has already been well reported. I would simply like to add that I am another who enjoyed this story which never seemed to drag and never let me down. Not only did the author make me like Sam Bass and Valerie, he also made me care about what was happening to them as the story worked its way to the conclusion.As the story develops, the character of Sam Bass is required by the plot to become "The Cowboy" who is a more mysterious shadow of the original Sam Bass character. It would seem the author could easily turn this protagonist into a most interesting characteer in future stores. While Sam Bass is not his real name, it would also seem to be the "right" name for the author to use for this protagonist if he should choose to have him appear in future stories. Sam Bass, the cowboy, just seems to have a good ring to it.Also, as the reader proceeds along the plot of this story, he is exposed to some interesting aspects of Cherokee Indian culture, and that also adds to an interesting story.Best wishes,Dave Wile

$review_text.: I really loved the continuation of Abby and West's story
 Anna Cruise always does an excellent job at the male p.o.v
and did not disappoint in It Was Me as we got to have this story from West's point of view.The story started off very sweet, and almost happily ever after-ish for Abby and West, but life is never going to be perfect

 Like any couple, they will continue to battle through tough circumstances, and in It Was Me, we see that in full force


 However, instead of being in an emotional girly roller-coaster, it was really nice to be in West's head for this battle.Seeing how and why he makes the choices he does in the book is heart-warming and gives you hope that there are more guys like that him the world


 Instead of going to extremes for one another, compromise is brought into play.I really thought Anna did a great job continuing their story, and would love to see what else life has in store for Abby and West!

$REVIEW.: I am fairly new to the paranormal romance genre & I was just blown away by this book. I took my time reading Between because I didn't want to miss any of it or misunderstand anything. I am so glad I took my time because I truly felt like I was in the room with Rose, Alek & Finn watching everything unfold!This book really makes you think outside the square & open your mind to endless thoughts & possibilities.It is very easy to empathise with the characters & the situations they have found themselves in. Although Rose is quiet & withdrawn she is highly intelligent & quickly comes to terms with what she is faced with & works out how to deal with it. I felt a bit sorry for poor old Finn who has a huge burden to bear as it was his actions that have led them all to the point they are at. Then there is Alek.. Hmm well lets just say you need to read the book to have the pleasure of meeting Alek!Lisa Swallow has written another brilliant book &  at times I was holding my breath waiting to see what happens next, at other times I wanted to cry for all 3 of the main characters then something would happen it & would be laughing at Rose's reaction to it.I was absolutely hooked from start to finish & I cannot wait to see how the story continues in book 2!!Awesome job Lisa, you should be very proud of this little treasure!!!!

$REVIEW.: Congressman Tancredo does one of the best jobs I have seen tackling the all too important and all too often ignored issues of mass immigration and border security of the US.  Chapter by chapter he dissects the issue of immigration and it impact on our country, our economy, our health care and the breach of security to this nation.  He debunks many of the current low key patches proposed by others in government such as the guest worker program which basically grants amnesty for those who have entered here illegally by breaking the law and are rewarded for doing so.  He tackles on of the biggest issues of our day, our loss of national identity in lieu of our pursuit of political correctness and "multi culturalism".  He does a superb jobs of demonstrating how many illegals do not severe their bounds to their origin countries and do not make attempts at assimilation to our country and are simply here to exploit its wealth.  He assets it is the US's right to decide who comes here and it should be done in this nation's best interest.  He discussed how we should be proud of western civilization and illustrates many examples of how we as a society have been bombarded with the message to love all cultures and the country should suit the needs of all cultures at the loss of our own national pride and identity.  There should be no hyphenated-American. My only issue is that the congressman takes the occasional political jabs at democrats (Tancredo is a conservative republican).  The book would be better suited if this was avoided.  Many local and state governments find themselves abandoned by the federal government when it comes to illegals and border security.  It's truly an issue for the federal government and not many of our elected officials have had the political courage to resolve this problem.  Our borders could very easily be secured (never 100%) so that they are not porous.  The one great thing about this book is it's not just a laundry list of all the issues but offers some excellent solutions that the author is currently seeking in his elected position.  A very easy read and written in simple language, every US citizen should become familiar with this subject as it could very well be our demise as a nation.

Perfect sex, perfect love and even when they had the big "fall out" it was short lived. she couldnt stay mad at him- he just had to look at her etc. I was really expecting someone a bit more hardcore and badass character based on how the hero was portrayed .

$REVIEW.: This one opens with action - a car chase."Richard!  Slow down!"Heart pounding, Eve took her gaze from the road and cut a glance to the driver, Richard, her business partner. Richard didn't respond.  The CD player was blaring.  Unlikely he could hear her above Van Halen's scream. Richard had picked up his new Porsche just yesterday.  He'd wanted to see what the car could do, he'd said with a smirk when they started on this road, and hit the gas.  Now the road began to slope and the car gained additional speed.  Eve's gaze went to the speedometer and her breath hitched.  Ninety and climbing.Outside the passenger window, a view of trees and rock-face streaked by in a blur.  Her mouth went dry.  Eve took her gaze from the road and cut a glance to Richard.  His focus was trained on the rearview mirror. It wasn't the first time in the last few minutes she'd spotted him looking into the rearview.  She looked around herself but couldn't see anything but the trail of dust the Porsche was kicking up in its wake.  As she faced front again, again, Richard's focus lifted to the view behind them.Written from omniscient point of view, this this one opens with action - a car chase. Danger on the first page, guy, gal, a new Porsche. Has all the elements of a "racy" read. Can't wait to finish this one. Also enjoyedFatal Transaction (Thriller & Suspense, Cyber Crime)

$review_text.: I've given 'The Coming Insurrection' 4 stars not on literary merit but because I found it informative.  In many ways it is just as heated and irrational as Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' or 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and, despite its very different message the overall tenor is suspiciously the same.The writers are Leftist Nihilists who believe that modern industrial and work-oriented society is not only foolish...it is about to go into the dustpan of history. Deservedly so, in their opinions.  They aim to speed things along by a succession of societal and infrastructure disruptions including vandalism, theft, strikes, go slow, obnoxiousness, sabotage etc.  They won't stop there.  There believe destrucion of the power grid which will cast all of France into darkness, is a very good start.To the authors, work is purposeless, demeaning and counterrevolutionary.  Therefore, their followers are not to work, living by their wits.  They should, instead, set up interlocking communes that will survive, initially, by parasitizing greater society...but...as society breaks down...largely by their efforts...they will need to become experts in medicine, agronomy, farming, marine biology and sociology which means...of course...that they will have to work [????].If everything works out as planned [and it won't] their multiple leaderless communes will spread out to occupy the cities and countryside.  No mention is made of the previous inhabitants but you can guess.  Nirvana will be achieved with little labor and plenty of time to spend on the real values of life such as meaningful relationships.  Our Plastic-Elastic society is rightfully history and the remaining Commune-istas are happy, fulfilled and content.Of course, it's hogwash.  Communities, even communes, naturally acquire leaders and, even more naturally, are creatures of factionalism and jealousy.  Communes will either implode and/or be taken over by dominant leaders who, more than likely, will make people work real,real hard--as ignorant slaves.Also....nature abhors a vacuum and the French Communes would be a political vacuum that will be filled--probably by North African Muslims.  The lotus-eating Commune-istas will find themselves obliged to convert--and work--or face ruthless punishment.  If not the Muslims, then the Russians or Chinese but, and this can be totally guaranteed, the idealistic communes will have a VERY short half-life.In the meantime, though, these fools could do a lot of damage.Ron

$REVIEW.: Harmony, Indiana is to Michael West what Castle Rock, Maine is to Stephen King


It's a beautiful little all-American town, populated by good, old-fashioned, ordinary folk


It's a friendly town, where the citizens aren't embarrassed to come to one another's aid

It's also a place with deep, dark, dirty secrets tucked carefully away, just out of sight.Secrets like serial killers, haunted farmhouses, Lovecraftian monsters, bloody rituals, and a history of gruesome deaths 




all of which feature in Spook House, the latest Harmony tale from Michael WestThis is another solid West thriller, gruesome, bloody, scary, and fun


The opening scene is right out of a classic horror flick, complete a "don't go in there!" sentiment shared by the characters as well as the reader

The scene in the basement of the Fuller House is matched only by the scene outside, where the gloriously grotesque spider-dog comes fully to the forefront.The emotional high point of the novel for me was the scene in which a young woman is sent by her father to let the dog in at the back door


It's one of those "don't open the door!" kind of moments, but even the most jaded reader can't anticipate the horror about to descend upon the family - even if a fortunate accident does provide the means to end the threat of the spider-dog once and for all.Sheri and Robby are strong characters, vulnerable and damaged in their own way, but with a hidden strength  that drives the story forward

There are sparks there, but West wisely allows them to smoulder in the background, never allowing the prospect of romance to distract from the horror
As for Cayden, the Irish serial killer who's come to finish what Fuller started, he's almost too charming

He's funny, clever, and almost likeable 






until he starts slaying young women to 'slip into their skin' (literally) in order to open the portal to Hell.As for the climax, it's absolutely brilliant


Once again, West manages to pull off a finale that's more than worthy of the horrors leading up to it


If you've ever doubted that Super Soaker water guns, trucks full off road salt, bags of saline solution, and a cheesy Halloween haunted house set-up could be scary, then you need to give this a read - even if just to see how history comes full-circle, and how the victims become the heroes.

$REVIEW.: Historical reads are not easy to write with accuracy. Research is vital if the story - whatever the genre - is to entertain as well as enlighten and inform. I found "A Run for Love" to be carefully crafted and because of Callie's attention to historical detail, the romance was enhanced and delightful.The reader is easily transported back to the Oklahoma Territory's rich history and is able to feel the hope, despair and triumph of its famous land rush. The blooming romance between Tori and Jesse, Tori's determination to do right by her loved ones, all comes shining through.I thoroughly enjoyed it and know I'll come back time and again to re-read.

$review_text.: The whirlwind of creative destruction is harnessed to the concept of continuous revolution in this handbook of how to think strategically in an arena that is both instantaneous and worldwide.Looking to business models instead of technology as the key strategic advantage for the near future, Mitchell and Coles distilled a decade-long research project, involving interviews and with CEOs of consistently successful companies that had ridden the crest of uncertainty by reinventing how they operated, in creating this book.  What they found is that, of those businesses they selected to study, the ones who maintained their edge had changed their business model, many more than once.  While their research begins in 1989, some of the companies in question had pioneered the concept, decades earlier.  (Nucor Steel had been, "The Nuclear Corporation of America," a conglomerate making, among other things, radiac meters, before F. Kenneth Iverson reformulated their business model to that of a high-tech minimill.)The emphasis on strategy, in seeing new opportunities in seemingly random or unconnected events, and the decidedly long view of history implicit in the underlying philosophy is what recommends the work above all else.  (The authors also clearly have a broad background in classical economics, and quoteAdam Smith, Alfred Marshall and others to illustrate key points.) Much of the strategic planning/scenerio building advice reminds this writer of concepts that he first ecountered in military life, and the anology of busines to war is not a new one.  (Think of Sun Tzu, lately a business guru, after millenia as a fount of military doctrine.)Like generals preparing to fight the last war, many business leaders stick with a winning formula even as it reaches the point of diminishing returns, and as unacknowledged competitors become mortal dangers to their security.  One example used by the authors is of Red Hat Linux, which depends at least partially on product innovations offered by the open-source community.  While Microsoft may be market-dominant and debt-free, their business model, which, the authors note, defeated Netscape in the browser wars by offering Internet Explorer as a no-cost, bundled product with Windows, it may not be able to keep them as cost leader in the operating system market against competition relying on what Eric Raymond described as the gift culture of the open-source community ("The Cathedral and the Bazaar"). Whether Microsoft will (assuming that Red Had and company succeed in making Linux a critical threat to Windows) abandon what has been enormously successful for them (their business model) for the untried is the choice faced by everyone on top when challenged by asymmetric competition. The failure to see, plan for, and meet such challenges is more often the fate of yesterday's leaders than is the successful business model innovation that Mitchell and Coles describe.  (See also, "The Innovator's Dilemma" for case studies of this problem.)Involving as many minds as possible in worst-case-scenerio planning is another bit of wisdom, validated by the testimony of CEOs whom the authors found to be constantly ahead of the competition.  This leveraging of existing resources (they're already on the payroll, if they are employees) is a low- to no-cost way to offset competitor advantages in fixed capital resources that the reader may not be able to match.While the book is generally shorn of technical minutia, making for quick readability, the discussion on pricing strategies is fairly detailed, and provides insight into how to use pricing to test business model concepts before fully committing to them.  As with the other chapters, the section on pricing is well-illustrated with case studies in what worked - and what did not.The book is well worth an evening's read, especially before events make agonizing reappraisals of how one operates a necessity.-Lloyd A.

$review_text.: I had never heard of Anna Katharine Green, but was looking for an inexpensive (OK, cheap) mystery collection, so downloaded the Mystery Megapack.  I am about 75% of the way through the book and the stories improve in interest and complexity as I work through the Table of Contents.  The Amelia Butterworth series originally was my favorite, but Violet Strange has usurped Amelia's top spot.  I thought I had identified the villain halfway through The Woman with the Diamond, but I have to admit I am stymied; can't wait to get back to reading and solve the mystery.  It does take some time to get used to the wordy, flowery Victorian writing style, but it is time well spent.  I have already picked out the next Anna Katharine Green mystery I will download and am sure it will be even more spellbinding than the ones I have already read.  I recommend this Megapack to anyone who loves a mystery, particularly a mystery set in Victorian times with plenty of high society characters, old mansions, horse-drawn carriages.  There is no sexually explicit situations or coarse language, just good old-fashioned murder and mayhem!

$REVIEW.: The devil made Mitchell Norton a serial killer.Forgive Me, Alex is the story of the serial killer Mitchell Norton and Tony Hooper, the man whose life he ruined, and who has since become something of an expert at making serial killers go away. Split between 1995, when Mitchell is released from prison, and 1978, the summer of Norton's reign of terror, this novel follows the events that made Norton into a killer and Hooper's desperate race to stop him ... twice.Readers of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will find much to like about Lane Diamond's debut novel. Exquisitely written, with earnest, irresistable characters and an intriguing dual narrative, this is one thriller well worth the time. Rest assured, as many have already commented, this novel has quite a few challenging scenes--be prepared for blood, and lots of it--but they add to the tension that ripples throughout the book. I, like others here, had a hard time putting the book down each night, and so compelling was the story that I found myself dreaming about it. I couldn't help but feel what was at stake, even when I wasn't reading.The book was particularly effective in its slow burn. The time shifts between 1978 and 1995 provided interesting perspectives, and in no way diminished the mystery of how things were going to turn out.Also effective was the small-town setting, Algonquin, Illinois. At first, I found myself wondering how Lane was going to make a story about a serial killer work in a small town, but the closeness of the people and the narrow confines in which Norton had to work served only to highten the sense of danger that pervades the book.My only real beef with the story are the two main female characters. I found myself wanting to know about them and about their abilities, particularly the FBI agent Linda Monroe. Neither was given much opportunity for fleshing out. Instead, they became the romantic motivation of Tony Hooper's pysche--not really characters, but ideals toward which Hooper could strive.Forgive Me, Alex is a compelling start, and the promised follow-up, The Devil's Bane, said to be available in late 2012, should easily build on Alex's foundations. I'll be particuarly interested to learn more about Tony Hooper's other serial-killer-killing activities, more about Linda Monroe, and pull back veil on Hooper's secret agent ally, Frank Willow.

$review_text.: The picture on the cover and the title are slightly misleading. This is a fantasy novel that includes mostly believable characters in a not-quite-destroyed post-apocalyptic world. The fact that the event that happened in the oldest character's childhood is not explained does not at all detract from the book. In fact, I like that.The clash between the current world and the people trying to restore the old is well done and believable. The central love story is touching. There are a very few typos, but they don't generally distract from the reading. In addition, the ending is a little abrupt, but the story overall is so well done it's not a huge deal.I definitely recommend this if you are a fan of fantasy. There is enough that post-apoc fans would enjoy it too, but it is definitely a fantasy novel.

 It is a disappointment to me as I was expecting a good decription of most of the common stones with photographs of each and it is a nice treatise on 62 stones


 While it has 13 pages on azeztulite, it has.....0 pages on quartz crystals, huh?  If quartz is not one of the 62 stones of the new consciousness what is?  Not saying he doesn't go into quartz in the long intro


 It has no rose quartz, amethyst, obsidian, and a host of others and I did  not see that noted in any of the reviews, so this is your warning, if you are getting this book to have a general description (with photos) of the stones currently available this is not it.

$review_text.: This series just continues to get better and better as the books go along.  I have loved this series from Book 1&#8230;Untouched.  This is book 6 in this series, and what I love is that we still get to see characters from the previous books as well.  This book took me a little bit by surprise, because even though I knew who the Hero was, I didn't realize that the heroine was Juliet's sister.  I also loved that this book touched on a serious subject.  I felt the author handled it well and it was written extremely well. Every book in this series has completely sucked me in and keeps me intrigued all the way to the end.  The title of this book truly fits this story.  This book was all about loving someone Unconditionally.  This was also a story about second chances&#8230;.in love and in life.We meet Garrett (Emerson and Brit's BFF) and Carina (Juliet's Sister) throughout books 1 and 2, but we really don't get to know them until this book.  I have to say that once I figured out who Carina was, I have to say I didn't like her much in the other books, but my heart broke for her in this book.  We find out her secret pretty much right off the bat in Chapter 1. (And what a chapter that one was&#8230;.this book definitely started off with a bang.)  Even though we see what kind of life she has been living, we continue to find out more about her as the book continues.  I loved watching her character grow as the book went on.  I also loved that she was able to repair past relationships and learned how to open up and express what she is truly feeling.  Now Garrett&#8230;.I loved him.  He was so broken.  My heart also broke for him once we find out what happened in his past.  He was the right mix of hot Alpha and sweet swoon worthy man.  I loved his 'dirty' mouth ;)  These two together really show you that a person can have a second chance at love and life and that they truly loved each other unconditionally.Like I said earlier&#8230;.we get to see all of the other characters from the previous books.  It was great catching up with them and seeing what is going on in their lives.  We also got to meet the characters  for the next book.  The epilogue for this book is the set up for the next book and let me tell you it is HOT!!!!!  I can't wait for July for the next book in this series.I would definitely recommend this book/series to anyone who is looking for great love stories and books with just the right amount of drama and sexy time!!!!!**A Complimentary copy was given from author**

$review_text.: Contrary to Bjorn Lomborg,The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World, David Owen does not think the environmental crisis (Global Warming, Peak Oil, etc...) is over-hyped.  But, he thinks it is misunderstood and that we go about it the wrong way in attempting to resolve it.Owen refers to Bryce excellent bookGusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of Energy Independencein confirming that ethanol is a boondoggle that requires a lot more energy to produce than it actually generates.  It also is causing food prices to skyrocket as corn production is being allocated for transportation purposes.We will inevitably continue importing a lot of oil.  Surprisingly, hybrid cars really don't make that much difference.  U.S. proven oil reserves (30 billion barrels) cover only three years of domestic consumption.  If we doubled the mpg of our entire auto fleet overnight, this would give us just an extra year of oil domestic consumption.  If we opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, this may also give us only an extra year of domestic oil consumption or an extra 10 billion barrels.  Hydrogen fuel for cars remains a distant pipe dream.  The problems associated with producing, storing, and distributing liquid hydrogen at a feasible economic cost remains elusive.  The huge reserves of shale oil and tar sands in North America may not bail us out of the Peak Oil constraint.  Their respective ratio of energy spent during production vs energy generated may also be rather unattractive.The World's CO2 emission is unlikely to decline soon.  The Kyoto Protocol has not made any difference.  The performance of countries with a similar population density as the U.S. such as Canada who signed this treaty have experienced more rapid growth in CO2 emission than the U.S.  All other members of the Kyoto Protocol have failed to meet their CO2 emission reduction targets and have instead experienced stubbornly increasing rise in such emissions.  As oil becomes less available, the resulting energy supply gap will be filled mainly by coal which generates much more CO2 emission than oil.  Coal already plays a dominant role in generating electricity to fuel the rapid economic growth in China and India.Most green technology do not make much difference.  Solar panel on residential homes provide only a small fraction of residential electricity needs.  Contrary to what the public believes such panels do not work well in high temperature.  When temperature rises above 77 degrees Celsius, those panels provide diminishing returns.  Fancy triple-glazed windows don't make much difference in residential energy efficiency over regular windows.Owen is not encouraged when he looks out to the future.  He does so by looking at current urban developments in Beijing and Dubai.  Although those two cities are culturally different they are both environmental disasters because they are increasingly auto dependent.  Beijing used to be a city of bikers.  But, with modern development Beijing is becoming a city of drivers.  Dubai is according to the author by design the most auto dependent city in the World, even more so than American cities.  Owen notes that many other large cities from emerging markets are adopting this auto-dependent model of urban design.  This gives him much concern because it is the most unsustainable urbanization form.So what is the solution to our environmental problems?  Manhattan...  no the author is not just kidding.  He really means it!  And, his underlying logic is straightforward.  New Yorkers live in a high urban density area.  They live in small spaces and they typically do not own cars, and walk and take public transit everywhere.  Their consumption of electricity, gas, gasoline, and water is a small fraction of the average American.  It is even a smaller fraction of Americans living what seems a more natural lifestyle in the great outdoors such as rural residents in the West.  Any apartment building or sky-rise in New York is far more green than the most high tech green home or the most green commercial campus anywhere.  That is because the NY structures are high density vertical ones associated with space and energy consumption efficiencies.  They are also proximate with no need for driving.  Meanwhile, the "green" homes and commercial campuses are horizontal ones that are highly inefficient from a space and energy standpoint.  Their users need to drive substantial distances to do anything.Owen states we should implement zoning and urban policies that encourage other places to emulate the urban density of Manhattan.  Instead, he feels we do just the opposite as environmentalists consider Manhattan an environmental Armageddon.  Meanwhile, they ignore that Manhattan residents' lifestyle is far more environmentally sustainable than the ones who have returned to nature in Wyoming and else where and have to drive huge distances to go to work, buy groceries, and socialize with each other.Owen mentions several luminaries who had the same understanding of environmental efficiencies decades ago.  One is the mathematician George Danzig, inventor of linear programming, who expanded on the same concepts as Owen inCompact City.  Owen could also have mentioned the visionair architect Paolo Soleri who presented the same themes inArcology: The City in the Image of Man.

$review_text.: I've never watched the episodes of the Real Housewives of NYC with Countess LuAnn Du Lessops. I gather from all the negative reviews, that like most reality TV stars, she comes off as less-than-stellar on the series. Certainly, her music video (YouTube it if you haven't seen it) comes off as laughable, out-of-touch and the very height of unclassy behavior. There are many moments throughout the book, where the Countess' money and lifestyle can anger those who cannot afford the same things. Sections on entertaining guests talk about household staff and giving gifts of monogrammed bathrobes after a dinner party.However, if you can get past moneyed lifestyle anecdotes (and you should be able to, unless you are small-minded) she has some good advice for women in the modern age. Her book is basically a call-to-arms for the overstressed, overworked woman to remember to take care of herself, treat her man and friends well, and be polite.It's easy to pooh-pooh her for not having to work for a living and having the abundant help of household staff. But better to light a candle than curse the darkness. She gives us a framework to aspire toward.For instance, I had forgotten how important is to maintain my wardrobe. Not only to have clothes that look good on me and fit well, but also to keep them in excellent shape - particularly my poor shoes. It reflects badly on me to get all dressed up and look gorgeous, but leave the house in shoes that are scraped and coming apart. Sure, there are more important things in life (pretty much everything), but keeping my shoes in good shape is just another thing I can do to make a good impression on people.This book is a good reminder and great primer on having good manners and behaving in a polite and classy way. I'll never dine with European royalty in their vacation cottages in the Alps, but I will be a shining example of good taste to my friends and family.

$REVIEW.: This book is, background story, based on the Horus Heresy books Thousand Son's and Prospero Burns. These books are not necessary to appreciate this book, it just gives the reader a better context. Overall the book contains interesting aspects of a continuous story that are amazing: the character of the Space Wolves, the Thousand Son's, Magnus, and all their dark motivations.In particular the motivation is something that I must recommend. Both sides have long term motivations that are well designed and depicted. Unfortunately that is as far as I can go without spoiling the actual reasoning behind the invasion of Fenris.Overall, the actual writing was well paced with its sieges, attacks & counter attacks, and the actual invasion of the Fang. The tenacity and hatred that drives both sides is dark and unrelenting. Neither side settles for anything less than the total annihilation of the other group. But only one can win.

When I'm serious about writing, I have about 40 years of independent writing and a book and articles behind me, but I like to mentor other writers.In general, what this writer has to say sells his book, but can be found online and in any library, so I wouldn't pay for it. He does have a few tips on dealing with vanity "publishers," but if a writer is trying to publish that way, they should know what the pitfalls are before they let any manuscript go. If they don't, someone warn them to seek an excellent editor, first, and talk to an approriate attorney.

$review_text.: Others have spoken about the story line, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but I want to talk about the impression the story left me with, The story of Vaughn and Trenyce is one that had me thinking about the characters long after I finished reading the story. Yes, it's that good.  I love the depth Ms. Brown gave each character, and most especially the main character Vaughn. Like all of us he was multi-dimensional with many layers, flawed, so real.  Their relationship had my emotions tied in knots because Ms. Brown rarely takes the story the way you expect.  I enjoyed the conversations Trenyce had with the other female characters, reminiscent of my own heart to hearts with my sister. I could see Trenyce's daughter clearly in my mind's eye,loving and speaking truth as only a child can.  Ms. Brown also gave us a peek into the lives of the grateful and unspoiled rich and famous.  Something you don't too often read about.  Ms. Brown not only gave us a tender, sweet love story, but she gave us a peek into the lives of people, real people like you and me with real issues, and at the end, real hope for a bright future. Thanks, Ms. Brown for sharing your gift with us.

 I only gave it four stars  because it is obviously not great literature and some of the snappy dialogue  became reduntant and mildly annoying
However, that being said, I quickly followed up by purchasing the second book in this series

$review_text.: Tales of an immigrant coming to America and struggling to succeed are abundant, but Girl in Translation by Jean Kwok tells the story of Kim and her Ma as they immigrate to New York City, in the hopes of the American Dream. Kwok tells Kim's story in chapters, made of short cinematic prose that mimic snapshots of a life, and make it easy to get engrossed in the story of Kim and her Ma.  Brought over by her Aunt Paula,  Kim and her Ma move into a roach-infested apartment, with broken windows, and no heat.  Put to work in a factory that pays "per piece," Kim realizes that in order move out the soon-to-be-condemned building she must do well in school.  The novel is told through Kim's perspective, and focuses mostly on her experience at school, with teachers who don't understand her Chinese heritage or that she comprehends very little English.  As Kim's English improves she advances in school, scoring very high on her standardized tests, much to Aunt Paula's dismay and envy.  In addition to Kim's studies, she must help her mother at the factory where she meets her friend Matt.  As the two grow up together in the common setting of the factory, they become really close, with their friendship becoming one of the main centerpieces of the novel.As I was reading this book I was reminded of the films El Norte and Spanglish, both of which detail immigrants experience, the later in particular with a mother/daughter relationship.  However while this book  has tones similar to these movies, the novel has a completely different tone.  The novel starts when Kim is in sixth grade and progresses until she's thirty and with it comes all the subtleties of growing up.  Kwok handles this subject matter with maturity and grace as Kim tries to stay true to what her Ma taught her while assimilating into American society and making friends.  It is in this method of storytelling that Kim's voice comes through, to the point where I thought I was reading a memoir and not a novel, and found myself having to keep reminding myself that the volume in my hands was a work of fiction.  Kim's voice is so present and alive that it felt like she was in the room as I read the book  and found myself relating to her, not as immigrant, but as an intelligent student.Kwok's personable characters and realistic plot make this story come to life and jump off the page with familiar situations and archetypes.  Everyone has had that childhood love interest or a friend who was there when no one else was, and its more likely then not that everyone has one relative that they don't get along with.  Even though all readers of this text might not be first-generation immigrants, Kwok elegantly explains the life and colloquialisms of a Chinese immigrant.However rich the characters may be,  the one thing that always makes a novel for me, is when I can't predict the ending. As I was reading this book I found myself anticipating a fairytale ending, but Kwok turned it on its head in the last twenty pages and made me happy and sad at the same time.  As such, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a delicious and dramatic human story. Readers will be pleasantly surprised to find themselves or someone they know in Kim's personality.Final Grade: B+

 Even though I prefer long sagas filled with characters and situations, this was nice to just read and relax with

 I would recommend this to young teen and up.

$review_text.: Author Wendy Gillissen's spiritual adventure 'Curse of the Tahiera' succeeds on so many levels; her characters have personality, depth and personal history, the fantasy environment is vibrant, detailed and filled with mythic wonder and the storyline is absorbing and well paced from beginning to end. Plan and simple it's one of the most enjoyable fantasy books I've read in a long, long time. However my highest praise for Ms. Gillissen's book is reserved for the deep, profound spirituality oozing from her written words; her understanding of the nature of dreams, her innate knowledge of the unseen but sometimes felt lifeforce emanating from the world (or worlds?) around us and the way in which she reveals the spiritual underpinnings and karmic destiny that ultimately determine who and what we are. Many writers have attempted to wed their own personal spiritual paradigm with literary fiction and generally the results are less than satisfying. Either the 'message' overpowers the story to such a degree that the fiction is delivered flat and contrived, or the author is forced to compromise the 'message' for the sake of the tale and the readers entertainment. In both cases both the author and the reading audience are left unsatisfied and wanting.In the case of 'Curse of the Tahiera' both of these pitfalls have been successfully and masterfully avoided! If you're looking for nothing more than pure fantasy entertainment this is the book for you. On the other hand if you're looking for a generous dose of spiritual insight that will help guide you in answering some of those inner nagging questions and doubts we all carry with us this is also the book for you. Now if you're looking for both, this must be your lucky day!

$REVIEW.: This was the first book by Ian McDonald I have read. The plot was interesting, even engaging at times. But the writing was horribly loose and overwritten, and especially in the beginning before I got used to large amount of Portuguese words scattered everywhere this was really, really slow read.Why say something simply, when you can use a few flowery and long sentences without commas to say the same thing? :-) This book didn't give me any need to sample something else McDonald has written. Second this years' Hugo nominated book I have read. At this time "No award" is still my first choice in the novel category.

I was enchanted by the sprinkling of short descriptive phrases that were sprinkled throughout the story allowing me to taste, feel and see what the main character was experiencing in such a rich way. I had a bit of a time working my way through the first 50 pages. I had almost given up when the story seemed to open up and did not let me go.

$REVIEW.: I had a hard time caring about this book. The first half had no real emotion. It felt like a narrative--this person went there, that person did this, etc. When things happened, I didn't really care because I didn't really know any of the characters or how they felt. About half way through, emotion finally made an appearance and I enjoyed the book until the end when it went back to the unfeeling narrative.

$review_text.: I had high hopes for this one, in light of the pros working with Nee. It just seemed to degenerate into a political polemic, however, about half way through; almost like two mini-books with stange pacing by the editor. Without trying to, I found myself mentally substituting "Al Qaeda" for IRA, trying unsuccessfully to differentiate in my mind why these guys were substantially different from middle eastern "freedom fighters". Left unexamined was the tragic way his family started him on his path in life, making him a really angry guy in general. Despite service in the USMC, he doesn't refer to himself as an American throughout most of the book. I really wish I could have liked this one more but I know plenty of guys like Nee who made better life choices.

$review_text.: As a self-proclaimed homoerotic novel--"one-handed reads," as I refer to them--The Broken H, by J.L
Langley [Loose Id LLC 2007] is better than some
Oh, there are plenty of sex scenes (15 in all, give or take one or two), but journalistically speaking the writing is quite solid, and the author has made an attempt to build a plot between the romps in the sack


Admittedly the plot is a bit short on originality, but the point is that there is one.Shane Cortez is a runaway with a mysterious past--although we don't find out what that is until quite late in the story

Nevertheless, he now seems well adjusted as foreman of The Broken H Ranch
The Hunters, a remarkably liberal family--including their gay son, Grayson--have unofficially adopted Shane as a son, and Grayson has fallen lustfully in love with him
It is nonetheless a rocky romance, made more difficult by a teenage bimbo who accuses Shane of knocking her up

Her father, a somewhat stereotypical loudmouthed redneck, then sets out to demand that Shane make an `honest woman' of her.Meanwhile, he and Grayson are filling page-after-page with "homoerotic sex" at the drop of an elastic band [see the story for an explanation].If a nice light read without too many challenging plot twists is your forte, then this story is bound to fill the bill.

There were some typos, but not enough to distract me from finishing the books.I still find if frustrating, though, that these writers charge fees for books with errors. If they have editors, they should ask for some of their money back, because it's inexcusable. If I stumble on errors as I read these books, I don't understand how editors (whom I assume are paid for their services) miss them.

$review_text.: Love PotionsA Warlocks MacGregor NovelContemporary Scottish Magickal RomanceA little magickal mischief never hurt anyone...Erik MacGregor, from a clan of ancient Scottish warlocks, isn't looking for love. After centuries, it's not even a consideration...until he moves in next door to Lydia Barratt. It's clear that the shy beauty wants nothing to do with him, but he's drawn to her nonetheless and determined to win her over.Lydia Barratt just wants to be left alone to grow flowers and make lotions in her old Victorian house. The last thing she needs is a demanding Scottish man meddling in her private life. Just because he's gorgeous and totally rocks a kilt doesn't mean she's going to fall for his seductive manner.But Erik won't give up and just as Lydia let's her guard down, his sister decides to get involved. Her little love potion prank goes terribly wrong, making Lydia the target of his sudden embarrassingly obsessive behavior. They'll have to find a way to pull Erik out of the spell fast when it becomes clear that Lydia has more than a lovesick warlock to worry about. Evil lurks within the shadows and it plans to use Lydia, alive or dead, to take out Erik and his clan for good.Review:If you like fun, paranormal romances....then you should pick this one up!Now, I have never read this author before, but if all of them a filled with this fun, witty, snarky, dialog...sign me up for more of her books.  So, I was sneaking reading this one at work and there were quite a few times, that I had to stop myself from laughing out loud while reading.  Loved the part where Erik is been whammied with a love potion and he is singing outside of Lydia's house.The book is not all fun and games though, there are some nastys out to get at not only Erik's power, but someone is obsessed with Lydia.  This story is full of magickal beings; warlocks, witches, ghosts, and shapeshifters and though it has all these things the Author did a great job of blending them all into a cohesive world/story.I loved the characters from Erik and his sexy, alpha male self to Lydia, who starts out shy and reclusive but comes into her own while dealing with Erik, his family and all the things happening around her.  Erik's family is fun, they are like a bunch of 10 year old's living in adult bodies...they are always up to mischief but are right there to help each other out in a crisis.  I am hoping we get to see more of Lydia's best friend Charlotte, the poor thing gets put through the wringer in this book, so hopefully she will get a HEA.Great story and I cannot wait until the next in the series!!!4 Stars

$REVIEW.: From undoubtedly one of the best quality comic-book series ever comes the Big Book Of Vice:fans of this incredible series know all too well that what's to be expected here is a very-in-depth look into the subject (vice) with the aid of some of the best contemporary comic-makers around.Your illustrated journey includes:-tobbaco. Its superbly interesting history plus the all (not) too well hazards it pertains to as well as all the marketing trickeries involved in its spread.-prostitution. Again, its history as the &quot;world's oldest profession&quot; (you'll discover stuff beyond imagination on this one) plus the wide spectrum of vice and illegality it brings with it..-gambling. Probably the most spectacular and eye-opening section of the book. Check out the stunningly imaginative scams of lotteries, pro-betters and pro-cheaters, card playing, and some of the most infamous bets ever made!-and a &quot;general&quot; section on vice which even includes the &quot;danger&quot; posed by comics as seen by some of society's less liberal sectors.As usual, drawn with tremendous gusto and funny as hell, this is a proud addition to the series. Even if your acquaintence with this series begins here be warned: odds are you will be hooked. And yes, i'd take a nice lil wager on that too.Precious stuff.

$REVIEW.: I have learned many languages in my IT career, but Java has not been one of them.  Since I work with people who program in Java, I decided to read this book to help me better understand the Java Language.Like the other Murach books I have read, this book excels in explaining the subjects it covers.  For experienced developers, the "Paired Page" layout (explanation text of the left page, examples on the right) is an easy way to understand the syntax of this language.  But in this book, I found it important to read the descriptive explanation of the left.  The descriptions on the left side were essential in helping me understand how strings and dates are handled differently in Java then any other language I have worked with.  I feel that this book will teach you how to become a beginning level Java if you read it and apply the exercises in the book.  The examples on the right pages of this book are superb. I wish other authors would learn from Murach how code their examples.  I especially liked how the examples in this book build off the prior examples in explaining Java concepts.There are something's that I wish were different about this book. One of my main complaints about this book is in how this book is organized. In most computer programming books I have read and use as a reference book, the author will completely define the different aspects of the language elements in the same place.  In this book I found the description on how to use the if statement scattered over many different chapters. This was true of other Java elements as well. This makes this book less effective as a reference book after you have become proficient in Java.  I also found some of the book was devoted to a particular style of Java development.  This book teaches the camel notation, which a Java developer friend of mine said is not the way most professional Java code is written.  I also don't agree with the author's opinion about not needing to commenting code if the code is easy to read and be understood.  That is not something that should be taught to new developers.I also showed this book to one of my Java developer friends at work. After doing a brief review of this book he told me that he wouldn't call this book a complete reference book on Java.  He feels that the book is a good beginner to mid-level book for those wanting to learn Java. What he liked about the book was: how the book used Class Diagrams; the use of hands-on working applications that are not too complicated to illustrate the books concepts.  His only negative comment about the book was that this book lightly touches a lot of areas that would require the reader additional research to implement the solutions found in this book fully.Overall, I would recommend this book for people new to development and wanting to learn Java.  This is also a great book if you want a detailed explanation about how different parts of Java work.  It is also a great book defining Java coding examples.  The only thing that I wouldn't recommend this book as is a reference book because of how the descriptions of the different language elements are scattered and not written together.

$REVIEW.: This is a short read from an author I know by her real name, Rebecca Raisin

Rebecca writes romance, Billie Jones writes humour.The author asked if I would like to read this story as I have read her stuff before and loved it
It is a very quick read and is a satirical take on monster type movies


It's a bit like a Scary Movie type take on those disaster movies we all love to hate! Or hate to love!The basis of the story is the fact there's a typhoon hitting Australia, but with the added danger of having snakes within it

Kez is sent to investigate due to being a herpetologist, someone who studies reptiles and amphibians.On the way to check things out disaster strikes as Kez and her pilot fly into one of the typhoons

What follows is sooo funny I can't begin to go into it without spoiling things


But here are a few of my favourite parts.&#8220;It&#8230;.t&#8230;.t&#8230;.t&#8230;.&#8221; he manages.I wrench his face closer to mine,&#8221;Snakes! Is it raining snakes?&#8221;&#8220;Y&#8230;.y&#8230;.y&#8230;.y&#8230;.&#8221;&#8220;This might take a while,&#8221; Bluey says, glancing over at me.&#8220;Yeah, the venom is working it's way around his bloodstream.&#8221;&#8220;No, not because of that
He's got a stutter.&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&#8220;Where's Jay?&#8221; I finally ask.&#8220;He's outside.&#8221;&#8220;What! What about the snake typhoon?&#8221;&#8220;Controlled, for now

Jay erected one of those plastic wraps, Under the Dome TM, you can buy from the shopping channel

He got two for the price of one, so he was happy to share

He also got a set of steak knives, but he's going to sell those online.&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&#8220;Found something!&#8221; Cindi splashes over, holding my laptop and I hope to God she doesn't drop it in the water

I have a lot of ebooks saved on it.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;That last one is something I can totally connect with! Lol Also the way the main character Kez constantly talks about the &#8220;secret government department&#8221; is like a running joke throughout the story.There are so many other passages I could have highlighted, especially near the end when you find out what has to be done to solve the puzzle of what's going on, but that would just spoil things as it's such a short read.A highly recommended read from me.

$REVIEW.: Good to read for interesting non-canonical scriptures other than what you find these days in published collections of New Testament apocrypha, usually Gnostic writngs, which are currently quite popular though what is today regarded as mainstream was shaped to a significant degree in reaction against them. The material in this book, while not part of the Bible as it is known today, has often had a direct positive relationship with what most traditional churches accept as orthodox. In fact much of this material was excluded from the canon for being so transparently written to justify the needs of the evolving orthodoxy of most of the current churches.

$review_text.: I love Kale so i loved this little novella about what Kale got up to while Alexa was in Las Vegas. It was amusing to read what happened as i expected Kale to go back to his old ways and be in charge of The Wicked Kiss is something i also found amusing as i always see Kale has the bad boy vampire and this novella just proves that. It's nice to get into the minds of the other characters and i was really pleased when i found out that Kale was having his own novella. Brilliant read and it has kept me anxious for September Moon.

$REVIEW.: Zen in the Art of Writing is a collection of essays which provides autobiographical information on Ray Bradbury's life and some advice on the writing life. Honestly, when I picked up this book I was expecting more. Although there was some interesting details on Mr. Bradbury's background, and a few snippets of writing advice here and there; the book in general did not live up to my expectations.A few ideas that he seemed to emphasize throughout his essays included utilizing word association as a creative tool, writing a lot (at least 1000 words a day), relaxing while writing, letting the writing flow through you - the writer, allowing the subconscious to come out and play through the writing process, letting your individual story flow through the stories that you write, and to write with feeling.I liked 3 of his essays, `The Secret Mind,' `How to keep and Feed a Muse,' and `Zen in the Art of Writing.' I also found a couple of the included poems inspiring. Furthermore, I learned new facts about Ray Bradbury's life. However, as a textbook on creativity, I don't see what the rave is about. Sure, understanding an author's life and how they became a writer may provide inspiration to wannabe writers, but everyone is different. What may work for one writer may not for another. Therefore, if you are a Ray Bradbury fan; if you want to understand how writing became his passion, then yes, read this book. However, if you are seeking general advice on writing methods, I would recommend looking someplace else.
$SUMMARY.: A good autobiography, but as a writing manual - ?

$REVIEW.: I love that Jimmy brings not only his personal experience and knowledge on this subject, but has brought in medical and other experts from around the world. There's a non-bias believability about this book that I can finally use to explain to family and friends why they shouldn't be taking statin drugs for "preventative" measures. Anything you could ever have a question on is answered in this book, based on the reality of cholesterol in the body (good and bad) rather than the now disproven belief that "fat makes you fat." Cholesterol Clarity finally highlights the real information that needs to be shared: inflammation is the cause of disease, not fat ... damaged fats and other inflammatory foods are the REAL cause of heart and health issues!

$REVIEW.: Have you ever been reading a book and have to put it away for a bit and catch yourself wondering what the characters are doing?  This one grabbed me like that.  Every time I put it down, I wondered how Cooper and Kayla were getting along without me.  Crazy, of me, but I like it when an author is able to grab me and pull me in like that.I met Cooper and Kayla in an airport waiting area.  Cooper is attacked by a candy cane wielding child and falls, quite literally, at Kayla&#8217;s feet.  They exchange greetings and pleasantries and in Kayla&#8217;s quirky, actuarial habit of sharing statistics, she reveals her extreme fear of flying.  The dialogue between the two of them here is clean and clear and lacks a lot of that nervous, first meeting, stilted conversation.  I enjoyed getting to know them both this way.  After realizing Kayla is in first class Cooper decides to upgrade to first class so that he can help distract her. And does. He. Ever. Wow. The hottest sex scene of the book takes place on an airplane.Kayla is a statistician heading from Maine to North Carolina for her younger sister&#8217;s wedding.  Cooper is an ex-Marine heading to North Carolina to begin his new career in private security.  Their chemistry is sweet and hot and sweet all over again.  One of my favorite scenes in the books takes place at the end when Cooper realizes that, in order to keep her, he&#8217;s going to have to do something way over the top, so he faces one of his biggest fears to win the girl.This book is a first for me by this author, but I do not intend to let it be my last! 4 of 5 stars

$REVIEW.: Synopsis: The basic premise of this book is that American Christians have distorted the message of Christianity to fit into the ideals of the "American Dream." This essentially means that American Christians are overly materialistic and selfish with their time and money. It also means that they view Christianity as a consumer product, thus rendering church services to be professional entertainment and Christianity to be a product that is consumed, not a life-changing truth. Platt offers explanation to how these views do not agree with the real message of Christianity and finally gives a "challenge" which will aid the American Christian in overcoming these American distortions of the faith.My Opinion: I have been putting off writing this (and honestly if writing it was not part of the agreement for receiving it I probably would not be writing this) because I have to say that something early in the book put a bad taste in my mouth so I feel like possibly that skewed my opinion of the rest of the book, so take that as a sort of disclaimer. What was that thing at the beginning of the book? Platt tells a story of a group of believers in his Alabama mega-church who hear about some Christians in Asia facing persecution who must meet in secret to study the Bible. These believers in Platt's church are inspired by these Asian Christians so they start a regular evening Bible Study and call it "Secret Church." To me this seems to trivialize and make light of the very real persecution of fellow Christians in these dangerous regions. Platt seems to agree with this criticism but never applies it to his church's "Secret Church." Toward the end of the book he explains about the ichthus (Jesus Fish):How far we have come when we paste this symbol identified with martyred brothers and sisters in the first century onto the backs of our SUVs and luxury sedans in the twenty-first century.Beyond this I felt that the book seemed to say a lot of the "right things" but never really got to the heart of the problem. Platt tries to offer advice in correcting these American distortions of Christianity, but he does so within the very system that has created and fostered these ideas. This seems to miss the very heart of the issue. He tries to encourage people to give generously to those in need, yet he pastors a mega-church which is a resource black-hole. He tries to encourage people to minister to each other, yet says nothing about the false distinction between clergy and laity. He encourages people to be sold out to Christ and never look back, yet he offers a "Challenge" or program to try out and see how it feels. Something in me has a hard time with a book titled "Radical" which opposes the American Dream, yet culminates in a one year program. Maybe I'm just being too critical. That is quite possible.This book exposes a lot of real problems within the American Church, what I feel it does not do is offer valuable solutions to those problems, and this is mostly because it never gets to the heart of those problems. I see two major oversights in Radical. The first is that he never asks the reader if they are truly even Christians. I think that would be the place to start. If you have a lack of passion for the things you say you believe, and if you believe a distortion of the real thing it would certainly be worthwhile to initially ask "do I believe the real thing?" The second oversight, in my opinion, is that he completely ignores the negative effect of the clergy/laity distinction. Why don't people live out their faith? Because they pay someone else to do that for them. Give money to missionaries and pastors and ministries. They are the professionals and that's what they get paid for. This is how Americans view everything and the clergy/laity distinction brings that belief into the church.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review as part of their Blogging for Books program.

$REVIEW.: **I received an ARC from the author for an honest review**The first book, Let Love In, was amazing! And this book was amazing as well and did NOT disappoint me! I love Maddy and Reid to death. I'm still waiting for Reid to come and kidnap me *winks*.So Maddy has left the hospital after her car accident. She's just found out that she's pregnant and Reid has walked away from her, leaving her all alone. She's not quite sure what she's going to do. Her whole life has changed in the blink of an eye because of a tiny little being growing within her. She's going to have to rethink college, get a job, find insurance. And will Reid come back into her life so that he can be a part of the life of their child? There are so many unanswered questions! And she's not sure if she's going to be able to handle everything. With the help of her best friend, Mel, and Momma though... she'll be able to make it.Reid didn't walk away. Maddy pushed him away. And he's not sure how to handle that. Maddy told him that if he can't deal with the past and his mom that maybe he doesn't have what it takes to love her. He keeps going round and round about this. He's going to have to deal with his past because he definitely wants Maddy in his life. What's he going to do if he can't deal with the past and move on from the fear? Will Maddy not take him back?I loved reading and watching everything unfold between them again. They both have a lot of soul searching to do. I fell in love with these characters all over again as they went through their struggles, made their realizations, and tried to heal from their past. If you fell in love with the first book then you should definitely read this second book! It will make you laugh, cry, gasp, and giggle! I give this book 5 bright and shining stars!

$REVIEW.: This series has its strengths and its weaknesses. Personally, I love it. This author has a way with characters, with making them authentic and interesting, even with their faults and weaknesses.This installment picks up approximately 2 years after the previous book. Not filled with nearly as much angst, Lily and Anna are going strong, in love with each other, and their lives with one another as their extended family gets ready to welcome another member in the form of Kim's and Hal's child, Lily is courted for a prestigious job, and Anna prepares to take on additional community responsibilities. Then Lily is unexpectedly reconnected with her past, and suddenly the two women have to reexamine how they define family, and what they want theirs to be.The interactions with children in this book are precious. I can't help it: I'm a sap. They aren't always comfortable, but that's what being around small children is like. I also like that Anna and Lily, despite some serious issues that come up, are always rock-solid in their relationship. It was a pleasure to spend more time with these characters and their families as they continue to grow an change. A fantastic end to a trilogy (though as I post this review written quite some time ago, there is a th book now) I can't help but revisit repeatedly.

$review_text.: Searching for another kick-ass urban fantasy heroine? Look no further, because McKenzie Lewis has arrived. Caught in a fascinating war between the fae king and the rebel faction, she is kidnapped by the rebellion, who wants to use her special cartography skills for their own means. McKenzie fights to escape in some seriously great action scenes, but gradually she starts to wonder whether the truth behind the war is even more complex than she ever imagined.What's intriguing about McKenzie is that unlike most other urban fantasy heroines, she's not a warrior. She has no magic sword, she doesn't have mad martial arts skills, and hell, she can't even fire a gun. But she is an exceptionally gifted shadow reader, a person who can see the trace imprints left behind when one of the fae has teleported to another location. The author does an amazing job of showing us how special McKenzie is, particularly in scenes involving a tracking test that's set up for her by the rebels. This girl is fierce and determined and fearless and funny, and I liked how she actually thinks and reasons. You know how sometimes you want to yell at the page because something should be occurring to the heroine, but it doesn't because the author wants to let the story drag on? It's like McKenzie hears you yelling loud and clear and answers you immediately in her actions. But I also like that she's so very human in the middle of all the powerful magic and power plays exhibited around her. She miscalculates, she doesn't know whom to trust, and she actually bleeds and feels pain in a jarring, wince-inducing way.And yeah...there are a couple of really sexy guys in this book. McKenzie's been waiting 10 years for something to happen in her forbidden relationship with the strong and principled Kyol, the king's swordsman; but her rebel captor, Aren, is also strangely compelling, with awesome healing powers and a pesky habit of making her feel things for him that she shouldn't be feeling. Love triangles are usually equal parts agonizing and annoying, but the romantic entanglements are handled incredibly well here. It's like the Dorian-Kiyo thing from the Dark Swan series, but done in a much more sophisticated, non-icky, non-frustrating way. I like that everyone behaves honorably and that fae politics and war add so many complicated layers to the situation; while everyone has secrets and agendas, it's clear why both men are so attractive to McKenzie, because both are certainly very attractive to us. The electricity running under her skin whenever she's touched by one of the men is incredibly hot, especially considering that there is no actual sex in any of these relationships. Yet.I'm really happy to find another great series, especially one that features such a smart and funny heroine and a well-plotted story. If you're a fan of Richelle Mead, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, or Chloe Neill, don't wait another minute! This could just be the urban fantasy series you've been waiting for.

$REVIEW.: Kyra used to be the girl with the bad reputation. A reputation she may have earned but she&#8217;s trying to redeem herself for her past mistakes. When she gets to meet with the somewhat reclusive but very famous band, Triple Cross, Kyra is a little star struck &#8211; and she has met her fair share of A-List celebrities. But Zach Wechsler is different. He&#8217;s even better than in Kyra&#8217;s fantasies. Can Kyra manage to keep her past a secret and have a chance with the clean cut pop sensation or will things between Kyra and Zach be over before they even cot a chance to began?If you&#8217;ve read Someone Else&#8217;s Fairytale or Nobody&#8217;s Damsel by Emily Mah Tippetts, Kyra would be familiar to you. Break it Up is a spinoff focusing on Jason&#8217;s niece, Kyra. She&#8217;s not the wild child she was but rather maturing into a respectable member of society. Kyra owns her own mistakes but is trying to leave it in the past and make something of her future. She&#8217;s an interesting character. I liked that she didn&#8217;t judge others for their actions because she&#8217;d been there, done that and it wasn&#8217;t her place remark on how they choose to live their lives. Her relationships with her family was great to read about. Whilst this book can be read as a standalone I thought it was interesting to see Kyra&#8217;s perception of characters that I had grown to love before from Chloe&#8217;s story.I thought that Triple Cross were fun. Somewhere between One Direction and the Jonas Brothers, they&#8217;re three young men who are in the middle of flux. Their mom-ager (mother manager) was recently cut loose and now they&#8217;re having to fend for themselves for the first time in their lives. Zach is the ultimate dream boy&#8230; and Kyra isn&#8217;t immune from his charm. But I found him to be a little immature and he read very young. A little too young for the world wise Kyra. I would have liked him more had he taken a little more responsibility for what was happening to him and his band rather than just hoping something would magically solve all their problems. Romance wise &#8211; Kyra and Zach&#8217;s chemistry was lovely. They compliment each other so well and I was rooting for them from the start.It was great to be back in the world EM Tippetts has created. Her characters are three-dimensional &#8211; each with their own flaws which makes them that much more relatable and enjoyable to read about. She writes fantastic New Adult novels that are interesting and clean. I enjoyed reading this book and loved that it is a complete story &#8211; with no nasty cliffhangers!

$REVIEW.: 3 1/2 STARS .... Was crazy about COLLIDE ...one of my favourite books just absolutely LOVED IT!However, PULSE was lacking a bit for me and I was a little disappointed (especially as I had been so looking forward to it).I really wanted to LOVE it and I tried but just found I was reading to get to the end ... skipping chunks .... didn't like the dream sequence at all.  It kind of went the way a few of these books have gone -- it was a bit drawn out.I loved the beginning - but then it became too smarmy -- too much without any real tension.  There were so many things I thought might have happened -- but just didn't progress anywhere ... I thought Gavin had changed slightly between Collide and Pulse ... I still liked the 'bottle tops' though.There were a few weird things -- the buying of the extremely expensive watch when he already had a $200,000 watch ?The driving without a licence -- that whole scene just didn't seem like their characters to me and didn't develop the characters anywhere.I stayed with it - but it wasn't a 'couldn't put it down' read for me this time.

$REVIEW.: ****WARNING SOME SPOILERS*****I picked up Wild Card as an erotica freebie, and was instantly sucked into the story. It's a romantic tale between two strong main characters which takes place 50 years after what I am assuming was World War 3.Ginny and Jack were terrific characters, but to be honest, I fell in love with Hazel and Ollie and it wasn't even their story...they were secondary characters who apparently have their own story in book two. (Which I will be buying as soon as I am done writing this review!)I had some issues with the book...but not too many. And nothing that maybe a full length novel that takes place in this world wouldn't solve? (Hint Hint Moira...aka Donna and Bree) I want to 'see' the werewolves change. Only Jack as a wolf then Ginny turns around at the sound of his voice. I want to know more about what happened in the war, I want more background on Ginny and Jack and Hazel and Ollie...and I know there's a third which I am assuming is Lottie's story? So maybe I'll get the 'more' I want from the next two books.It's a fun, quick, erotic read, with great characters. I can't wait to read the next two books, and I am hoping the authors have written more in this world.

 On the other hand, even though we worked together for some time, I still do not know what David's convictions are, and I don't think he knows either."Lamont then went to say that shortly after speaking to the reporter, he met Cameron himself, who told Lamont his answer was spot-on and admitted he was not sure what his convictions were.This got me thinking about Tony Abbott
He is intelligent and articulate and that necessary EQ component of all leaders, the desire to win (which in this case is becoming the prime minister) and spends much time putting down his opponent

 And in case anyone thinks this only occurs in Australia, may I suggest they watch the US presidential debates.However, Lamont raised an interesting idea: whether a prime minister (or any leader) can be deemed to be successful unless she or he has convictions

I have just finished reading journalist David Marr's recent essay The Making of Tony Abbott
Marr is bemused by Abbott - he tries to understand what makes him tick but fails.His essay focuses on Abbott's nurture but spends little time on his nature
 He spends an inordinate amount of time on Abbott's time at university
However what you do get from reading the essay is that Abbott is a conviction politician


You may not agree with some of his values: Catholicism, monarchy, anti-abortion, etc, but what you have to admire is his willingness to both debate and stand up for his values.Many people doubt that Abbott has what it takes to be prime minister but even Marr concedes that Abbott was an excellent health minister - one of the major portfolios in the federal government


 Even more interesting is that Marr defines one half of Abbott as "Values Abbott" in contrast to the other half, which he deems "Politics Abbott"
 While everyone has focused on the wall banging incident and whether it occured or not, it may be that Marr has unlocked (unintentionally because he is Labor to the core) why Abbott could be as successful a Prime Minister as say John Howard.

$SUMMARY.: Abbott may have what it takes to be a successful PM

$review_text.: Return to Shirley Plantation is an interesting and unique Civil War story. It takes place in the now-historical buildings and grounds of Shirley Plantation in Virginia. The author skillfully brings readers into this moment of time in 1862, when the Union army takes over the plantation and turns it into a field hospital. Readers feel the anxiety of the family members of the home, and feel the pain of the men injured and dying.Against this background, we read the story of Angelina, a former slave, who is only one-eighth  African American. Angelina's anxiety level is at maximum as she deliberates her next move, but waits on God to direct her. What plans does God have for her and why does she feel such an attraction to one wounded soldier?This book is especially thought-provoking as it focuses the issue of mixed heritage. It is interesting to read about those slaves who actually appeared to be white, but were considered black, because they had a fraction of African blood.I enjoyed reading this story. It should appeal to everyone who likes historical fiction of the Civil War period.

$review_text.: Michael Greenberg parcels out slices of his soul -- per his editor's instructions, a drop of blood and 1,100 words at a time -- in "Beg, Borrow, Steal: A Writer's Life." Each of the stories in this pocket-size volume originally appeared in the weekly Times Literary Supplement (published in London), which explains both the word count and some of the grittiness.Greenberg has given his life and subsumed some personal relationships in his quest to put just the right words on paper. Many people wish to write; very few are able to continue to pursue their passion when they are faced with numerous obstacles. Greenberg and his muse, however, are made of sterner stuff. Words and muse cohabit his mind while his body performs a numbing succession of dead-end jobs as he establishes himself in his chosen profession. Greenberg details several of them here. Some of his recollections are wry, but others are more painful to read, as are several of his descriptions of his relationship with his father.What remains most strongly with me about Greenberg's words and his choices is his clarity of vision. He knows his background and understands how it continues to inform his choices. In one particularly telling passage, Greenberg describes a relationship with a grifter who recognizes his hunger for exotic human attachment."Beg, Borrow, Steal: A Writer's Life" is best consumed in small servings, the way you'd nibble a square of extra-dark European chocolate while sipping an espresso. Biting, slightly bitter, but worth the patient investment of time.

$REVIEW.: The plot of this book was very interesting and well developed, however the writing itself was not as well done.  The author used several modern phrases - such as the clothes were "dressy" and the characters "hung out" together - that really distracted from the historical setting for the story. Also, when describing the romantic relationship between the two main characters, the writing suddenly became very juvenile - like overly romanticized language a tween would use.Overall, it's not a bad read, but it certainly isn't the most well written novel to be found.

$review_text.: This is an interesting theory. In fact it is a slightly more robust and sophisticated off-shoot of the "renegade CIA officers did it" theory. However, the critical element -- of linking it to Clint Murchison -- shows up here as being mostly rhetorical, and thus is weak at best. The language used on page 155 is that "Murchison could have easily arranged the meeting between Cord Meyer and LBJ." However, is it unfair to point out that the authors are way too far down the road and into the weeds to be using as the finally linking connection, a "mealy-mouth" phrase such as "could have easily been arranged?"In any case, the LBJ/Cord Meyer angle is an E. Howard Hunt death bed concoction. Which raises another fair question to ask: Who in their right mind would believe anything that E. Howard Hunt would say, especially since he never admitted being the third "faux tramp" taken from a train in full view of the world and arrested only yards away from the Grassy Knoll the day of the assassination? Is that what he refers to as being a "bench warmer?" And with the exception of "Poppy Bush," and Richard Nixon, Hunt is also the only man in the known universe who did not know where he was on the day JFK was murdered? (Did he not lose a million dollar law suit to the Liberty Lobby and Spotlight Magazine on the basis of lying about where he was on that fateful day?) And did his son, St. John Hunt, not confirm that Court verdict by insisting that his mom had told him "that daddy is on a business trip to Dallas" -- as well as recognizing his father unmistakably as being the third tramp in the picture shown across the world on that fateful day?It must be said too that this "LBJ/Cord Meyer did it" version, spun from Hunt's devious mind, still retains the same old contours of, and smells like, CIA  disinformation. Perhaps this is the last in a fifty-year long series of CIA hangout positions. Let's hope the next theory will be the one that finally moves up the stairs to the top of the Langley hierarchy. This is a long-winded way of saying that the parts of this well-researched and well-rehearsed narrative do not all fit into a single completed puzzle: The sum of the parts are still much greater than the whole? It leaves the JFK assassination still "an over-determined system," with too many left over parts pointing in every conceivable direction? (Just like a successful intelligence operation is supposed to do, right?)To wit: We now know that there were at least four teams of shooters in Dealey's Plaza that fateful day -- six if you consider LBJ's designated hit man, Mac Wallace, and Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, as separate teams. As well, a cascading sequence of theories have evolved over time that are best defined by a single dimension: how far away from the nest of high-level vipers residing deep within the bowels of Langley, they were.First there was the lone nut commie theory. Then there was the Castro friendly Communist cabal theory that LBJ used to recruit Earl Warren to Chair the Warren Commission. Then there was the violent anti-Castro cabals in combination with David Ferrie and Clay Shaw -- the Jim Garrison theory. Then there was the New Orleans branch of the mob theory. Then the mob in cahoots with renegade CIA agents and anti-Castro revolutionaries, theory. Then the Jimmy Hoffa did it theory.Now its the LBJ and Cord Meyer did it theory. And even though the book pointed to yet another theory, in the end it left "the GHW Bush and his CIA friend's did it" theory, hanging in the air. May I suggest that since with these last two theories, we have already breached the gates of Langley, there is nothing really left to do but to go straight to the top of the Langley pyramid and finally pin the tail on the donkeys they belong to: Allen Dulles, Richard Helms and James Jesus Angleton. Fifty years later, we know that nothing could have happened without them knowing about it and directing it, so why are we still pussy-footing around with these low-level theories? Yes, LBJ was a crude megalomaniacal sociopath but always at the beck and call of the plutocratic oil interest. Never and independent operator. So, the sixty-four thousand dollar question is: was LBJ, Ed Clark and Cliff Carter capable of pulling off such a complex operation? I seriously doubt it?Regarding having an "over-determined system" and the cowardly omitted Poppy Bush theory, may I ask: What do we now do with all the recently uncovered extra parts, that when carefully connected, lead directly to GHW Bush's door steps as being the most likely CIA operational manager of the JFK assassination? To wit: He succeeded Richard Nixon as head of "Operation 40," the anti-Cuban group of trained and operation ready assassins (that even this book suggests morphed from a "get Castro hit team," into a "get JFK hit team.") And this remains true even if at the time Mr. Bush was still "plausibly denying" that he was in the CIA at all. Despite his denials, it nevertheless has been argued that GHWB, among many other things, was also the moving force behind Watergate (helping from his CIA perch, with his hand-picked team working as plumbers in the White House basement), to oust Richard Nixon.Plus, one of Bush's best friends, John Ashton Crichton, as this book so astutely points out, was all over the assassination map in the run up to the assassination and during the motorcade: from helping LBJ and John Connelly plan JFK's trip to Dallas, to being a close friend of the owner of the Book Depositary building, DH Bryd; to having his key aide drive the lead car in the motorcade, to being a ranking officer in the Texas 488th military intelligence detachment (that had close ties with the DPD and that was instructed to "stand-down" the day of the assassination), to being a close friend of LBJ, Clint Murchinson and HL Hunt, both of whom are reputed to have financed the murder.Moreover, Bush's friend Crichton also attended the assassination-eve final coordination party at Clint Murchinson's house. Add to this the fact that Bush, through "Operation 40," continued to have long-term ties to both E. Howard Hunt, the Cubans he served as case officer for, and the radical factions of the anti-Castro movements; that Bush was also a close friend to George de Mohrenschidlt, who was directed by J. Walton Moore, a CIA operative and Bush friend, to babysit LHO when he returned from Russia (De Mohrenschidlt was also rumored to have received $200k after the assassination while working in Haiti on a project for Zapata Oil, GHW Bush's CIA front company); and a Bush/Crichton theory comes more and more into focus and into the realm of plausibility.Finally and most importantly, is the fact that George Herbert Walker Bush is one of only three people who also has claimed not to know where he was when JFK was shot (the other two, as noted above, are Richard Nixon, and E. Howard Hunt).Yet, Bush, inconveniently has caught his tail in a web of gratuitous lies of his own making in this regard. He has in fact been caught red-handed deploying a series of pre-positioned alibis for not having been in Dealy's Plaza, when there is in fact a wealth of contrary evidence that proves beyond any doubt that he was in fact there?This evidence is made of solid gold and includes among others, a paper trail of FBI memos that not only proves that he was there, but also proves that he was in the CIA at the time of the assassination. Interestingly, included in most of the hard evidence are Bush's own clumsy attempts to cover his trail. However, the piece de resistance is an undeniable picture of him standing in front of his friend DH Bryd's Book Depositary Building at high noon on 11/22/63. How is Mr Bush ever going to explain away this gold-plated but contrary evidence?So, what are we to make of this book as we near the 50th Anniversary of the JFK assassination? I believe it is an honest effort to finally get at the truth: that LBJ clearly was heavily involved in both the planning and the cover-up phases of the assassination. However, I also believe that the JFK assassination was a much too complex conspiracy to have been run out of a "mom-pop"-like shop as LBJ's suite 8F at the Huston Lamar Hotel was.LBJ, Cliff Carter and Ed Clark may have been able to bend business and politics to their will, but they were still "small time operators" no matter how much they saw themselves as an omnipotent "shadow government;" and no matter how much others wish to see them as "untouchables." The JFK assassination was a massive undertaking that required a lot of moving parts; a virtual army of "cut outs," and an overseer with a panoramic vantage point over all of those moving parts, and a huge budget accountable to no one. This leaves only one possibility: the nest of vipers at the top of the clock tower in Langley. Five stars

$REVIEW.: 'Thief' is the first in a fantasy series about the life of Sevy, an orphaned girl who steals to get by and will do anything to get what she wants.Main character Sevy doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities, however seeing the hard life she has been forced to lead from a young age and the things she has had to protect herself from go a long way towards explaining her behaviour and garnering sympathy.  I liked her strong-willed attitude and found her very interesting to read about.  I wasn't that fussed about Jarro, the first person who really shows Sevy any sympathy, but couldn't really put my finger on what I didn't like about him.  I found Revik intriguing and very much enjoyed reading about him.The story starts off sort of slow but I got so immersed in the characters that I really didn't care.  This is a book I didn't want to put down for even a minute, I was surprised by how quickly and entirely the story commanded my attention.  The story was very well plotted out, the tension mounting towards the nail-biting ending.  I was on the edge of my seat by then, horrified by the way events had unfolded.  I won't spoil the plot, I will only say that the ending was extremely tense but after it was all over it was very much a satisfying story that had been told.I loved this book. I bought the second one straight after I put this down and I intend on reading it when I have the time to truly savour it.  Highly recommended fantasy!

$REVIEW.: "Even though it was my face, all I could see was him staring back at me- his eys, his nose, his mouth, his... everything."This is the torment that Kaiya lives with everyday.  She has lived through years of abuse and now has no faith in love.  How can she love someone when the person she loved assaulted her for most of her life?  Years later she is still haunted by her attacker.  To function, she has rules when it comes to sex.  She needs that control that was taken from her. Without it, she feels like she is back in the grips of the evil monster.  Then this is all turned upside down when she decides to take a self defense class at the gym.  The instruction has the reputation as being a ladies man, a womanizer, a man whore.  But Ryker is one thing for sure... he is pure alpha male!  When he sees something he wants, he goes after it and something about Kaiya is different.Ryker is fighting his own demons.  Burned by love in his own right he does not need that long term relationship.  He needs one things from the ladies and has no problem getting it.  Kaiya does not fall at his feet like the others.  Yet there is something deeper in what he feels for her.  Its like he can feel he needs her just as much as she needs him.Their relationship is hot! Smokin hot!!!  Even though Kaiya has her rules, Ryker is determined to break them.  One by one he is determined to get her to open up to him.  Kaiya also feels her defenses falling, and she knows she is also falling for Ryker."He didn't even understand how much I needed him.  He had become the glue that held me together, the stitches that were slowly repairing the scars of my heart."Will the demons that play with Kaiya's emotions be to much for her to be in a relationship?  Can she trust Ryker to be in a committed relationship? When the demons from her past make an appearance, will it be the end of them?  You will need to read to find out!!I love how even though they both feel empty, together they are whole.  With the self defense portion of the novel, it truly feels like I got a lesson in how to better defend myself! You can tell the author did her homework! The author also does a great job dealing with a subject that is difficult, sexual assault and abuse.  Even though Kaiya was a victim, she didn't allow her to be weak.  She became stronger and learned to defend herself.  The moments of weakness are still there but it shows that you can move past a horrible and terrifying event.  Even thought at times its dark and made my skin crawl, I would highly recommend this novel!
$SUMMARY.: Through the darkness, you can find love!

$review_text.: Another great book by Lauren Dane. If you haven't read anything by her yet, you better have enough money and time allotted so you can read her books. I absolutely find her books addicting and this book can be another added to her growing list.Mia is back in her hometown after an attack and the area pack didn't do anything to help find her attackers. Still trying to deal with the aftereffects, she happens to stumble over a handsome shifter who is shot three times with silver bullets. Even though she complains about lugging his huge body into her house, she digs the three bullets out because if she didn't, he would die. When he awakens, she realizes that he is Gibson de La Vega, of the family that has made hers a living hell all those years ago. Whatr she didn't realize was that this was the man who would forever change her life.Gibson is the protector of his pack. He sees a threat that has come into the area and goes to head it off but ends up getting wounded. When he comes to, he finds a strong, delectable woman that has helped him. Every instinct in him is screaming at him to keep her close but he soon finds out that she is Porter and it will make things more challenging. But with a little persuasion from his mother, they help transition Mia's family back into the pack more fully in hopes to make up for his family's mistakes. Of course, the perk of having Mia closer to him is an awesome bonus. But when things get tough, are they able to keep their feeligs solid and intact? Guess you will just have to read it to find out.I loved how well Mia complimented Gibson. Even though she is one tough cookie, she helps soften up the pack protector. Every man needs a woman they can be share their love and passion with and Gibson found the perfect match in Mia. So if you want to read about a great love story with some awesome action thrown in, you've found your book.

Tessa and Gage are an unlikely pair thrown together by Tessa's desperate need to escape her cheating fianc&eacute; and controlling parents and to gain access to an inheritance (so her pregnant sister won't lose her home.) What Tessa doesn't know is that Gage is a convicted murderer. Once I hit the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down! (Clean Romance: No sex, no foul language).

$review_text.: I wholeheartedly agree with the author that autistic people should be embraced for who they are, and that humor is part of that acceptance.  She writes well and the book is full of witticism.  The whole book is anecdotes of experiences with her son and his quirks.  It reminds me of sitting around talking with other moms, except only one mom is talking.  And the stories are funny but also stressful... my son also went through a dog phase--it was cute for a while and then it got scary as I wondered if he'd ever come out of it.  I found myself wanting to put this boy on a GFCF diet and give him some boundaries...  The good Lord gave me my own wonderful children to laugh with and enjoy and correct; it's a bit much to handle reading about the quirks of someone else's child.

$REVIEW.: Whew. This book is hot start to finish. I loved every second of it, even when some of the characters were driving me bonkers. Mols and Drake why must you play with my heart so! I am going to for sure have a hangover from this book. It strayed from the norm and kept my attention beginning to end. Its was just one of those books. An original. Ok lets talk about the actual story.This book follow Molly and her journey to finding love and moving on with her life. She lost her fianc&eacute; at a young age and has since been a single mom. That itself is a feat but she does all she can and uses all the resources she has to provide for her daughter and to do what she has always dreamed, becoming a Chef. I commend her for this. not in any part of this book does she put her own needs about Stellas. Molly is also still moving on form Liam's death those 4 years ago. Her heart was his and thats not something easily given again. I loved her as a character, she was funny, interesting and a great mom. Sometimes I wish she wasn't so hanging on Drakes word, but part of me enjoyed how vulnerable she was with him. It was a give and take with her. I thought at some points she should just stand up for herself and make a choice, but really I commend her on hanging in there with him. True Love is worth it.Drake. OH Drake. I Loved him as a character. He had that tourtured-ish alpha male going on, but he was also tender with the girls. You really got to see his soft side form the get go. I loved that it wasn't something that Mols had to work towards to get out of him. It was just natural. He was sappy and loving, but also domineering and Hot. The perfect Mix.This book had its ups and downs and They definitely had their bumps in the road. Revealing bumps emotionally at that. I felt for the characters and just loved the story line. It was a different and new read which I always love.  It also left me nice and wide open for the next book! Not a cliffhanger per-say but you are holding your breath for the next book :D In addition I got to t read the Prologue Excerpt for Kitchen Scandals and Oh Boy!!!! The writing was great and it was edited wonderfully! I really have no complaints. This is a wonderful novel and a great addition to any romance lovers bookshelf.

$REVIEW.: Today in the USA, we have thousands of men coming home physically and psychologically ravaged by war. With the translation of THIRST we get a thought-provoking little novella by a critically acclaimed Russian author that speaks about the war in Chechnia, and indirectly speaks to many of the struggles of veterans coming home from our wars on terror Afganistan and Iraq.Filled with the somber, nihlistic tone of a stereotypically Russian novel, THIRSTY has a lot of merit as a literary work as well. This is not a book for everyone, but if the reader is interested in literature, and thinking about big issues with a little entertainment, than this book may be for that reader.

I don't paint, I can't do physical art very well, but I was able to use these prompts to create digital art - each card represents my interpretation of these fabulous prompts, and I have worked through nearly all of them!  I was never intimidated into thinking that my method of expression wasn't right or good enough, and I have enjoyed the direction that each card has taken me.  Some were tongue in cheek, some were serious, some were playful.  I love each of my cards and am grateful to my friends who knew me well enough to share this book with me.I have the kindle version, which is a little different to the print version, and perhaps it's not exactly the same as holding this fabulous book in your hand, but I loved being able to download it at 2am when inspiration set in.  ;)Thanks, Sheri, for your fabulous book!!

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this book right to the last page.  It is a good historical account all the way through the Vietnam war, in various corps, which I always enjoy reading from those who had numerous tours there, military or journalistic.  The sweep of reality in various minds as the war progresses over time and place is always an interesting insight for me.  I served in the Mekong Delta during 1966-67, with the 175th Outlaws as a helicopter pilot.  There we witnessed much of what John Laurence describes throughout this lengthy book--in that he is trying to record the pilots' and grunts' memories and emotions while he visits with them.  He always admits the shortcomings of not being able to stay in the field with them, and that is a very interesting aspect of this well-written book.  My book, OUTLAWS IN VIETNAM, covers the life of we helicopter pilots at Vinh Long, but this descriptive work  by Laurence is exacting over time with his experiences, and those of newsmen and military personnel around him.  As a voyage through time in RVN, I see it as a valuable addition to my personal library of books written on the Vietnam Conflict.  This  is a keeper, and will last.

In the end I was just too intreged to stop with a sample. I understand why some readers rated it poorly, it's kind of derogatory toward women. But that's because Justice had a flawed past. I personally enjoyed this book. It had funny LMAO parts as well as sexy hot parts. I wish it could have been longer or part of a series. I would recommend it. If you are in doubt, order a sample.

$review_text.: Diann Hunt was one of the authors of Smitten, a book I really enjoyed, which is why I chose to read Bittersweet Surrender.  This book follows Carly who owns a spa and has a bit of a sweet tooth. Ok, maybe it's more than a bit.  When she starts exchanging emails with her childhood crush (and brother's best friend) and he says that he will be moving back to town, she tries to lose 25 pounds.  Her best friend Scott tries to help her out along the way by taking away all of her chocolate and making her go for walks and runs with him to get her in shape.Her crush Jake comes to town and everything seems to change.  She's not sure she is really in love with him, he is rough and doesn't  take a liking to her advice to making his daughter happy about the move.  Carly's brother C.J. is in a HUGE gambling debt and Carly doesn't want to help him out this time (a breast cancer survivor, she is trying to save up for surgery, not to bail her brother out all the time).  C.J.'s marriage is falling apart and a bunch of secrets come out about Scott's wife and Carly's best friend Ivy, who passed away in a car accident.The book is an easy read and quite interesting once you get in to all the drama that starts to unfold.  Will Carly stay with Jake or has her teen crush faded?  It is very easy to relate to Carly and root for her to suceed not only in her love life, but in realizing her self worth and with her spa business as well.  The book is 259 pages and includes some reading questions at the end if you're reading it in a group!

When you finish reading this you'll understand why us good girls like bad boys. This book has it all, romance, intrigue, suspense, and it's done so very well. Cain and Emma are finally trying to come together as a family. Even though we all wanted to slap Emma senseless in the first book, she is finally coming into her own. It's a great stand alone read but is much more powerful when you've read the first book, The Devil Inside. I actually could not put it down. I hated to see the novel end but I can't imagine where Vali could go from here. How do you improve on perfection? Move over Radclyffe, your competition is here.

$review_text.: Francine Craft is a veteren author whose books I have been reading from Arabesque and Kimani days. She does not disappoint in this latest novel. I would classify this as an interracial, christian romance. Sheba Davis, lost her first husband to suicide. Robert Solomon also lost his spouse tragically. He was a telvangelist and she was the minister of music at Church of the Holy Redeemer.This novel had a touch of everything, and shows that even in a church community there is greed, backstabbing, jealously etc. There was a lot of tragedies, but love triumphed over all. There were a lot of sub characters and i had a little difficulty keeping up with them at times.The only drawback that I found was the length of the novel. At times I found myself skimming over some of the details that I didn't find interesting. Over all it was a very good read and very affordable.

There is information about what mothers, sisters, fathers, brothers, schools, colleges, peer groups and the rest of the community can do to put a stop to the moral threat against this generation of girls faces


There are real-life examples as well as examples from today's media about the grown-up issues that even young girls have to deal with.While there is a lot of bible-quoting and the like, I feel like there is excellent advice even for those who are not religious but still want better for their daughters
It's not just a Christian thing to want your daughter to be treated well, to respect her own body, to make good and informed decisions and to consider her future in even the small decisions that she makes on a daily basis.As the mom of two daughters, I can definitely appreciate the advice in this book

And I agree that the buck starts and stops at home


After all, a girl's most important role model is her own mother.Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for writing an honest review

I did not receive any other compensation.

$REVIEW.: Well written book with many insights into aspects of the Vietnam War that were unknown to the U.S
public

 The author clearly kept a very detailed dairy of events, as he remembers things so clearly
 And he does have many hair raising stories to tell of his many adventures across the fence


 This book is a good read, and there is much to be learned about the role of the FAC in the Vietnam theater
 In the past few years I've read several accounts of the operations in Laos and Cambodia, and the author's book provides another enlightening glimpse of the clandestine world.My only negative comment is at times I felt a bit detached from the author's story, and maybe it was just me

 In the best first person accounts it is possible to feel that you are right there with the author, seeing through his eyes
 In this book I rarely felt quite that connected to the events


 With that being said, I have nothing but praise for the author and his service to country

 Further, he has done an admirable job of shedding light on operations that were unknown to us all at the time.

$REVIEW.: A Review of Sutherland's PrideBy Stephanie FreemanFrom the opening pages to the very last, I was enthralled


The story opens with a young woman returning to her hometown to bury her father
In the process, she crosses the chasms of misery and memory with tangible proof of a love capsized; leaving the two main characters, Flynn and Pride trying to navigate the treacherous waters and the jagged shards of memory.Many women desire to be swept away, to be loved by that special someone, but sometimes in the light of day the fantasy and reality collide
The loss is immeasurable
The gain is bittersweet because sometimes they share the same eyes and small hands

The bitterness becomes so pervasive that is chokes out all reason and the glimmer of hope that redemption can bring.Kathryn Brocato distilled those details in a remarkable story about second chances..
about redemption and the most frightening words for people to utter when love is involved


"I was wrong


I apologize."This my second opportunity to read the work of this masterful author and I must say, with each story her study of the human heart is perfect

This author never disappoints
I was given an advanced reader copy of this work for an honest review for no compensation.

If you have some room in your shelf for a good background work, that is a little dated this would be the one I would get
Don't get me wrong, guns are guns and dated is not necessarily bad, but just a forewarning to any buyer who expects to have something showing recent guns.In addition, given the genre and nature, if apocalypse happens, dated is fine, because you won't be dealing with the latest and greatest! :)

$REVIEW.: I was provided a copy of this book as part of the M/M Romance Group's DBML program on GoodReads in exchange for an honest review.I have found that there is always a delicate balancing act you have to perform when writing m/m/m type stories. Especially when you want it to come out as a balanced relationship, and not just a couple that is having a fling with another man (not that that is bad...I'm all for a little hot and heavy three-way action). I do think that the way this was written, in regards to the relationship developing, was done very well. It wasn't love (or even lust) at first sight, but something that grew between Chad and Jeremy (seeing as Chad and Dion clearly have the lust portion of the event covered, before Chad and Jeremy had even met).However I never really felt the heat between any of the characters. I never really felt anything, to be honest. Not anger, or lust, or desire. They felt way to clinical for me to get a good grasp on what they were really feeling and what they say they were feeling. It didn't help that the dialogue felt like the script to an after-school-special. It was saying all the 'right things' but it constantly fell flat of reality. Chad is a low-income, undereducated, druggy/alcoholic from England (somewhere)...but he reads as just another cookie-cutter abused kid with parental issues. And aside from a few slang terms, and few mentions of the schooling system over there, it never really felt like it was unique to England in any way. Everyone talks in such flat, clinical, monotones, that you never get a feel for any of the characters or any of the settings. Which is sad, since they could really be interesting.And for the love of all that is holy, if a dude basically blacks-out after being beat half to death, on your porch, you do not just give him a quick wash and a bandaid. You drag his a** to A&E--if; only because him dying of an internal hemorrhage on your guest room bed, is going to really put a crimp in your interior decorating scheme. Jeremy is a cook, not a doctor--if Chad had fallen at his feet because he needed a souffle made, then Jeremy would be his guy. Not so much if Chad needed to find out if ribs were broken enough to turn his lungs into a bagpipe.I love m/m/m stories, and I do like the idea of Dion's cheating leading to a relationship between all three of the guys, because that is a complicated mess I would enjoy watching unfold, but this story never really moved past the surface and I didn't really get why they were attracted to each other.

$review_text.: If you're looking for one person's perspective on Horror, like so many other Horror apologist or philosophy books. I'm not sure whether this is a good or a bad thing.Rather than being one man's exegesis, or his own considered opinion on the topic, it's a collection of thematically arranged quotes and quips from others.Whether or not you like this may depend on your own personal preferences... It's kind of somewhere in between being good & bad, in approach. I guess one might just say it's a different approach. Basically taking the exegeses of others and chopping them up then rearranging them into a pseudo-narrative on topics of your own choosing.On the one hand, it's not precisely "original insight" or "original research," since it's just a collection of stuff that others have said. But, on the other hand, it is kind of an original approach to basically tell the story of the Horror genre in the collected words of its own authors.Original or not, much of the content is regardless quite interesting and perhaps it does amount to more than the sum of its individual parts (short quotes arranged by theme). For those who like the horror genre and would like to know more abbot its approach and themes, this is a pretty interesting and lively read, since it skips around a bit and gives many slightly varied perspectives on the same topic(s) in the relatively short space of a couple adjacent pages.

 It is a book of forbidden love


 It is appalling and endearing at the same time

 The book evokes so many emotions and thoughts.The reader has to step outside their "personal" thoughts, ideas, morals, and emotions to fully grasp the story.When an author can bring forth this kind of emotional response, they have written a brilliant book!I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: While I haven't read "High Cotton" yet, I have read most of the stories in it.  As had I read most of the stories in this anthology.  "Bestsellers Guaranteed" and "By Bizarre Hands" collected the majority of Lansdale's fiction back in the day, and it is from these two books where the majority of these two books come.  I think he focuses on novels now, and I'm not sure how much short fiction he has published in the last decade or so.  Rather than simply reprinting them with a new introduction, Lansdale and editors put these two collections together.That's fine with me... There are some new attractions.  Lansdale includes a new introduction to each story.  His introductions are often so funny I wish he would compile a collection of intros and other nonfiction.  "A Fistfull of Stories" collected a good bit of his nonfiction, for those who are interested.  I enjoyed this collection, as it had been so long since I'd read most of the stories I had forgotten many of them.  I look forward to the next mainstream Lansdale story collection which, hopefully, will contain a majority of new material.

$REVIEW.: I thought this was a great start for a series. The characters make you fall in love with them and feel their emotions and struggles. The beginning is a little dark and for me difficult to read but once past that it is a true love story where you are rooting for the couple. The only thing I thought was odd was how she handled and the quickness of the ordeal she went through. I thought there would have been more problems with recovery but then realized I was trying to put it into how I think I would have handled it and every person is different in their processing of things. I can't wait to read the next book and delve more into these wonderful characters lives!!!

$REVIEW.: This was the second book from A.L Jackson that I have read and yet again my Author crush on her has grown into something HUGE. Not that it was ever small to begin with mind you. The way she is able to tell a story is just amazing, you are able to get emotionally involved  with the character's and feel what they feel, Yes I may of may not have shed a tear or two at peculiarly dramatic moments.This had me hooked from the beginning and I didn't feel so much as I was reading a story but I was living it, Amy is one of those authors who can transport you into her world and that is something I relish and Love to be apart of. I don't think I could ever read one of her book in anything other than one sitting, forget toilet breaks and coffee all you need a comfy and warm spot that you can sit in and enjoy the adventure you are going to be taken on.The first thing you are introduced to in Take This Regret is a young couple in collage who are madly and deeply in love, or so it appears. Christian is a driven Law student who has ditched his partying ways to prove himself to girlfriend Elizabeth but things don't always work out the way they should. Elizabeth wants to work with young children so when she unexpectedly falls pregnant she knows there is no way she can get rid of the baby, her baby, no matter what she knows she is going to have the baby and love it even when she is given the ultimate ultimatum.Christian is one of those guys who almost has a 10 year plan, he knows exactly what he wants to happen in his life and when he wants that to happen, the last thing he expected was to be made a dad while still in collage so he tells Elizabeth it is him or the baby and she cannot have both, amusing she would choose him he cuts all communication with her and waits for her to come back to him . . . only she doesn't."They say cowards run in the face of danger or pain. I supposed that's what I was, what I'd become, too fearful to love, too fearful to be loved, too afraid to live - so I ran."You really feel for Elizabeth, not only is she going through something that is hard for any women to deal with if unexpected but she is also going to have to do it alone and with a heart that has been broken beyond repair. You end up hating Christian right along with her, how could anyone not want their own child? You then realize it is going to take a lot for not only Elizabeth to trust him but for you as the reader to trust him with Elizabeth again.5 years later and Christian's world is miserable he knows he made a mistake when he found out about the pregnancy but he assumes there is nothing he can do to change that until one day at the supermarket when he comes across a little girl who just feels familiar, even if he does some what look like a creep he cannot take his eyes off her. Could it be . . . . No it couldn't . . .  But then it might just be."How could you? Did you think of me? Did you think of our child? Why didn't you love me enough? Did you even love me at all? Why now, after so many years?"This story is all about learning to love and trust again and learning that sometimes people make terrible mistakes. I like this book because it isn't all sunshine and roses we see Christian working his arse off to get back into Elizabeth's good books and we see the journey of him learning to become a father."What do you want, Christian?"What did I want? To make her smile, to wipe away her tears, to hold her. To be a father, a real father, not one in title, but on who'd earned that right. I wanted to stay."I want my family," I forced through the lump in my throat."She was mine, had always been, and I'd always been hers. Despite what I'd done, the wounds I'd inflicted, she had always been mine.... our hearts had been tied, our bond one that neither of us could ever escape."The thing I love in most stories are alternative point of views, it just brings so much more depth an realism into what you are reading, it can also make you understand a character much more and Amy manages to do this terrifically well.5/5 stars!

$REVIEW.: It is the only book I'm aware of that understands at a fundamental level meth isn't a drug problem, it is a symptom of our current societal and economic problems. The meth epidemic isn't about  a drug, its about the economy, and so Reding's book is as much about the death of a way of life as the birth of a drug.For those looking for a Breaking Bad experience, or another drug-porn description of whacked-out meth addicts, this is not your book. Instead, Reding, after returning to his hometown of Oelwein, Iowa, chronicles the descent from a thriving agricultural-based economy into a desperate place where cheap, easy to obtain drugs like meth were just waiting to move in. Along the way Iowa's story parallels the changes in our broader national society and economy, focused here on Big Agra moving in, first destroying family farms and local meat packers, then replacing the workers in its new mega-facilities with cheap, disposable labor from south of the border. Such changes, whether wrought by Big Agra businesses, Chinese steel or Walmart, take away the life of the town but leave behind the people.Just like Big Agra destroyed a way of life in Iowa, Big Pharma profited off the remains. Reding details how the pharmaceutical industry spent heavily and lobbied successfully to not limit the import of pseudoephedrine into the U.S. The drug companies needed that chemical to be available and cheap for their cold medicines, and were without care that that same chemical, distilled out of those same cold medicines, fueled the meth epidemic. Hey, it was just business, a perfect metaphor for the rise of profit above all else, the leaving behind of the 99 percent.Reding touches on how easy the drug is to cook up in small batches, although a small mistake in the chemistry can result in horrific burns and explosions. Meth wasn&#8217;t a social drug, and so you didn&#8217;t need to hang around with old juicers in a dark bar. Meth came to you. Your friends were using it, if not selling it or cooking it, and the angry, speedo high it gave fit the young guys better. Meth wasn&#8217;t only for boys, either. Girls liked it too, and because you never thought about eating on a meth cruise, they called it the Jenny Crank diet.As part of research leading to my upcoming book, Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99Percent, I spent some time in the Rust Belt of the Midwest, where meth is as popular as in Iowa, and for the same reasons. Reding's descriptions and conclusion ring true.But most importantly, meth just isn't cheap and easy, it is a Midwest drug. Instead of the flighty high of weed or the dulled feeling of alcohol, meth at first offers a powerful feeling of self-worth, of energy, that is the perfect antidote for the crushing depression and lack of hope the space around the user represents. For a world stuck in crap, meth was the answer. This was a drug designed for unemployed people with poor self-images and no confidence. Of course the drug is a false front, as users quickly suffer from the debilitating health problems we are all familiar with. But that's a tomorrow kind of problem, and the lost users in Iowa and elsewhere know they have no tomorrow anyway.Criticisms of the book are few. Reding includes far too much information on the personal lives of the few good people in town trying to better things, and about himself. These do little to support the central ideas and often detour the narrative. The book tries perhaps too hard to end on a positive note, focusing on the progress made but losing sight of how little winning one battle in rural Iowa means in the larger war for our America.But don't let those points stop you from looking into this book. Skim the filler and focus on the important point: People without jobs, without hope, without tomorrows, will turn to things like meth to ease the pain. It's human nature. As Reding writes, rock bottom is not a foundation to build on. And unless we as a nation figure out a better way forward-- jobs that pay a living wage for more Americans, the reining in of big interests that rip apart the fabric of the nation around them-- methland will be our land. We can't fix America's meth problem without fixing America.

$REVIEW.: As a reader of serial killer books, I can usually get through them pretty good. But this one is dragging. I'm only partway through, but it seems a little editing could have been heplful. It reads more like an almanac than a true story about a serial killer. It really meanders around between the weather of the day and a little bit about the killer, very confusing sometimes as to what the book is truly about.

$REVIEW.: Temporarily Yours was so good in so many ways.First off they have to have one of the cutest meetings ever. There are kids involved, a candy cane and Copper falling on his ass. The best meetings are the ones with humor and this one made me laugh.I really enjoyed Kayla. She wasn't whiny. She was strong, knew her own mind and the only place I saw that waiver was when dealing with her family where I got that sometimes it's just easier to pretend than to deal with whatever family is going to dish out. We've all been there in one way or another.And swoony, swoony Copper. What else do I need to say about that man. It was really nice to read one of heroes with not only a good reason for not wanting to get involved but other vulnerabilities that he has to push through to get the girl. I &#60;3 him.Two other things that I loved about this was the blatant acknowledgement of the ROMCOM idea of the grand gesture. We see this in a lot of Brazen books and I enjoy it but it was great to see it acknowledged. The other is that after Kayla and Copper spend the weekend together they aren't professing their undying love to each other. They want to be together, they want to try but it wasn't &#34;Hello. Let's have sex. Now I love you.&#34; They recognized something different in each other that made them each want to be together.Don't get me wrong. The other Brazen books I've read that does have the big I love you after a short period of time I also love reading. It's just nice to sometimes mix it up a bit.This was a good one!

 This book was entirely different from the first, but I loved it too

 The first book was so interesting, I got to  know all the characters

 This book was a crime novel and kept me on the edge of my chair

Heart of Gold is a story of learning to follow God even when the path is hard and you don't understand why some things happen the way they do. Robin Lee Hatcher writes a beautiful book that reminds you of these basic faith principles.I would have loved a deeper connection with the characters and for the book to expand more about their daily lives. But, this story, in its simplicity was well worth the read.Book DescriptionAgainst Shannon's wishes, love stakes its claim in her heart. Will she discover treasure or treachery?When Shannon Adair accompanies her minister father to the western gold rush town of Grand Coeur, she's certain she'll never be happy away from her beloved Virginia, even though the South is still gripped in civil war.Wells Fargo driver Matthew Dubois isn't sure the lovely Shannon belongs in Idaho Territory either, but he is a desperate man. His widowed sister is dying and leaving her young son, Todd, in his care. Matthew wants to return to driving coach for the express company soon--so he'll have to find a wife to look after the boy when he's away.Shannon is determined not to lose her heart to a man who is neither a Southerner nor a gentleman.

$REVIEW.: I was a little hesitant to read this book at first. After all, Emma and Cole were finally together at the end of Now and Then, and Layla and Ben had also found true love in Now and Again. Why write another story about them?But after reading Now and Forever, I changed my mind. After all, reality is not exactly happily ever after. Every relationship has its up and downs and every couple has to face challenges in their relationship. I loved how Brenda Rothert wrote this story. I was guessing what would happen when I was reading the start of the story and I was happily surprised that it was completely from what I thought would happen.I was a little irritated with Emma several times in the book and I thought Ben was a little too chauvinistic but these actually make the story more real and make the characters more human. Sad to finish the end of a great series. Looking forward to more of Brenda Rothert's books.

$REVIEW.: It always starts with a simple case - in this instance the old favourite of a missing husband - and it always goes wrong. It always looks like the hero - the wonderfully crafted Tom Kendall - is heading down the wrong track and yet we always know that he will somehow deduct, decipher or detect something that the cops cannot and meander his way to the bad guys. Spiralling seamlessly from missing person to high crimes and misdemeanours, The Marinski Affair is another example of highly skilled storytelling from the pen of old maestro John Holt.Like all the others, this is a highly recommended read. If you haven't yet enjoyed a ride with Kendall and Mollie, I suggest to start right now!

$review_text.: Second Chances had a common theme throughout and centered around two families.  The lives of two families were forever changed overnight.  We first meet Hanna while she is babysitting 7 year old Kadi.  As Kadi sleeps, Hanna calls her hot tempered ex-boyfriend who broke up with her because he had already moved on.  Hanna tells him she's pregnant and they agree to meet later that night.  The next morning, Hanna is found dead.  Kadi's father Ryan Crowe, is accused of and eventually convicted of murdering Hanna.  Ryan is sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Hanna's younger brother, Dain, vows to kill Ryan in 20 years when he is released from prison.  The ripple effect of one incident caused many more families to suffer because one person chose to remain silent by not telling the truth.Second Chances is told from each character's view, but mainly Dain and Kadi.  As a reader, we were able to read how each character is feeling and thinking at the time.  We were able to understand the purpose of their actions as they happen.  As adults, Dain and Kadi end up in the same bar not knowing each other's past.  It is now 20 years later and Kadi is on her way to reconnect with her dad.  Dain is waiting to make his move to make his vow a reality.  He's set to kill Ryan Crowe.  Until he runs into Kadi.  Dain is struck by Kadi's beauty and Kadi is intrigued by Dain.I really didn't care for Dain's rage and abusive nature.  If he didn't possess such anger and violent thoughts, he could be a really great guy.  I personally don't associate with anyone with that type of personality, especially as a parent and wife.  I wouldn't want that around my family.  When Dain and Kadi were together, they both seemed to spark each other's rage and feed off of each other.  At times, their relationship was tumultuous roller coaster.Kadi plays detective to prove her father's innocence.  Meanwhile, Dain is doing his own investigating.  With the same passion and determination over finding out the truth, their friendship eventually turns into more.  They are both investigating the same case but fail to share what they learn.Kadi and Dain's love for one another is a strong bond.  Through the maze of finding out the truth to who killed his sister Hanna, he is unable to fully give himself to Kadi.  At least not until he knows the truth.  He needs to know if Ryan Crowe is innocent.Second Chances is about two families finding a second chance at life, love, family, and the future.  Overall, this book was an exciting, romantic, and suspenseful read.

You get to know Zarian, Nicholas, N., and the rest of the uncanny people that seemed to be the expatriate tribe in Corfu at the time.However (I wouldn't have given it 3 stars if there weren't a "however"), that's not always what you're looking for in a travel book.

Now sixty years later, Winter has risen in the Order's ranks, she has become a Captain with a team of her own but her demon is riding her harder. If members of the Order do not bond with another eventually their demons consume them.Marcus Black is the Lord of the Nightwalkers. He finds Winter being attacked by demons and comes to the rescue. Marcus is stunned to discover his wicked attraction to Winter. He quickly discovers she is his mate. However, Winter is unwilling to submit to Marcus' reasoning. Marcus wants to complete the mate bond with Winter but she keeps refuses.When the Order compounds come under demon attacks Winter must turn to the Lupines and Nightwalkers for assistance. They build a steady alliance between the three groups who have never been friendly and go in search of the guilty party. Terror ensues as the death toll grows. There seems to be a larger plot against the Order than first realized and somehow Winter is the center of the villain's plans. Can Marcus protect his mate or will he lose her forever?Kiss of Darkness is a thrill a minute novel. Loribelle Hunt keeps you on the edge of your seat while seducing you with her sexy characters. Winter's world is complex and filled with complicated characters with depth. I found myself attached to this group of paranormal hero's, holding my breath with fear that they would not all survive.Winter and Marcus set Kiss of Darkness on fire. This couple packs an emotional punch. Winter is so reluctant to bond with Marcus and she lets him know. Watching Marcus struggle with such a headstrong independent woman is hysterical and seeing him slowly seduce his woman is sensational. There are several couples in Kiss of Darkness and all of them leave you wanting more! As a matter of fact I was screaming at the end for one couple whose relationship was left hanging. I hope to find out more about them in the future. Kiss of Darkness is a gripping novel that features a cool world that you will be ready to dive into again and again.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: Chris Santella`s "Fifty Places to Sail Before You Die" is an interesting but ultimately disappointing book.  Although the idea of a collection of unforgettable places to sail is an excellent idea, this book is one of unrealized potential.The author contacted and interviewed famous sailors from around the world - racers, charterers, instructors, photographers, etc. - for their favorite places to sail.  For each great sailing area, he wrote a 3-4 page blurb about the area, and included a small bio of the expert along with some basic information about how to travel to the area, when the best sailing season is, and information about local accommodations and charters.Unfortunately, Santella does not sell these sailing locales.  I expected a book on great sailing areas to include numerous dazzling photographs of each area, but most of the sections include only one picture from the area (some none).  Too many of the write-ups focus on the history of sailing an area or other trivia instead of the reasons to sail that area now, and there are no maps to give one a flavor of the area - another must, to me, in a book about sailing locations.Despite these drawbacks, there is still some interesting information in this book and the sailing locales are a nice sampling of different types of sailing locales.  Ultimately, although this book did not give me a burning desire to travel to many of these places, this book is still a worthwhile purchase for anyone with a love of sailing.

$REVIEW.: While the initial premise of this reboot of Prophet was interesting to me, it wore off quickly as I read page after page of this Conan-lookalike murdering his way across amorphous blobs of feces and grotesquerie in pursuit of missions that, in hindsight, make absolutely no sense at all. I enjoyed some of the art, but in the final story, &#34;Coil&#34;, I could not tell you what was happening in any given panel, beyond the vague impression that Prophet was once again fighting... something and then at the end eats... something kind of gross.The actual narration is also pretty infuriating, as it either tells the reader exactly what is going on in a given panel or else rambles on using fabricated language that is never defined even by virtue of implication.I suppose there is a target audience for this; it reminded me a lot of Perdido Street Station, another work I found an overblown exercise in grossing out the reader, but which I know a lot of people enjoy. And much like Perdido, Prophet never really provides satisfying conclusions to any of the tales within, when the stories even make sense at all.I would give this a pass. There are much better graphic novels out there.

$review_text.: I am very grateful for this book. I had already known about pre-birth planning and thought that there was not much more for me to learn. I was wrong about that. I had never read a book that chronicled pre-birth planning stories in such detail -- intellectually I knew that we plan our lives before birth, but not to what extent. The stories in Your Soul's Plan are moving and showed me the love and compassion inherent all "players" involved in any tragic or difficult life situation.  I struggle with non-judgment, and after reading this book, I understood in a profound way that people choose the path that is best for their growth. The people who provoke me or trigger my insecurities are doing me a favor - they're reminding me to be compassionate. If the people who came out of these challenges with compassion, forgiveness, and strength, what am I doing with my petty opinions? I found that my tendency to judge diminished significantly after reading just a few of the case studies - what a relief!  Thank you, Robert Schwartz, for taking on this project.
$SUMMARY.: This book reminded me about compassion and non-judgment

$review_text.: This major effort seems to have touched all the bases.  It leaves virtually no possible cause of medical errors unexamined. It does, however, seem to employ its excellence in describing gripping case studies as a distraction much of the time, often leading one's attention away from the root causes it seems to prefer not to pursue.I refer, to cite but 2 examples,  to 1.) the touch-and-go treatment of the selection and education of medical students and 2.) to the issue of the cover-ups that are the consequence of the "Brothrhood" of physicians.Our impressively literate authors manage, disappointingly, to leave issues like these without much examination and to virtually leave considerations concerning them out of their "solutions."They properly make much of the "culture" of physicians, yet offer no ideas as to how to modify this culture at the med school level, rather than after the wrong people (drug addicts, among others)have been trained and are wreaking havoc. Drug addicts, by the way can be picked up by tests before, during or after med school - as can asocial individuals.  Such tests, strangely and destructively, are not employed in the medical culture (as they are in industry.)Nor do the authors seem to be aware of the possiblity of, or to encourage the employment of, others than physicians and their handmaidens to try to right the problems that are killing hundreds of us daily.  They, like most physicians, seem to prefer having foxes guard the henhouse.  And, given the culture they describe, this traditionaly hubristic practice (self-policing or peer review) virtually insures that proposed solutions will be destructively doctor friendly and largely leave the patient to his own resources.The systems oriented approach that they champion, and which the Bush administration and the AMA seem to have picked up on, has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement.  Bush and the AMA are, therefore, all for electonic help for doctors, and advanced computers will certainly help, but  GIGO (Garbage In-Garbage Out) applies to their computers even as it does to ours.  And tired, incompterent, impaired or indiferent staff can readily compromise the efficiency of such aids.Such solutions also distract from, and ignore, important needs such as those mentioned in the 2 examples noted above - without which meaningful reform of  the medical culture simply cannot occur.And so, I see their "solutions" as mere paliatives awaiting the more difficult structural changes that I and others have thus far only hinted at.Reading this book is tremendously informtive about a lot of things (and it is entertaining) but don't confuse its contents with anything like a meaningful solution to the problems of American health care.  It , emphatically, isn't.

$REVIEW.: Roy Hallums' "Buried Alive" is a plain-spoken ex-military man's of terror, hope, survival and ultimate triumph over being kidnapped by terrorists in Iraq. Written in a matter-of-fact style, Hallum does not varnish the truth, sensationalize his story or politicize the horrors he lived through. Leaving those types of journalistic tricks to the media, Hallums' book is written in an accessable, friendly way, as if told to a group around a camp fire. Though he endured a harrowing situation, Hallums personality shines through.  And that's what makes "Buried Alive" such a great read.His book, written in the first person, covers his own story from the day of his capture to his eventual rescue and trip home. We're witness to his deprived existence, first in several holding places and finally in the underground cell in which he was held until his rescue. Hallums reveals not only the stupidity and brutal inhumanity of the terrorists, but gives us an unflinching view of the effects - both physical and mental - that their treatment had on him, including the bad food (or lack of food), pestilence, lack of air and light, and the absence of simple things like the ability to wash or use the bathroom.An emotional inclusion are excerpts and quotes from his family's diaries and interviews during his imprisonment. These reveal that the terrorists acts not only affect their prisoner, but also deeply affect the families that are praying for a rescue and return of their loved ones. The book also reveals the inept inner workings of our own government's policies regarding recovering a kidnap victim and the practice of clamping down on the victim's family rather than focusing on that recovery. Hallums' relatives give us a real picture of the FBI's illogic and reveal how that organization was, at times, an impediment to any real action.While the story may be too harrowing for some, Hallums book is gripping and a fast read. I found myself hoping for the eventual rescue while turning each painful month's pages. Knowing his rescue was coming but having to dwell in that hole with him gave me a fractional glimpse of what he endured and in that regard the book is a real success.

He is quite popular, and has lots of friends
Ok, not really

He's not typical and he doesn't have a lot of friends


He totally blames his dad for that

Sam, is, however, a PK

Preacher's Kid
Yeah


Isn't that grand?Sam just wants to fit in, but because of his PK status, other kids clam up around him and get all prim and weird
Sam just wants to be normal............This book had me laughing out loud from page 1, which

Later on, I had to change books because I was reading in bed and didn't want nightmares

I absolutely LOVED this book.It starts with, "You see that dead guy by the side of the road? Yeah, the one lying in a pool of his blood with his face all messed up and his clothes all torn and dirty


That's me." The end of the first chapter ends with the bit about the stupidest thing he ever did
Seeing as I thought this book was about Jennifer's demons, I was a little confused, but it didn't matter because I was laughing.The next chapter completely switches gears and goes to Jennifer's perspective


And it's creepy

And strange

Strange and creepy


Love it!If you know anything about psychology and/or mental illness, you might be reading the book while another part of your brain is working on puzzle

Near the end, I came up with a hypothesis of what was going on, but it was really only because Sam started down a line of thinking that led me to it.There was one part of the book where I was actually saying, "Go Dad!" because it was that good

Normally, I don't like the parents in books, but this one had me cheering Sam's dad

(What a great example, on this Father's Day  )I give this book 5 out of 5 stars


Honestly, I'd give it more if I could

Get this book

$review_text.: &#8220;Key to Immortality&#8221; is an engaging commentary on the Gospel of St. Thomas. Kapuscinski takes each of the logia within the Gospel of St. Thomas and discusses these logia&#8217;s meanings for his own life, leaving the reader to interpret and determine their applications within their own lives. Kapuscinski also provides important notes and discussion from translators and other commentators on the Gospel of St. Thomas.I&#8217;ve never been a big reader of the books from the Apocrypha, but Kapuscinski makes the writings seem valid and important, even if the mainstream Church does not agree. I found Kapuscinski&#8217;s writing to be fresh and engaging, and I enjoyed every moment I spent reading &#8220;Key to Immortality.&#8221;This book is an important addition to the existing commentary on the Gospel of St. Thonas, and I would encourage anybody interested in what the out-of-the-mainstream writings of the disciples had to say to give it a read today. The book is accessible even to the layperson, because Kapuscinski discusses and dissects each of the logia in a way that is clear and mostly free of theological jargon. Those of a theological bent will still find the text useful, because of the insightful viewpoints Kapuscinski expresses about the Gospel of St. Thomas and its meaning to him and us.

$review_text.: Saint Benedict started his adult life as a hermit before considering monastic life. Truthfully, there were differences from one monastery to another. Some monasteries existed so the monks within could study and pray, other monasteries allowed their charges to become little more than lazy children, dependent on donations from local Catholics to keep food in their bellies.During his hermit days a man of God provided food for Benedict and the nurse he'd had since he was born. The nurse, however, broke a borrowed item and Benedict repaired it by his prayers. The man couldn't hide in a cave any longer. A local monastery had lost their head honcho and begged Benedict to come.He wasn't what they expected.Benedict wouldn't put up with their laziness. Isn't sloth one of the seven deadly sins? These guys must not have cared, because they conspired to murder the man. Only a miracle could save him, and it did.Benedict worked several miracles in his lifetime. He wasn't the only person in his family to do so. His twin sister, a nun , worked at least one in her own life.This book describes that one on detail because it involved being able to violate one of Benedict's riles for the monastery. His sister, the Sister, prayed that Benedict would be able to spend the night with her.NO! Not like that!! She just wanted to spend a little more time with her brother because they only saw each other once a year. And she had some special things she wanted to discuss with him, things that couldn't wait.The most important part of the book might have been Benedict's rules for monastic life. I say might have been because you have to read it between the lines. You won't exactly find the document, but you will find a lot of 'for instance' examples that will help you figure out what the document said.And it all seems to be common sense.

Rebecca Scarberry is making a name for herself quickly in aiming for the young adult market without telling us old folks. The simple, uncomplicated plot line is focused on Henry and the details of solving a crime mystery go unquestioned. Instead, Rebecca focuses our attention on the love and friendship of Henry and his "do unto others" spirit is wonderful.

$review_text.: Good morning everyone! I just finished A Little Bit Sinful by Robyn DeHart

This is the second book in the Forbidden Love series
I have to say that I did enjoyed the first book, A Little Bit Wicked, but I think this story was even better

Let me share why.Back in A Little Bit Wicked, we first meet Clarissa Kincaid who happen to get herself in a bit of a pickle


She needed help to get her reputation repair
However, in A Little Bit Sinful we focus on Clarissa and her hopes to wed George Wilbanks
She has been waiting for sometime for George to pop the question, but alas the man seems reluctant
Crazy, I know.She decides to enlist the help of a family friend, Justin Rodale
Though he was raised with his father the Duke of Chanceworth, he was never really accepted into society


You know being born on the other side of the blanket always causes problems


Yet, Justin is really concern with Clarissa's choice and really wants to help her see the error of her ways


What are you suppose to do with a stubborn young woman who wants to marry the wrong man? Looks like a lot work for Justin.My first thought of Clarissa was "boy she's trouble." The girl is a bit impulsive and doesn't really think of the consequences until after fact

However, those are the best kind of heroines
Plus, they always need a hero even though they might not think so


Most people would think Justin as unlikely hero


Especially, when he's described as a pirate


Ooh yum; can't go wrong with a pirate looking hero

Even though he was born a bastard, he truly acted like gentleman

Especially around Clarissa, even though he was so tempted by her.A Little Bit Sinful was a lot of fun to read
Especially, when you have an impulsive heroine with a penchant for trouble and a hero who was born on the wrong side of the blanket that is more honorable than most gentleman
If this sounds like your kind of read, you might want to checkout this story
I thought it was a sinful delight.

The ONE thing that drove me NUTS was on page 40 of the book Kella is explaining to Lily abut her relationship with Fraser

There, his last name is Gennerson

On page 197, everyone is at Dane's parent's house for dinner and Kella and Fraser come in

kella is pregnant and they tell everyone they found out the baby is a boy and here, the last name given in Garrison


Grrrr..


Wish the names would've been correct, it throws me off when stuff changes in the same book

Otherwise, I was in love with the very fast reading


It had a great psychic twist, was not too far fetched as some and was really great
I cried after they found Steffy and as everyone discussed her progress


I thought this was a really good read! Thanks so much for the chance to read it! Will look for future books! :)

$review_text.: Basically, this is a book about repetitive imagery bringing you what you want in life, ala "The Secret."  I'm not saying that there isn't some basis to the concept, because I believe there is.  But there is very little that is new in this book and a LOT that is redundant.  The production quality is very poor, with lots of typos, too.  Everything that is put forth as the basis for this concept could have been presented in less than 50 pages.  Up to 30% of the book is taken up with one line, repeated above every paragraph.  "I am wealth.  I am abundance. I am joy."  It is in bold type, over and over, ad nauseum.  While it is useful and perhaps effective to have a mantra such as this, it takes away considerably from the credibility of the book. There is also a pretty amazing mash-up of how the concept is confirmed by quantum physics right at the beginning of the book, which ruined any idea I might have had about further credibility. I purchased this book because it was recommended by someone I respect.  I can only think that that person had never seen this concept/philosophy in any other place before.

$REVIEW.: I just adore this paranormal romance series. Wicked Souls is the third novella in the Witches Anonymous series, but it can be read as a stand alone book. Amy is a recovering witch. She's almost reached the six month step of not using magical powers. It's proved to be more difficult then she thought it would be, and Gabriel the archangel who is working on his own agenda. He steals half her soul because he thinks that she's the reason he can't get back into heaven.Meanwhile, there is an unknown witch playing havoc with Amy, and it's making it so hard for her not to use magic to break the witch's power over her. Then there is Luc...Lucifer, who has the other half of her soul from when Amy was a practicing witch. She still has an attraction to him, which she hates because her boyfriend Adam, is actually the Adam and Amy knows that no one is more perfect then he is. But he's dealing with his own set of problems-mainly Eve, who is here to cause trouble thanks to Gabriel. Amy isn't going to let anything stop her from keeping the man of her dreams-Adam, or stop her from completing step 3 in Witches Anonymous.The characters in this series are all fun, and I loved that all of my favorites returned in this one. Amy is such a feisty heroine. There are all these people pulling her in different directions. There is Luc who makes it known that he would love Amy to be by his side again, Gabriel who while he is supposed to be one of the good guys, tempts Amy like no body else to use magic. Then there is her best friend Keisha, who wants Amy to be good, but doesn't see the harm in using a little magic. Through each novella, Amy grows stronger in her belief not to use magic, and I love seeing her stay firm in her decision even with all the aforementioned forces working against her. She's just not going to let anything get in her way of becoming magic free.Wicked Souls had the most religious undertones of all the novellas so far, but to me it just showed how much Amy is growing as a person trying to do the right thing. This was a super fast read, and when I'm done with each one I am always craving Dove candy bars (Amy's weakness) and ice cream. (Amy owns an ice cream shop) I can't wait to see what kind of trouble Amy gets into next!Favorite Quote:The instant our bodies touched, the bars holding my magic back broke into a thousand tiny grains of sand and scattered everywhere. His fire magic ignited my air magic and burned through my body, an inferno of desperation, lust, and the most powerful black enchantment to ever exist. The two brain cells still yelling no, no, no in my head fell silent as fireworks detonated right under my skin.Favorite Food quote that made me hungry:The cool ice cream livened up my taste buds and slid down my throat with practiced ease. We`d been eating liquid lunches for the past week, ever since Keisha tossed a scoop of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle together with two scoops of Raspberry Cheesecake on a whim and blended them into a frothy concoction of wickedness.

Ms. Allen has a brilliant gift for creating a historical sense of time and place that provides the perfect backdrop for her thoughfully imagined characters you can't help but root for. There's nothing shallow in her work; it's on a much higher level than much of what's out there. I heartily recommend her full length books, too; some of the best money I've spent in the Kindle store!

The story is told by Neil Callahan, one of Larkin and Tigh's children and gives the book a perspective from an adolescent's point of view

$REVIEW.: A lot of the content felt like a massively cleaned up, polished version of a private journal--and I mean that as a compliment since a journal does capture the inner truths and landscape of an individual.In the introduction, Rachel Thompson writes that her hope (with these poems/essays) is "to touch a nerve, make you think, make you feel. . .What I experienced stayed inside me, waiting for me to learn how to tell it on the other side of time. And now it's here for you--in the raw."That it is non-fiction makes the written pieces even more poignant. I know that a good writer would be able to produce convincing, compelling and evocative prose, but somehow, knowing full well that these are really experiences the writer has gone through makes it that much more personal and memorable. And to create something memorable--in a sea of consumerism/commercialism where trends and fads come and go all the time--is certainly an accomplishment to be proud of.Another strong point of the writing is that the sexual content was raw and intense without being at all graphic or lewd. This brings about a subtlety to the overall expression of the content, which again makes it a much more nuanced experience (i.e. reading experience) than if the same scenes were presented in a crass manner (within the context of this particular work).I would like to add that the cover image/artwork for this book is MOST excellent, in terms of reflecting the content and title, and in terms of design elements. It conveys the right mood and tone of the interior contents too, so that readers can expect this book to be a dark but essentially, not completely hopeless, piece of work. This is truly the stuff of contemporary literature/poetry that should not be missed.

$review_text.: This is an interesting little book which attempts to cut through all the scare mongering that fills the media every time a new virus, or variant of an existing virus is discovered.  It puts thing in perspective and explains, among other things how the last thing a virus or bacterium wants to do is kill its host because that means it cannot be passed on to others.What I thought was most interesting was how genetic mutations which can produce disabilities in human beings may also confer immunity against other diseases.  Sickle cell anaemia for example goes hand in hand with the ability to survive malaria.We may actually be managing to create the conditions in which another pandemic could arise instead of preventing one occurring.  Written in layman's terms this is well worth reading by anyone who is interested in what might just be the facts behind the scaremongering.

$review_text.: As a reader who doesn't read many BDSM-themed stories, I still found myself intrigued by Daddy Morebucks as well as still confused by the appeal to those who choose this lifestyle

 Unlike most of the BDSM stories I've read before, this one takes on a more psychological slant to the sexual interludes

 It was a lot of specialized talk that formed the relationship between Marley and James and set the boundaries between them

 While there was intense physicality here, I've read other works that delved into even harsher physical scenes

 So those readers who have trouble with BDSM stories dealing with whipping, bondage, and depravation will find this read a kinder, gentler BDSM story.Marley grew up harshly with only her brother to care about her
 But with his recent death she's fallen on hard times and become a prostitute

 Luckily for her a white knight comes calling as we evolve into a modern-day Pretty Woman with a kinky spin to the story


 Marley soon learns that she's to be a rich man's little girl who must obey the rules while he's to be called Daddy


 She easily accepts this role as she enjoys being taking care of, likes the safety her Daddy provides her as well as the gifts he gives
 Though she loves these benefits she constantly feels inferior and worries that her Daddy will tire of her


 She worries too that she'll embarrass him if people find out about her past
 She doesn't see any self-worth beyond the sex she provides which leads to a disastrous choice for a Christmas gift that almost destroys the fantasy-life they have together

 She truly loved James but couldn't understand that she was the only gift he needed
 Marley was a tough character to relate to
 I never really got a grasp on Marley's actual age as she acted the little girl part to a tee with pouting down to an art form and exuberance that was childlike
 She wholeheartedly embraced this lifestyle though and seemed to thrive on it at times.James is a workaholic who's found that his specific kink leads to problems in his relationships

 After a particularly nasty break-up he turned to prostitutes

 With each one similar to the last, meeting Marley is like a breath of fresh air

 He sees no artifice surrounding her and she seems to genuinely enjoy being with him
 He feels sympathetic for everything she's gone through in life and just wants to protect her and give her everything she's missed out on


 Until now women seemed to want him only for his money but she gives him a reason to live life to the fullest as opposed to just living to work and he looks forward to coming home to her everyday
 He will do anything to keep her there permanently, if he can just convince her of her self-worth
 James is clearly the more mature of the two of them though his age isn't clear either

 I found him charming but there's still a bit of the ick-factor in his referring to/thinking of Marley as a little girl that I couldn't ignore no matter how sexy he was.On a whole this was a well-written story vividly depicting a particular form of BDSM that essentially encourages the complete care of the one you love


 While these two characters seem complete opposites they bring exactly what the other needs to an immensely satisfying relationship


 Each character is unique which provides for a variety of super hot sexual encounters that take over the story at times

 Though the desire behind this kind of lifestyle isn't made too clear the author did make this couple's relationship mutually satisfying which makes for a HEA which is what every romance reader ultimately wants.3.75 STARS

$review_text.: Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare your Heavy Duty Tissue supply. It's time for a tear-jerker.The Mine (Northwest Passage), by talented Indie Author John A. Heldt, is a sassy time-travel book that is much less about the travel than it is about the time. The main character, Joel, is easy to like... which makes him hard to love. So when he finds himself trapped in 1941, trying to befriend his then-young grandmother and woo her engaged best friend and roommate Grace, he is quickly overwhelmed.Seeing cocky people do cocky things is boring. That's why the newest James Bond movie, in which the Cockiest Man Of All is brought to his knees, is the best one so far. Seeing Joel question everything he thought he knew about himself as he struggles to win the love and approval of two very different women, stuck in a history that he is afraid to change, is enthralling.As Joel tries to prove himself to the two-newly-most-important people in his life, he proves himself to the reader, too. I was rooting for him so hard it almost hurt.Well, not literally. But still.Despite the seemingly placid story line, I could not put this book down (with the exception of the death of a character, at which point I had to put the book down in order to cry). While Joel tries to find his place in an old New World, Pearl Harbour and the second world war are hanging over his head. Every day that passes brings the harsh reality of rations and conscription closer to the almost idyllic friendships that Joel develops.There is also the threat that Joel will change things - and maybe for the worst. Could he accidentally prevent his own birth, just by being friends with his own grandmother? Could he ruin someone's life by having a role in a time that isn't his own?It's these questions about fate and responsibility that lead Joel to change who he is... and change history, whether he wants to or not.

$review_text.: Man is asleep. This is the explicit message of the 4th Way school, and the implicit message of many other spiritual traditions.  In "Gnosis", Mouravieff, who was loosely associated with Gurdjieff, describes a method, based on esoteric teachings of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, that is to lead to our awakening and consequent salvation.Mouravieff argues that most of our actions and thoughts are just mechanical reactions to stimulae.  We identify ourselves with those thoughts and actions and put the label "I" on them, thus giving them authorship.  However, it would be more correct to speak of many "I"s.  And, if we are truthful with ourselves, we will admit that these actions and thoughts do not proceed from our will but sort of "happen to us".So far, so good.  Anyone who has done any meditation training will be familiar to some extent with the above description.  We sit in meditation and tend to our breath, a mantra, a prop.  Very soon, though, we will be distracted by a myriad of thoughts, some of them very strange indeed. Whence did they arise? We are taught, in such cases, to observe these thoughts and return to our concentration.  We can see that in some way the thoughts that arise are alien to us and the "observer" is the one, permanent, I. Let us call this "observer" the True I.These worldy phenomenon- be they thoughts, emotions or events- to which we usually identify ourselves are given the name of "A" influences.  Occasionally we will have another type of higher experience, named "B" influences or those issuing from God.It occurs to me that one should observe the "A" influences from the vantage point of the True I and willfully decide to engage them or not.  The idea is to enter into a more conscious role with the world and ourselves.  Mouravieff has other ideas though.We should according to him, "never again participate enthusiastically in life.  In other words one must die to life if one is to deflect the "A" influences and attract more of the "B" influences.Here is where Mouravieff shows his hand and where I must part company with him.  He views the fall of man from a strictly negative point of view similar to some forms of gnosticism.  Life is an evil into which man has fallen and you had better disengage with it.  Instead could not there be a positive view of the fall: that it is also a chance for creation and consciousness to expand?In order for consciousness to grow, life must be engaged consciously and not avoided.  To do so, one must be a conscious participant and not just a disinterested actor (as Mouravieff suggests).  For an example of what I mean, please see the wonderful film by Wim Wenders, "The Wings of Desire".

$review_text.: "No, painting is not done to decorate apartments.  It's an instrument of war for attack and defense against the enemy."  So said Pablo Picasso, as World War II was ending.  He must have reflected at the time that even the most famous painting-as-weapon had not really made a difference in a previous war or the current one.  Still, his _Guernica_ had made an impression, and it still does.  When war against Iraq was being considered, the United Nations's huge tapestry reproduction of the painting (originally made for Nelson Rockefeller, and donated by him to the UN) was covered up.  A plain blue background was needed for the broadcasters in the building, said a UN spokesman; you won't be able to pull a cover on the upcoming carnage in Iraq, said an Australian delegate.  In _Guernica: The Biography of a Twentieth-Century Icon_ (Bloomsbury) Gijs van Hensbergen has given a readable summary of both the art and the politics of the painting, from the history of the Spanish Civil War and the heinous bombing that it depicts to its eventual return to the Spanish republic.  There is thus plenty of twentieth century history here, and art theory, and biography of the most influential painter of the century.  It is all wonderfully well integrated and fascinating.In 1937, Picasso was in Paris when he heard of the atrocity of the firebombing of Gernika (Basque spelling), far behind the lines and without military connections, arranged by Franco and carried out by the Nazis as an initial experiment in what we have come to know as "total war."  He had procrastinated on a commission for the Paris Expo, but in a frenzy of inspiration, he drew his first sketches and five weeks later had completed the painting.  After the Expo, the painting began its extensive travels, with the aim of giving support to the anti-fascists in Spain.  Picasso refused to let it go anywhere in Spain until "a genuine Spanish republic had been restored."  Picasso was satisfied with _Guernica_ settling in New York: "By means of _Guernica_ I have the pleasure of making a political statement every day in the middle of New York."  But as a communist, his work was suspect, and the references to Franco and the Spanish Civil War were dropped from the label at the Museum of Modern Art.  J. Edgar Hoover asked specifically that the US Embassy in Paris send any info on Picasso, even though the FBI had no business trying to get dirt on foreigners.  The file on Picasso included asinine whoppers such as the accusation that he was a Russian spy.  A congressman from Michigan state seems to have assumed a Rush Limbaugh-like role as radio commentator, railing against Picasso as "the hero of all the crackpots in so-called modern art" and that "critics who support modern art should be attended to."Picasso died in 1973, and Franco in 1975.  Franco had been increasingly ill and distant from actual power, and Picasso's work had gradually been allowed to be shown within Spain.  Poster reproductions of _Guernica_ were popular.  Picasso had not lost his bite, and gallery owners had to worry about vandalism, some of the worries proving to be entirely justified.  The final section of the book deals with the difficult and labyrinthine negotiations to bring the painting back to the home it had never known.  Politicians, lawyers, Basques, city boosters, and heirs all had to have their say, but eventually under extreme security, the massive canvass made a triumphal entry into Madrid in 1981, originally installed in a huge, guarded box of bullet-proof glass.  One commentator observed, "Today the last exile has returned to Spain."  That is the sort of tribute and the degree of importance attributed to _Guernica_ repeatedly through the book.  Its detractors, frequently quoted here, may be many, and its influence in actually stopping war may be nil.  It will forever haunt us, though, like a conscience that insists that someday war ought to be no more.

$review_text.: There is a lot of promise in "Known Afterlife", which bursts with ideas, and it only lacks a bit of polish
The book could be categorised as sci-fi, but the principal themes are religion, enlightenment and environmental symbiosis.The plot revolves around "the Provider": a Gaia-like alien planet, which interacts with its native lifeforms in complex ways

Fans of "Avatar" will be familiar with a similar premise

Steffor is one of the Provider's inhabitants who is most attuned to its powers and influence; this allows him to participate in the extreme sport of diving, but more importantly he is charged with protecting his culture and its spirituality

I found the chapters about him quietly moving.Another character, Stalling, is prominent in the book, but he is a scientist and not a mystic


His exploits first appear to be orthogonal to Steffor's, until the surprising connection becomes clear


Don't expect a conclusion to the overarching story in this volume, but do expect a thought-provoking and entertaining journey through exotic worlds.

$review_text.: I started this novel with high hopes, but these were dashed not long into the slow-moving plot. I found it very hard to believe that the main character could keep asking why the "villain" did this or that? It was obvious what he was doing which was ripping off the father for hundreds of thousands of dollars.The clues were totally unsubtle, the heroine very stupid. Why would she rush off to confront someone whom she suspects of fraud and murder, thus giving him plenty of time to cover his tracks? Her relationship with her lover is most unconvincing, as she asks him to wire her an enormous sum of money and agrees to marry him, but then doesn't bother to check her emails.The descriptions of the landscape take over pages of what should have been well-written mystery. Nothing in this novel was a mystery and the ending felt as though the author had suddenly realised that she has to finish the book, so rushed through the final denouement in a page or two.Most disappointing. I will try another by this author, and hope that things improve.

$REVIEW.: This second volume of "Plastic Man Archives" sees Jack Cole really hitting his stride.  His stories are charming and comedic, with some dark overtones.  His art is precisely cartoony, which is probably an oxymoron.  His characters are drawn to appear like something one would see in the funny pages, but Cole packed into his pages incredible detail and energy.  "Plastic Man" was easily one of the liveliest and distinct features the golden age of comics produced.  It's light-hearted without being ridiculous, serious without being too heavy or grim.  I'm glad DC is rolling this series out at such a fast pace.

At first I was disappointed in this book, but then I realized it's quite appropriate for its intended audience.  It provides a broad overview of the writing process and then outlines the steps to publication.  It's as good a place to start as any.  Even for more experienced writers there are parts of the book worth studying: I made special note of the sections on story ideas and emotional moments.

$REVIEW.: Spend the time reading this book, it is well worth the short part of your life to put things in a good and positive perspective, at least that was the case for this subject chosen to write a Eulogy.  When the character in this novel finds himself, perhaps deservedly, out of work, he learns how much he had departed from being the best he could be.  Anyone can profit from this book and anyone can enjoy it. Perhaps those who all think the world owes them a living could somehow find the time and couple of bucks to learn from The Legacy Inheritance and turn their lives around. Thanks for a great read!  Have now bought the second book from this author and looking forward to it.

$REVIEW.: For the first time in my life I actually understand why companies are so draconian about their copyright and trademarks
Of course I understood it from an intellectual perspective, but this has shown it to me first hand

The last Sherlock Holmes comics I reviewed were some from Dynamite and they had a very specific pulpy feel to them, however this is a Dark Horse comic and the art style, particularly the colouring, is very different to that
It different definitely does not mean worse, but it was interesting expecting this to be one thing and it being something else entirely.This comic does something very rare and I appreciate it very much

It throws you into a cold opening, which in this case helps to get the story going rapidly, but it manages in just the first three pages to provide enough set up and build up that by the end of it there is already a swerve that I did not see coming


Normally that takes an entire twenty-two page issue to happen, so I &#8216;doff my cap&#8217; to the writer for managing that so quickly and effectivelyThe story is incredibly well crafted, especially when you consider that this is a French book and is translated into English, which a spectacular effort as translations are often terribly done

The writing style is very formal, the entire book is a letter written to Watson, and it is fitting for the language used, which again is impressive for a translation

In fact knowing that this is a French publication explains one tiny detail which the artist got wrong and that I am certain almost no one else will pick up

At one point they leave Paris for London and go to the vampires castle, unfortunately it is in a French Renaissance style, one which is entirely absent in the UK
The correct style for that period would have been Tudor which is red and black brick rather than sculpted white stone and I hate myself for picking even the smallest hole in the stunning artwork.It claims to be a Sherlock Holmes book, yet breaks one of the most intrinsic rules of that story telling by making the monsters real


However if you remove that preconception and read it as a monster-horror-mystery story then it works fantastically, supported by some of the best art I have seen in a comic book
Therefore I think I can sum it up thusly; if you are Sherlock Holmes fanatic who loves the Conan Doyle books, then avoid this like the plague
However if you like well told stories with fantastic art then you will love this book.

$review_text.: Jose Lezama Lima achieved one of the most complex and mesmerizing novels of the XXth century in Latin America

Paradiso is a Bildungsroman (a novel about an individual's growing process) as it is a Kunstroman (novel about the artist)

The reader will find many references to Lezama's life, but his work goes beyond a self portrait
Jose Cemi is a little cuban boy who grows up having breathing problems, and grasping the lifes of those who were before him.His individuality mixes with the other's and the result is a complex narrator, an overwhelming amount of literary, cultural and mythological references, a refined use of the metaphor and a hightened sense of reality
Cemi's world is more than nature..

it is supernatural

Cemi attends to the world of death, as he remembers the lifes of his ancestors, as they are told to him by his mother Rialta, and grandmother Augusta

The first half of Paradiso is all about the family..
then uncle Alberto's death marks a point of change in the novel
From that moment on, it focuses in Cemi's friendship with two other students: Fronesis and Focion


The three of them constitute a triangle in which homosexuality, love, erotism, unity, mythology and androginy are the main topics

As well as incest.When this simbolic triangle breaks, Cemi is ready for the epiphany: he meets Oppiano Licario: a friend of his father who promised him, as he was dying, to look after his son (Cemi)
Licario also witnessed Alberto's sexual iniciation
He is a poet, and he is the one who can bring Jose Cemi out of the time of desperation into a rythm of reflection and artistic contemplation.There is so much more to this novel..

You can only know what it is all about by reading it
I can here only give you a few pieces


As Lezama believed: only what is hard is really rewarding, and this is particularly true for young people.

$REVIEW.: Ms. Locke's book is the third in her Victorian San Francisco Mysteries (and she has two short stories in the series too), and she continues the strong characters and interesting views of Victorian San Francisco. This reviewer was raised across the bay from the city, and finds the mix of mystery, San Francisco history and strong women characters very appealing.Bloody Lessons deals, in part, with the historical battle over teachers' pay and responsibilities. We think that our teachers are underpaid and undervalued now, but in 1880 their salaries were a travesty. Teachers were paid based on the age level they taught, their sex, and their connections. "The newspaper said that one of the Board members justified lower salaries for the primary grades because taking care of the youngest children didn't require any special training or experience to do well." The school board wanted to slash salaries by 30%!The mystery in the book surrounds our protagonist, a financial advisor disguised as a psychic, young widow Annie Fuller. She runs a boarding house to support herself, and helps advise the San Francisco elite with their investments by pretending to be a medium; after all, women are thought not to have the brains to provide advice of any kind! Annie's beau, lawyer Nate Dawson, asks Annie to mentor and sponsor his young sister, Laura, who is a teacher. The plot thickens when angry, accusatory letters begin to circulate about hanky-panky between board members and teachers.The historical background is accurate and beautifully recounted in Bloody Lessons. Each chapter is headed by a quote taken from the San Francisco Chronicle of the time. As Annie struggles to maintain her disguise as a psychic medium, Madame Sybil, she debates whether her clients have come to trust her enough to allow her to let the clandestine personality emerge and openly become a financial advisor, working under her own name. In addition to that worry, she is juggling her relationship with Nate, concerned about the well-being of her boarding house tenants, and striving to solve the seemingly insolvable.The past is revealed slowly, as several teachers in the story seem to have secrets. Who were the men in Laura Dawson's former life, and why was she attacked in the alley? Why are there some teachers without any training or credentials? Ribboned throughout the story are Annie's personal relationships, friends and co-workers who are very three-dimensional and believable. The reader can take a genuine interest in these Victorian lives, in San Francisco's communities at that time, and in the characters that come to life and bloom in Bloody Lessons.Ms. Locke's background as a college professor (recently retired) of U.S. History and Women's History have proven to be a boon in her writing of this dynamic series. Although the books stand alone well, I recommend that you start with the first book, Maids of Misfortune, so you can appreciate fully the growth of the characters and beauty of the San Francisco setting.by Laura Strathman Hulkafor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women

So far have made her Oven Fried Catfish (I substituted Tilapia and it worked just fine) and her Buttermilk Pan Fried Chicken which was, without a doubt, the best chicken to ever come out of MY kitchen.  I am certainly no chef and consider myself to be an average cook, so I really appreciate her detailed explanations on how to make these dishes come out a winner.  Even if you didn't watch the TV show, there is much to be gained from this 'cookbook'.  Also purchased the "MasterChef" cook book and although I haven't attempted any of the dishes yet, there are many I look forward to making.

I was really getting drawn into the story, although didn't quite understand why they had it jumping around after just a few paragraph's of telling what was going on. When I got to the end of this 'story', I honestly thought my Kindle had messed up the download or something. I knew it had a larger book as it tells you:"If you enjoy this free story from Quiet As They Come, consider the full version found here."And it directs you to where you can pay $9.99 for the full story. Meanwhile, this essay sized book has a retail value of $15.95 so I was excited to get a steal as this was a free download from Amazon. I was expecting it to not finish the story...but to barely start it. I'm so irritated by the 'marketing ploy' that I probably won't purchase the actual book.

$REVIEW.: Even though I knew about the major events that make up this book, even though I knew the ending before I started - this book was more compelling than any other I've read this year.The fight for marriage equality is one that I am passionate about


 I feel that it is the civil rights movement of my lifetime and I have watched at times in awe at how fast things are changing - and at times in abject frustration at some of the setbacks and deep-seeded hate that is still out there.Jo Becker provides a behind the scenes look at people whose lives were changed dramatically (several times!) by the battle over Proposition 8 in California and by DOMA in the US


 Her writing style is so clear and clean, that at times I forgot that I was reading and I felt like I was truly there - that I was a first-hand observer in the lives of the plaintiffs, lawyers and activists.It was so interesting to read this in light of where our country is going, how in terms of social progress, the fight for marriage equality is FINALLY moving at a quicker pace
 Becker writes in such a way that the reader is able to absorb a great deal of facts, court procedures and history without feeling overwhelmed


 Each person has his/her own voice, and the action moves swiftly - causing me a few late nights.I was fascinated by this book, by this story of people from all sides that came together to force necessary change
 It was emotional without being flowery or sappy, it was powerful without being preachy, and above all, it felt fair.I applaud Jo Becker for this amazing book and hope to see more from her.

$review_text.: Another great book by Carrie Daws. The lessons to learn in this book. Melody had a hard path to see where god wanted her. Her faith I believe was tested. Like most of us I think we put our faith in ourselves or other people or things. Where our faith should lie is with Jesus. Was a tearful story about loss but yet she found her true peace. Her husband David also had lessons to learn. Where did God truly want him? I love the families in this series and look forward to each book and the lesson there for us to learn. Carrie you do a wonderful job. Looking forward to your next book.If you haven't read this series I would recommend you do. Well worth your money and your time.

$review_text.: I thought this would be a fun read, but 1/2 way through it was a little boring. It wasn't that it was just predictable, but it took forever to end. It's not that long of a book, but the story was over way before the epilogue. I love a happily ever after ended as much as the next girl, but... GIVE ME SOMETHING. I would try another story from this author but I would not have high expectations. Even when I don't agree with where some stories got to, at least they take some risks.

$review_text.: This is one of the series that actually got me reading books like crazy!  I picked the first book up in this series a little over a year ago and I have been hooked on every book that comes out.  I seriously will sit down and read the entire book in one day.  And this newest book in the McCarthy&#8217;s of Gansett Island Series was no different.  It was a little shorter than I wished it would have been but it was fantastic.  Jared had me interested from when we saw him in Jenny and Alex&#8217;s story and I was happy to hear that he ends up finding his true love again!  I want to Thank Marie for writing so quickly to keep up with us demanding readers.  I can&#8217;t wait for the next in this series to come out.  This is a book you don&#8217;t want to miss!

No plot to speak of, no engaging characters, no intrigue except the speculation on the androgynous nature of the 'heroine.' That mystery is left unresolved, and the whole book ends rather pointlessly.

$REVIEW.: I was two years old when Willy Wonka was in the theaters so I can't claim to remember EXACTLY the first time I saw Willy Wonka. It had to have been a TV special and, proudly, I claim to be a HUGE Wonka fan and have seen the movie at least a dozen times.And while I love Behind the Scenes glimpses of beloved movies, I was a *tiny* bit hesitant to read Julie's memoir for fear of hearing something like, "Oh that Gene Wilder was an awful man" or "the whole production was horrid." Well, fear not, fellow Wonka fanatics! Julie Cole's memoir DOES give us a peek of her experiences in and around the beloved movie with much love and fondness. Especially liked her memories of her on-screen father.In my 80s memoir, I make mention that "every 40-something male loves Gene Wilder for his roles as Willy Wonka, Dr. Frankenstein, the Waco Kid, and his movies with Richard Pryor." In Gene's memoir, Kiss Me Like a Stranger (which I also enjoyed very much), I WAS disappointed that he only made a brief mention of his role as Willy Wonka. Well, Julie has filled in many of the details I was hoping to read in Gene's memoir. And now that I think of it, I can also say that "every 40-something male will forever have a crush on Veruca Salt!" Yes, Veruca is nasty...but she's also CUUUUUTE...and every guy loves a girl who's just a bit bad...(though Veruca was a little more than "just a bit")...I read this book on two cross-country flights and could not put it down. Thank you, Julie Dawn Cole, for giving us a glipse behind the Wizard's Curtain...for telling us about the Chocolate Room, and your countless hours rehearsing your big song, and your exploits around Munich...AND for your life afterward! Here in the States, we didn't see BBC shows so I'm glad to know that your career continued on a successful course.LOVE Willy Wonka! (Refuse to see the Johnny Depp remake...just can't do it...) and LOVE Willy Wonka even more thanks to this well-written memoir from one of its principal and eternally-unforgettable characters!Tom Harveyauthor of "The Eighties: A Bitchen Time To Be a Teenager!"

$review_text.: There are two reasons why I feel everyone interested in Kabbalah should read this work:A: It is truly JEWISH Kabbalah, and is not blended with New Age or Golden Dawn theory. Rabbi Cooper looks into Talmudic folklore and Scripture to explore the true origins and meaning of the Kabbalah. As a non-Jew, this is very important to me.B: Rabbi Cooper's style is easy to follow, and his focus is always on how it benefits the reader to know these deep and sometimes confusing esoteric ideas.But its more than just a work on Kabbalah. This text changed me, and it is a work I refer to over and over during personal meditation. Rabbi Cooper's discussion of God, the Book of Genesis, and the Soul have totally changed my personal beliefs on these topics. I feel it is one of the most valuable spiritual works I have ever read. Period.
$SUMMARY.: Absolutely essential for anyone wanting to know JEWISH Kabbalah

$REVIEW.: I'm not sure of the structure of this book, if there is one, but the text itself is worth reading. The author imagines the entire process of living through a pandemic, making one's way to a government camp, etc. (I'm only halfway through the story at this point.) There is lots of good detail and a nice mix of characters. I find myself wanting to know how they fare as time goes on.As always, I despair at the state of the editing profession. The author uses phrases like '"off of" (which appears at least twice) and to switch tenses in mid-paragraph. Simple editing should have caught such egregious missteps. Also, in the Kindle edition at least, the table of contents is useless.I probably would buy another book by this author.By the way, although this book comes up when one searches for "28 Days Later," the book plot is entirely different to that of the movie. Perhaps the sequel book, "The Killing Floor," is closer to the movie content; I don't know.This book actually reminds me more of Stephen King's short story, "The Mist."
$SUMMARY.: Interesting, page-turning story.

$REVIEW.: As with her previous two books, The Moonlighter's Guide to Online Writing for Immediate Income and How I Made an Extra $1200 Per Month at Home Using One Free Website, Connie Brentford has yet again come to the party in terms of in-depth and thorough research with her latest offering: Make Money Online: 67 Real Companies That Pay You to Work in Your Pajamas.It's a short read, but don't let the book's brevity put you off. This is very much a case of not judging a book by its length. She may well be the queen of super long titles, but Ms. Brentford is by no means verbose. She gets straight to the point; there's no wading through a bunch of long-winded preamble first.Make Money Online offers solid advice for aspirant work-from-homers, as well as a wealth of well-researched resources. Connie covers a wide range of opportunities ranging from Call Centre work to Online Tutoring to Virtual Assistant jobs, and much more besides. She also talks about how to avoid getting scammed and job searching beyond what is offered in the book.My original issue with the book was that the majority of the opportunities listed were for United States residents only, but Connie has since given the book a make-over and included a section for those of us living elsewhere. While not as meaty or long, the section does offer some opportunities.One thing to keep in mind though, this is not some get rich quick scheme. The pay offered for most jobs is average at best.

$review_text.: I was very disappointed with this book.  Being very familiar with Pennsylvania Dutch country and having grandparents that lived  all of their lives and ancestors dating back to 1722 in the area, I can say that this book is not "authentic" pow-wow.  Instead, it is a conglomeration of the author's beliefs and stories that were "Wiccanized" for individuals who want to practice a form of Christian magic, but are uncomfortable with the Christian part of it.  I also took a double take at some of the author's assertions or implications that some sort of goddess worshipping groups were resident in the area during the late 17th and early 18th century and had come over from Europe when the Swedish first came to Pennsylvania.  This is really a ridiculous assumption.  Pow-wow had no roots in pagan religions as many want to imply.  I have never heard of any old-time pow-wow practitioners who worship the goddess.  Most of them were/are members of the Reformed churches (now the UCC), Lutherans, or members of the Church of the Brethren. For an interesting discussion of the origins of Pow-wow see the works of Don Yoder.I also found the "updated" charms slighlty amusing.  All of them, including some of the Psalms, were "updated" to make them more comfortable for individuals who apparently are uncomfortable with Christianity. God had been changed to Goddess, Christ to the lord/lady and etc.  The author did have enough sense to leave the 23rd Psalm alone - I guess reading "The Goddess is my shepherdess , there is nothing I shall want" seemed silly, even to her.However, all that being said, I do admire the author for attempting to keep the vestiges of a dying practice from becoming extinct.  By bringing pow-wow(Hexerie or Braucherie)to the mainstream, it will definitely help more people to explore this interesting practice.  Again, however, she does some disservice by trying to pass of what is in the book as "pow-wow".  I would definitely recommend other books for those truly interested in Hexerei, Braucherei or Pow-wow.  Those books would be the Bible, The Long Lost Friend by Hohman, the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses and etc.  Use the original sources and much of the practice can easily be discovered.

$REVIEW.: Every time I pick up a new one by Nocomus Columbus, I think to myself, oh God, what have I done. This man has a skill for taking me where I don't want to go. I read ROMANCE NOVELS, for crying out loud. But I'm hooked. So when I see a new one up, I can't help but look.And once again, he delivers, dragging me into a genre of literature I normally despise, this time post-apocalyptic. And as usual, he made me like being there. This story was fascinating, intense, and thought-provoking.We follow McDonald through his flashbacks and nightmares, his fights and his love affair with a hooker too many years his junior. We trace his downfall and triumph in what must be one the most tragic happy endings ever written.As usual, the images just jump off the screen, vividly, painfully alive.The skill with which this story was wrought is astonishing. If it weren't for the language, this is the kind of story one would read in class and analyze for theme, tone, and imagery. It's that strong.And so, the girly romance lover can only shake her head and say, most sincerely, he's done it again. No matter what genres of literature you like, you won't want to miss this.

$review_text.: With all due respect to previous reviewers who may have glanced at this book,Opus Dei is NOT a monastic order and has zero monks.Dead Sea Scrolls are Jewish and make zero reference to Jesus OR Xty. There was NO Vatican in the "early centuries of Xty." not until 12th century, a fact explained concisely with precision in Deception Q+A format. Easy to check and a quick read. Just the simple fact that the Church venerates (not worships) the Blessed Virgin Mary completely displaces all DVC claims that the Church suppressed women.Myth after manufactured,conjured misleading 'facts' are dispelled.Another key fact recalls  that the earliest Christians DID believe Jesus was divine, 250 years before Nicea! There are no rabbits appearing from Brown's hat just $$$$ into his hat. A brief look(as this book aptly explains) at the New Testament itself mentions Jesus as God's Son over 100 times and early Christian writers Ignatius,Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Tertullian as well.Christ's humanity is very clear in the Gospels not the Gnostic writings, but the New Testament. Christ bleeds real blood, cries tears at the death of his friend Lazarus,desires to share Passover with his friends,the Apostles and so on.  Great for subway,bus,doctor appointment waiting room times.  Best book for the price and info. This book exposes countless deceptions and provides the facts without clutter.

It is so much going on but the pieces to the story fits.Nina and Carlos went through so much but it show's that the relationship the two have and what they were up against that they had each other's back.Pito was a underhanded mess.Miranda character proves that a woman scorn will do anything to get payback even though she put her own self in the position she was in.
