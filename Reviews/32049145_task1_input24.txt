$REVIEW.: Reading these book just makes me feel good. They are funny and can take you into the characters lives as if they were your real friends. I've really enjoyed feading each one. I am reading them in order as a series.  Some of the people come back in other books , which is so fun to me!These books also help to lean about yourself, what I like about me and what I'd like to change. I see this as the characters live out their daily lives.I very much recommend! !  Its great reading, deep and touching- as well as care free,  Enjoy!

$review_text.: WAR OF WINGS is the first in a trilogy surrounding the fall of Lucifer and a third of the angels from Heaven.WAR OF WINGS is a well thought out and imaginative account of events leading up to, during, and immediately after the fall via Gabriel and Lucifer&#8217;s points of view.Gabriel is introduced as a slacker who becomes a reluctant and unlikely leader.Lucifer Morningstar the first and brightest, the great deceiver who believed he was God&#8217;s equal.We know the story of Lucifer and his expulsion from Heaven, but we know the 20,000 foot version.  Tanner McElroy imagines a more personal view for readers, adroitly walking a fine line of humanizing angels enough to make them relatable while maintaining their otherworldliness.  It&#8217;s well done and the slow inexorable transformation of Lucifer and his followers, a visual reflection of their hearts, is one of my favorite aspects.Lucifer&#8217;s insidious campaign against God and Gabriel&#8217;s struggle with love and truth drew me into WAR OF WINGS. When events finally culminate in a definitive battle on the grounds of Provender, God&#8217;s loyal angels have no concept of the dark knowledge Lucifer has gained and can&#8217;t wait to wield. During the battle, I was reading furiously while white-knuckle gripping my book. Despite knowing the outcome, tense, would be putting it mildly.WAR OF WINGS is a thought provoking book about God, faith, love, free will, and responsibility.  If these interest you, WAR OF WINGS should be at the top of your TBR pile.  Hopefully, BkII, THE REIGN will be released soon.I&#8217;ll leave you with my favorite passage.  It speaks volumes.&#8220;They made their own choice, Gabriel.  There is no hope for them.  You must accept that.&#8221;&#8220;That is the difference between you and me. I believe God&#8217;s forgiveness is limitless. I have hope for her. I have hope for all of them.&#8221;  He looked back to the beautiful blue world receding into the distance behind them. So much promise there. When he spoke again it was with hard-earned wisdom.  He could feel the truth of it. &#8220;Some see a hopeless end while others see endless hope.&#8221;Reviewed by IvyD for Manic Readers

$review_text.: This author has done it again! She has written a story I have thoroughly enjoyed


Sometimes when you read a series of books, one of them doesn't meet your expectations


 Not so with this series
 They have all been very enjoyable!Grace Westcott has always thought she was a good person and enjoyed helping others and doing good


 When she is kidnapped and taken by a French mercenary, Rafe Dubois, she questions why this is happening to her

 Rafe has agreed to deliver her to a man who wants to do her harm


But the journey by ship to Columbia has Rafe doubting his decision to turn her over for money

 And the journey is also showing Grace that "good" people are sometimes bad and "bad" people can sometimes turn out to be good
 Both Rafe and Grace have alot to learn

I really liked Rafe in this story and how he handled Grace
Their interaction throughout the story was enjoyable to read
I could easily read the wholeseries all over again.

$SUMMARY.: Another great book by M.L.Tyndall

Visions of Wool is a good addition to Wooliverse with a bit of mysticism. Why not? The whole Wool world is quite mystic. What I liked most in this piece is the optimism. Unlike other Silo stories where the uprising and breaking out led to Silo's shut down, here is a positive end &#8212; the people with help of somewhat mystical force provided by main character Grace managed to reborn their Silo.

This story would be a good one to use as an introduction for a child who is just starting to read as the text is very simple and uses repetition of basic words to help build confidence while learning to read

I love all of her books

She keeps you guessing who has done the murder until the very end of the story


Who you may have thought did it was not the person who did do it

Okay, I'm hooked

I like the characters, and this book keeps me wanting to read more to see what happens to them


Some of the characters I just want to say to them, "get a clue" or "get over it"

But that's what keeps me interested in them.Fast moving and interesting


I recommend it to anyone who likes murder mysteries

I felt like I was invading someone&#8217;s privacy as I poured over the letters back and forth between Ever and Caden.  It was as if I was sitting in a chair upstairs in some darkened attic, long after they have left this earth; leaving a legacy of their beginning, their love, their lives.  It brought me to tears over and over as I physically lived their pain through her words&#8230;that is how real it felt.

$review_text.: Marylu is a very good author and knows how to develop a story and her characters. This time period in our country concerning people who were light skinned and could pass for white is very interesting. Many were very good looking with the combination of races as in this case. I can't imagine what these people went through when they didn't fit in either race as the 1/2 white,1/2 Indian people went through. We whites are very judgmental and I think that is finally getting a lot better in many ways.The story is intriguing and the main character will draw you into her life. She is constantly living like a person who has committed a crime and yet her only crime is being born. The story will lead you on quite an adventure. I can't wait for the next one!Write on MaryLu!

To me, each one, just gets better than the previous...I love the way she brings the couples from the previous books into the present one...Leo is quite the different rock star dude and I loved that about him
No drugs for one! He is quite the lover and works his magic to win Sam over...But in the end, who could refuse his charm and witty sense of humor! Case in point, one of my favorite lines from him to Sam, "I was wondering if you'd like me to take you to have that stick pulled out of your ass"...Looking forward to book 5 Safe With Me, Caleb and Brynna's story..One question though, I can't seem to remember who Brynna is

I know she moved into Nat's old house, but who was she connected to?

$review_text.: Jake Needham is a unique author, a blend of James Clavell&#8217;s knowledge and love of the orient, Raymond Chandler&#8217;s intensity and Ian Fleming&#8217;s panache, knowledge of foreign affairs and intrigue.Needham&#8217;s &#8216;everyman&#8217; hero, Jack Shepherd, is neither good nor bad

His wit sets his boundaries, confuses the enemy and if only it were a boat, could keep his head above water


Complex thinking, honed by his life in the orient, is his strongest asset in &#8220;A World of Trouble&#8221;, a thriller that I found impossible to put down


I don&#8217;t just &#8216;read&#8217; Needham&#8217;s novels, I &#8216;live&#8217; them; and immediately feel homesick when I inhale the last word.Needham&#8217;s ability to write and weave plots within plots also demands an unraveling, but you&#8217;ll find the answers throughout the book, so skipping to the end will avail you nothing
Major and minor plot twists and turns abound, one ends while another begins, and the entire time you&#8217;re fully immersed into a world of exotic places, characters and intrigue.Even now, any hotel that caters to the international crowd has a bar where, any evening, you can find &#8216;money men&#8217; drinking brandy and cognac, smoking expensive cigars and negotiating deals; spies drinking gin or vodka, flicking the ever-present cigarette, looking cool and watchful; truly dangerous men, eyes dark and intense, their posture seemingly relaxed while laughing disarmingly, sharing their latest joke with a &#8216;pal&#8217;, a &#8216;neat&#8217; scotch or beer held loosely in their hand; they don&#8217;t smoke because their physical prowess is their best friend.A room like that isn&#8217;t the place to kick back and experience a good dinner, it&#8217;s a good place to sharpen your wits and know it&#8217;s possible you&#8217;re in for the ride of your life.And that&#8217;s my best description of a Jake Needham novel.

$REVIEW.: I tried a book outside my normal range of interests, and occasionally that really works out for me, but this didn't do it

 I think the author does a good job at the writing (which is an accomplishment these days since it seems I've read so many books, especially on Kindle that lack writing skills, plot development, etc)
 It's a fascinating subject, but going back and forth between times didn't work for me


 There were some things in the book that were too fantastical to believe (don't want to give any spoilers, but after it's read, others might agree)


 I wouldn't read again, I wouldn't recommend, but I wouldn't say avoid it either

 I can't give this below four because it is well developed, well researched, character driven and beautiful at times, just wasn't for me, and maybe too depressing at times.

This is also the story of the love a father has for his son, no matter what, even while the son withholds love from his father. The rewards of material success are examined and ultimately compared to the rewards of family love. It is a good story, but it is a story of limits.

$review_text.: I wasn't feeling well when I started this book, and had a bit of trouble getting into the story. I came back to the reviews and after skimming through a few, decided I would keep reading. I am very happy I made that decision. As another reviewer mentioned, I also found myself dreading the chapters reflecting the dismal and cruel reality of the orphanage. I will strive to remember each day as was presented in this worthwhile novel that a smile and kind words cost nothing and can literally be life changing to the recipient. Thank you, Christina McKenna, for this lovely work!

$REVIEW.: This is a well written coming of age story set in 1800's Arkansas. The characters are well fleshed out and don't feel one dimensional at all. The story line flows at just the right pace. Enough detail that the reader doesn't feel lost and not so much that you get bored and bogged down. The ending felt a little abrupt until I realized...we haven't heard the last from Brody.  I also loved the historical accuracies that the author injected into the story. The reader gets a good feel for what life would have been like in that place and time. I can't wait for the next installment in this story and am thrilled to have found a new "favorite" author.

$review_text.: As with most gay romance novels written by women, there is the small and fragile character who needs to be rescued by the big masculine second character. Just change a few pronouns and you have a straight romance novel.  If that's what you like, that's fine. Personally I prefer to read a gay romance between two men who are equals.  But I understand that women like these kinds of books, so there is a market for them.  I'll stick to gay romance novels written by men, who seem to understand the gay psyche best.  That being said, this was an interesting story, and most women will enjoy it very much.

I'm confident that through the application of this inexpensive ebook, I'll be a connoisseur in a matter of weeks.* This ebook should really be called a crafty and engaging database of wine perspective, respect, and passion.* It taught me more during my first read, then I would have absorbed through the grapevine over a decade's worth of time.* The author doesn't miss a single beat, and lays out everything one needs to know to enjoy wine and its delicious complexities in a user friendly way.This includes the inherent complimentary natures it possesses in terms of cooking, dining out, and personal satisfaction.My favorite part is the no-nonsense style. It's polished, and as refined as an aged Sicilian Nero d'Avola. The formatting is great, and I never have to worry about buying any other study material, this ebook is a one stop shop!

$REVIEW.: This was the first book that I have read in comparing Christianity and Islam and I must say, I could not put it down, I read it in about four days and as much I like to read at times I am a slow poke!  There are already quite a few reviews but it gives great insight into the culture Gabriel came from, why he left and the struggle for people in Palestine to embrace the Christian faith.  The best argument (there were many) was Gabriel's treatment of Muslims misunderstanding Jesus' teaching about the Holy Spirit in John 14 and 16.  I have talked to numerous Muslims and many believe that the "spirit of truth" to come is Muhammad, but Gabriel clearly explains why this cannot be the case.  The "spirit of truth" is said to be inside the believer, so how can Muhammad, being a man, be inside a believer?  If we follow the logical train of thought in the context of John it has an immediate context, which came to pass in Acts with the coming of the Holy Spirit, NOT something that happens over 500 years later with the coming of Muhammad.  If that was the case, why would Jesus speak about someone to come 500 years later to testify of Jesus?This is just one example of the great insights Dr. Gabriel speaks about and it really helped me understand a lot of what's, why's and it was a great comparison.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great comparison, read with an open mind and you will see why we all need Jesus Christ, even Muhammad did, but the truth was transformed into a lie.

$review_text.: As another reviewer has noted, this encyclopedia focuses virtually exclusively on the adventures of the "new" Doctors from the series reboot, covering Eccleston's single season and Tennant's first two. It's very handsomely illustrated with numerous color photos and packed with short and pithy entries and character biographies. It is NOT an episode guide, so be certain you know that you're getting a quick reference manual and not detailed synopses and reviews.There's a lot of material here, but a surprising amount of it smacks of filler. For instance, every song that was ever heard for more than three pico-seconds in any episode is included here--along with separate entries for the band or singer. And in some cases, for the composer. So, we get to read a bit about Jeff Lynne--because he wrote an ELO song that was featured in one episode. That's...just a little oddly obsessive to me. Where do you draw the line? Why not comment on the brand of spark plugs used by a taxi the Doctor rode in?Another minor annoyance is that the author seems to pay overwhelming attention to two animated episodes ("Attack of the Graske" and "The Infinite Quest") that are probably not canonical and that are not very likely to be known to American viewers. I mean--sometimes it seems that every third or fourth entry pertains to one of these. It's a bit frustrating.The wealth of photos makes this a pretty good value, but overall this encyclopedia just seems a bit lightweight and has a lot of questionable entries. Try to get someone to buy it for you as a gift.

$REVIEW.: With the Invisibles, Grant Morrisson created an interesting, of-kilter variation of the super-hero comic.  From shamanistic transsexuals to James  Bond-wannabes, each character is individual, distinct, and interesting.  The high point in the second series, Black Science, dealt with the  long-running conspiracy theory that HIV was an engineered disease.  At the  height of this story, team leader Ragged Robin risks her soul to stop the  most vile character Morrisson has ever created: the dwarven Mister  Quimper.This book represents the prelude to Black Science II, as well as  a one-issue epilogue to the second series.  Morrisson also commits arguably  the greatest crime a writer can inflict upon his audience: he lies to them.  Repeatedly. Characters question each other's trustworthiness, only to  later prove that everyone really is trustworthy, after all.  Worse, the  climax to Black Science is undone by contrived time travel plots, the likes  of which almost undo the otherwise superb characterization.Ultimately,  what kills this book isn't that it was bad (barring the end of Black  Science II), but that it should have been much, much better.

$review_text.: I found a couple of contradictions that, to me, undermine the book. Mr. Carr compares the electric revolution of 100 years ago with the more recent IT revolution and argues that since electricity no longer confers a competitive advantage, then IT should be treated the same way. He underscores this by pointing out that &quot;many large companies created the new management post of vice president of electricity...But within a few years...[they] quietly disappeared&quot; (pg 29-30). Later in the book, he states that &quot;the seniormost corporate IT executives...need to lead the way in promulgating a new sense of realism about the strengths and limitations of IT&quot; (pg 133). If VPs of electricity are unnecessary, then why not so for IT executives?He also seems to contradict himself regarding ERP and Web browsing software. On page 113 he states, &quot;Yet the vast majority of workers who use PCs rely on only a few simple applications - word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, and Web Browsing&quot;. But earlier he writes, &quot;ERP packages promised to solve, and sometimes did solve, one of the most daunting and expensive problems facing modern companies: the proliferation of narrow, discrete software applications&quot; (pg 46). And on page 115, he describes how one business improved productivity by getting rid of Web browsers.

I do not understand why the author felt the need for these characters to be so disgusting to each other or why the women were constantly threatening to kill people and each other. The story was a good one that could have been a somewhat charming love story, but sadly it was ruined by a bunch of needless crap. How many times can the main character scream like a two year old and say &#34;I hate you&#34; ? Better luck next time.

$review_text.: It's much agreed by those that are that Hammett is the founder of this genre, though Raymond Chandler might bid for this honor. However, Hammett preceded Chandler,soooo. Decades ago I read Hammett's primary novels and was not too terribly impressed. Very convoluted. It took me all these years to give him another try in the short story format.Happily, I took the chance. I pretty much read the whole book in one sitting. Many, if not most of these stories otherwise comprise a &#34;stand-alone&#34; book titled The Continental Op(erative). The hero is not at all the stereotypical handsome, 6'2&#34;,  190 lbs. beat'm all to Hell. He's around 5'7&#34;, 190 lbs., admits to being chunky, not very swift of foot and decidedly not a ladies man. He's got a nationwide organization behind him, but there stories take place in the 1920's. Don't expect a GPS, cellphone, tv, jet aircraft, anything remotely related to computers. Most &#34;detecting&#34; was done with &#34;shanks-mare,&#34; or, rather, by foot, slower cars, trains, pay-phones often requiring an operator, buses and yes, streetcars!If you'd like a taste of an entirely different age, plenty of fast page-turning action, that reads well and makes sense, without all the rampant,raging, insatiable sex leading nowhere of today's crime story, yet be surprised at the knowledge even then possessed by the &#34;Dicks, gunshoes, peepers,&#34; grab a copy, flop back, yank a cork from a bottle of cheap hooch, fire up an unfiltered Camel, rest your .38 gat on the nightstand, toss your moll on the carpet and enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Oh Ms. O&#8217;Rourke what a perfectly naughty read! The Estate is exactly what it claims to be graphic erotica with an M/M/F m&eacute;nage that will delight fans of the genre as Grayson is introduced to The Estate. Although we don&#8217;t get the full details, we are given enough to know that Grayson is in need of some serious relief of sexual tension. Not only that, he is dealing with his attraction to his bi-sexual boss, Marc, who has been harboring feelings for Grayson for a decade. Marc convinces Grayson to accompany him to The Estate, where Boston&#8217;s elite shed their public persona and indulge in whatever hedonistic activities strike their fancy.Marc is one of The Estate&#8217;s elite members. He has been waiting for the opportunity to initiate Grayson into his world, even if only for the weekend. He learns upon their arrival that Ice (the ladies all use fake names) is there for the weekend and has requested the company of two men. As Marc has indulged in Ice before and is aware of her proclivities, he is pleased for the opportunity her presence provides.Once Grayson recovers from his shock of who Ice is when she&#8217;s not at The Estate, things heat up quickly as this trio indulge in as many pleasures as they can with one another. Ms. O&#8217;Rourke is definitely up to the task of providing the reader with plenty of steamy sexual escapades as Marc and Ice initiate Grayson into the world of The Estate. This is a definite re-read for me and I am looking forward to the sequel.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers!

$REVIEW.: In Amy's first book Ransomed Dreams we are introduced to Gracie and the overwhelming incident in her life. Gracie experiences every mother's nightmare. The story is fast paced, compelling and full of amazing scenes of forgiveness. I found it exciting, thought provoking, heartfelt and a very rich story.While Gracie's investigating the facts of her nightmare she meets FBI Agent Steven Kessler working in the Crimes Against Children Unit. Clint Rollins is Steven's partner. Clint's wife Sara is an oncologist. This group of people rooting for the same team encourages each other in and out of work. They all face impossible challenges in their lives day in and day out. They all have a strong faith in God. They live their faith out loud in the middle of unnerving situations. You'll want to read this book first so you'll experience the richness Healing Promises has in store for you.In Amy's new book Healing Promises, all the same characters are back. Faith as they knew it and life as they all were comfortable with is threatened. Clint is tested in every aspect of his existence while he fights for his life. Clint is also on a mission to save children's lives and catch the serial killer -it's becoming so confusing for Clint. But he is determined to be an overcomer.Clint is not going to let this disease get him down and stop him from getting this bad guy. Clint and his wife struggle with the reality that "In our weakness God is Strong." Both Clint and Sara are used to being at the top of their game, in control. They both struggled with letting go of control - and letting God work in every fiber of their being. They wonder can it be done?Both Clint and Sara didn't even want to entertain this thought "In Our weakness." That was a very uncomfortable place for them both to be, yet it was the very place God was taking them. This is a fast paced story with a great sense of family unity. Amy introduces a new character Hanna Kessler, Steven's sister. We will learn more about Hanna in the third and final book of this series. Parts of this book made me feel uncomfortable. If you have a family member or friend dealing with a serious illness this will grip you. Amy has a way of getting to the heart of the matter. Treatments can be brutal on the patient and the family members as well. I have known some people very close to me deal with this disease. I had a new appreciation for what that family has gone through. This will definitely open your eyes to many things medically which I felt were necessary to the story.Clint came to the conclusion "He was weak, but God was strong. God was God. God was in control." Control that is what Clint wanted; Sara wanted; we all want. Read how Amy's story gives a clear message of this very passage. This book will leave you with the message of hope and what God's love looks like. This book will take you deeper if you let the message of God's Love grip your heart.Finding Hope Through Fiction[...]

$REVIEW.: Zack has been the object of Chloe's attention for a long time. In fact in elementary school she created a club in honor of Zach. It was fun and a way to get together with her friends, she never expected it to continue in college. In fact, she wants it to end, but it just keeps going...To make matters worse, Zack has just become her stepbrother. She is desperate to keep the secret, but her best friend isn't doing so well in keeping confidences and friendships.For Zack, Chloe has always been the girl that he has secretly admired, but not wanted to get close to. He knew if he did, it would be beyond friendship for him. He will do anything to keep her safe and away from the guys who want to use her.The book was written in a fun and light voice. It alternates between Zach and Chloe's point of view. I really like that we get to know where both of them are in their opinion of each other.While this book is fun, it is not for readers who are not mature. There is quite a bit of swearing, several uses of the 'f' bomb, and lots of talk about sex.I received an ebook copy of this book for review purposes.  This is my honest opinion of the book.
$SUMMARY.: Cute and easy  read.

$review_text.: Let me preface this book review by stating it is a joy to read stories where the setting feels like home. (Texas) The fast-paced thrilling murder story leads you through a path of possible conclusions. I would say mystery, but the foreshadowing was overt. This  story was about finding proof. One of the things I admire about Molina's writing is the way she can use her craft to unravel clues slowly building a case so to speak against the antagonist. Little by little she allows you to gather more information mounting undeniable evidence.House of Cards had me a little on the edge of my seat as I wanted the antagonist to be caught. As the story develops it follows with a predictable ease; however, the ending surprised me as it also depicted a feeling of  empowerment. Flashbacks and memories the main character displayed mounted evidence in my mind. As a reader, I slowly started mounting my own evidence similar to what I would do if I were watching an Episode of Matlock or Bones without the strong forensics. Molina usually writes a little more romance in her other books, but the subtle romantic innuendos were enough for this serious and at times sad story. The cultural aspects of this novel in the title was witty. If you like a quick and nice read about plots of murder, then this is a book for you. It begins then it ends, there are no stagnant parts in House of Cards. It is like a piece of candy, you can't eat (read) just one.If you read this story, you will definitely want to read another of Molina's work.-M.Espinola[...]http://www.amazon.com/Terri-Molina/e/B004S2VMV2

$REVIEW.: When i read a marie Force book, i expect plenty of romance, decent love scenes, lots of  gratuitous "i love yous" and secondary plots to offer a little diversity to what would otherwise be a short novel.  You get that with "the Fall".  Ms Force has developed a good formula.  it's predictable and mostly unrealistic, but isn't that what romance novels are about?  it's not so unpredictable that you can't relate to the characters, in fact i think the subject matter Ms Force chose for "The Fall" was something I have rarely come across.  which is why i kept reading after i would have normally put the book down for a more dreary day.  stealing your best friends girl friend isn't an easy subject to tackle.  the morals and relationship dynamics were tackled quite well and insightful, which was better than the love story.  it made me really think about the choices we have in love.  how hard is it to do the right thing, and what is the right thing?  And the consequences are devastating to the individuals involved as well as the wider circle of friends.  I really enjoyed reading about how this scenario played out over time.What I didn't like about this book was the resolution to the drama.  I think Ted leaving Caroline was cowardly and almost unforgivable considering he made her a promise they would be in it together no matter what.  What ruined the book for me was this and the fact that Caroline took him back so easily.  It almost felt like Ms Force was in a rush to finish the book.3.5 stars.

Thus begins the adventure and we are taken into a world full of hilarious quips, super cool tech and of course, aliens.I loved the story line and can&#8217;t wait for to read the next book in this series.

The relationships in this book #2 are a continuation of book #1 by Ian Dalton.  The affection and respect which is shown by the couples and their friends for each other is something everyone should aspire to. There are a couple of new twists and turns introduced in this book about some of the characters which I cannot wait to read in the next book.  Again, this is such an exquisite book which keeps your attention and makes you want more and more.

$REVIEW.: David Platt-- The Radical Question, A Radical IdeaDavid Platt, senior pastor of The Church at Brook Hills (New Orleans, LA) and author of New York Times Bestselling books, Radical and Radical Together, has combined the concepts from several of his books and created a short and easy-to-read edition: The Radical Question, A Radical Idea

In this version of Platt's 'radical' message, he calls the people of the Church of Jesus Christ to live a radical life of loving service and get-your-hands-dirty discipleship

If you've read either of Platt's best selling book, there is not much new in this edition


However, if you haven't read Platt before, this is an excellent introduction to his major thesis and hopes of implementation.In The Radical Question, A Radical Idea, Platt proposes that the American church reconsider its priorities and place people above programs and buildings

He does not profess to have all the answers to problems in the American church, but Platt encourages leaders and lay people everywhere to ask the hard questions
For Platt, there is no virtue is doing something or pursuing a project just because it's the way things have always been done or are typically done today
Platt does not condemn the American church, but instead offers the challenge of rethinking 'normative' Christian faith in a manner that may seem 'radical' but can really make a cultural impact.This book is well written and quite simply very easy to read


It's a great introduction to Platt's other works, but it is written in such a way to really make you think about the importance of living a radical Christian faith

So check out  The Radical Question, A Radical Idea today!I received this book at no cost from Multnomah Publishing

$review_text.: Peter Lalor's BLOOD STAIN details the murder of John Price by Katherine Knight. I read a lot of true crime, and true crime doesn't get more disturbing than this. Without going into detail, it is one of the most horrific murders I've ever read about to the point where it was difficult to continue at some points. Suffice it to say that what Lalor refers to as a blood stain is something like referring to the Gulf of Mexico as a pond.BLOOD STAIN takes place and was written in Australia and author Lalor provides a real feel for the small town life of Aberdeen, New South Wales, the focal point of the action, and he is aided by some very nice color pictures, a true crime first for me. Lalor describes and quotes the residents, who I can best describe as white trash, extensively, and his work in researching the life - from childhood through conviction - of Katherine Knight is masterful. At times, though, it becomes repetitive since Knight, an unintelligent, insecure, violent, cruelly manipulative, and thoroughly unpleasant woman, is pretty much a one trick pony, a discussion of whose lunacy no matter how well done - and Lalor does well -could be sufficiently covered in a long magazine article. As such I found the book starting briefly to drag a little about 2/3 of the way through. But Lalor picks it back up with his presentation of the psychiatric evaluations undergone by Knight.BLOOD STAIN is really a dynamite book, the occasional repetition notwithstanding. Lalor writes with enthusiasm and has produced a book that is a fast paced and interesting read. I highly recommend this book to fans of the genre, and I thank my friend in Lubbock for recommending and lending me this book.

$REVIEW.: We start off with a young women named Leticia. Leticia is a werewolf and the only person she told just left her, thinking she was a freak. One day She wakes up beaten and confused as to what's going on. Unsure what happened, she packs up and moves away as fast as she can.9 years later she finds she is still being hunted, by the only person she every told who she really is. Unlike last time Leticia is not alone, she has landed in the hands of 3 more supernaturals that want to help her and be her friend. Nancy and Jackson are siblings and both are shape shifters and then there is Tristan, he is a vampire. Jackson has his sights set on Leticia, but can he over come his cold heart and bumpy past to let Leticia in or will he keep pushing her away? And can they find who is trying to kill Leticia in time before all is lost?I would rate this book 4So I'm going to tell you that this is a cliffhanger book. I enjoyed reading about Leticia and her past and working on her future with Jackson and being friends with Tristan and Nancy. Lots of twists and turns so many ideas of who it could be that's trying to kill Leticia and her friends. I'm not a fan of cliffhangers, but on the plus side I found a new author and I can't wait to see who is really behind all of this chaos.*Reviewer for Paranormal Romance and Authors that Rock*

It was recommended heartily by my professor (when in fact he has never used it in the course), but I chose not to buy it. And was glad about it aftewards since after reading half of it in the library I found it1) Boring2) Exceedingly and unnecessarily detailed3) Poorly organizedFor those of you who don't fall asleep while reading the first 200 pages, this might prove to be a good investment. Otherwise, I'd suggest taking good notes during classes and consulting online references, because this book is just not worth the price (in my opinion, of course).

$REVIEW.: My thoughts&#8230;Wow! Being totally honest here my first impression was that this was going to be a serial that didn&#8217;t stand out. I can&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t like the hero, but I didn&#8217;t love him either. He was pretty bossy which is to be expected, but I think his actions were a little out there. Maybe a little unrealistic in the fact that he kept showing up conveniently. Especially for someone that was a complete stranger. After a while though I warmed up to him.Anyway, I&#8217;d say about 30% in things started changing. The story started enchanting me. The more I read the more drawn in I became. There was no way I was going to put this baby down without seeing what would happen next and what the cliffhanger was going to be. And the cliffhanger&#8230; What a doozy. Although I sort of had some of it figured out. Sort of.Overall though, I think this serial is going to be extremely good. I&#8217;m already excited to read part two. I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s going to happen next. Oh and before I forget. The sex in this book is oh so scorching.

$REVIEW.: Gaia's GiftAuthor: Fran OrensteinIsolation and a life all alone without the frills or any type of human communications was the solution Rachel Wells decided for herself as life or fate took away all that mattered to her. When her entire universe sank within the depths of a roaring sea and a storm raged so fiercely that only she survived  as Rachel Wells died a slow death in her heart and mind. A storm so fierce she could not control its wrath as her young daughter Emma and her husband Jack vanished into the blackness of the deep sea. Reality set in but only in spurts as Rachel Wells withdrew from life, her friends and herself into a tragic pale specter and shell of a woman so deeply haunted by her own fears, angered at her own survival and consumed with hate for those who had not lost what she had.Spring is a special season. The world is reborn with greenery, flowers bloom, the air is fresh and rude awakenings can change the deflated, the destroyed and unhappy. Reflections in mirrors do not lie unless you choose to not see what is really within the panes of glass and the images reflected within it. Rachel Wells awakens one morning, faces herself and her image in her mirror and does not recognize the person staring back at her. Realizing the gravity of what she saw facing her she sent out a phone call for help to a dear friend. But Rachel had not come full circle with her anger, fears and her inner self instead she decided to succumb to the cruelty of her neighbors banter about her, the branding her as a witch and the coldness of the warm sum that chilled her instead of giving her warmth. Rachel decided to leave civilization, leave the world she knew and create a safe haven for herself that would provide the shelter and seclusion she wanted, devoid of memories that hurt too much to remember. People hurt and sometimes the pain is too great. Rachel along with the help of her attorney dealt with Jack's estate and left the world as she knew it to live her life out on an isolated and deserted island with only her cat as her constant companion and limited access to the real world.Could the same raging storm repeat history five years later? One young child is torn from her mother's arms while her parents are killed and washed up on the sand. Abigail Stern is now alone in the world and has to fend for herself at the age of three. Awakening she finds herself on this island with a dog. Meeting Rachel would change both of their worlds and the inner rage that flared within Rachel's heart. From the wreckage of a storm Gaia the goddess of the earth presents Rachel with a special gift of one little precious girl. Angered because she took her family away will her heart soften and the hate melts away by taking care of Abigail?Flashbacks, feelings, fear and one little girl who came into her life and who thought Rachel to be her mother was more than just a gift to Rachel. More images flash, visions of a life jacket and shed relives the event that took away her family. Why did Abigail think Rachel was her mother? Why didn't she correct her? Can each one replace the person they lost with another? Why would Gaia present Rachel with this special gift? Two separate worlds blended into one reality or was it? As Rachel and Abigail bonded so tightly and each one learned more about the other the closeness they developed was remarkable and the ties even tighter.Then a trip to the mainland would enlighten Abby about the real world and her questions about life, television and wanting the net like other kids do disturbs Rachel. Added in is the ever-present scent of lavender that reminds her of Emma and Abby's feeling or visions of her Emma become more prominent in her mind too. Just how they intertwine and why she sees Emma you have to learn for yourself. Just what happens when Abby meets a group of kids causes Rachel to become fearful yet feeling some guilt. How will this all play out and just why does she feel she can never tell anyone about her?Gaia's Gift presents some important issues to the reader. Lies, deceits are told by Rachel to protect the little that she has and the one precious child she loves more than life itself. Is she right? What moral obligation does she have to Abby to find her real family? Is what she's doing right? The ties that bind them are so fragile yet so tight.Everything cannot stay the same and Rachel begins to hear two distinct voices in her head trying to help her reason out her situation. Abigail's visions and feelings about her past become clearer and she shares her thoughts with her new friend Danny before having a severe meltdown. Still fearful of storms and the sea although much older Abby cannot handle the thought of an impending raging storm, Rachel flares up while on a boat with a new friend named Ben and things change as a friendship that could have been wonderful and a life that would be more positive comes to an abrupt halt. Rachel and Abby disappear and no one can find them. Will Danny be able to track them down on his short wave radio? What is next for them both and what does Gaia have in store for Rachel as she prays each morning for one more day?When Ben learns the truth about Abigail and Rachel will he use it against her? When Abigail learns the startling truth about her parents and the life that flashes back in front of her she does something that frightens not only her but Rachel too. Lies, deceits, betrayals and hidden truths come out and two people's lives hang in the balance, as Gaia has to decide what is next for Rachel and her special gift.Author Fran Orenstein leaves the reader with many interesting questions that most would have difficulty coming to terms. What does happen to Rachel and Abigail? Where will they go from here? What unanswered questions are still traveling many routes in both of their minds and what if anything will unite them as a family? From the author of Calling of the Flute comes another Five Star novel that far surpasses so many others.This book gets Five More Gifts From Gaia

$REVIEW.: I have this book 4 stars because it was entertaining if you don't mind a dark romance novel. There were a few parts in the book that just didn't make any sense, for example the Rwanda thing. Lance said he supplied the guns for the Rwanda genocide in 1994, but walker in the book he said he was 26 years old...that would have made him an arms dealer at the age of 6. That wasn't enough to ruin the story for me, but a detail she should have left out. Overall good read though!!!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed reading &#34;Bishop Street&#34; by Rene Schultz. The book was amazing. The author really put her heart and soul into writing this book. The emotional roller coaster between the 4 main characters was very inspiring and well written. The book focused on Margaret (Maggie), Elizabeth, Lucy, and Randolph who met her roommates at Bishop Street Orphanage. 20 years later Maggie sets out on a journey to help locate her friends with the help of Damon, a private investigator. Will she find her friends? Will they want her back in their lives? Read this book to find out.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review

$REVIEW.: I was lucky enough to meet the author at the Lori Foster Reader/Author Get Together in June (I swear I will get my recap post up soon!) and have been twitter friends with her for a long time. I  have to say I was really excited to read this book because vampires just never get old!There are three things that  I've come to expect from a 1Night Stand novella: a compelling storyline, hot sex and super likable characters that make me wish the novella was just a chapter or two longer. This Time Next Year didn't disappoint me.I think what I liked most about this story was that it wasn't your traditional vampire story. Kiernan was vulnerable, and really felt bad for what happened to Moira's family all those years ago and wanted to make up to her. Madam Eve works her magic and brings Moira into his life again..but while Moira is vulnerable, I loved that she was also independent and made decisions on her own terms. This was just a sweet romance with a lot of passion! I want to say more, but it was just 38 pages and I don't want to spoil anything. This was one of the best debut books I've read in a long time--This was an arc copy from the publisher to write a fair & honest review.

$REVIEW.: This book is all about a mysterious enemy who managed to conquer a dozen major cities of the US, plunging the country into war and turmoil

What made the enemy really evil and scary was the fact that no one really knew what was going on as anyone who approached the cities was immediately taken over by the enemy.Then, four special operations soldiers are sent into enemy occupied new york to try to find and eliminate the enemy, embedded into super cool giant robots immune to the mind control effect


Filled with battles, tension and mystery, this is one interesting book.

$review_text.: With this detective story I enjoyed a woman in the role of leading officer solving the crime. She doesn't hide the discrimination she faces at the police station. She also can identify truly helpful coworkers.Too bad she had to identify a potential new friend as someone involved in crime.I'm comparing Scandinavian female heroes and the two I have read are both good. I'm looking for Swedish and Finnish titles to get to know the countries. I will be in Sweden and Finland soon and I am enjoying becoming familiar with place name and  descriptions.I have just finished the title and also Murder in Malmo. I liked both but, the Swedish heroine was a more serious police officer and more believable. She faced more discrimination in the police office.

I'm abig fan of series romance because I get to find out from one story tothe next about what happened to the characters in the previous book.It's like being part of one big happy family.I had lots of laugh-out-loud moments throughout the book, especiallyover Bailey's funny moments. Those scenes were so reminiscent of my ownchildren's growing years. Although tense at times, I liked thecontinuing development of Chase and Jamie's relationship and the way hemanaged to hook her. I liked that Jamie stood her ground, and thenultimately realized she could no longer fight it, and it melted myheart.The scenes in Carlucci's Bistro with the Italian mama were hilarious.Finally, I'm no cook by any stretch of the imagination, but theserecipes were easy to follow.

$review_text.: ...Dr. Brian Weiss.I don't see how any book on life between lives (or life after death of course) could be written, even as a primer to introduce readers to important workers in the field, without giving prominence to Dr. Michael Newton, PhD. and Dr. Brian Weiss, M.D. Both of these men are hypnotherapists who use the past-life regression technique, but then go far beyond that to describe the "geography" of the life that exists between corporeal lives.N.B. The author does give links to Weiss' and Newton's books but no discussion of them.Also this book, as sent to me by the author for this review, is liberally sprinkled with typos. The author, or an editor, should have found these before publication. Has the author re-read his book recently?This said, I did not know of Bruce Moen, or really the story of Dannion Brinkley so these were interesting cases for me.The book has its heart in the right places, if a bit on the scant side.

$review_text.: If you've read any of Ted Dekker's books, you'll know that you're in for an interesting twist in the story. Here the twist is too weird and seems impossible. Shauna McAllister has been in an accident and wakes up from a coma, not knowing what happened. She is forced to trust individuals that she doesn't remember. She doesn't know if she should be trusting them... The mystery part is interesting. You feel like your working with Shauna to piece back together her memory. Nothing is given away too quickly, so you don't really know anything more than Shauna does.As the pieces start to come together, we find out that Shauna has a very odd side-effect from the "treatment" she received while she was in a coma. (I'm trying to remain vague...) It's this side-effect that's too weird- it all seems implausible.Overall, an interesting storyline that's fast-paced enough to keep you reading. But after finishing it, I wasn't left with any strong lasting impression other than that it was odd. Not a horrible read but definitely not a winner, either. If you're okay with the sci-fi-ish weirdness, then you'd like it better.

$REVIEW.: I downloaded this book straight after finishing The Ultimate Choice
 In my opinion Plague isn't as good as Choice , but is still a good read

 Almost the entire story is set inside one house, but enough happens there that I certainly didn't get bored by the story line

 The book is certainly worth 3 stars, and had it gone on to describe a bit more about the obvious next stage in the story - then I think it would have been a terrific read
 In fact the contrast  between the life inside and the life outside the house would have been intriguing and refreshing
 So I guess I have marked the book down - not because of what it had (which was fine) but what it lacked ( the next stage in the story).I enjoy the author's writing style and will seek out more of her work


 A sequel to this story would be warmly received.If you are trying to decide whether to buy the book or not, my suggestion is buy it - it has enough going in its favor that you are almost certain to be satisfied.

$REVIEW.: In "The Converging", George Straatman demonstrates a command of story, plot, characterization, and description that is rare. From the onset, Mr. Straatman carefully spins a tale, one strand at a time, until his web is complete and the reader is fully ensnared. Once entrapped, he leads us into our greatest fears. These run the gambit from lost children to unseen things that stalk us in the night and from confrontation with our own deepest selves to an invulnerable evil that relishes pain and knows no pity. This is a novel that can stand toe to toe with the masters of horror. It is a must read for all dark horror fans.

$REVIEW.: Kate Winter has her heart set on graduating from Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio. The problem - she is terrified of speaking in front of others. She knows she can be free of her family and her mother's determination to marry her off to a wealthy man. Despite her fear, she agrees to sing in the musicale production that fellow student Ben Hanby, a musical genius, is directing. Ben's also got a secret - he works for the Underground Railroad. When an accident force Ben and Kate to work together, both of their secrets are threatened. Somehow, Kate must find the courage to sing a song of freedom.This is the second book in the Saddler's Legacy Series by Rosslyn Elliot. Set in the years prior to the Civil War, I was drawn into the story and the historic Underground Railroad. Freedom is a theme I found in the book. What is the price of freedom? For the slaves, it's quite possibly their own lives? For Kate and Ben, it's the willingness to go and do whatever it is that God calls them to do. Being based upon a real life family, the Hanbys, I enjoyed being able to get into their world and to read some about them. I love the time period of the Civil War. The drama of the Underground Railroad and feeling the emotions that the slaves, Ben, Kate, his mother, and others had while attempting to shelter the passengers gave me a new impression of the time period. I've never had to live in fear like the slaves. This is an excellent book, and I'm delighted to have read it.Rating - 5 starsI received this book for free from Thomas Nelson's booksneeze program for the purpose of reviewing. I was not required to like the book. My thoughts and opinions are my own.

$review_text.: On January 26, 2014, I received a random e-mail from Phenice Arielle at Goodreads... I did not know who she was nor have I heard of her previously. She asked me to read her book, The Phoenix Rising, Destiny Calls for a fair review. I have read several books from new authors and I did not have super high expectations. My general assumption was that the story would probably be okay and that I would have to deal with a lot of grammatical and spelling errors. I read some other reviews from Amazon to see what other reads had to say, and, seeing generally positive reviews decided to agree and read the book having no major expectations.....Today is February 5, 2014 - just 10 days after I began to read this book. I finished the book last night. I decided that sleep would not come to me until I finished every last word in that book. For someone like me, reading is a luxury that I have a hard time finding. I run 3 companies, I'm a parent of 2 kids, I'm the PTA President at our local elementary school, I sit on the Governance Council at our local Middle School, and my kids has activities 7 days a week (violin, piano, art class, etc)... Thus, reading an entire book in 10 days is a difficult feat for me....The bottom line is this..... THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ IN A VERY LONG TIME.First, the grammatical and spelling errors that I expected to find were not present. The book was very well edited so I did not have to deal with those distractions - HUGE Bonus.Second, Phenice's writing style is superb. I loved the flash backs - they kept me on my toes. I loved the description and the details. I loved the fast pace of the book - there was not time to get tired of read about a scene because the book moved so fast. Something new was happening on each page - in each paragraph. I loved the fact that the book contained some BIG ideas - peace, love, respect, caring for others, responsibility - to mention a few. I have found that many of today's authors simply write a &#34;cute&#34; story, but do not handle the BIG ideas and I was pleasantly surprised and super pleased that this book had them in it. I'm in my 40s and love Young Adult literature, but I don't often tell my 13 year old that she must read a specific book unless I felt it was worth her time and that she would get something more than a &#34;cute&#34; read out of it... This book is on the MUST READ list for her, and eventually, my 9 year old as well.Third, I was pleasantly surprised when I quickly figured out that this book is about Africa and the African people (mostly).... Most of the books that I pick up do not cover this part of the world. For me, it was super refreshing to read about a new land and a people that have such an amazing and rich culture and history.I loved every letter on every page. THANK YOU, Phenice Arielle, for picking me out randomly and asking me to read your book. I feel like you gave me a rare gift that I will treasure and pass along to my kids as well. Please keep writing as I am waiting for Book 2 with bated breath. You truly have a gift and readers all over the world will soon realize what a treasure your story is.My only regret is that the book wasn't longer and the characters within its pages did not have longer interactions and relationships so that I, too, could have continued to experience their lives.An amazing book that no one should miss reading.

$REVIEW.: This is a big book!  It's really a complete series of three novels published together in one book.  In the first novel, Waiting for Morning,  you will meet Matt and Hannah after Hannah suffers a devastating loss at the hands of a drunk driver.  She walks away from her faith in the aftermath.  It is a very sad story of faith, loss and healing.The second story, titled A Moment of Weakness, is the story of Jade and Tanner and the mistake they make as young people.  You will see how the decisions they make after that first moment change their lives but how God gives them hope for the future.And the last book is, Halfway to Forever, where Jade, Tanner, Hannah and Matt live out the tragedy that hits them.  Some of the themes explored in this book are adoption, illness, and faith.  As always you will watch as the characters draw on God for their strength.The first story was difficult for me to read.  It was very sad to watch Hannah deal with the loss of her family members and then her faith.  There was hope at the end of the story and it made me think a lot about forgiveness and how I respond to those who hurt me.I enjoyed the beginning of the second story but was upset with some of the decisions the characters made after they faced failure.  The faith portrayed in the story was strong but impatient.  It reminded me that no matter how hard it is to wait on God it is still the best way to handle a problem and live our lives.In the last story I was reminded of how differently people approach a problem they are faced with and how different circumstances will test their faith more than others.  Life is fragile and that is something I need to remember as I live my life.  I need to be thankful for those around me and do my best to live for Him in each moment.This huge book would be a good one to take on a vacation or a long road trip.  It will keep you busy reading for hours and hours.I received a free book from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in order to write this review and have shared my honest opinion.

$REVIEW.: This is a great short that provides unique insight into the main story line
The main story is written completely from Jeremah's viewpoint and Noemi's true abilities and strength are not revealed until the end

It left the reader wondering if she was always strong or if the strength developed as her journey progressed
This short answers that question and much much more

$REVIEW.: Other reviews have told the content of the book.  I want to say that it is a beautiful story that touches your heart and soul.  I read it several months ago and it still keeps coming into my mind and gives me pleasure.  Another book of Susan Wiggs that is memorable is The Horseman's Daughter.  Anyone who purchases either or these books will not be disappointed.  You will have fond memories and good feelings return evey time you think about these two stories.

$review_text.: I tend to read A LOT of zombie/post-apocalypse fiction, perhaps too much.  This book kept me reading, however, and I will be reading part two.  I wasn't prepared for the book to end when it did, but I enjoyed the new perspective this book gave on the infected.  Interesting twist, but I liked the varying viewpoints of two young people the best.  I got this book when it was free, but I will pay for book 2 to see if the mystery can be solved.

$REVIEW.: I jumped into this series at the third book and thought it was easy enough to get into, I didn't feel like I was missing anything important and I could understand the story well enough without reading the first two installments.In this book Stacy is trying to solve a mystery in her hometown and it seems that anyone that tries to help her has died, her family has magical abilities and just for this it is a fun story. I like that the author seems to have done her research about this sort of magic and made it a great addition to the story.I didn't however like some of the back and forth in the book, she sets out to solve so many things that it started to blend together when some of this wasn't related to the main plot. I am tempted to check into the other books, but it won't be at the top of my reading list anytime soon.

NOT THIS ONE
I was very surprised by the ending

The ugly duck turned into a beautiful swan

I loved that fact that the characters from April's past got a chance to see what Taj saw from the very beginning....someone beautiful on the inside.I would recommend this book and the author.

$REVIEW.: May contain spoilers.Ah...that was not what I was expecting. I love the whole standing up for yourself and doing what YOU want to do and not what other people want you to do concept. I myself have suffered from always wanting to make other people happy and never doing what I think is best for me.Naomi is a far cry from a weak girl. In fact I think she is strong for all that she had to endure when she got kidnapped. I was a little more annoyed with her this book. She was whiny and indecisive. And I guess i can't completely blame her. Her mom is so overbearing and Jesse is controlling. I was glad when she finally left him! What a huge relief.I can't help but feel disappointed where the story ended and I wish I would have just stopped with the first book. I enjoyed where it ended there.I also didn't really care much for Finn. Why couldn't she leave more time to find herself? And why does she have to tie herself to somebody so soon? Give yourself time to truly heal without the hope of being with Jesse. Being alone is not bad at all.Jesse...someone I loved in the first book. I loathed him this time around. He was so selfish that I wanted to slap him. Everyone has a choice to do better...he gave up too quickly. Idiot! I pity him. To live a life like that must be lonely.I highly recommend The Breakaway but the second one not so much.

$review_text.: Most of the time, when I find out about a book and it&#8217;s a novella, I just say pass. To me they tend to be stories that just seem unfinished and lacking a lot of the substance that is required to be great. There are very few who can rock a novella and make it feel like a full length story, and C.C. Wood is one of them! C.C. Wood does novellas and she does them AMAZINGLY! You get a full awesome story all compacted into a nice tiny little package!In Love With Lucy is the first book in a new series, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the rest. As with the majority of C.C.&#8217;s series, this series will focus around a group of friends, with each novella focusing on someone different. And I promise, you will find yourself wanting to be a part of this group. They are fun, snarky, straight forward, take no s*** types of girls! I found myself laughing with tears in my eyes at some of their comments to each other!Our main character for the story is Lucy. She has been working for her boss for 3 years and is rejoicing over the fact that she is FINALLY able to quit and purse her dream of being a photographer. Her boss is a cold, hard, serious, no nonsense, kind of guy. He&#8217;s also REALLY REALLY HOT! He has been very difficult to work for the last 3 years, but Lucy has done so by giving as good as she got. She never put up with any of his crap and told him right from the start that she would not cower from him. When Lucy has her first showing for her photographs, Chris shows up and goes all alpha male marking his territory. This is the first time he&#8217;s ever acted this way towards Lucy, and the first time that she starts realizing there may be more to her boss that what there seems. I LOVED their interaction with each other. She fought the attraction to the bitter end, but once she gave in, boy did she give in. Talk about smokin&#8217; hot! The sexual tension in this book was to the extreme!I am absolutely in LOVE with Lucy and Chris and thoroughly enjoyed their story! I can&#8217;t wait for more from the Not Safe For Work Series!~Lauren~

$review_text.: Ah, Charlotte


Nobody is writing erotica like Charlotte does
I think sometimes that drives her bonkers -- she is a friend -- but I am so glad that she is doing it, I can only see it as a good thing.Deep Desires feels, thematically, like an extension of Sheltered

It's about the redemptive power of sex for psychically wounded people

And one of the things I really enjoyed about this novel -- and really appreciate about Charlotte's work -- is that she believes there *is* a redemptive role for sex in people's lives

And I mean this not in the sense of fantasy sex, though of course there is an element of fantasy here, but more in the sense that in order to have great sex, her characters are forced to reach for and accept and embrace different selves


They are forced to become the people they need to be in order to communicate with their bodies and their minds
They *want* to, because pleasure is their reward, but that doesn't mean it's easy or automatic.Nobody else is writing erotica like Charlotte does

Thank goodness for her.

And somehow, as gutter as American Demon can be, there's redemption in the end and you find yourself rooting for Grisham after all.  Fistfights in drag, benevolent grave robbing, running with the devil, huffing glue & shimmering Jesus in the sand -- it's all here in what I hope isn't Jack Grisham's last book. One of my favorite books of 2011.

$REVIEW.: Perhaps the best thing about this story is the portrayal of this precious girl named Kondi who struggles through the hardships in her life and learns to trust in Jesus for her care and protection. I know little of Africa, but the author painted such a vivid picture of it that I feel as if I know a bit more now. This, to me, is a perfect gift for both parent and child. As I read it, I could imagine reading it aloud to my own children when they were small. It is a wonderfully compelling story, beautifully written, and one that will pull at your heartstrings.

$REVIEW.: I finished my last ebook on Sunday and had downloaded a number of samples to check out - this one being one of them.  The sample had me rolling on the floor laughing my head off, and I thought "If the rest of the book is like this, I'm really going to enjoy it!" - so I bought it - and sadly, I didn't.I love dogs, and I love stories about them.  I just didn't enjoy Jack's independent narrations - and there are a lot of them.  I enjoyed the ones he did WITH Tall Guy, and I enjoyed the ones Tall Guy did on his own, but not the ones he did on his own.  I wish the sample had included a section or two written just by Jack so I would have known what to expect.  So sorry.  I hate to give negative reviews, but I just didn't enjoy this book as much as everyone else so far.

$review_text.: Jayne Pupek can write! Tomato Girl is a beautiful novel related by an eleven-year old narrator, Ellie, whom I loved from the moment she admitted "I can't tell them about Mama's moods, or how she keeps Baby Tom in a jar." I was captivated by her story, and so curious to learn it that I had trouble setting the novel down.Though young, Ellie is a perceptive narrator, and I enjoyed meeting the adults in the book through her eyes. I saw how and why she adored her father, though his actions were irresponsible, sometimes cruel, and sometimes criminal. Her mother suffers from madness, and as I watched her condition deteriorate through her daughter's eyes, I felt my concern intensify into something approaching terror. Ellie is a child forced to shoulder burdens that even an adult--and especially the adults in the story--have trouble carrying. I couldn't help but feel compassion for her. I wanted things to work out for her; I was completely sucked into her world.The story is very dark at times, but the book remains hopeful, often because Ellie brings a light to the events through her unwavering love for her family and her childish innocence. The characters are complex, the setting well described, the voice one you will not likely forget. Tomato Girl is a wonderful debut novel by a writer who knows her craft. I'm already looking forward to Pupek's next book.

Although I struggled to finish the book.The book itself was okay. I wouldn't get excited over it.

$review_text.: No Peace for the Damned is a gritty, dark, and different entry in the UF genre.  The characters are interesting, intense, and realistic.  No vamps, weres, fae, or any of the current sups dominating the genre, but it is a story with strong supernatural elements.  The fact that it is not a mushy tale of instant love just makes it that much better.  There's an attraction and a sense that a relationship is building, but no sex - at all.  This is a story about a young woman who has never experienced a kind word or love.  Her life revolves around unimaginable and unspeakable pain, torture, and cruelty - delivered by her father, uncles, and brothers - until the day she manages to escape.  Magnolia's freedom is tainted with danger and suspicions, and  is even more complicated because she lacks social skills due to being isolated from all but her sadistic family.  Watching her attempts to find acceptance and balance in her life is heartbreaking because she is very attuned to how others see her or what they think about her.  I love the story and impatiently await the sequel!

The alpha is fantastic, if somewhat scary in a good, want to climb you kinda way!  The story is quick, it doesn't drag out with needless drama.  The heroine does not feel sorry for herself, thank goodness because that is so depressing.  She is actually very strong and spunky.  She is sarcastic and very quick witted.  The guys tower over her and she just keeps letting the comments fly.  Even when she is kidnapped she uses her head and doesn't give in!  It is so refreshing to have a heroine with brains and attitude.  I love Demon, he is a scarred, tattooed hunk of yumminess and even after he falls for Clytie you don't make him a pansy.  I am getting the second book but I will be very irate if you don't make a nice long series on this!!  I want more of Mac and Ben.  Plus Eli and Lucas!

Things are explained about Sophia's past and how it will possibly affect her future.  We also get to see Sylvan's and Drake 's relationship settle and shift in a way.  Francesca is up to no good as usual, but doesn't realize she may have a problem in her own house.  It'll do her some good to learn how to truly value what she has.  We also get to see how Jody and Becca's relationship deals with Jody being a Risen Vamp.  There are a couple of new romances on the horizon that I hope Raand gets into in the next installment.  I tried not to read reviews this time, but I couldn't help it.  I think the story progresses and disagree with other readers.  These Weres and Vamps are going through a lot of relatable things like insecurities, finding self worth, opening up to love, and the fear of losing that love.  I understand that  the Weres are very sexual beings and don't mind the amount of sexual content.  There's still a story unfolding.  I believe it actually enhances the story rather than taking away from it as other readers feel.  It's who they are...just my opinion.

$REVIEW.: I don't usually read romances, but I've known Sally since high school and she made me read it.  Just kidding.  I really did enjoyed this one.  The characters are so likeable.  The book takes place in a small town in the summer, and I felt I was there, experience summer and life in a small town.The romance between Kate and Luke is a story of friendship lost and found with the grown-up element of love.  Alongside this romance is the love of her parents.  Her father is a Sheriff of this small town, and her mother is a ghost.  That said, I wouldn't classify this as a ghost story.  The author manages to present a character as a ghost but make her seem perfectly ordinary and kind of charming.Once I started reading this book, I didn't want to put it down until I found out what happened with Kate and Luke and Sheriff and Mama the ghost.  And if you know how slow I read I was holding the book a long time.  When I finished reading, I still didn't want to put it down.  I like those people.  I miss them.

$REVIEW.: I've read all the books in the series Slave Breakers. I think the author did not like slavery. She does not really believe that it may be good for anyone. One could describe Holden, the main character, as a master who has a velvet hand in a velvet glove.I understand that the author has created a situation where the retrainers are literally saving the lives of slaves cruelly mistreated by their former masters. We could not bring a broken slave to life by hitting him, even gently. So her context is well suited to the nature of the dominant -- not so dominant.As for her slaves, although they are 16 or 17 years-old, they behave like lost 11-12 years-old children, always snuggling against everyone and sit on every adult's lap. It is charming but unrealistic. My knowledge of adolescents aged 16-17 has a different story. And even in the context of slavery, since they are first sold at the age of 15 years, they should rebel against the cruelty of their masters. But no, they crash, let themselves be destroyed. The only ex-slave who is said having been resisting is Holden himself, but the author does not describe (or very little) that part of his life.As I was about to read this first book of the series, I imagined a couple receiving of other discouraged masters their rebellious slaves, and the couple finding a way to break theses slaves into the perfect ones that any master would dream. But no,these are the story of loving dominants with broken slaves.

$REVIEW.: It was a dark book

So much hatred and shame

There was lots of fighting
Lot of cussing


Lot of freaked up stuff in general; you will find no comedic relief either
The best part of the book was finding that I loved and hated characters and that is what truly makes a good book


I went tense at so many scenes; I'm happy to read a book that had me so enthralled


There were points that I didn't care for: there is a lot of hostility floating around and her self loathing almost got to be too much at times
Also, it was hard trying to keep up with the different crews etc
But I enjoyed it! Hopefully there is actually sex scenes in the next book.Rated R for graphic violence and bad language.

$review_text.: This is the best self-help book I have EVER read on dealing with abusive behavior. Not only does it give a detailed account of the ways in which abusers operate, but also why hoping they will improve is normally futile. The book then goes on to give detailed responses to use when confronted with various abusive comments and behaviors. I bought the audio version and I highly recommend it because hearing the responses is so empowering.The only downside to the book is that it is heavily slanted toward heterosexual relationships in which the man is the abuser and in which patriarchy plays a strong part. She completely ignore gay men and especially women for whom this is not an issue. While you can skip though these parts in the book, it is harder to do so on the audio version without missing important information that is embedded in this section.

The laws of physics don't even get a wink and a nod.Where to start?First, the ship is &#34;hurled&#34; like a spear with &#34;six engines forming a circular, dark blue flaming flower at their rear&#34;. When a course change is required the captain shouts &#34;Helm up forty-five degrees! All astern full!&#34;. The &#34;helm officer&#34; first pulls back on the &#34;engine order telegraph&#34; and &#34;then pulled back on the yoke in front of his chair&#34;. This causes the ship to perform &#34;a corkscrew pattern&#34;.Engine telegraph! Really? Is this 1920?Full astern? (OH, by the way, isn't that is where the &#34;flaming flower&#34; is located?  How exactly does that work to change delta v?Helm up 45 degrees does what? Adjust the rocket nozzles? Perhaps it is the ailerons I expected to hear &#34;full flaps&#34; next.A few pages later the fire their &#34;rail guns&#34; which &#34;accelerate a 4000 kilogram slug of depleted uranium&#34; to &#34;several thousand kilometers a second&#34; and do it in &#34;their 180 meter length&#34;Somebody else can do the math and figure out the energy required to accelerate 4000 kg to several thousand km/sec in 180 meters. (It's not worth the effort to me.)Then there is the equal and opposite part of it and what would that do to the ship? Talk about a rifle with a kick!When I'm this far in and disgusted, it makes me wish I wish I had never hit that BUY button.

$REVIEW.: I don't know how many of you would go looking at the a person ad online or newspaper and actually respond. However, in The Story Guy by Mary Ann Rivers, Carrie West actually responds to an add to a guy who is just looking for an hour of kissing. Yeah, I know. Seriously, he could be a lot of things when you sit to think about it. Anyways, when she meets Brian Newburgh for their set appointed time there is this undeniable chemistry between them. Carrie is looking for a little more time with Brian.First off, this novella is absolutely amazing. I'm so glad Sara from Harlequin Junkie suggest I read this story. Seriously it's so good for being a debut from Mary Ann Rivers. For one thing, she has written a compelling story about this guy who wants to keep things simple between him and Carrie. Yet, for some reason he wants to break all his parameters for her. Not only that, he has so many hidden layers, which makes The Story Guy a perfect title for the story. You really don't learn anything about Brian from him, but through Carrie trying to understand him.So, here is the bottom line: If you are looking for a quick emotional read, you will find it in The Story Guy. Plus, you are watching the story unfold through Carries eyes. Which at times is a bit heartbreaking, but worth the read.Copy provide by Random House via NetGalley

$review_text.: Family members from a few families...tightly wound like vines on a tree - Past & Present meet - Growing Suspense - are only a pinch of descriptive words to describe Carmen DeSousa's latest novel
DeSousa's characters are always strong and play their roles to a 'T'
The dialogue is always realistic
Descriptions are on the money


And the build-up to the neatly-tied ending is perfect.This story grabs you from the beginning, even if you've not read 'Pit Stop' or 'The Depot' (which I highly recommend)

DeSousa lays out just enough info to keep you turning the pages...and wondering 'how?' 'who?' and 'why?'


This reader missed the culprit


Oh well, that's because DeSousa is a talented author who knows how to slowly unwind the vines from the tree


I highly recommend this novel for those who love a suspense-filled, whodunit story with two very good main characters, Mark and Ashlyn

$REVIEW.: Are you looking for an encouraging 40 day devotional for Lent? The 40 Day Devotional Challenge would be a great choice. Each one contains a Scripture and a short devotional. They are aimed at deepening your faith while encouraging your heart. They are quick to the point and can be read in only a few minutes.I really enjoyed reading these devotions. Kathi tells personal stories that are very interesting and help illustrate the point of the devotion. Many of the Scriptures are from the Old Testament, a welcome change from the popular New Testament passages.There is quite a bit of space after each devotion for your own personal response. Writing a response in my first generation Kindle is difficult. A newer digital reader may work better for adding your personal notes. I suggest you have a notebook handy as each devotional will encourage you to respond.I received a digital copy of this book through the Book Group Network for the purpose of this review.

$review_text.: Veronik Avery is an extremely talented designer of handknitted garments who has had her designs published by the elite of the handknitting world:  Interweave Knits, Vogue Knitting, and in books published by Stewart Tabori & Chang.  She finally has published her own book full of  beautiful designs and it's a must have for the handknitter.The majority of the garments are for women, with a handful for men and girls; most are sweaters, with a few accessory items (such as lace socks and a mohair scarf).  Avery draws inspiration from fashion history and sources as diverse as a Japanese sash, traditional Scandinavian sweaters and a Victorian corset cover.  The styles are updated to reflect more contemporary silhouettes (i.e., set-in sleeves).  Techniques such as stranded knitting, lace and cabling are used to beautiful effect, so if you're sick of making boxy drop-shoulder garments out of stockinette stitch, you'll want to check these out.  Avery's eye for color is also apparent in the designs using multiple colors of yarn (particularly a gorgeous set of Latvian-inspired gloves).  Avery uses a variety of fibers and gauges throughout.  There are at least 5 designs that I'm eager to cast on, and several more after that calling to me.The production values of the book are also high. Gorgeous color photography, schematics and color charts, multiple pictures of the same garment, nice sturdy paper and clear typefaces.  Throughout the book, shots of Montreal -- Avery's hometown -- provide a lovely backdrop for the models (incidentally, the models are not the typical blonde waifs, but reflect a more urban, cosmopolitan look).I have long loved Avery's design sensibility and already count this book among the favorites in my (extensive) knitting library.

$review_text.: Not what I was expecting. It is still told as a story of a world within a game. Similar to the first book, life is not easy for the gamer. In this book, we focus on Xavier. In the game, he is a knight with a very good heart, in love with someone he can never have. In the real world, he is someone who wants to be loved for who he is and not what he looks like. He uses Marithe as an escape from his demons.This book actual goes back in time to before book 1 and tells the story of Kareth and Kardif, back to before Magic's, Vinnia's and Scheen's birth, back to their parents' time. It is a convoluted book with some of the characters from the first book, but with twists that if you're not paying attention can be confusing up until the end. I didn't have any particular favorite, but did find that I liked both Xavier and Lase best. Mirandra and Magdella drove me crazy. I don't know what it is about the women in this book.Like the first book, I did wish for a slightly different outcome for Talander and Xavier, but that would not be in keeping with book 1. Still a magical read. You get a lot more history on what happened to the crimson dragons, and how the curse came about. Definitely still a very interesting series.

$review_text.: I know that the book sings the praises of Amazon anbd maybe working at corporate headquarters is great but there is an underbelly to Amazon that is anything but great: low pay, horrendous working conditions, etc. in their warehouses. Wegmans is another compnay heralded in the book, yet when they moved into my geographic area several years ago a checker told a friend of mine that they don't like to make employees full-time thus they don't receieve benefits (maybe that has changed as that was almost ten years ago). Anyway, life for those at a companies corporate headquarters may be different than that for those working in the trenches for the compnay.I quit about half way through the book, as there were just too many instances of &#34;her and&#34; instead of &#34;she and&#34; for me to give credence to the author.

$review_text.: Josh and Reese meet by accident and kick off their volatile relationship with a fiery debate in the gym. When their paths cross again at the hospital, the fire between the two of them becomes more intense. It's one of those relationships that needs the animosity and debate to keep on going in order to sustain their passion. That intensity is what has drawn them to each other. Unfortunately, that intensity doesn't last, making this kind of passionate relationship difficult to maintain. Reese and Josh definitely have their ups and downs and it is hard to tell if they will be able to make it.Both of them have their issues from their past, that have caused them so much pent up anger. The focus of the book is on Reese's past, losing her baby sister. That's what drives her in life. Until she can finally come to terms with that, she will not be able to find happiness at work, nor in love. Josh had a failed relationship that was glossed over. I would have liked to have had a bit more background on that, and more explanation of his feelings, I think. It didn't receive as much attention as Reese's sister, though Livvy is more of an impediment to their relationship.Reese is supported by her two closest friends. Nikki has been a part of her life since they were kids. Julia is a new addition to the friendship ring, as she works with Reese at the hospital. Both woman are devoted to their friend and want nothing more than to see her finally be happy. Like the good girlfriends they are, they meddle and manipulate as much as they can to facilitate the process.Reese and Nikki both have brothers, with whom they were close when growing up. Both of these brothers live and work abroad, and randomly show up. You know that they both have more to their stories yet to come, though not in this book. Each of them do play a significant role in the development of Josh and Reese's relationship. I did feel like their appearance was a bit more abrupt than what felt realistic.Most of the characters in this book have a lot of mood swings that show multiple sides of their personalities. It can be hard to pinpoint consistency in their personalities. Nevertheless, they are an interesting group of people who kept me entertained throughout the book.I did enjoy this book, and again could see that there is more to come in their stories. There is one incident with Julia toward the end of the book, though, that feels completely out of sync with the rest of the book. It is thrown in there to foreshadow the next book. For me, it bothered me because there was no more allusion to it, nor any further incidents. My only consolation was that there was an excerpt from the second book, at the end of this one, that helped to tie it back together. Without that excerpt, though, I was left trying to figure out why on earth it happened. I may have to check out the second book to find out what happens to Julia!I received a complimentary ecopy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: Oh how I love the Lux Series!!!  Is this her best book in the series, probably not because I thought the beginning was a bit slow but I still loved the story!  What&#8217;s not to love about Daemon and Katy??  What&#8217;s not to love about an alien romance??? I think I hear the song by Katy Perry, E.T
in the background&#8230;Whenever I read this series I forget that they&#8217;re in high school because it&#8217;s definitely on the alien sexy side!!!  Their relationship is going strong and they finally understand each other or at least, they&#8217;ve made progress in that area

 I mean, it only took three books to get there and I&#8217;m not complaining


I think I love Daemon more in this book because he shows his softer side and he listens more without being a total brute


 Of course he&#8217;s still Daemon and he teases Katy non-stop.&#8220;I have the feeling we just made a deal with the devil, and he&#8217;s going to come back and want our first-born child or something.&#8221;Daemon waggled his brows
&#8220;You want kids? Because you know, practice makes&#8211;&#8221;&#8220;Shut up.&#8221; I shook my head and started walking.&#8221;There is so much alien drama and with Dawson re-emerging it made things all sorts of interesting
 Dawson is so damn loveable but Jennifer L
Armentrout keeps you guessing and you wonder&#8230;will he go postal after the ordeal he just went through?  Also, Katy is much more conflicted in this book and it made her seem very real because of some of the questionable things she has to do.Between the DOD and the alien intrigue, I didn&#8217;t know if I was coming or going

 And the cliff-hanger left me so angry and worked-up but left me totally looking forward to the next book in the series, Origin


 I can&#8217;t wait!!&#8220;A slow, wry smile teased Daemon&#8217;s lips


&#8220;Simmer down, Kitten, before I have to get you a ball of yarn to play with.&#8221; Annoyance flared deep inside me


&#8220;Don&#8217;t start with me, jerk-face.&#8221;My final two cents:  I totally loved it even if it has the mother of all cliff-hangers!

 It's a good source of information about Kate's family and upbringing, her many eccentricities, her career and her relationships; though there is not much that would fall into the category of information not available elsewhere
 The only problem I have with the Kindle version of this book is the typesetting; there are many typos throughout the book that are distracting

 The writing is good though and it is an interesting biography

$REVIEW.: It ended too soon...Nick Nolan does a great job on making us familiar with the main characters (Sebastian and Kitty) along with the rest of the crew!  You really feel like you know these characters.  Maybe, you even FEEL like these characters in this novel.  Although (it seems) that Nick Nolan is identified by his association with the LGBT crowd, I didn't consider it a LGBT story, just a story where some of the characters happened to be LGBT.  In a way, it was a love story where:1. Someone was afraid to love (Reed)2. Someone wanted to know what love really was about (Sebastian)3. Someone hoped to find love (Mateo)4. Someone had found love (Libby and Tess)5. Someone had lost love (Ramon's losing his son Mateo and Tess losing Libby)The message in this novel seemed to be (and pardon the simplistic view): Grief is the price that we sometimes pay for love.  Aptly put.One con:  The novel was too short (in my humble opinion)!!  I would have loved to have seen where everyone would've ended up (including Kitty...Grrr!!) given a expanded time-line.I recommend this book!I give Black as Snow...4 stars!!

I was looking for a book that would have instructions for lots of techniques, not just a bunch of pretty pictures.  Well, this book has lots of instructions AND lots of pretty pictures!  I have tried a couple of the techniques, and I can't wait to try more.  I'm also glad that quite a few of the techniques don't use specific brands of products; that can be a hassle if you can't find exactly what you're looking for.  Some of these ATCs use simple materials like tissue paper, paper towels, and acrylic paint.  How easy is that?I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with this book.

$review_text.: Every once in a while I read a book that makes me imagine it as a movie. I don't mean just visualizing it as I read it.  I am talking about being able to picture this story on the big screen with bigger than life characters.  This book is that good.  Once Gil was on the island, this book took off. There was never (not even once!) a dull moment in this fast-paced story of a man, his best friend, and 5 women on an island.  Many characters were facing their demons in this suspenseful mystery.  Who knows something but isn't letting on?  Who will survive and who will be killed?  Just as I thought I had it figured out, there was a twist and turn that surprised me, excited me, and kept me intrigued. At one point while reading this, I considered calling in sick to work because I just had to keep reading!Then the ending leaves you anxiously awaiting the next book in this series from Darcy Scott.  If you haven't yet read Matinicus, the first in this series, start there to get some background. It isn't necessary to start there, but it will have you hooked and wanting to follow this story of Gil and what haunts him.I seriously would love to see this as a movie!!

$review_text.: In this unusual, charming, novel Muriel Barbery pulls off a kind of literary high-wire act, with surprising success. The alternating narrators - Renee the dumpy concierge and Paloma the precocious 12-year old - are completely charming and Barbery steers the story to an unexpected, but emotionally satisfying, conclusion.I was swept up enough to read the book in one sitting - a major point in its favor. A few weaknesses become evident upon reflection, though. The fairly hefty dollop of implausibility attached to the two main protagonists didn't bother me particularly - the author is constructing a kind of fable, after all. But the way Barbery plonks in whole pages of ponderous ruminations on art, philosophy, Japan-worship, completely out of the blue, is an intrusive artifice and a major structural weakness. Aren't authors suppose to show and not just tell?Then, too, my inner cynic has to cavil just a little bit at the unlikely perfection of the emotional harmonic convergence towards the book's ending. Mr Ozu seems too good to be true - more a wish projection conjured up to salve the protagonists' inner longings than a believable character in his own right. For that matter, once you get away from the hypnotically persuasive, utterly charming, voices of the two narrators, the thought might cross your mind that maybe the other residents of the building aren't quite the shallow monsters they are made out to be. Doesn't the much-maligned older sister, Colombe, deserve our sympathy as well? Paloma's family members are closer to fairy tale archetypes than believable, real-life characters.Nonetheless, "The Elegance of the Hedgehog" worked for me, perhaps because of its fable-like qualities. It is compulsively readable, (except for some of the intrusive philosophical digressions, which did nothing for me, but were easily skipped).I give it a strong recommendation.

$review_text.: Reckoning starts off right were Forbidden ended

After the battle with Vladimir, the only way to save Gabriel&#8217;s life was to turn him


In my opinion, that book ended in a cliffy because you didn&#8217;t know if it actually saved him or what was in store for them next
Right off the bat Gabriel is taken from her

She enlists the help of an unlikely ally in order to find Gabriel

The book alternates between Rose&#8217;s and Gabriel&#8217;s POV&#8217;s

I can totally hang with that but it crazy around the midway mark

I&#8217;d find myself waiting on bated breaths, hoping for a bone&#8230;anything to bring them back together.All of the action that I loved in Forbidden is back in full force times 10
It was gorey and incredibly detailed
I could feel myself in the scenes, watching it unfold right before my eyes


Just when I thought I was getting what I wanted it was snatched away from me
I feel like Amy killed my puppy&#8230;.not just killed it, but ripped it to shreds


My heart is broken after yet another CLIFFY! I can&#8217;t even wrap my mind around the revelations that were thrown at me
Everything I believed was somehow twisted into this magnificent mind f*****y that was utterly fantastic
NO ONE IS SAFE!!! Just remember that


I hope book three is a bit kinder to my heart.

I was impressed so much by this book that I couldn't put it down for the entire weekend.  The author has an amazing way of capturing your attention.  Winter Solstice Winter is a romance novel that takes you deep in the world of Vikings and the supernatural.The book takes you down a road filled with mystery and magic.  You meet new characters along the way including mortals, creatures and Gods.  The author does an outstanding job of describing the land in which the book is set, Midgard.

$REVIEW.: Though short,  this is a very intense novella that pulls you immediately into it's world.  I liked the initial depiction of Jenn and Scott and how they meet at a party and move,  oh so quickly,  into a slave/master rel.  But while I was interested in Jenn's harrowing prior experience in BDSM it just revealed for me once again what an odd world it is,  and how dangerous it can be.  While in college Jenn 'lost herself' as she puts it,  in a BDSM rel with an inexperienced and frankly abusive Dom.  But she couldn't see the abuse until it was too late and needed strong aid to get  out.  I know Scott was different, but I could totally relate to her fears,  if not to the situation she had willingly put herself in.This is a well written book with characters of some depth,  and even though we only see them at the very start,  we can believe that this rel with grow into a solid HEA.  I will look for pieces by Natasha Moore again.  And at $2.50 it's reasonably priced,  but I think it took me less than an hour to read,  so it's very short. I also found it a bit disturbing -  in this rel things are going to go right,  but in the last rel they didn't go well at all and that awful situation Jenn found herself in really upset me.

$REVIEW.: Lots of things I liked about 12:19, and I'd have given it five stars if not for a high number of punctuation errors (an editor needs to be replaced). The plot drives along with little interruption, and with Evil taking center-stage throughout the story, don't get too attached to the characters; many of them meet unfortunate (and grisly) ends. Man of these result in &#34;I-didn't-see-that-coming&#34; plot twists, which is the main attraction for this fiction reader. I don't want to give away too much about the focal character, J.C., but once his full identity is revealed, the plot speeds up with the stakes raised dramatically. The characters are credible, especially protagonist Tom Drayton, who becomes a reluctant hero, but even he gets an unexpected plot twist at the end.  All-in-all, this is one of those Good vs. Evil reads, and at the end we're left to wonder if Good winning this battle was enough, or if there's a 12:20 in Michael Infinito's writing future.

$REVIEW.: Chemistry was definitely interesting! That was, in my opinion, solely because of the main character, Claude Frollo. He is Insane, capital I Insane... but I sort of loved it! His passionate, impulsive and irrational nature made the first person narrative unlike any I've read. We got to watch everyone else become heroes while his obsessive, all-consuming love for Esmeralda caused him to self-destruct. He fell into the common trap of believing Esmeralda was more than she was. His delusion was my addiction, this novel was definitely a page-turner!However, this retelling may have stayed too true to the original in regards to the plot and not the style. Esmeralda has a pet goat... there are the same very outdated names - Claude, Valentine, Esmeralda, Phoebus... Claude lives in a church... the description of Valentine's 'ugliness' was so overdone I was confounded as to how he was even alive. I don't believe that it was convincingly brought into the twenty-first century.Although there were fundamental issues with the characters and plot, the last quarter of the novel was its redemption. The scenario was perfectly modern, Lamm's twist on the ending was extremely well done and a thrilling read. This was where the retelling truly came to life; Claude Frollo's story is a tragedy, it's obvious from the blurb, and let me tell you, his descent and desperation were a force, but hopefully you'll find that out for yourselves. I'd definitely recommend this novel, Claude's erratic almost bipolar side of story, you won't find anywhere else.For more reviews, please visit my blog Looking for the Panacea, [...]

Sydney is an entertainment photographer and Ben is the lead singer of the band Reckless. They meet and Ben is very interested in her, but Sidney has had a very bad experience with a particular rock star and therefore all rock stars are bad news in her book. Ben is very persistent and is not about to give up. He wants to get to know Sydney and find the reason for her attitude. Can he tear down the wall Sydney has in place to protect herself? I love the fact that this book took me in a journey through several years. I also got a glimpse of some of the characters from sheet music and how they are doing. All in all if you love sexy rock stars you'll really enjoy this book.

$review_text.: 3 1/2 stars.It was a sweet introduction into DD and Age play.  The story is about an author, Dana,  that writes erotic spanking and age play stories, but has never been a part of the scene.  Richard is a friend of a friend that meets Dana and wants to have a relationship for real.The story had some graphic sex scenes, anal play, spanking with paddle and hand and age play with Richard as daddy and Dana as his 6 year old.I liked Richard.  He was sweet and caring and tried to help Dana in a safe and secure environment.  Dana needed the age play since she had no childhood to speak of.  Both were consenting adults that walked through the pitfalls of starting a new relationship.The ending was happy and Dana finally started to be her real self.  Richard was always there for her to care for her and keep her safe.  Dana had great friends that supported her as well.

$REVIEW.: This is an extremely satisfying, exhaustively reasearched, brilliant, biography on the great literary family, the Brontes. At over 1400 pages, there is not much that Juliet Baker hasn't analysed, dissected, and/or debunked. She writes like a detective, weeding out fact from nonsense, and along the way she extinguishes 150 years of myth. Was Branwell always a screw up and a drunk with no redeeming qualities? Was Patrick an uninvolved parent with anger issues? In this wonderful bio, Baker manages to set the record straight once and for all. She didn't write a dry recounting of previous information. This is a fresh account of a real family, consisting of 8 distinctively real personalities with just as many flaws as virtues. There is no reason to read anything else on the Brontes.

$REVIEW.: The novel, "The Underlighters" by Michelle Patricia Browne, is a dystopian horror adventure with a great protagonist who progresses through her coming of age journey in the midst of a world none of us would recognize. That is, we wouldn't recognize it without the deft writing skills of Ms. Browne. She quickly establishes this new world environment and continues to add dark, complex layers to it as the story unfolds.Despite the darkness and despair in the world she has skillfully created, Ms. Browne, in the end, has a lot to say about the strength of the human spirit and its ability to survive and overcome against some very long odds.This is a terrific author with a unique voice who has a lot to offer and I strongly encourage readers who enjoy discovering new worlds to check this one out.

$review_text.: A fast-paced and humorous novel, set in England, with romance, suspense and political intrigue. The sassy heroine is a member of the royal family and the hero an American undercover agent, not used to protocol or magnificent palace, and way too sensitive to the lovely Briton he&#8217;s supposed to investigate-- or protect, but not fall in love with. We are met with a riot of emotions, fear, anger, hope and trust. A lot of conflict and a great sensual tension add to the interesting plot and the appealing characters.

$REVIEW.: The thing I love most about this book?  That it's the first book in a new series by Ms. Raney, and I get to return to Clayburn again!I'll admit upfront that I've always loved Raney's books.  They are hopeful and romantic without being saccharine sweet.  Her characters are real people with real issues.  The books are consistently fun and easy to read while imparting essential lessons about the grace of God.This book, however, has topped the list as my favorite Raney title.  It grabbed my attention from the very start with the carjacking of Maggie, and held me until the last page.  In fact, I finished it in one night.Maggie and all of the people she encounters on her journey, both real and spiritual, are flawed and fabulous, the type of characters that allow the readers to recognize pieces of themselves, family members and friends.  Clayburn, the fictional Kansas town where most of the story happens, is charming; it is the kind of bucolic town where everyone knows everyone else, and Raney illustrates both the positive and negative aspects of small-town life.The suspense at the end of the novel gave me that last little jolt that I needed to keep my eyes open in the wee hours of the morning.  I cheered quietly, so I wouldn't wake up the family.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys engaging, heartwarming tales.

$REVIEW.: Okay before you start this book have a box of tissues handy. This was an ARC that I read and I am glad I was able to have the opportunity. I cried so much from beginning to end. The main character Noah Sullivan goes through so much from the start of the book to the last chapter. I actually felt his emotions as I was reading the book. It's weird when you become connected to a character. There was a lot more to the book than just romance which I thoroughly enjoyed. The relationship between Noah and Jake is very close but yet there was still a distance of hiding who they really were from each other. As I was reading this book I called and texted my best friend that I have known for 25 years just to see how she was doing and how to tell her how much I loved her and was grateful for her. In some instances there are friendships that have bonds that are stronger than sibling bonds. This is the case with Noah because he is an only child. So when Noah suffers with his grief I pictured me and my best friend in the same situation and how I would have handled. At some points during the book I had to put down just to take a breather. I really don't want to give any more specifics because I don't want to ruin it, but the one character that I will remember forever is Noah. I loved Maddie but her role wasn't as strong for me as Noah's was. Enjoy the book but don't say I didn't warn you about having a box of tissues ready.

$review_text.: Essentially this is a collection of tips for writing and testing C++ program (presumably better C++ programs).  Firstly, games programming usually implies a treatment of graphical algorithms (rendering, mapping and so forth). Be surprised, but this book doesn't cover the usual material. The title is completely misleading. Secondly, if you don't know C++ then this book will be simply over your head.  The code snippets are just that - snippets.  Many of them, in my opinion, are largely psuedocode in C++ packing. For instance, plugins are presented at so high a level (i.e. so general) that it is difficult to gain anything useful at all from the chapter. Finally, there are good tips and tricks in the book.  However, other C++ books present much the same take on performance improvement, memory management and variable scoping.  The CD has a bundle of presumably working programs (I didn't compile any) which are worth examining.My overall reaction to this book is quite equivocal.  On the one hand if it were another 'how to write great C++ programs' texts, it would be moderately interesting but not top drawer. However, on the other hand, the title suggests that it has a very specific games focus, so you expect game related material.  Largely that just isn't there, hence my rating of the book.To be absolutely candid, having read the other glowing reviews, I was astonished when I received the book to discover that it was largely not about game programming (as typified in texts from Dave Eberly, Andre Lemothe, and Alan Watt and Poliocarpo). I had a completely different set of expectations. Unfortunately they were not realised.

Anne takes us on a wonderful journey of riddles and rhymes in her quest to learn everything about Baphos Hall, which she had just inherited. There are so many thrilling and twisting turns during this story. Things are most definitely not what they seem to be, and the excitement of unlocking these mysteries is amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed this novella. I'm totally impressed with the writing Poppet has put into this, and her way of sucking a reader in. This has now become one of my favorite stories by Poppet, it's brilliant.

$review_text.: Review posted at:  [...]This is one of the most anxiety-inducing reads I've experienced.  I wanted to reach through my kindle and protect Devon more than anything.  Devon is our main character and she has her walls up, rightfully so.  We don't find reason well into the book but we're seeing her relationships build, yet struggle at the same time up to that point.  The fear elicited from the pages seeping into my pores left me sweating.  Devon's running from something or towards something and I wanted to shake her to figure out what it was.  It played out nicely knowing that in time she'd open up to share her story.  Her friends aren't lacking in secrets themselves.  These secrets could help or hurt them in the long run and the intense ride is non-stop angst--which I strive for in a great read!!  KA absolutely delivered in these terms.  The fear and suspense had me turning page after page after page, but also the tension in words spoken and flirtatious actions.  The sexual tension between Devon and my newest book boyfriend, Brennan, was HAWT!!  Brennan and all his demeanor spoke volumes to what Devon needs and how their story plays out is beautiful.  Everything happened at the perfect pace and he was there for her, protecting her, and comforting her.  His words and how he says them is like sweet nothing's being sung into your ear.  When everything's out in the open it doesn't crash and burn, instead it picks up and they move forward, which is heartwarming to see.  This book had me laughing at the banter, I already spoke of the anxiety and fear, but this read also left me in tears-for what was spoken and shared and the future.  I ended this read hopeful that Devon now feels her greatness is following her.  Give it a try!

$review_text.: Obsidian...where to start?  I loved this book so much more than I thought I would.  I really love paranormal books, but hadn't really gotten into aliens yet.  I have had this book for at least four months and finally decided to read it.  I think it took me two days to finish it.Katy is the heroine and main character.  She moves to West Virginia from Florida a few years after her dad dies because her mom needs a change of scenery.  Her mom is a work-aholic as a nurse and is not around often but they have a good relationship.  Katy's neighbors are Daemon and Dee Black (they are twins).  Immediately Daemon and Katy have a very intense dislike of each other.  Dee and Katy become fast friends but Daemon continues to try to drive Katy away.  It becomes clear why Daemon is trying to drive Katy away, but even knowing this he still acts like a jerk (with a mystical sensitive side that comes out sometimes).  He's hot, he's cold, he's giving Katy whiplash he changes his mind so often.  At the end of the book, the author has a small section written from Daemon's point of view and I loved! reading that part.  Despite Daemon's crazy personality, you can't help but adore him (and want to smack him).  I can't wait for the second book to come out.

$REVIEW.: I gave this review a 5 star because we all need a break and it takes time and effort to write a novel. The story of B is  typical, but entertaining and the book is a fairly decent read. However, as it takes effort it also takes money put to good use. Like for editing. It's hard to get into a story where the grammatical errors outweigh the plot. I'm looking forward to this author reprising this book and the sequel that should be a much better grade of product.

$review_text.: The story of a marriage to meet two peoples social, but not emotional needs, was plausible

 The transition to a loving, caring relationship was well-written

 But this is not a "sweet" romance

 The language is very crude and unnecessary

 The intimate scenes used crude language also and detracted from the story.I liked Luke and Molly as they each had their insecurities and faults


 The story needed more tension and not just the sexual kind.

A time warp thing, I just couldn't buy it and I kept 'pshaw-ing' it, like really??The 'hero' left me wanting more.. not in the bedroom per say but he was otherwise lacking in personality and character,he came from another era and it was just not my thing.  I just couldn't get into this story, at all..The 'heroine' is weak and hasn't enough backbone for my taste, she was pathetic and boring as well.I can't say why this book has gotten so many good reviews, it was overall a very dull read..

As a person who now lives with significant limitations and often is concerned about being a burden, this memoir is a real gift.  The value of relationship is celebrated even as it is transformed.  Life takes on a new shape and texture.  Happiness is in surrendering to life as it unfolds and taking comfort in what is, having learned that we have much less control than our youthful selves assumed.

$REVIEW.: Spoiler Free Review: (Originally posted on my blog 9/25/13): http://bookcrush.in/reviews/book-review-capstone-cornerstone-4-misty-provencher/Let's start by bringing this party back to the beginning, since this is technically the end I say why not. Thanks to Goodreads, I know that I added Cornerstone to my "to-read" shelf in December of 2011 - but it wasn't until I was enthusiastically recommended to read Cornerstone, by a book loving friend a whole year later, that I actually picked it up and I devoured it! As well as each and every title since! This is why you should take some recommendations extremely seriously! You never know what diamond in the rough you will find even if the book was technically on your radar. You can visit my very simple goodreads review of Cornerstone. I have also reviewed Jamb, the 3rd book in the series as well as an author crush post where I gush over Misty Provencher!Now onto the fourth and final book in the series, Capstone. It is just as compelling and enthralling as the rest of the series. I thwarted most of my responsibilities just so I could read it as fast as I could! I wanted to consume it and do it quickly, kinda like ripping off a band-aid, because I knew it was going to hurt me on some fundamental level. I even assembled a preparedness kit of chocolate, candy, wine & tissues to read the last 3 chapters.Now that it's been a few days since I finished Capstone, and I took some time to process, I feel like I might be able to review it without getting all verklempt. I guess I am the saddest over the fact that this fantastic series is over. That is where all my feels go - to dealing with that I am no longer going to be reading another Cornerstone installment...I hate letting go. But I know Misty is going to continue writing fascinating books, so that gives us all something to look forward to.Capstone is noting short of exceptional. This ENTIRE series is beyond words for me. I rated it the rare 6 hearts! (If only other sites would let me too!) It wasn't what I was expecting for the finale, but it was overwhelmingly satisfying too. I do have one complaint - it was too short. I know what an awful thing to say, because I know it's just me being selfish and wanting so much more and not wanting it to end...ever. But all good things must come to an end, and Misty tugged at my heart and brain just enough to make me smile like a fool all while tearing up.The book was full of non-stop action, picking up exactly where Jamb left off. Because that Jamb cliffhanger was a humdinger! Actually Misty does cliffhangers right, aka makes me scream at the top of my lungs and then dies for more! I have never had a worse book hangover like I do when I finish a Cornerstone novel. I am so screwed for a good long while. It was wrong for me to say it was too short, when so much happens and it happens so smoothly that you barely realize the book is almost over! Without giving away the plot at all, let me just say HOLY COOKIES to the rescue!Every character has a point and purpose in this book. It comes full circle, for many. But let's talk Garrett & Nalena. Garrett is so perfect. He has always taken his time with Nalena, never pressuring her, never giving her too much information to overwhelm her, because he knows just what to say & when. Nalena has grown so much, but is still very much her. They endure so much together and together they make some of the hardest choices. These two are the perfect couple, I mean they love each other so hard, so real & so deeply. However, they also try to put their responsibilities above themselves, the world is going to hell and they are involved in trying to get the pieces back together. As it is with many YA series I get so attached to the characters that I want them to do things, that as an adult reader expects them to do *giggles* and even though this book is still very PG and still very YA, you do get some amazingly sexy scenes between these two. Sometimes the anticipation is steamier than the act! (Thanks Misty! Whew! *wipes brow*)The Cornerstone series is hard to pin down, it's fantasy, it's romance, it's a coming of age, it's paranormal, it's unique. It is magical & it is AMAZING! This series has some of the most distinctive worlds & characters I have ever read. I love it. Be patient like Garrett and you will get all of the feels, all of them and they will get you too.I hope you give this series a chance too, as I am that enthusiastic reader that is recommending it to everyone I can!

$review_text.: The story was heartbreaking but at the same time very fulfilling, satisfying at the end. It's not just because the story gives you a happy ending, but because the story was weaved piece by piece that just leads to a happy ending effortlessly, and not much but definitely not less.I actually bought the book seeing that there's a considerable amount of 5 star reviews and of course there's no 1 star (not that it ever stopped me from buying a book).Anyway, I didn't expect to be totally swooned by this book. I expected a typical a-hole millionaire with excess baggage smitten to a no-life-widow and a smart kid, but the description doesn't justify the entire story.I thought it was the typical frail lady having a hard time moving on, but I was wrong!Clare is an epitome of a woman we should all desire (at least I think I should desire), strong, survivor (if you have readKiss Me in Paris, there's a great line there about surviving which i think fits here ), loving & cool mom (dancing with her 4 year old daughter - all the time).Then we have Logan, (I'm glad his manwhore past was not highlighted much because we've read a lot of those already), Richmond's "McSteamy" , is actually a real man, and by real I mean, man enough to leave daddy issues behind which means "no drama".I think I've spilled enough giving you an overview of what you're about to read. And honestly this book is something worth reading so I suggest go grab a copy now.

$review_text.: I would say this is a cross between the movies BIG, LOTR & Jewel of the Nile.  I would agree with others that it might be more suited for young people than adults, but it is still rather exciting and interesting if you like science fiction, fantasy or time travel stories.  I did enjoy the historical aspect of this book;  it helped having Jade be well versed on history so she could help them in different situations. Having already read book #2, I have to say this is probably the best one, in that the two main characters seem more mature at handling the different situations presented them on their quest.  I liked that the author put them in difficult situations that they had to figure a way to get out of on their own or with the abilities of their avatar.  The author did a good job of transitioning them from their normal real life to that of life inside the game. Knowing there is 5 books in the series also helped knowing they would escape any serious situation, but it was still interesting to see how the author accomplished that each time.  The company and quest seemed to be getting along together quite well until someone referred to Phoenix as "The Leader."  After that it seemed to have gone to his head and he reverted to his actual age of 14 again and the unity they had before disintegrated.  I enjoyed the "quest" of a group of people in both LOTR & The Sword of Shannara so much that it allowed me to overlook some of these glaring negatives in the story.

$REVIEW.: I was in the mood for a light romance and I am a huge fan of the author&#8217;s other contemporary romance, Wait for You. Frigid definitely didn&#8217;t disappoint. I really enjoyed it and it suited my mood perfectly. Honestly, there were snow flurries the other day and I just wanted to cozy up with a contemporary romance and this cover jumped out at me. It was perfect!The conflict was interesting because Sydney and Kyler were friends and both of them wanted more and thought the other didn&#8217;t for completely different reasons. Sydney and Kyler found themselves snowed in at a ski resort, which was great because it forced the two of them together. I also enjoyed the mysterious aspect of the novel because someone was obviously sabotaging the cabin during the storm.Frigid was a light, steamy read and I definitely recommend it to fans of the author&#8217;s other contemporary novels. I was completely in the mood for a book like this and I devoured it in no time. I wish I would have read it sooner, but I think the colder weather made me appreciate the whole snowed-in plot scenario a bit more.

$review_text.: This book is a very engaging story about a special unit in the FBI.  It has lots of suspense and romance.  And as an added bonus it is a paranormal book with great characters.The author blends the romance into the plot seamlessly at appropriate places in the story. The heroine of the story is a strong character despite her past and her gifts. While Erica does fight falling in love, there is plenty of romance and hot steamy sex.  The hero is a strong, protective character with a cocky attitude that captures your interest immediately.  The supporting characters are very bewitching and make me want to read their stories and get to know them better.The plot keeps you intrigued and keeps you reading to the very end.  There are plenty of suspects to keep you guessing with the team racing against time to stop a madman.  The heroine's personal story adds some mystery and confusion to the story, since she has kept her gift and past a secret from her teammates.If you love a story that grabs your attention and characters that have something special to add spice, then this is just the book for you.  I am looking forward to reading more books from this author and hopes she plans to write the rest of the team's stories.

$review_text.: It is the rare PRIDE AND PREJUDICE variation that does NOT try to summarize everything that happens in the pages of that hallowed book, even while veering off into "what-if"-land. While there are many scenes here that are culled directly from P&P, there are other scenes that are alluded to in only the vaguest of terms, assuming that the reader already knows what happened. Ergo, this is not exactly a stand-alone book. However, it's hard to imagine someone who is NOT a P&P enthusiast reading this, and I sure didn't have any trouble following it. I did find a bit of similarity to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES (which I frankly despised), but only in the way it injected the new story within the framework of the original but without the snarky tongue-and-cheek that ZOMBIES has. This has intrigue and mystery and Code of Honor killings going on, it's serious business, and I loved every page of it!

$REVIEW.: I bought this one on sale, but It's worth full price if you like to laugh.  There are so many books by Brits moving to France that you have to wonder when the French will start moving to England to get away from the English.  That said, this is one of the better efforts. I was struck by the trouble and expense of getting their horses to France, but if you are a horse lover maybe it will make sense to you.  Very funny observations of French country life and reactions to the newcomers.  The topper is the story of the identity thief.  I won't spoil it by revealing the guilty party, but it could certainly happen to any of us.

$REVIEW.: Jerry Cornelius, a product of sixties hip when Moorcock's name never seemed to be out of the papers, died, was resurrected and died again, certainly in terms of his fashionability.  Now here he is with a bunch of the best of his earliest adventures coupled with a quartet of his best new ones, dealing with Clinton's foreign policy, Lady Diana's death-cult, Middle Eastern Politics and, in what is probably the best story in the book, events around the catastrophe of 9/11.  And, to this reader's surprise at least, he seems even more relevant today than he did when he first hit the pages of New Worlds, that magazine of early post-modernist senisbility, some forty years ago.  Moorcock's fingers were definitely on the pulse of our times and this collection proves it.  Elegant, fast and sardonic, these are tales that are, like Scott Fitzgerald's,distinctly of their time and yet retain a universality lacking in most other contemporary fiction.  This is the best value on the literary market.  As he proves in his McSweeney's MammothTreasury story, Moorcock is also provides great entertainment while making us think a lot deeper than, for instance, the Matrix's rabbit hole.  Totally recommended!

The four stories interweave nicely and kept me itching to see when and how this unlikely group would meet up.I'm not ashamed to admit that I really, really hope there's a book 2 coming so these survivors can hook up and start to work on repopulating the world. You know, down the line. What? Post-apocalyptic romance is totally a thing. In my head, at least.But let's not get ahead of ourselves. This book? Very fun. Lots of biting and fighting. Several instances of our characters surviving by the skin of their teeth. A few bad guys of the non-zombie variety. You know, everything you need to make your zombie apocalypse a hoot!While I admittedly want some love, zombie apocalypse style, down the road, I also hope we get to see the survivors get out of the mess they're in at the end of this book. And it is a mess. Just as we're beginning to get some answers, things turn sticky -- zombies start appearing and BAD THINGS HAPPEN.It gives me the shivers.I'm trying to say that this book totally worked for me. From beginning to end, it was a blast. And I hope there's more planned because I'd totally be down with reading it.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal

I'd have given a higher rating if he at least explained how to make a TincTrac, instead of just dangling it out there as a "better way" for Children. I would not go so far to call this a bait and switch, but at the end of the book he provides a URL to an equally vague web site that drives the customer to some pricey classes.It may be my loss, but based on the book, I would be sceptical about the classes.

It was one of the most captivating love stories I have read in a really long time. Even Fifty Shades of Grey seemeda little dull in my opinion in comaprison to this story. Although we the plot of this story has been seen in many stories written before, you know the supper rich guy falls for the poor struggling girl. There was something about this series that was simply different. I'm not sure if it was the depth of emotions that Monica and Jonahtan shared, or the way that she only submissive to him when she wanted to and he was ok with that, because when she wanted to was everytime he ordered her to be...Jonahtan and Monica were what every woman wants in ther life!!

$review_text.: Texas Wildflowers by bestselling and award-winning author Anita Higman, is a four-in-one collection of contemporary romance novellas, in the Romancing America series.

But for Rose, things are not so rosy. When the storybook moment every girl dreams of her whole life comes a cropper with her groom failing to show up, a heartbroken Rose returns to Galveston, back to her childhood house.

But can she trust him to handle himself appropriately when women practically swoon at his feet?Texas Wildflowers is a fun read that will resonate well with lovers of contemporary Christian romance fiction.

$review_text.: 4 of 5 starsI received a copy of  This novel from the author for an honest review. This book is part of series but can certainly be read as a stand alone. Ana has fled her beloved New Orleans for Maine. The circumstances are vague in the beginning as why Ana needs to have this time to herself, but we know it was something huge. There is a home on Summer Island that has been in Deschanel family and she decided this was good place to go to put some distance between herself and what happened back home. Ana has always felt a little apart from other people and has a gift of healing that she keeps close to the vest. She has a really hard time connecting emotionally with other people and rather likes her own company most of the time. Other than a really close relationship with her cousin, Nicolas, and her father, Ana isn't close to anyone. She prepares for the winter in Maine, an experience she has never had, with the help of a friendly gentleman named Alex. The other folks on Summer Island are gossipy and stand offish at first, but the vet on the island is particularly rude. When circumstances arise that force Jon, the vet, and his brother Finn, to take Ana into their home, things get really strange. When Ana doesn't contact her family for a few days, then weeks, Nicolas and his best friend, Oz try to get to island despite overwhelming odds. Nicholas just can't shake the feeling that something terrible has happened to Ana. The suspense builds and builds toward a shattering climax. In the aftermath, will Ana be able to come to terms with all these cataclysmic events and move forward from shocking revelations and build a life with another person for the first time in her life? The author does a wonderful  job of slowly revealing information at a pace that builds suspense. The atmosphere of winter in Maine gives the suspense another hard edge. Winters in Maine are infamous. Even those born and raised on Summer Island can be taken by surprise in dire situations. There was one point where the suspense became very taut. I was on the edge of my seat. As the author states, this novel has elements of paranormal, suspense, mystery and a bit of an unusual romance. In the end I felt like Ana will finally find some peace and will break a dangerous cycle in her life. This was very unique story. A great imagination and a peek into the darker side of human nature. This book would appeal to fans of many genres. Overall an A

Anyone living in a small area but would like to grow their own garden should read this book.  Great read for people living in urban areas or anyone in general that love gardening but have limited space!  Recommended.

$REVIEW.: I have written a five-star review of this book on my "noteworthy YA fiction" blog: The Stuff That Isn't Twilight, but I'll post an excerpt of it below:I can barely begin to describe what this book did to my brain.  I couldn't stop talking about it with my friends for days after I finished it.  I read it in about one sitting while I was on the train back to school, and it absolutely blew me away.  It also scared the crap out of me, because there is actually a super volcano in Yellowstone, and it will eventually erupt, and all the scary/intense/life-threatening things that happen to Alex and the people he meets will probably happen to everyone who is alive during the super volcano eruption.  Yikes.  Mullin obviously put a ton of effort into the research he did for this book, and it shows.  That's sort of what makes it so terrifying. In the afterward, he explains all the research he did, and I almost didn't want to read it, because I didn't want there to be proof behind the horror.  But I did, and I don't regret it, because I love knowing how smart and thoughtful authors are.  Makes me have hope for myself.  Anyway, besides the realistic terror, I was super impressed by how each character we meet (including Alex) is entirely whole.  Even if we only see them for a chapter or less, each character is beautifully written and carefully thought out... even the frightening ones we never wanted to meet.  Watching Alex's journey from a bit of a smart-mouthed brat, to a strong, brave, caring, three-dimensional young man is also astounding and fun to be a part of (even when some of the events that may trigger this change in him are a little disturbing).  Oh, and I can't forget the badass powerhouse Darla, who Alex meets along the way and develops feelings for.  She is hands-down the best character in the book, because she is brilliant, strong both emotionally and physically, resilient, and doesn't take crap from anybody (especially Alex).  The two make a fantastic team you root for until the very end.It's hard for me to place an age on this book, because although the reading level is probably at 12 or 13, the violence is so realistic and prevalent.  I'm serious: there is quite a bit of violence in this book, and although I believe almost all of it is necessary, it's still pretty gory.  For that, I'm going to stick with 14-15 for this one.  This is the perfect book for teens who love dystopian/disaster novels with a strong male and female lead.  Though, to be honest, it's basically a must-read for everyone.  I still can't get past how much effort went into crafting this piece of fantastic literature.  Mullin is an up-and-coming novelist we should all keep our eyes on!

$REVIEW.: Firstly, let's start with the goods. Cool post-apocalyptic setting. Interesting characters, good imagery. It was a fairly quick read, with something actiony always happening. I'd probably pick up the next one just because I like her writing style.However... There were many instances with typos, and not so much spelling errors. It was more like the author started to say one thing and changed it, but didn't erase the previous idea. Also, there were times when whole words were missing from sentences, but you got used to it by the end and just filled them in automatically. I'd say with having someone beta read for her, even just one or two people, a lot of these mistakes could have been thwarted and it would have made the experience a definite 5 star.

$review_text.: I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.Professor John Dunn has always been missing something in life


 Hiding in the vanilla world, Dunn has his fascination for spanking and his interest in BDSM.Moving to Corbin's Bend, Colorado gives him the wherewithall to dip his toes into the lifsstyle that is BDSM
 Not actively searching for a sub, he nonetheless finds a willing &lt;i>student&lt;/i> in Sara Harshaw.Sarah Harshaw grew up in surburban Denver and later her family moved to Corbin's Bend


 As she grew up, she realized her family was unlike most others:  her father spanked her and her brother, as well as their mother


 Only later did she realized that the adult spankings usually were erotic in nature.Always knowing something was missing in her relationships, she finds herself intrigued with Professor Dunn

 When he presents her with the contract, she can't stop herself from signing it.To me, the first half of the book  was written as though it was being told as if you were reading the characters diary
 There is not a lot of character interaction, but more what scenarios happened with the characters


 The second half of the book showed more interaction between the Sarah and John.~~Wicked Reads Review Team~~

$review_text.: If you are looking for a novel ripe with twists and turns and intricate interweaving of plots, Silenced Cry by Marta Stephens is a novel for you. This is a classic detective story that is detailed, intricate, and full of surprises.Silenced Cry starts out with a bang. Detective Sam Harper is a hot shot narcotics detective whose life is permanently altered the night his partner is killed by someone who is supposed to bring them a break in a major case. To control a potential public relations nightmare, the force transfers Harper to a homicide unit where he quickly gets involved in a decade-old child homicide.Though initially frustrated by his assignment to a cold case, Harper quickly realizes that this case is much more than anyone originally thought. The investigation brings up his past--and the past of his friends, family, and nemeses quickly combine to turn this case into so much more than a cold case involving a nameless infant.This quick and easy read will keep your attention throughout ever page. With a wide range of characters and sub-plots, the novel is exciting and interesting.My one complaint would be an almost overabundance of essential characters. With so many people to potentially care about, no one is developed enough that you can associate with them on a deep level. This leads to a bit of confusion as well as a desire for more information.Marta Stephens is able to weave several intricate stories into one cohesive novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Armchair Interviews says: The novel is a fast-paced, exciting read.

All with wonderfully embellished themes of fantasy

$REVIEW.: As someone who has an avid interest in espionage, intrigue, conspiracy theories, true crime, political debacles, I am always interested to see what F C Etier is going to write next.  I am hooked on The Barry-Hixon Conspiracy series.  If you read the first in the series, The Tourist Killer, you will know who the Barry and the Hixon of the Barry-Hixon Conspiracy series are.  You will also know who Rosemary Woods is, otherwise she may not be who you think.  Mr. Etier is an accomplished photographer, and you can possibly tell this by the way he writes his scenes.  I can imagine his mind seeing these scenes as photographs and recording the atmospheric details on paper for the reader to enjoy--snapshots in time.  As we read along in The Presidents Club, interacting with all of the colorful characters, we cannot imagine the intense action that will occur in the last third of the novel.  It is a hang-on-to-your-seat cardiovascular workout. When I first read part of the book in serial form, I commented to the author at the time, that I had not often seen a scene between two characters written so skillfully as that in Chapter Ten of the book.  We are sorry to bid some characters adieu in this novel, and we are anxious to see others return in future works.  If you liked Goldfinger, All The President's Men, Executive Action and Washington, Behind Closed Doors, you will love this.  I highly recommend it for your political-thriller fix. The Hitchcock-ian touches are nice and did not go unnoticed. --Sara Marie Hogg, author of three thrillers and a paranormal fantasy about a POTUS, reviewing as Phoebe Stogstill

The chemistry between the main characters was explosive and you manage to fall in love with Llew and Jess as well as his brothers and Jane (featured in the second book) as the story progresses. This book has a lot of spice and some surprising darkness towards the end. The writing is pretty good and the characters are portrayed well coming together for an overall steamy little read that turned me on to a new series. I would definitely check it out but be warned its definitely got a TON of sex, so if that's not your thing I would steer clear, if it is then what have you got to lose? The book is free!

$review_text.: Ms Yarde had clearly done her homework. Not only when it comes to historical events, but also when it comes to clothes, food, interiors, bath houses - well, everything. Which is probably why it is so easy to slip into the historical context of this book, set in 14th century Moorish Spain.I haven't as yet figured out why the book is titled Sultana: Two Sisters, as there are no sisters in the book, nor is there as much as a whiff of sisterly love between Butayna and Maryam, the two protagonists. Ms Yarde has chosen to mainly tell the story from Butayna's POV, and as the novel progresses, I feel I really get to know this gritty girl. Maryam, on the other hand, remains elusive throughout the book - elusive and, unfortunately, rather one-dimensional, as it seems her life revolves round two things only; to spite Butayna and to ensure her son is made Sultan.Fortunately, the book has other female characters, such as Leila, sister to the Sultan, and Fatima, the Sultan's ancient grandmother. And then there's Yusuf, the Sultan, husband to both Butayna and Maryam. Ms Yarde does a good job in depicting this man, on the one hand the mighty ruler that demands total obedience, on the other a man struggling to find some balance in his domestic arrangements. I did, however, have some problems understanding why a man insisting he was in love with his first wife would go on to marry a woman his beloved spouse hates - and who hates her back.Ms Yarde presents her story in a fluid and poetic prose - at times a tad too poetic. Despite this minor quibble, I found this an enjoyable and interesting read.

$review_text.: Basil Wolverton is one of the legends of comic art, noted for his grotesque drawings that appeared in Mad Magazine, DC Comics' "Plop", and posters for Topps.  He worked a number of years for Timely/Marvel comics as well.  Less known, however, were illustrations he did for Plain Truth Magazine depicting the Old Testament Bible, commissioned by the Worldwide Church of God.  This is the bible as only Wolverton can depict it, filled with apocalyptic drawings of cataclysmic events, insidious demons and other beasts, and the universal evil that men do.This is all told in Wolverton's unique art style, highly detailed and yet caricaturized at the same time.  The book contains over 450 illustrations in all as well as additional 170 Wolverton illustrations including numerous cartoons and general zaniness.  For fans of comic art, particularly extreme, underground-style art, this book is a tremendous boon as it shows a genius illustrator at the pinnacle of his ability.

Bianca was a character that I could connect with. She dyed her hair blond to start a new life and to carry on after her sister. Bianca had attitude and was sassy, I always like main characters who have some spunk in them. The book kept me reading until the end as I wanted to figure out who did it. I love mystery novels and this one didn't disappoint at all. I will be reading more books from Ms. Carr.

$review_text.: I don't normally read "fiction," but since I got a stack of nonfiction books waiting for review, I thought I'd change it up with something outside my normal picks.Ramazan and Ali first meet at an orphanage in Turkey, and their connection blooms from a quick friendship to something more, until they're practically joined at the hip the rest of their lives.Ramazan is a cute and cleaver boy that dreams his parents left him by mistake and will one day whisk him away from all his misery. Ali is a quiet, solitary boy that bears every hardship silently. After growing up unloved, they realize all they have is each other. Unfortunately, life is cruel to the two uneducated orphans after they leave the orphanage. I don't want to say more to avoid spoilers.The fact that it takes place in Turkey didn't affect my enjoyment at all. Change a few names, and I could imagine it taking place anywhere today. It didn't take long for me to sympathize with poor Ramazan, who always dreamed of a better place. Though he dominates the narrative, while Ali is mostly silent through out the book. If Ramazan didn't constantly remind me how much he and Ali were inseparable, I'd say the love was almost one-sided. While Ramazan is fully fleshed out, his partner Ali gets only the sparsest bits of characterization. But I was pleased that it managed to be neither pornographic nor gratuitous with it's sex scenes."Ali and Ramazan" is a gripping novela that you could polish off in a few hours. For the first "Gay/Lesbian" fiction I've read, I liked it.

Finished size, number of blocks needed and the finished size of the blocks are next.

What a wonderful addition to a quilting pattern.Fabric requirements and cutting instructions are next, followed by how to create the block.  All the instructions are written clearly and there are plenty of graphics to make sure you are sewing the blocks correctly.Tips are given in a colored box and are scattered through the book.  Applique patterns, when needed, are given at full size.  Rather than the old standby "quilt as desired", there are quilting suggestions given which I always love to see.Grab your stash of red, white and blue and quilt up something wonderful.

$REVIEW.: Wrong Bed, Right GuyWell --- So long sweet, hot, and steamy summer--- To end my wonderful summer, I filled my time with a fabulous little story about Elle and Gabe!Thank you Darkfallen for the recommendation! It was well worth it! And thank you- of course- Katee Roberts for writing a fantastic contemporary romance novel!Here we go! This story grabbed my attention immediately! Within the first few pages we were introduced to Elle who is attempting to seduce her boss Nathan, and boy oh boy, does everything go to hell in a hand basket! This book had limited bullshit. The author did a fabulous job of not pissing me off. As of late I have had a difficult time dealing with stupid females and Elle, although she had her moments, never dwelled too long on her own stupidity.No ridiculous love triangles! And although there were secondary characters, such as, Nathan (Gabe's brother and Elle's boss) and Roxanne (Elle's bff), the story was all about Elle letting go and Gabe becoming the man he has always wanted to be.Hot - Steamy - and yes there is actually a storyline! Beyond that --- I laughed so hard!!!!! The humor is this book is amazin! I want more! I am not going to lie ... I need more--- I need to know what happens next and YOU need to know what happens first... So, go ahead --- buy the book and love it as much as I did...Ughh--- Gabe... Nuff said.

But now she&#8217;s thrown into the spotlight as Jason&#8217;s assistant because he believes her to be a safe choice because she&#8217;s married.The only problem?She&#8217;s not.Working in close proximity wasn&#8217;t supposed to be an issue.

$REVIEW.: The setting and idea are interesting

The problem is that this short story simply stops at a random point


It reads like the author wrote a novella, accidentally erased the last 75% of the book, and decided to publish anyway
What on earth?  Seriously? The whole story reads like the free introduction to a book, and at the end you should be deciding whether or not to buy.As other reviewers say, the editing is appallingly bad
The author used word completion without checking the consequences, inserting a random wrong word about once each page
Verb tenses are often wrong (e.g., he have)


Any middle school graduate should have been able to find and fix most of these errors, by doing a final proof-read prior to publication.The world is interesting and worthy of investigation


The leading lady is a chip-on-the-shoulder fanatical vampire hunter, working for the government in modern times


A recent human/werewolf/vampire war has led to treaty negotiations still in progress and uneasy peace


He is a leader of the local werewolves, and upon meeting wants her for his mate

Plot wise, my biggest complaint is that her actions at the end of the book are highly offensive
She has an explosive temper, little self control, and seems unable to take personal responsibility

Still, those flaws could have been worked out over the course of a plot, if this had been a full book.Skip it.


$SUMMARY.: short story stops mid sentence

$REVIEW.: It's incredible that Dick Couch was able to perfectly capture so much in this novel. His story is fluidly woven to provide so many different aspects of his team and warriors, the feelings of being alone, of fear, of death of your friends, and so much more.I could say more, but I think it's better for you to read it yourself. You'll find yourself wishing there was a sequel or series: that's how close you come to the characters, as if you were on the fire team with them.I also read Couch's Warrior Elite, The Finishing School, and Down Range (all great.) He has a great knack for story-telling.

$REVIEW.: LONG STORY SHORT..I want this book to be made into a movie, and I want Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play Zach while I play Vee.Water...every drop is precious.  Imagine living in a world where a bottle of pure water is more precious than a human life.  Nuclear war has ravaged the planet to the point where rain stings, animals have died off, plants have died off, and people fight a government that wants to round up all &#34;deserters&#34; to make them work in the factory.  But that work is not quite what it seems....Garr is a masterful writer.  She here put together a work that is stark, gripping, exciting in a macabre way, and will make readers shudder at the plausibility of the world presented.  Stunning emotion, breath-taking action, heartbreaking scenes...this book is amazingly well done.  Let's just say it had me dwelling more than a little bit on a post-nuclear war plan...On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this book a 4.LONG STORY...The GoodHeart thumping. Riveting.  Terrifying.  All these words and more describe Waterproof by Amber Garr.  Imagine you live in a world that has been decimated by nuclear war, famine, and people struggling against one another in a desperate struggle to survive.  Survive just one more day, so that you just might survive the next, and so on.Zach and Vee were high schoolers until the nukes rained down.  Now they are deserters, people who have refused to acquiesce to the governmental draft to serve two years doing hard labor in the &#34;factories&#34;.  No one knows for sure what happens in the factories.  All they know is that those who go in never come out.  They don't want to go in.They are also not sure how they feel about one another, and don't figure this out until it is very nearly too late....or is it?Waterproof is a book that broke my heart,  made me want to puke, made me pump my fist in exhilaration, and shudder....all in the same chapter.  Well-written settings that made me feel as though I was part of the action pulled me into the scenes.  A riveting fast-paced plot grabbed me by the seat of the pants until I did not want to quit reading.  Let's just say I stayed glued to this book for a bit and lost more than a little sleep because I had to know what was going to happen.I'm not kidding about wanting this to be a screenplay: director = Joss Whedon.  Zach = Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Vivienne = me (what, I've done some screen acting!).  Yes it is a dystopian future in a media world where those are becoming more popular, but this one has a ring to it that is just plain terrifying: I could see it happening.Okay, maybe not this exact scenario of course (somehow I feel like the science is a little off in the end), but something eerily similar.  It is easy to sit back and say that we'd never kill anyone, but what if we were in a post-nuclear existence where all water in rivers/oceans/rain was contaminated with nuclear fallout and the only pure water was that which was pure and bottled before the nukes fell?  Can you honestly tell me you wouldn't kill another for such a precious commodity?It terrifies me to think just how plausible this freaky future may be.Anyways, this book is haunting.  The characters are very real, have their own distinct voices (this is very important to me), and made me want to hug and slap them at the appropriate moments.  Something just isn't right about some of them, and it makes me want to read the next one.Oh yeah, this clearly is not a stand-alone book.  It kind of cliffhangs.  *&!@#$Also, it is told in a way that bounces back and forth between Zach and Vee's viewpoints.  Garr is really good at this - it is never confusing who is speaking.  I rather liked being able to crawl inside each of their heads and get a fairly good idea of what was going on at any given time by seeing it though two perspectives.  After Zach and Vee are separated (oh, c'mon...I'm not spoiling to much - you know they get separated if you watch the book trailer), we get to see what is happening on both sides of the story.  I love this!This is kind of Hunger Games meets &#34;Book of Eli&#34; meets &#34;Legion&#34;.  Dystopian.  Love.  Water.  Fight.The Bugly (bad/ugly)Okay, you might have noticed this section has been remarkably short in most of my recent reviews.  I'm not going soft, I swear - the books I've been reading lately just haven't given me much to complain about.  The same is true here.There are two things that bugged me:1)  I HATE cliff hanger endings.  I'll give that this one was done fairly well, but I was more than a little annoyed when my Kindle said &#34;99% complete&#34; and I KNEW the story wasn't anywhere close to finishing.2) The wonky science here bothered me - if an entire land is plagued by radioactive fall out and such, wouldn't the people have radiation poisoning of some sort?  Also, I'm sure the animals mentioned would take MUCH longer to stop showing signs of radiation poisoning and still be unsafe to eat (if the species even survived in the first place).  The people here didn't seem to, and this did bother me.  A certain medical thing near the end bugged me a bit to, simply because I think it was made up....but so long as it remains consistent throughout the story I will let it go.  :PREAD THIS BOOK....AND THEN DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO HELP HUMANITY AVOID SUCH AN AWFUL FATE.

$REVIEW.: I really loved the theme of this anthology
I'm terribly nosy - seriously, I'm that neighbor who is always staring out of the window watching everybody's business (hey, you shouldn't put it out there if you don't want people to watch or listen and that's it - take it in the house, people)- and if I had stumbled across the scenes some of the people in this story have, I wouldn't play coy for a second and probably would watch.The stories in here range from those who do the watching to those who want to be watched

The co-editors of this anthology, Rachel Kramer Bussel and Alison Tyler, were right in their element in picking these stories as well as contributing to the anthology themselves with a story of their own.On the subject, Rachel's contribution called "Like This" was probably my favorite in the book because it was a very intense, intimate scene between a husband and wife of long standing and not some superficial fling or hook-up that would only last as long as the night itself
There were plenty of those kinds of stories in here and they were pretty good, too, but being that I'm married myself I like to read about people who don't always have to look for outside help to spice up things in the bedroom (although the woman in the story had used the image of a fantasy threesome between herself,  her husband, and best friend to help herself orgasm through her intense masturbation performance for her husband who was watching - but the point was, it was only those two present and that was only one of many erotic images she used to spur herself along).Anyway, all of the stories were good in their own right

However, I only have one complaint about these anthologies in general and not just this one but many of the ones I've read by these two editors and even the ones by Ms

Violet Blue, who I absolutely adore and that is that there seems to be an unfair shortage of gay stories in here between men when compared to the ones about lesbians.I happen to be a lover of yaoi - that genre is a whole new ballgame altogether- and because I do, I happen to like reading erotic scenes between two men even as a straight woman


It is a guilty pleasure of sorts for me
So I was very miffed to see there was only one story that fit the criteria in the entire anthology (I can't remember the title)


I guess maybe there was two if you wanted to count the one about a young woman who goes in search of kinky sex in a park where after hours gay men carouse
Either way, compared to the many stories in these overall anthologies - no matter the theme - that is a bit unfair when I'd say as many as one out of every three stories in these anthology caters to lesbians if not women who are at least inclined to bisexuality.Now that I'm thinking about it, it's probably because most of these anthologies are geared toward women of all sexual orientations and, thus, they must assume that just as many lesbians read these books as straight women
Either way, most women may not relate to reading about two guys together as easily as they could reading about two women

Either way, however unbalanced it is, these books always do cater to the people who read them

I've said it in my other reviews of this editor and Ms
Violet Blue - you will find something to relate to, something that you feel calls to you individually and you never have to read anything in these books that does not.I enjoyed this one and as I have read everything Ms
Violet Blue has put out as editor, I hope to do the same for Rachel Kramer Bussel and Alison Tyler.

$review_text.: This is not a good story, it's a great one.  It rivals Kit Prate's best works--JASON KILENNY'S GUN and LONG RIDE TO LIMBO.  Kit Prate is sort of a cross between the classic western movie directors Sam Peckinpah and Henry Hathaway--visceral and elegant.  I don't know what other writer to compare her to, because she really doesn't write like anyone else.  That's to say I really don't know of any other western writer, living or dead, who is anywhere near as good.  Kit's a totally unique voice.  She's pitched her tent in her own camp on her own high hill.  It's a crying shame that she isn't better known than she is, because she deserves to not only be a widely read writer but one who is sufficiently compensated for her truly great contributions to the American Western.  Please read this short story.  It's worth every penny and many more of the 99 it's being sold for.  And then search out all the rest of Kit Prate's stuff.  There's not a lot out there, because Kit's lived a tough life with damn little time for writing when she wasn't making enough to live and feed her family on writing alone, but you won't be disappointed in any damn thing she's written.

$REVIEW.: After a quick introduction to collage and collage tools, the book is divided into two sections.Section one features in-depth profiles of five artists. Each artist is interviewed and interesting questions are asked about their creative process, their inspiration and why they choose to use the materials that they do. Multiple pieces of their artwork are shown. One project is featured with stepped-out directions and photos so you can learn their technique.The five artists profiled and directions for their project are:1. Laurinda Bedingfield: 3D collage book sculpture with photographs2. Barbara DePirro: using acrylic gel medium to create the look of encaustic3. Paula Grasdal: printmaking and collage4. Sharon McCartney: mixed-media multi-paneled wall hanging5. Teesha Moore: mixed-media journal pageSection two is a gallery of two pieces of artwork from 20 different contemporary mixed-media artists. The information includes brief technique explanation, inspiration, and a list of supplies used.The strengths of this book are that there is a great variety of type of artwork represented. This is not a book of fads and trends. It was clear to me that each artist is following their own voice and making their own unique kind of art that they enjoy working with. For this reason I treasure the book, because there are other publications on the market which seem to display the `trend of the season'. This book is fresh and unique. Just seeing different types of artwork and seeing these artists using their own inner voices to guide their art (even if I personally didn't love the look of all of it) made me want to go and make some art.The book closes with some essays on the topic of the artist on the Internet. Directions on how to do photo transfers and how to do encaustic collage are provided.The book has a products resource guide, a vendor listing and a directory of all the artists featured in the book.The paper in the book is high quality glossy paper. The layout is very nice and the photographs are in full-color. This was very nicely put together.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mixed-media collage. If you love to read about what inspires artists and about people's creative process you will really enjoy this book.On a more personal note...My personal take-away from this book is a feeling of freedom of expression and a desire to go make my own personal style of art. In the past I have felt uncomfortable when I was creating art that was not the current trend, especially after reading certain books or a certain art magazine. Also while doing mail art swaps I have been criticized for making art that is not the hot fad of the day, for using different colors or materials than some people were. I personally don't plan to copy the work of these artists even though there are stepped out directions for five projects. What each of us takes away from a book is unique and that is alright.I also really enjoy reading about what inspires artists and what their creative process is like. I smiled when I read that one artist creates while sitting on her living room floor with images all around her. I prefer more talk of the creative process and inspiration rather than the books that only feature the finished art piece yet leave me wondering, "What was the artist thinking, why did they make that?".
$SUMMARY.: Has a Major Focus on the Creative Process and What Inspires the Artists

$REVIEW.: I am a qualified Nutritionist and Naturopath and I appreciate reading books that are rich in meaningful information, scientifically credible, and at the same time being easy-to-read so I can recommend them to patients where applicable.  This book certainly qualifies on all those counts. I think the other reviewers have covered this book nicely. I read this book after reading "Salt" by Mark Kurlansky which is about the history of salt over the centuries. The 'bottom line' is that many people are not getting enough salt causing dehydration, and this insufficiency of water in the human body has all sort of consequences such as thicker blood (ie blood with high viscosity)and reduced metabolic function caused by low body fluid levels. This can have all sorts of consequences such as fatigue, increased colds and flu's, and hundreds of other ailments. The old line that salt is high in sodium and sodium increases blood pressure is a very simplistic explanation and one wonders how the population was ever duped into believing it.There are three forms of salt. Firstly, there is pure 100% sea salt which is 85% sodium chloride and 15% other minerals, and this is the salt that you can consume with confidence. Secondly, there is white sea salt which is only the sodium chloride part with a tiny bit of trace minerals remaining and the rest of the minerals have been removed and this byproduct rich in minerals is sold separately under the name of Magnesium Oil, Nigari, or the original 'Old English' word Bitterns. The 3rd form of salt is the cheap one we buy in supermarkets that is 100% Sodium Chloride with some added additives to make it free-flowing plus some iodine.To understand the health benefits of salt, you should also understand what Magnesium Oil is, because its the valubale part of ocean salt that gets removed.

$REVIEW.: This is a great WWII-era detective novel, featuring a spunky, kind-hearted American boy as US Army investigator stationed in Europe
Spot-on historical detail, rich in wartime atmosphere and cultural sensitivity, and a great murder mystery


I particularly appreciated James Benn's ability to combine the lighthearted--there is a heist of canned peaches at one point in the novel--with the very serious: central to the plot is a (real, historical) covered-up massacre of [allied] Poles by [allied] Russians
I feel both edified and entertained coming out of this.I hadn't read any of the previous books in the Billy Boyle series when I read this, so I would describe it as able to stand alone, but I liked it so much I intend to go back and read the previous installments in the series.



$SUMMARY.: Lovable WWII GI detective runs amok in London? Peachy.

$REVIEW.: First time in reading this author and discovered her at a event. Love encountering new to me authors after reading description of this one was quite intrigued. Stepping away from my novels dealing mainly in romance one form or another I do like to do on occasion for something different so this fit the bill. Enter the dark side I would say and the road in this one isn't very long but one enjoyed traveling. Boredom is the starting point and what crossed my mind was a saying growing up idle hands devil's playground but in this case it is humans and their greedy little lives.One man's downfall is the beginning of one fallen to take over to do as he pleased but in a big way. This is a excellent build up of what promises to be if this is the intention a good intense series. You are given all the key players and they do play rough. Evil or should I say sin also is rampant and the game is high stakes. Many out of their own darker nature will lose. Of course though evil doesn't always win in this read,towards at the end of it the set back will take place in the battle and the demon doesn't quite win at all. His opponent turns out to be very worthy too. What is written so far very well done. Looking forward to what is written next from this author. Received a arc for a honest review.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the book, but only gave it three stars for a few reasons. First I felt that the character of Jessie was poorly developed making it a struggle to understand her (I.e. she comes on to Noble during a inappropriate time making her seem flighty and sex-driven). I found the action to be good, although Noble functions more like a machine than a man. I struggled with buying the conspiracy, although it did lend itself to encourage me to keep reading. I also could have done without all the cussing, but that's just my personal opinion and it certainly is not as bad as others I have read! Overall I am glad I read it and may give the second book a chance.

$REVIEW.: When Tess meets the man she's been talking to over the internet, her journey into bdsm begins and so does the reader's in The Training of Tess by Tessa Wanton. Make no mistake, this novella is erotica and not erotic romance. The story emphasis is on Tess reaching a place of perfect submission to the man she accepts as her master and is told entirely from Tess's POV.Two things about this novella made it stand out from other bdsm fiction. First, the writing flows beautifully and is almost lyrical in style. It suits the nature of the book, which is to show the joy that Tess finds in submission. The second thing that stood out was how real and authentic the bdsm elements felt. The reader gets the sense that he or she is reading the real deal, and the story packs a wallop as a result.The Training of Tess is probably not everyone's cup of tea. If you're into sweet romances; this probably isn't for you. But for its genre, it's an excellent book.

$review_text.: I&#8217;ve read Through the Wildwood (The Legend of Vanx Malic) so this book immediately went on my &#8220;must read list
 I wasn&#8217;t disappointed at all and am eagerly awaiting Book 4.In this book, the author gives us a very good look at Vanx&#8217;s father &#8211; Captain St


Elm.As before, I found the plot intriguing and the characters are all beautifully crafted.Personally, I find Vanx to be quite likable, albeit a bit rough &#8211; Even after finishing the book, I still find myself grinning at some of his shenanigans.The story opens with Vanx being roused from sleep with news that something is on the roof and his beloved dog has ran out after it
 Vanx then creates a familial link with the dog
 This bit of info alone should make you want this book


 I like when authors add in cool things like familial link as it is different and you don&#8217;t seen it done a lot


 If you are not understanding what I mean, he has linked himself to the dog mentally and is able to see what is going on outside on the roof through his dog&#8217;s eyes (as well as breathe in the same smells as the dog)


 I&#8217;ve come across this occurrence in some fantasy books but not many.If you like books that continue through several books and if you like great fantasy reads- I think it is a no brainer than Vanx Malic should be on your reading list.

$review_text.: As online dating has become more socially acceptable, a growing number of people are using it to find love. The beauty of online dating is that it allows people to screen potential mates while they are not inebriated and fighting for space in a loud, dimly lit room.It allows a woman to patiently evaluate multiple men without being afraid of losing the chance to connect with a man because she might not ever see him again. Most importantly, it allows her to make an informed decision after observing a man's online dating behaviors and checking out his online dating profile.How long does he take to respond to emails? Does he seem to be glued to his computer screen or is he out and about living a productive life? Does he want kids? What kind of a job does he have? These are some of the important questions a woman can answer with certainty after observing a man's online dating behavior patterns and asking him questions about aspects of his online dating profile.But, when men like this book's author write books like &#34;Why you should ask her if she ever stole chocolate&#34;, they ruin online dating for women. Instead of receiving sincere emails from men who are actually intrigued by her, a woman will now receive copy-and-paste emails containing one or more of Lothario's &#34;funny questions&#34; from guys who only email her because she is &#34;hot&#34;.If a woman has her doubts about a certain guy and wants to take some time to figure out if he is worth meeting in person, she should have the right to wait as long as needed to make up her mind. But, that is simply unacceptable for men like Lothario, who clearly wants to run his &#34;wham, bam, and thank you Ma'am&#34; routine on women as quickly as possible.Why else would he advocate that men use subtle pressure tactics to coerce women into meeting them in person sooner than later?Dating in the real world, with its share of pick up artists and &#34;alpha males&#34; is already bad enough. Online dating was one venue that remained relatively untouched by womanizers like Lothario. But now, even online dating sites have become part of this womanizer's playground.If you're a man, don't read this book! If you're a woman and want to understand the mindset of a man who prowls online dating sites just for the sex, read this book.

$review_text.: "First&#894; for some people no amount of evidence, nomatter  how  logically  sound  will  convince  them  of something  they  do  not  want  to be  convinced of."-A quote from the authorBefore I begin, let's all remember that we will tend to agree with people who think like us
With that said, please do not just give me a thumbs down because you want this book to be "good" and believe me to be a "illogical atheist." Here me out as to why I am saying the author of this book is not being rational or transparent.Let us start from the beginning

This book is presented as an analysis of illogical atheist arguments
It is written in a semi-formal style that you find in scholarly journals on library databases such as ebsco
It assumes that the audience is has very little formal training in deductive logic and therefore has detailed historical facts and explanations as to what the author is intending to demonstrate


However, it becomes apparent that the book is not what it appears after a few paragraphs


For example, the quotes, "After my eyes rolled from the back of my skull, it slowly sunk in why Atkins would propose such a preposterous thing, " and "So, the objection that God is improbable because he is complicated and extraordinary is  philosophical garbage which we shall be dealing with when we come to discuss the Dawkinsian fallacy from evolutionism, " are just some of the things that the author says that are irrelevant and unnecessary for a discussion or analysis of any work


The author also goes on to make an insult about people who are politically liberal as well.Now let's examine the actual support and methodology that the author uses for his argument
Mr


Jinn uses deductive reasoning to present his "counter argument" as to why atheism is illogical
Let me use the examples in chapter six

Out of the first four syllogisms that he presents, he only is able to truly dismiss the second premises
He never provides actual reason as to why the other two are wrong
Instead, he goes off into a another story, or a syllogism as he calls it
Effectively, he is guilty of begging the question and also creating a straw man
This is pretty much the way that the entire book is written.So what am I trying to say? The author of this book reveals very little details about his qualifications or background
He does not present evidence as to why a specified argument is illogical, but a way to get around it

If you are truly interested in finding a book on logic or why atheism is illogical, please go read a scholar-review or a journal (they are free)
Alternatively, why not invest time in taking a course or reading a book on abstract logic and then finding the flaws in atheism? There may be many things that are wrong with atheism, but this book and its author are not capable of revealing them.

$review_text.: The Stolen is a book of dystopian fiction in two short stories. I enjoyed author Michelle Browne's excellent writing. Phrases such as "eliminating thought by changing the language," and "my  skin remembers what my mind cannot," conveyed with brevity depths of meaning testifying to her skill, while presenting somber material that did not appear to be a polemic against current society.. The first story, The Fields, is set go-knows-where some time in the future. Clarice is a fighter in a dark, dangerous, depressing dump to which she has been dragged unwillingly. She is one of many ill-treated women forced to be governesses. The totalitarian regime has a long list of instruction for these unlucky ones to learn. They live in dormitories with thin sheets and mattresses that disappear when they are out in the fields weeding the hanfir, or sitting in class, or coping with the awful food. It is obvious that people are being eliminated in the facility, and others are taken to the swamps where anything may happen. The story is frosty, negative, and one asks why it is a Good Idea to write about such stuff. The answer, in part may be in the second story, The Word Thieves, a tale that forcibly reminds one of Orwell's 1984 Its a tale of a far flung empire, with colonies on Mars, Io, and other planets. Sarah White is the equivalent of Orwell's Winston Smith. The characters are busy re-writing literature, for a regime wishing to purify books of sex, anger, and the art of insult. I found it odd that the bosses were called Spiritualists who are among the least fundamentalist religious groups today. Sarah's rebellious spirit is broken, just like Winston. But she has her childhood playmate, Toby, who shares her thinking. and  is part of an unspoken solution to a wretched situation. What fun!

Some parts were completly absurd and , really, immature and crude. I also did not like 4some. We are talking about mates who mate for life. And then f/m/m/m sex scene comes in.and for those who say it was really necesery in this storyline, then 1st, I dont think it was (think of Maggie) and 2nd, this storyline was author's imagination. It just did not fit into 'mating for life' scenario.After 1st book (In plain sight) I added the 3rd book of the series into my must-buy-when-it-comes-out-list but now Im thinking of crossing it off.

$review_text.: It is somewhat difficult to rate this book. On the positive side, the plots move quickly, the book is readable and well researched. On the  negative side, the characters are two dimensional and all too obviously good or bad. The American and Dutch characters are all terrific and glamorous, etc.  I sometimes thought that the book was aimed at older teenagers, it would certainly teach them a lot about the opening months of WWII in the Pacific.I hope that the author will return to this theme. The Netherlands East Indies was a very interesting approach to colonialism and to colonial defense and should easily provide ample material for a real novel, indeed a series of such similar to the ones we have seen about the military and naval side of the British Empire.  The same is true of the US role in the Philippines prior to WWII.

$REVIEW.: **I have received this complimentary book from the author for an honest review** I love this story! This is the continuation of Addison and William's story, it picks up  right after Addison was rescued from Scott Hammons.. the psycho that held her captive? Ya him!.. The looney who scares the ever living crap out of me! I gotta say I am soo infatuated with a fine man named William ..you know him? He's a Billionaire with a FINE a** body, black hair beautiful blue eyes, very persistant? I gotta say I wouldn't mind him following me and being persistent. We find that in this book Addison has even more of a hard time.. she doesn't love her husband , she wants a divorce but is kinda at a standstill. I gotta say I have seen a lot of standoffish personalities and there are reason for people being like that, one can never be too cautious of who you know and who you talk to. I love/hated the William/Addison/Patrick triangle. It just made me want to smack them! I was yelling at my kindle "OH COME ON GROW A PAIR!" yes it is hard .. but to add Patrick's mistress ! If I was William and Michele ( Patrick's mistress) I would be reacting the same way they did. I couldn't get enough of William and Addison's relationship.. Push and pull, push and pull. It's a great story and NEED to find me a William! I love about the book and give it 5 stars! ~Chris

If you want both in one book, look no further than Bad Deeds.I loved Robert Bidinotto's first book, Hunter, and I looked forward to see whether or not he could give us a second book in the series that would continue to develop his interesting hero without trapping Dylan in the very same morality play as the first book. I'm happy to say that Bidinotto accomplished that and more.I think that you would enjoy this book even more if you read Hunter first. This will help you understand how Dylan and Annie met and the development of their romantic relationship. However, even if this is your introduction to the writings of Robert Bidinotto, you will find that this novel stands up by itself.

$review_text.: Bella Kirkwood is used to living the good life in New York City


 As daughter of a famous plastic surgeon, she's grown up expecting to get whatever her little heart desires


 What a shock to find herself uprooted by her parents' divorce and transplanted into an Oklahoma farming community!Life is TOTALLY unfair to this poor little rich girl!  Seriously
 And her snobby attitude certainly does not help her adjust to her new life


 It doesn't take her long to alienate almost everyone in her new family and school


 Poor Bella


 She is so misunderstood, right?Little by little, she begins to see that people have value above and beyond the label on their jeans
 As she learns to become more humble and stops whining so often, she begins to forge real relationships based on trust and respect.Teen girls will identify with Bella's struggles with her parents and her friends, and they will LOVE the author's style!  She manages to capture all the teenage angst with a balance of compassion and humour that will have you laughing out loud.This book is, for the most part, a safe read for teens
 However, I am not going to permit my 13-year-old to read it YET

 It's just a little too grown up for her right now
 Examples: one student is dead from "suicide", another critically injured in a hazing accident, and a third is arrested for drugs

Bella herself is forced to take handfuls of pills as another student tries to murder her

There are secret parties in the woods and some students drink beer from kegs there


 Also, there is mention of "making out" and Bella experiences a kiss that leaves her breathless
 Although Bella and her friends do not drink, smoke, use drugs, or engage in sex, we don't want our daughter reading about these situations at her age.All in all, So Not Happening is a great book for older teens and beyond


 I look forward to the next book about Bella this fall


 I can't wait to see how she adjusts to life in the real world.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the most annoying cookbooks I have ever read.  The chirpy language is relentless.It is good if you want a brief history and rhapsodic prose about every type of organic rice and whole grain commercially available in the US.  The commentary is typically longer than the recipe.On the other hand, if you don't know how you like to eat your oatmeal, this may be the cookbook for you.Example: "As with the cooking of all grains, we all have a way we like our cereal cooked...smooth and loose so it is a homogenous mush, with milk, or a bit stiff, so that the milk is a moat and can be cut into with a spoon.  Open the cover and check the consistency of the cereal, give it a stir with your wooden or plastic paddle...  If it looks too stiff, simply add another 1.4 to 1/2 cup of water or milk.  If it looks too loose, either set for a second porridge cycle...blah blah blah... How to serve your porridge is entirely a matter of personal preference...create a moat of milk, half-and-half, rice milk, soy milk, or oat milk around your hot cereal.  Whatever your choice, it's a good morning to you!"Since it covers on/off and fuzzy logic cookers, the actual recipes often boil down to experimentation: especially for beans and hot cereals ("Continue to tinker...adding or reducing the water about 1/4 cup at a time until your cooker is turning out rice that is perfectly suited to your tastes, jotting down the results...[this is the recipe for plain old rice]").  I could have done that without the cookbook! Recipes are also either for a 10 cup or 6 cup rice cooker, with few conversions, you're mostly on your own to convert.  Don't buy at all if you have a small rice cooker.Most of the recipes are rice based or cereal based; there is a section on steaming that only works with an on/off cooker.I would have much preferred a book that took up 1/20th of my counter space, had 50-100 recipes, and had recipes only for a specific type of rice cooker.  I don't think I can use any of the recipes.

$REVIEW.: Sheriff Bill Crocker, school teacher Summer Dayes and newspaper reporter, Clive Parker--3 people whose lives are inexplicably intertwined in a tale of greed, lust, betrayal and the quest for the truth no matter where it leads.In this Florida panhandle town, Bill Crocker rules like a dictator and thinks of himself as a southern "Tony Soprano" where sometimes you do good things and sometimes you don't. All is going smoothly for the sheriff until a seemingly innocent fender bender becomes the catalyst for the spiral descent of his power. Crocker was drunk when he hit the car and without thinking, he leaves the scene of the accident. When the whole incident is covered up, it piques the interest of reporter Clive Parker. Clive doesn't like people who think they are above the law. The more he researches the dealings of the sheriff, the more he uncovers mistresses, illegal land holdings, embezzlement of funds and corruption at its worst.Ms. Francisco does an excellent job of pulling you into the story from the opening pages when a school girl discovers a body. Who is it and what happened? The story is well-developed and I found her characters realistic, especially Bill Crocker although I didn't find him especially likable. Just when you thought you had everything figured out, the author reveals another piece of the puzzle.  Just how far will Sheriff Bill Crocker fall? If you like a good mystery, definitely 1-click SUNSHINE HIGHWAY.I received this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review.

$review_text.: It started with Mason breaking Claire&#8217;s heart by leaving. She thought they were in the same page after what happened. It was a great night of pleasure and she was sure they shared that connection. But she was wrong.Six months later, Mason was back. He got assigned to go undercover that is pretty much dangerous and speaks a lot about his past &#8211; fighting, women, drugs. Some fighters are turning up dead, and it is Mason&#8217;s job to solve the mystery. Before he goes into the pit hole, he made a stop. He went to California to Claire. He might not come out of the mission alive, and before (or IF) he dies, he wanted her to know about his feelings.AND HE WAS IN FOR THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.Claire moved on with a great guy, Cooper. Although he was near perfect, and even the sex was pretty much amazing, there was still something lacking. He could never spark that intense passion Mason can easily do even with him across the room.NOW THEY ARE GETTING THEIR SECOND CHANCE.But before they get into their happily-ever-after, they must first get out of the mission unscathed and fight their way inside the octagon ring.Here is a girl who really doesn&#8217;t have a lot of drama in her body. She&#8217;s strong, forgiving, and she does what exactly her heart dictates her to do (most of the times). She&#8217;s tough, and stood by her man all throughout the ordeal. She didn&#8217;t even waver when the danger came to her side. All she wanted was for Mason to be alive and safe.I loved her when she gave that second chance to him. She knew what she wanted &#8211; and she grabbed it wholeheartedly. Of course, she needed Mason to crawl a little. Nevertheless, I loved her character.And there&#8217;s Cooper &#8211; he was perfect, but her heart wasn&#8217;t just cut out for him. She had already given it years ago to Mason. I wish he&#8217;d have his own HEA in the near future too!Mason &#8211; he&#8217;s a god! He might have experienced  the bad side of being rich and famous back in his fighting days but he did a 180 after finding out someone close to him is about to die. He cleaned up his ways and joined the police force. Now, he was given a second chance to once again feel that adrenaline-pumping moment inside the ring.I have always loved books about second chances &#8211; and Meant for Me is one great book about it. It&#8217;s not just about having the opportunity about having that second chance in love, but in your dreams as well. This book has taught us to NEVER PASS that opportunity when you are offered that chance at whatever circumstances &#8211; you have already allowed it to pass once, and it has once again being offered to you &#8211; you&#8217;d be a fool to turn it down.The thrill of the chase and the unknown had made this book a page turner for me. Set in dual POV, I fell in love with the plot, the character and the suspense, swoon at Mason and the rest of the fighters, and sigh with envy at Claire to have this great, alpha lover in her bed.&#9733;ARC Copy was given in exchange for an honest review.&#9733;

$REVIEW.: Everyone wants someone in their life to make them feel alive and wanted.  This is especially true when life takes an unexpected turn for the worse.  That's what Harper Somerville is to Bree &#34;Breeze&#34; Delaney - a burst of life, a spark.  At the ripe old age of twenty-two, Breeze was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  With that diagnosis she lost herself.  She lost her spark and had given up on life.Breeze and Harper had been friends since they were children.  Now as adults, they live together - strictly as roommates.  But could they be more than friends?  Breeze had always had a crush on Harper.  She'd assumed he didn't feel the same way, until Harper drunkenly confesses his feelings.  Scared to lose their friendship, Breeze brushes him off.Harper is a well-known Aussie surfer and leaves frequently to go on tour.  When Breeze found out she was sick, Harper was away on a surfing tour.  Harper was shocked when he came home from being away  and saw how frail she was.  Her physical state wasn't the only thing Harper noticed  - he saw just how depressed she was.  The inner glow that he admired in her was gone.  Determined to show her to live again, he all but forces Bree to embark on a road trip through Australia.&#34;Prior to this road trip, every decision Harper had ever made revolved around the ocean with surfing at the forefront of his mind. Now his priorities seemed to have altered somewhat, because of me. I didn't want him giving up on something he loved for me, it didn't feel right.&#34;Harper and Bree's friendship was my favorite part about this novel.  They had that special bond that some of us only get if we're lucky.  They know each other inside and out.  Harper knew how to make Breeze smile, how to make her laugh, and most importantly, how to face her inner demons and learn to just be.  Seeing them together as friends just made me smile.  During their road trip, they played games like, &#34;never have I ever&#34; and &#34;unfortunately/fortunately.&#34;But their trip wasn't all fun and games.  Bree still struggled with her uncertain future and mortality.  Although I've never had to  stare death in the face like Bree had, I was able to empathize with her and better understand what she was going though, like her fear, the stress, and tension in her heart to push away Harper.&#34;I wonder if this is what death is like...Quiet and peaceful.&#34;Right as Harper began to let the fear take hold of her and sink back into the dark abyss she fell into when she was diagnosed, Harper was there to pull her right back out.  Harper's positive energy was infectious.  I loved how Harper was able to take such a weighty subject, such as death, and turn into something way less terrifying.&#34;I don't know about other people, but I believe death is what we make of it. It can be scary and painful or tranquil and calm. I think whatever you learn to embrace in life passes on with you.  Trick is to live a peaceful accepting life so that's what you take away.&#34;Throughout the book I was just waiting for Bree to wake up and smell the coffee.  I understand her hesitation to jump into something with Harper, but COME ON.  This wonderfully caring, sweet, loving and incredibly patient man dropped EVERYTHING for her.  And she STILL was holding back.  I wanted to shake her.  Her reluctance to move forward only added to the tension and I ate it up.&#34;You're going to live, baby girl, and you are going to live with no regrets.  And if you go before me, I want you to know when it's my turn I will find you. I'm going to rock  your afterlife just like I rocked your living life.&#34;Did you catch that?  He calls her baby girl.  I've said this before, but as a general principle I do not like pet names.  However, I make exceptions.  This is an exception.  With Harper's spunky, care-free, and happy personality, I could completely picture him calling her that.  And each time it made me grin.  Yes, Harper is sweet but he's also super hot.  He had me fanning myself multiple times and trust me when I tell you he laid it on thick.&#34;Breeze baby, my nights are filled of dreams where I [screw] you in every conceivable position and in every conceivable place.&#34;Admittedly, I was scared to read this book because based on the synopsis I knew it was going to be a cancer book.  But once I started it, it was way less ugly-cry intense.  The highlight of this book was Harper and Breeze's chemistry and connection.  They were perfect for each other in every single way and, like puzzle pieces, they just fit.This book was a strong 4-star read for me up until the last 20% when the &#34;conflict&#34; occurred.  What happened in terms of the conflict did not work for me.  I felt like it was a bit unnecessary and took away from the rest of the book.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to share the love and knit a jumper for my husband. The problem was... finding a pattern he liked! He is so unbelievably fussy. There are a lot of patterns for men out there which look really nice to me but not to him!!!So I was intrigued by the promise that this book contained patterns that "he will wear".I thouroughly read the psychological guidelines and these were great help and worked a charm. My husband decided he liked the pattern on the book cover. The next thing was the yarn, but that's another story.... I don't know if all men are like this (I only have one husband) but if they are, you are in for quite a bit of a process in deciding what pattern to knit for him.I now realise I don't have to feel guilty about knitting lots for myself and very little for my husband. He is too fussy with patterns. We agreed one jumper per year. The important thing is that he actually wears what I knit for him with love.The book delivers on it's promise and goes into details on how to approach a reluctant man when proposing to knit something for him. A very valuable insight into men's knitwear psychology.

The first few chapters will have all readers swooning over him! Every single thing he did in this book had my stomach fluttering, and head tilting dreamily. I enjoyed reading more into Molly and Drakes story. I got some good laughs with Mollys pregnancy mood swings and bluntness. Molly and Drakes relationship matures and changes in different ways right before your eyes, you feel how much they care for their children and the people important in their lives. It was brilliant to bring back a previous villain. I didn't expect that, and I love surprises! It was kind of bittersweet to see this series end, but I think Brooke left everything resolved as well as added the perfect HEA for Molly and Drake! I love that Michael got his as well, love that man!

$review_text.: Every now and then a book comes along that reminds a person of why they love reading so much.  The Interestings is such a book.We are introduced to six strong characters -- three girls, three boys.  In 1974 they meet at a summer camp for teenaged incipient artists, one that nourishes the creative impulse.  Does such a place exist?  One in which hopeful dancers, animators, French horn players and dulcimer hammerers thrive together?  Not important.  It's the familial closeness that is spotlighted here, exemplified by these six.  But focus is on Julie, transmorphed into Jules on the very first night.  Who seems at first to have no obvious artistic talent, but is accepted immediately for her surprising wit and likability.  The genius of this book is that although from the beginning each of the six is a well defined character, several are relegated to supporting, if pivotal, roles.  This isn't one of those sagas attempting to show the passage of recent eras employing six narratives and their divergent paths. Not following quite a linear storyline, the novel offers insights from future perspectives, the strengths of the histories woven into a pattern of codependence and support.  Secrets are revealed, not as mysteries, but as indicators that inform the interrelationships between the major characters and others.  The role of art plays out with various levels of success, but it is the inner lives that carries the important threads of the story.  Highly recommended.

Some positive quote books can come across as a little too sugary or syrupy and don't make the connection back to real life application.  This book however provides great inspirational quotes, a brief narrative and best of all, a thought provoking, affirmation to take forward into our daily living.  While I'd recommend this book for everyone, if you follow a New Thought approach to life/spirituality this book will surely resonate with you.

 Jonah is wonderful, a gentleman that loves deeply, and makes you wish that you new a man just like him

 The children will steal your heart, and the rest of the characters will keep you chuckling to the end

 Penny's way of adding prayer and scripture is just right

 Woven into the story in such a real way she gives just enough of each!  I love the way the story line progresses and the action is paced flawlessly


 This book will take you to the edge of temptation, love, and possible sadness!I can't wait to read Hailee and see where Penny will take us next!

$REVIEW.: I'm really on the fence about this book.  As a plot on its own, it's pretty good.  Not fantastic because I didn't read it again after I finished it, but still pretty good.  However, would I have ever even considered this book if it wasn't classified as a Pride and Prejudice variation?I read this book when it was published as free fanfiction.  I enjoyed it at the time, but again, it was not something that I ever returned to to read again.  Why?  Because it's not really Pride and Prejudice or even Jane Austen.  Or, it certainly isn't the Jane Austen that wrote Pride and Prejudice or Emma.  Maybe, just maybe, it's similar to the Jane Austen that wrote Mansfield Park.  So, in this regard, I completely agree with Sam's review that this is not a Pride and Prejudice variation.But opinions differ on what is and is not fanfiction so, enough about that.  Even if I were to review this book as just coincidentally having characters named Elizabth, Darcy, Caroline Bingley, etc., it is only just mediocre because the book does not fall neatly into any one category.  It's not classic literature because classic literature doesn't deal with this type of plot.  It's not modern regency romance because, well, it's just not really romantic enough to qualify as such.  So then, you have this almost strange situation where Elizabeth and Darcy are kidnapped, their captor is really a diamond in the rough who just needs to be given a chance and who also immediately falls head over heels in love with Elizabeth, Elizabeth herself seems to have some lingering feelings for hiim (to the point where 10 and 40 years down the road Darcy is still insecure), Darcy and Elizabeth start engaging in some canoodling, and then Elizabeth does what can only be found in fanfiction: the great sacrifice otherwise known as, I am going to face great shame and society's disapproval regardless of what that may mean for the rest of my family just so that I can spare Darcy any further humiliation.So, I guess this does just go back to fanfiction, except the fundamental characters behind Elizabeth and Darcy have been changed to the extent that I just see this as real Pride and Prejudice variation.

$REVIEW.: the chapters of this book read like a who's who of international development

 there are many outstanding authors

 the book approaches the issue of development from a number of perspectives - first-hand accounts, workers, experts, leaders

 the chapters are written masterfully


 they seem meant to inspire
 they provide just enough information to get us started but not enough to see us through


 for that, there are hundreds of other books


 combination of development and evangelical christianity has a long history and it ought not surprise anyone that that the introduction was penned by one of the biggest-selling evangelic ministers in history
 i think that it is an excellent book, well written, an easy read, and quality
 if you read it and it works, you'll want to next be asking, "what can i do?"

$REVIEW.: This is book one by a great new author. The story of young love can be hard to keep believable but in this book it is done effectively. Both characters come to the story with a sad history. Grace has lost her parents and Ian is abused by his father. The story covers a few years of their lives. This is not a book for the faint of heart as mature subject matter is dealt with. I truly loved the writing style and feelings this story created for me. I look forward to whatever comes next in this series.

We get to sit on the sidelines & be entertained by these flawed yet real to life characters. Some seem to have forgotten what a desperate broken heart feels like. Let the drama begin!! You go Shanda... don't take it no more! Loved the Shanda/Selange tag outing. Especially Geo's response. Gotta love a man that thinks he can do whatever he want just cause he's a Don. I just love Geo & Alfonzo! Yes... and even Nico. Lot's of action in this volume that kept me engaged right to the end. This is another powerful read and I can't wait for the release of Volume X11.

$REVIEW.: I wish I could find the right words for this book. For how it made me feel. For how the words on each page evoked such emotion that they burned my soul. For how I dreaded yet yearned each turn of the page because I didn't want it to end, but I needed more of their love.Profound. That is what this book is. This isn't just a story about the so called forbidden love amongst a lost girl and her equally as lost male teacher. No, this story is about the true, soul searing love between two people who found each other when they needed each other the most. The true meaning of soul mates.The sorrow and utter despair each feels due to the events in their lives just breaks your heart. But don't worry, the love between Ashlyn and Daniel will put it back together. Not without bumps in the road though...Do yourself a favor and read Loving Mr. Daniels. You need to.

$REVIEW.: The novel is more than a romance - A truly unique story with unforgettable people
Half way through I found myself cheering for them as if they were friends of mine.The writing is  excellent and full of detailed information on the people and places


The love scenes are delectably passionate and always move the plot forward.What was so interesting for me is the mother and adult daughter had tremendous issues in their past and the character of Chris was a rock when it came to her relationship with both women


 Everyone would like to have a friend or relative like Chris
 Chris isn't superhuman and has her own share of problems but she hangs tough and the novel comes to a beautiful conclusion.Do not miss reading this novel - when I finished reading it the first time all I could say was 'WOW'.

$review_text.: IN A NUTSHELL: A TRUE STORY ABOUT THE MIND SET OF A DESPERATE JAPANThe book is a short, easy, and an interesting read for most people acquainted with naval construction and operations. It is broken into two distinct parts; the construction of the ship [under a cloak of extreme secrecy], and its short life as one of a class of two, of the most extreme battleship designs ever constructed. Both the designs of the ships and the mindset of the navy that ordered them are interwoven and born of a need to somehow prevail over a greatly superior adversary. In that light, this book is fascinating as it reveals this rather empirically. In reading "Battleship Musashi", I felt and empathized with the Japanese of the era by witnessing [through the written accounts] some of the motivations and experiences of the Japanese people during the period. Many of the goals that were to be achieved with this new class of vessel embodied the rather unique hopes and ideas that the Japanese people had at the time, compared to westerners. This book stresses these cultural themes in the context of the construction and destruction of an incredible symbol of Japanese Imperial power.Though I would have preferred reading more detailed accounts of the design criteria and ship operations, it was a fast and worthwhile read. In the end, the invincible Battleship Musashi shared the same fate as the rest of the Imperial Japanese Empire, and this book is a requiem to both.

$review_text.: Ok, so here's the deal..I actually read this book before the first book in the series. Matt and Leah's story was a bit more appealing to me and my instinct was right. Not that I didn't like the first book, but Waiting on Forever had a better flow and the character development was much stronger.Here's what I liked about Leah: she's smart, a bit sassy, and honest. I appreciated the fact that while she did have a mad crush on Matt, she didn't bow down to him just because he was a star athlete. She definitely put him in his place a time or two. I also like that Leah came from a 'normal' family. It was a nice change from all the issues books I read. Not to say there aren't issues here, but at least one part of the couple was relatively happy/healthy/stable.Now to Matt. I really loved Matt. He's such a sweet guy. He's this big time star athlete at the university, but he doesn't act like a typical jock kind of guy. When he first met Leah, he was a bit timid. He wanted her to see him as more than just an athlete. So, he pursued her! Yes, pursued. It was adorable. I loved the flirting between the two. Matt and Leah had a great connection.Where's the drama, you ask? Well, Matt's past is a bit rocky. Not that he was bad or anything, but his mother had been an addict. She gave him up to his grandparents right after he was born. They raised him for most of his life, but died right before he finished high school. The significance to this fact is that  it has made Matt a bit guarded. He's never really had a relationship with a girl. But, with Leah he feels like he's found someone special. And when his mom re-enters his life, Leah is there by his side.Overall, I thought Waiting on Forever was a sweet story. I loved that the nerdy girl got the star athlete, but it was much more than that. Matt and Leah complimented each other well. And I will tell you tell you that there were some really great steamy moments too! If you're looking for quick, sweet read that has a little spice...check this one out.Quote:~Pulling his lips aways from mine, but still close enough where I can feel his breath on my face, he softly whispers, "That was so frickin amazing."I'm not sure what he's referencing, the perfect game I just bowled or the kiss we just shared. Even though bowling a perfect game is frickin amazing as hell, I'd pick our kiss ten times over if asked which felt better. -Loc 716

Circle City: Lord of the Wolfen is a new series by Author Alisha Paige who brings many worlds of paranormal together in this action packed and quick paced book.Axl and Zoe go through a quick whirlwind romance that you attribute to "Love at first Sight".  The sexual tension and release will leave you squirming in your seat and ready for a cold shower.The plot line is deep and the twists and turns of the book will keep you wondering how things will happen and how it will end.This book is not for the faint at heart or young adult reader. It is a true adult novel with adult situations, explicit sexual details and is very open about drug use. While it might not be for all audiences, it is a good read and intricate story and anyone with an open mind will enjoy the start of this series.I look forward to seeing what happens in the future Circle City series.

$REVIEW.: He's big, he's bad, and he's dirty, which is exactly opposite of what wolf shifter Candace Jace wants in a mate. Candace is borderline OCD and the victim of a cheating ex, she now has her life in a some sort of order and everything about bear shifter Trace Dakota off sets her carefully controlled world.Owner of a bar, Trace had not expected to meet his mate at this point. A bad marriage and left Trace with strict rules when it came to women, one night stands and that is it. He knows his mate is Candace and even though it is difficult for his bear, he is taking his time to woo her as much as a Harley riding bad boy can.Very fun read, I liked that they are polar opposites and Trace is pure alpha. You can easily understand Candace's reluctance as Trace is very vocal about his wants an needs. Look forward to more in this series.

We don't have to listen to those little ole demons telling us bad things about ourselves.  If you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, you are totally forgiven for anything you have done or will do.  When you know this and receive that forgiveness you are totally cleansed and want to live right for God.  Never feel defeated again.  Read the devotional every day and be renewed each day.  He has risen and we are forgiven, healed, saved, and are the Righteousness of God in Jesus Christ.

$review_text.: I loved this book.  It was a shorter book than most but that&#8217;s what part of the appeal was.  It was what I call a &#8220;day read&#8221;.  You can sit down in the morning and start reading it and have it done by supper time.  It wouldn&#8217;t be that easy if the plot wasn&#8217;t good, though.  It was compelling, fast moving and exciting.  Once I started it, I didn&#8217;t want to put it down.The characters were all strong and interesting and I did want to know what was going to happen to them.  But what I liked best was Finn, who is the hero of the book and it&#8217;s not necessarily him that I liked so well but the fact that he was an Alpha male werewolf and the author let him be a leader.  Lyra was content to let Finn lead and actually be a man.  She never got into a power struggle with him and that&#8217;s what kept me reading.  I like books where men are allowed to be men and the women don&#8217;t have more brass than the men.  Lyra, a vampire, is a force unto herself for sure and she and Finn worked together to get back their daughter, Vega but she let him lead and be an Alpha.  Sorry ladies, but we don&#8217;t always have to dominate our men and Lyra didn&#8217;t try it with Finn and I loved that part of the story.If you&#8217;re looking for a sexy book, this probably isn&#8217;t going to be to your liking.  It has some sex in it but it&#8217;s not wild, kinky or &#8220;out there&#8221;. It can get kind of hot, I guess but the story about getting Vega back and the love story that got Lyra and Finn together in the first place carried the book.  There was no need for a lot of graphic sex and frankly, I&#8217;m glad there wasn&#8217;t a lot in there.  Too much can ruin an otherwise good book.On another note, I guess I would have liked to know how Lyra survived without her coven after her brother first kicked her out.  Maybe a little flashback would have worked.  It was understood that it was very difficult for her but I would have liked to known more. I think it would have been interesting to know how Finn and Lyra came to really know each other.  They met in a shifter bar, yeah and it was love at first sight, yeah but how did the rest of it come together?  It would have made for a longer book but maybe a prologue would have been okay or something.That being said, this book was fantastic.  I loved it all.  I just hope there isn&#8217;t a sequel because I am so tired of reading book series and having to chase down the next book.

$REVIEW.: the story of surviving alone on the road home was encouraging to read. Kyle shows his weaknesses that many would experience but also shows strength of character and determination. The author tended to go into a little too much detail at times and I felt there needed to be a stronger element of danger but I would still recommend the book. no foul language to deal with is a plus.

$REVIEW.: Once in a while, an exceptional book comes along that breaks all sorts of rules, perseveres until it gets itself published, and once published,stands out like a jewel.This is one of those books.Behind every great rule-breaking book is an author who knows deep down, her story deserves to be published because it is the exception to the rules.What rules?There's a ton of them. But I'm going to talk about three rules which Kary Rader's book broke.1# Don't write about depressing topics.Kary's main characters are dying from cancer. 17yr old Taylor has leukemia. Her mentor, 25 yr old Gavin has Stage 5 Melanoma. Both are on short time clocks that do not mesh with our current social perceptions of right and wrong.Taylor wants to make love to a young man before she dies. She's been robbed of her dreams and her future. But she's not dead yet and she wants to experience Life and Love in the short time remaining.Gavin wants someone to love and miss him when he dies. It's bad enough cancer will take his life in less than two years, but the idea he could disappear and no one would notice or care tears at him. He desperately needs his life to have meant something to someone.Which brings us to  Rule #2:2# Absolutely no sexual relationships may occur between teens and adults.At the beginning of the book, Taylor is a very mature 17, two weeks from her 18th birthday.Gavin is a 25yr old computer genius. Admitted to college at the age of 14, he missed his normal teenage years, thus now he's a mix of teen and man.To me, Taylor seems the most mature of the two. But mental maturity doesn't come into play with social mores. The publishing rule in this matter is very strict, and most publishers won't break it, even when the characters have extenuating circumstances, such as if they wait, they'll be dead.Gavin tries to do the right thing and deny the love that has formed between them, but Taylor refuses to waste the little life she has left obeying rules written for people who would live another fifty years. And this precious young woman is a force to be reckoned with when she wants something. One day after she turns 18, they marry.Then there is a third brick wall that Kary hurdles:#3 Thou shalt not bear a child to save a parent's life.Honestly, I cannot imagine anyone who reads this story would object to this particular situation.  But that is due to Kary's adept handling of the matter making the child a gift from God and a blessing on their union, rather than a last ditch effort to save her life.How did Kary break through all these walls?A Taylor Made Life is  real, authentic, and goes straight to the heart. I dare anyone to try and read this book without falling in love with both main characters.Or bawling your eyes out near the end.So grab a boat load of tissues and ready yourself for a beautiful--yet horrible,tragic--yet uplifting ,endearing--yet devastating journey through this authentic love story of triumph.And if you can't guess, I give this book 5 stars

$REVIEW.: This is a story rich in detail of custom and lifestyle at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The author's inspiration was the newspaper story of a young woman who was a stowaway on a vessel that sailed from Antwerp to New York. Blinkert's imagination fleshes out the heroine and several others who could have been onboard. The reader is allowed inside the staterooms and lives of the first class passengers. We read the menus, survive the storm, and walk the decks as the privileged share their secrets, fears and romances.Just as many foreign films end without the neat and tidy resolutions American audiences are comfortable with, so too this story will leave the reader with a desire for resolution. Life is seldom neatly wrapped up, and so the author bridges the span between fiction and fact.

$review_text.: Deadstock's title is the first hint that the sci-fi noir universe of Punktown is an unsettling one. The nightmarish possibility of headless, limbless vat-grown meat clones has become a reality, a thriving industry that's as lucrative as it is cutthroat. A petty feud between the offspring of John Fukuda of Fukuda Bioforms and Adrian Tableau of Tableau Meats transforms into a full-blown war, with the shapeshifting Jeremy Stake at its center.Stake is a gumshoe in the traditional noir mold, complete with porkpie hat.  He is also a mutant who unconsciously transforms to resemble the person of whomever he's focusing on. This considerable talent is put to good use in tracking down the lost bioengineered doll of Fukuda's daughter, Yuki.  Stake's history as a war veteran haunts him with every step, including a woman from another dimension he still pines for.In what at first seems like a separate narrative, Javier is a gang leader of the Folger Street Snarlers who at 25 years old is past his prime. He comes to Steward Gardens to look for a missing gang member and friend, Brat.  The Snarlers eventually becomes trapped, along with a rival mutant gang, in a technological house of horrors.On the surface, this is a noir thriller complete with faceless monsters, ray guns, and aliens.  But peel back a layer and author Jeffrey Thomas has so much more to offer.  There's an overarching theme here about the capacity for someone to love while at the same time recognizing that dependence on another necessarily means a dilution of self.  Stake struggles with all his relationships, unsure of everything about himself except for his love of a prisoner from a long forgotten war.  Fathers struggle with their daughters' independence, bioforms struggle with separation anxiety from their owners, and even weary gang leaders find love in surprising places.  Through it all, each character is challenged as to who they really are - and if the sacrifices they made for love were ultimately worth it.Thomas deftly balances the weird setting of Punktown with the basest human emotions: of love, jealousy, and violent rage.  Deadstock is perhaps best summed up by a brilliant invention that still creeps me out just thinking about it: Ouija phones.  These phones just might tap into the wavelengths of the dead, who can barely communicate anything but a sense of urgency and loss.  Deadstock begins and ends with these phones.  In the end, the only thing we have left of a person's passing is the love we felt reflected back at us.  Thomas leaves his characters, and the reader, haunted.  And that's a good thing.

$REVIEW.: If you you are anything like me, you love carbs.  With that in mind - what could be better than having a delightful snack consisting of Biscotti, granola bars or popcorn - and actually have them help you lose weight?  No, I'm not kidding. The Serotonin Power Diet is designed to teach you about healthy eating - including "timing" your carbohydrate snacks so they can work for, not against, you and your weight.  Here's why.Longtime friends, Dr. Judith J. Wurtman and Dr. Nina Frusztajer Marquis, made a fascinating discovery. Through years of laboratory research at MIT, clinical studies in weight loss and private practice, they noticed, most people - especially women - gained large amounts of weight after taking antidepressants and mood stabilizing drugs. Their passion for understanding the brain's role in controlling appetite led them to locate the nucleus of "emotional triggers" that cause weight gain.  Turns out the neurotransmitter, serotonin, (or lack thereof) is one of the most important variables in both weight gain and depression, according to their findings.What exactly is serotonin?  In laymen's terms: It's the chemical that gives your brain and your body a happy satisfied feeling.  It also, according to authors Wurtman and Marquis, is the "switch that turns off your appetite." Imagine it - a switch that puts you in control of your weight loss!  How to give your brain the serotonin boost it needs? Eating a timed carbohydrate snack before each meal. It's music to this carb-lovers ears!Authors Wurtman and Marquis remind us that sure we will lose weight quickly on any of the new fancy low-carbohydrate diets, however, most of that weight is water.  Once the water has been removed, the body will seek to metabolize precious muscle for fuel.  High protein diets also deprive our bodies of the feel good mood elevator serotonin - resulting in both both depression and carbohydrate cravings.  This can lead to unhealthy overeating. Authors Wurtman and Marquis do give us the solution, yet be advised - it is not a quick fix.  Their Serotonin Power Diet is a 12-week weight loss initiation program, one that will help you lose 1-2 pounds each week without sacrificing muscle.  In fact you will be building muscle which, in turn, burns lots of calories and fat - even at rest.  Their program is designed to help you feel great and keep the weight off forever - It's a lifestyle.In my opinion "lifestyle change" is what is missing in most of the quick fix diet programs out there.  In my mind - it needs to be recognized that to change patterns and to live healthy is a lifestyle.  The Serotonin Power Diet follows this principle.  It shows you that you can eat and lose weight without need for depravation, meal skipping or dangerous high-protein diets.  The three phase approach it offers, will help you to create a healthy new lifestyle.  Too, once you've lost the weight, authors Wurtman and Marquis take you into a maintenance phase that helps you keep your new body for good!What's more, authors Wurtman and Marquis understand that healthy weight loss doesn't happen in a vacuum. You will need to exercise! They understand that weight loss and exercise work in tandem to achieve lifestyle goals.  And to stay healthy, you will need to work an exercise routine into your weekly program.  For this reader, The Serotonin Power Diet is a wellspring of healthy cooking ideas and delicious recipes.  It can help you work toward finding your bodies' natural instincts and using the power of your mind to work for you.The Serotonin Power Diet will be even more effective for those who have:-Tried low carb dieting and found themselves heavier than they were before they started-Are looking for a lifestyle program that will help them lose weight in a healthy way and be happy about it-Been using antidepressants and found that they've gained weight even though they were naturally slim beforeThe three best things about The Serotonin Power Diet in my opinion are:One: This book is helpful for the scores of people who have found themselves on antidepressants and have gained weight as a result.  Authors Wurtman and Marquis show us how to take control over our own minds and change the way we think, as well as describe an eating program that supports a positive thought process.Two:  There is a significant portion of the book dedicated to overcoming the "excuses" associated with exercise and proper eating programs.  The Serotonin Power Diet focuses on helping its reader overcome the psychological roadblocks to healthy eating and lifestyle changes.  My how we sabotage ourselves before we've even begun!  This book helps you to overcome the excuses your critical mind conjures up and gets you right down to the business of first losing weight - then maintaining your new slim and fit figure for life.Three:  I absolutely love that authors of The Serotonin Power Diet discuss and devote a significant portion of the book to exercise and creating an exercise plan in conjunction with healthy eating.  They recommend just 30 minutes each day! There is simply no better way to get healthy and stay slender that I know of.  It surprises me that very few of the latest and greatest programs marry exercise with weight loss - thank you Drs. Wurtman and Marquis.A Final Note:  The Serotonin Power Diet is a must for anyone looking to lose weight and keep it off.  Simply by reading this book you are giving yourself a great education about the body and will have all the tools you need to get off the "dieting" treadmill.  It is a roadmap showing you both where you need to go and how to get there. And once you have arrived, you'll simply enjoy the new view.

It makes even a novice realize the time and intelligence and care that went into the creation of our country's greatest document.

$REVIEW.: This book surprised me with its layout and content. It took me way back to my days as a kid when I would get to go to Fenway Park.  The book has three main literary features.First of all, you can read the "kid level" language to a young child to help them learn the alphabet and absorb a bit of information about the Red Sox and their home field. Second, there are ample, well drawn, colorful illustrations to augment your reading to the child by having pictures to use to point out some details. Third, and here is where the book gets interesting, there are paragraphs on every page that contain facts of interest to Red Sox fans and all baseball fans. So, as an adult, you can read to a child while also enjoying the book yourself.  As a teen or a ball player in grade school, you can enjoy the book on its own merit.Here are a few examples of things you will learn from this book. What uniform number was retired by every team in major league ball and who last played under that number?  What is the ground rule should a ball get stuck behind the ladder on the high wall in Fenway Park?  What is the "triangle" in Fenway Park?  How old is Fenway Park?  How many people can it hold?  Why is there one red chair in the bleachers? So, while the book is pricey for its size, it is also unique and makes a fine gift and addition to the library of a baseball fan, especially a Red Sox fan of any age. You'll watch a Red Sox game with a new perspective after you read this book and it is loaded with little topics to help enhance any baseball discussion. You'll also pose a threat in a baseball trivia game.

$review_text.: Bug Out Bag Book: A Quick BOB Guide on How to Make the Ultimate Bug out Bag by Robert Reinoehl is for those who know little to nothing about assembling a BOB. The book is well written and organized in a logical manner. My issue with this book is that it lacks any insight or product recommendations. Providing specific product recommendations or choices would significantly help point the reader in a direction when it comes time to purchase a product. Like many books in this genre there are lists of what to put in your bag but unfortunately there is little in the form of specific product recommendations or information as to why one product is a better choice then another. This type of insightful information would significantly provide more utility to the reader than just providing a list of what to put in your BOB. If you have any experience with BOB's this book will not offer you anything new.Overall Assessment:Bug Out Bag Book: A Quick BOB Guide on How to Make the Ultimate Bug out Bag by Robert Reinoehl is written for those who want to assemble a BOB and are just getting started. The book fails to go into any detail so further research on your part will be required especially when deciding which specific products to put in your gear set up. For those who have even a basic understanding of a bug out bag this book will not provide any new or insightful information. All of the information presented in this book is available for free on the internet.A book that I do recommend is:Realistic Bug Out Bagby Max Cooper.

$review_text.: The first time I read the description of this book "a romantic short story about two people who fall deeply for each other, without ever seeing one another" I thought 'Wow! How can 2 people fall in love with each other and yet never see each other before?As I read the preview version on Amazon website, I got more intrigued with the book as I am a fan of dialogue type of books. Maybe because I find myself imagining I'm the character in the book as I read the dialogues and immerses myself in the storyline.I like the concept of this book (though it may not be logical since the 2 characters never see each other and this book does not seem to be bothered much with factors like time, season, weather and so on) where the 2 characters just chatted about everything, the openness and honesty with each other and the way they complimented each other with sincerity.In page 7: "You shouldn't speak if you don't want to. Silence is fine. It is easy to find people with whom you can talk, but it is much harder to find somebody who enjoys staying together in silence." Wow! This sentence is so so touching! I don't know about you but I think this line pretty much sums up how a relationship should be as we grow old together with our spouse. Not necessary that we should talk and talk to fill the silence but just being there for each other and enjoying the moment.A wonderful book to read that brings a smile to my face as it makes me reminisce the early days of being in love with my special someone aka my hubby!

$REVIEW.: In London, Italian Immacolata Borelli attends school for a degree in accounting.  When she learns of the death of her best friend Marianna Rossetti from leukemia, Immacolata flies to Naples to attend the funeral.  However, Marianna's grieving raging parents treat her with scorn even spitting on her.  They blame their daughter's death on the Borelli crime family that belongs to the vicious Camorra network of families; her kin controls Naples whose trucks dumped toxic material in the fields and waters.Immacolata is traumatized by the experience and believes redemption is in order for her implicit failure to acknowledge the harm her family causes.  She returns to London where she calls the Palace of Justice in Naples offering her services as an informant turning in her family.  Speciale Investigator Mario Castrolami works the Camorra case; he understands the danger Immacolata will face as the mob will kill anyone who betrays them; collateral damage being acceptable.  On the other hand Immacolata failed to consider her English boyfriend Eddie Deacon a teacher; as ruthless "Il Pistole" enforces the mob rules, which means killing any informer even the daughter of a cherished leader.This is a great suspense thriller as the reader anticipates with each spin an OK Corral confrontation on the streets of Naples and perhaps London.  Fast-paced with a strong cast on all sides of the law, Immacolata makes the tale as the title character who expects to die but believes she is finally doing the morally correct thing.Harriet Klausner

$review_text.: Carolyn Hart's life is one gigantic mess. She's never been able to figure out what she truly wants to do in life. She's flitted from one potential career to another, with her affluent father footing the bill -- until now. Carolyn is a shopaholic, constantly putting herself in credit card hell from impulse buying on the Home Shopping Channel. She can't bear to run to her father for yet another bailout, but on a teacher's aide salary, what other option does she have? Her boss has the perfect answer: Carolyn will write a children's book as a fundraiser for the school. It seems like a quick way to earn some needed cash, but Carolyn's unfiltered remarks put her on the short end of the negotiating stick simply to keep her job.Enter Mason Dixon, an eccentric cartoonist/artist with a bristly attitude. He's been drafted as illustrator for the children's book Carolyn is expected to write. It's a favor to pay back his aunt, who is one of the school's benefactors.  Mason has no use for elementary school teachers with no creative passion, and that's exactly how he pegs Carolyn at their first meeting.Carolyn is caught in the middle. She can't afford to turn down this little job, but she also takes an instant dislike to moody, broody Mason. They have what's left of the summer to write and illustrate this book, so the two end up sharing a small cabin out in the middle of nowhere to get this thing done.  Somewhere along the way, some major chemistry begins to build.The relationship between these two is a series of stumbles and saves as each tries to make sense of their situation and lives, before their time together runs out. Prejudices and preconceptions are shattered along the way, until Carolyn's penchant for spending more than she makes ensnares Mason. Will it be enough of a wake-up call for her to recognize she has a serious problem and needs help? And will Mason drop out of her life forever because of what she's done to him?Carolyn and Mason are great characters. They have a lot hiding inside their skins.  I wish the book had been longer, to reveal more about them, to play up Carolyn's addiction and Mason's &#34;disabilities&#34; more.

$review_text.: Heading Out to Wonderful takes place in the tiny town of Brownsburg, Virginia, population 500 in 1948.  It's a town where no very much happens, where people go about their business, most everyone knows one another and life is simple and relatively peaceful.  It's also a period of time in the South where even a talented seamstress, like Claudie Wiley, an intelligent black woman with plenty of money, knows the protocol of letting the white women get in front of her in line at the local market.So when a handsome newcomer shows up in town with a couple of suitcases, one with set of butcher knives, imported from Germany, and the other suitcase full of money, he's bound to stand out a bit. The stranger is 39 year-old Charlie Beals.  One day Charlie is a hero in the townspeople's eyes when he saves a young boy from drowning. People welcome him, and given the fact that he worked as a butcher before, he even finds a job with the local butcher Will Haislett. It is here at the market where Charlie meets all of the local people, and becomes a hero-like figure to Will's young son, Sam. Charlie enjoys the boy's company as well, and lets the boy tag along, but a handsome man like Charlie needs some female companionship as well, and when he first sets eyes on a beautiful young girl named Sylvan, he's hooked.Sylvan Glass is the very young bride of the richest and meanest man in town, Boaty Glass. Boaty purchases his young bride from Sylvan's father knowing his farm is failing and he needs money desperately. Sylvan, has bigger dreams of fancy clothes, is obsessed with Hollywood, movies and a glitzy kind of life.  For Charlie, Sylvan's a girl who deserves all this, and he has the money to buy land and other things for her. However, a pursuit like this seems destined to turn out bad.  The two begin an intense affair -- witnessed by a little boy (Sam) who doesn't understand what is going on.The story is told by Sam, who is now an old man, recalling his childhood and the sadness surrounding it. It's a story of love, betrayal and the vulnerability of children. The story is dark and foreboding, and is told in a way that compels the reader to read a few pages more than they planned and then another few pages as well.  The ending had the WOW factor for me, but some reason I felt like the third person narrator wasn't right for this story.  Although the writing is very good, at least with the audio version, parts felt somewhat sappy at times.  Despite this it is a book worth reading if you don't mind a sad sad story.3.5/5 stars

$review_text.: This is the first in a series of books by Jenna Kay Pridgen. It is the story of one man, Jeff Craner. Jeff seems to think he has it all successful career as a Lawyer, the almost perfect girlfriend (if she would just give up on her belief in the fantasy of God), money and prestige. To top that off he is about to win the most difficult case of his career.  Then the unthinkable happens and it all is snatched away. How you ask? Read this book to find out.I really enjoyed this book both as a reader and a pastor. It is very reminiscent of a Randy Alcorn novel. Mrs. Pridgen has crafted a story that through Four different Points of View shows us how the world of the Spirit Realm interacts on a daily basis with ours.  Reading the tale from the side of  a guardian angel and a demon was very eye opening.  As a pastor and teacher of spiritual warfare I must say this book will inform you and help you grow while being entertaining at the same time. I look forward to reading other books in this series.

$REVIEW.: Just when you think there is nothing more to add to the story Terri Anne Browning finds away.  Would have to say this is one of my favorites in the whole series.  I love how it captures the sensitivity of a rocker when it comes to the birth of their child but in the same aspect catches the sexiness of being a rocker.  I absolutely love this series, you can pick up just one book and read it and know the story without reading the rest of the series, but I would strongly advise against that as each book in the series is amazing.

$REVIEW.: First, I would like to extend a heartfelt "Thank you" to John Busaker and his publisher for sending me a copy of "Fully Engaged: how to DO less and BE more" to review for them. I am truly grateful for this generosity. I really appreciate the time, effort and expense it takes to make a reviewer copy available to me."Fully Engaged: how to DO less and BE more" by John Busacker may be a small volume and an easy read, but it is one of the most challenging personal growth books to hit bookstore shelves in quite some time. According to the author, there are three key components by which life is marked: awareness, alignment and action. Systematically, Busacker takes the reader on a journey through these three intertwining lands to develop a clear, concise and measurable strategy for living that is bound to lead to greater satisfaction and impact.Each chapter ends with a series of workbook exercises to help the reader discern his or her priorities and develop a tactical plan for living more deliberately. This is a wonderful book that I will recommend often and revisit to re-evaluate my own life.

$REVIEW.: **I was provided a copy of this ebook free from the author for honest review**Wow!  The first book in this series was good, but this one was fantastic!  All the characters we met in the first Coffin Girls book are back, but this time Sophie - the empath - takes the reins to tell her story.  This book pulled me in from the start and just took off.  It was exciting and romantic, and the visuals that were invoked in the writing were stunning.  Also, the editing was much improved in this book over the first one.  I am more than happy to rate this book 5 stars and am anxiously awaiting the third book.  Fantastic!

It's something I know I will fall back on time after time, no doubt.  I know if you buy this book you will be happy that you did.  This book is concise, encouraging, informative, and best of all reusable.  Let's face it, homeschooling can be overwhelming.

$REVIEW.: Without question, this is the best NL Hold Em tournament book on the market today.End of story.I have read tons of poker books out on the market, books that focus on Limit Hold Em, books that cover the basics, books that cover how to stay in the moment while playing poker.  Each of these books have their own pros and cons, but sadly none of these books focused on NL Tournament Hold Em like it should be covered until I read 'Harringon on Hold Em: Volume I'.  Dan Harrington and Bill Roberte have packaged together a book that ALL NL Hold Em tournament players should read (or maybe they shouldn't --- I'll get back to that later).The chapters are broken out as follows:1. Basics of No-Limit Hold Em2. Playing Styles and Starting Requirements3. Reading the Table4. Pot Odds and Hand Analysis5. Betting Pre-Flop6. Betting Post-Flop7. Betting on the Turn and RiverAfter reading this overview you might think that this is just like any other NL Hold Em book, but it's simply not.  For one thing, this book ASSUMES that you know something about the game of NL Hold Em before you read this.  While you can pick up this book not having ever played the game before, you are better off probably having read a basic book like Phil Hellmuths or playing some hands before you read this text.While most books cover the basics like AA is better than JJ and explaining what 'Big Slick' is, the heart of this book are the hand analysis parts at the end of each chapter.  The thing that separates this book from any other on the market is the realism of the hands presented.  Other books try to do the same thing, but to help the reader feel better, they will usually say the reader hits a monster hand and wins a ton of money.  I understand why the writers do this, but it really doesn't help anyone who really wants to become a better poker player.My favorite poker quote of all time:"You win you earn, you lose you learn"Without going on and on and on and on, I'll stop this review and state that while I have reviewed many books in the past, this is only the 2nd poker book that I have ever put HPR on.  If you want to become a better NL Hold Em tournament player, pick up this text and watch your game improve dramatically.Actually, maybe you SHOULDN'T pick up this book so that myself and others can take advantage of our improved game while you are stay the amateur level and watch the chips come my way.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION

I&#8217;d equate the book to something along the lines of Lord of the Rings that has a Dungeons and Dragons twist. The pros for me were the adventures and the friendships developed along the way.

$review_text.: Brought to you by OBS reviewer AndraIt was an interesting book, though difficult to get into in the beginning (probably due to a lot going on in this book and the story vacillating between the vintage club member&#8217;s (a club of 12 of the richest men in the world) story and Reggie&#8217;s story in the beginning and thus a bit difficult to focus. Once I got past the initial hump&#8230;.and as a result of the writing being so good and the story/mystery became intriguing, I did not want to put the book down and was swept away.As stated in the book &#8230;&#8220;The goal of the Vintage Club was to find a new wine that would reverse the aging process by chemically transforming a person&#8217;s blood into the sort of the blood that ran through Adam before his fall.&#8221;Rather a bold goal for this club.  The journey the club members take is thought provoking and bold, as the reader will see.Similar to other stories (for example:  the Da Vince Code) The Vintage Club  explores both the  literal and figurative meanings of many scripture and historical bits of information related to the life and death of Christ, and in particular  the idea of eternal life. With these religious tie-ins included, it can make it difficult for a reader to follow, especially if at least a small base of religious knowledge is not present.As a mystery/thriller, the author did a delightful job.  I enjoyed following Reggie&#8217;s journey.  The whodunit was not revealed until the end (of course), but I was kept guessing until the end&#8230;.not the person I thought it was.  And is that not what one wants from a mystery?The story was wrapped up well, though it certainly left little &#8220;bits&#8221; of unanswered questions so that maybe another book is on the way?*OBS would like to thank the author for supplying a free  copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*Visit OpenBookSociety for this review and more!

$REVIEW.: HORRIBLE BOOKI should have suspected something when I saw that this book had 34 reviews at 5 (five) stars each. I bought the book primarily because I saw it being listed in the Wall Street Journal bestseller list - this is the second time I have been disappointed with a book from the WSJ list.First, this book does not explain the fundamentals of money and currencies (concepts like the role of money = unit of account, store of value and means of exchange). Then, it does not explain international trade and the role of currency in that. The book is written like a cheap romance novel, with short chapters etc. The book is not very long, but it is extremely boring and dry. I wonder what the author's objective is - whether to draw attention to his advisory work or to just promote himself.What I would have preferred is a book with more fundamental concepts instead of just a bunch of simplified stories about currency wars.I do not plan to finish reading this book because it's already been a waste of my time reading through three chapters.Sorry about this negative review, but I hope it helps other readers.

$REVIEW.: OK, let me just say from the get-go that Ms. Warneke has rapidly become one of my favorite authors. I read "Siren Song" (because anyone who has read my reviews knows that I LOVE my werewolves, and any twist on the legend is awesome) and I thought it was great. So I then picked up "Stone Lover" because it sounded...different. And it was fantastic. And I was really thrilled when I discovered that "Stone Romance" was out and I grabbed it.This book was even better than the first one. If the first was riveting, this one is simply beautiful. Melanie was fun, but there is a tragic side to Jenna that just makes you want her to find happiness again. She suffered a terrible loss when she was younger that was mentioned in the first book, but is painfully detailed here. This author has said on her blog that she is a sucker for a happy ending. And that's what we get. This is a paranormal romance (but are gargoyles paranormal or mythological?), but more than that, this is a great storytelling. All of the characters from the first book are back, and they are just as fleshed out here as they were there. You like them even more in this one. Hell, you even learn to like the imps, if such a thing is possible. What is also very interesting is that this book essentially begins about  through "Stone Lover". So you get nuances to the first book that you never saw before.Just as a note for the faint of heart: There are several love scenes between a human and a living stone gargoyle...which is not as weird as it sounds (probably because said gargoyle is human for the other half of the day. Whatever!)Someone said you don't need to read "Stone Lover" to enjoy this book. But you do. Not because this book wouldn't work as a stand-alone. It can. But because the series is that good. And I can't wait for Armand's story.

$review_text.: I loved these short stories. I actually had to go to the authors website to find out what one of them meant, Lol. But I enjoyed the twists and turns and unlike most short stories, I could actually imagine it happening as I read it. Sometimes short stories are nice to break up the monotony and thinking you have to do with novels. Well, I was blindsided because the author packed a big punch in a short story. Thoroughly enjoyed and will be purchasing another of his short story books just haven't decided which one yet, or maybe all? Definitely cant beat the prices.

$review_text.: Intoxication is a story about Leslie, who, when her boyfriend drinks her coffee one day at the office and becomes sick, decides her secretary was really trying to poison her. The rest of this novelette explores whether or not the character's suspicions are correct, or if someone else is the true killer. But is she paranoid, as her boss believes, or is there truth to her theory that someone is out to get her?The general plot of this book is intriguing and there are plenty of twists and turns until the surprise ending. My biggest complaint is that right after Rick falls ill, Leslie assumes the coffee he drank sickened him and that she knew who did it. I would have liked to see more support as to why she immediately jumped to this conclusion. I also didn't see sufficient evidence to support that Leslie could be crazy. If that aspect of her characterization could have been developed more, I expect it would have added more suspense to the book.I found some occasional grammar mistakes and typos, and occasionally the dialogue seemed stilted. But overall it was pretty clean. 3 starsAlso included in this book was The Hitchhiker. I actually thought the characters and plot were better developed in this story than in Intoxication. The ending kept me on the edge of my seat. 4 stars.And finally, the last very short story, The Bike: without sufficient time to develop the characters, the motivation for the plot doesn't ring true for me. It left me with more questions than answers. 2.5 stars.

$review_text.: This not only was a fun, quick read but an interesting and welcome variation on the detective novel genre. For one, it takes place entirely aboard a cruise ship. For those curious about life as a passenger or as a crew member, there are some interesting details. Even more unique is the age of the hero - 84. He takes impromptu naps, mangles names, and gets away with a lot of things a detective half his age wouldn't. It turns out to be more of an advantage than a disadvantage - including at the plot's climax.

$REVIEW.: This started ok and then started downhill by about page two.  The writing is stilted and juvenile, there are long boring passages of dialogue that drone on and on.  The premise has been done before and sadly it was done better by everybody else.  The obvious lack of a proof reader or at least one who is competent makes for sometimes amusing gaffes, however, most of the mistakes are simply glaring and at best annoying.  I won't read this author's work again, the fact that she is continuing this story is amazing as that means someone must have encouraged her to do so.....

$REVIEW.: This book was a very basic introduction into the Arab-Israeli conflict - and therein lies its strength and weakness. The reader will have a better understanding of the root causes of the conflict, but it does leave her wanting to know more.The story was repetitive at first, but if you can get past this, you will be amply rewarded. Ms. Archbold clearly presents her assertion - that the Jewish people have a God given right to the land of Israel that overrides anybody else's claim to it. She mainly focuses on chapters 35 (a curse AGAINST Mount Seir or the Arab peoples) and 36 (a blessing FOR the Mountains of Israel or the Jewish people) of Ezekiel to prove her point.At first glance, the observer might accuse God of being unfair to the Arab nations. But Ms. Archbold plainly demonstrates how God has NOT been unfair to them. She points out how much land they already do have, how much natural resources (i.e. oil) they have been blessed with, and STILL they begrudge Israel and what little she has. Also, Ms. Archbold imparts how Israel has always tried to treat the Arab nations fairly (in the past and present), but these nations have mostly refused to return the same courtesy. However, she gently reminds us that it is the Arab leaderships that deserve our condemnation. The Arab people, though, need to know what we Christians already know - that God wants to extend His grace to them as well.As other reviewers have stated, the maps were very effective in illustrating the territories in question.All and all, a very good, lucid primer into the Middle East situation.

$REVIEW.: I received an advanced copy of this book at no charge for the purpose of an honest review.First I have to say I really love Mary DeMuth. She is an amazing God loving woman who I am convinced if she lived in my town we would be fast friends. I have loved every book that I have read that she has authored, however I have not read them all because she is an amazing writer who just keeps cranking them out! She writes non fiction and fiction well and both keep me interested and pointed to Christ as I read. This is indeed a rare thing. When I saw she wrote a cookbook I was interested of course and wondered how this new genre would go for her.This cookbook was great! It had a great variety of different foods ranging from appetizers, main courses, to desserts. They are an unique collection different from any other cookbook but laced with jewels of helpful tips and tricks that worked for her. It is a great cookbook worth having in your kitchen. You should give it a try.The recipes are easy, not too costly, and mostly the book encourages you toward hospitality to others. I loved this aspect of this book. It is so important that we open our homes to others for a real sense of community. This book helps you do that if you feel ill equipped. With easy step by step recipes you can easily open your home up to others for an easy meal and fun fellowship.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this book! The gargoyles are so sweet and caring, not only for their family but Mackenzie. They adopt her into their pack. Valor and "Mac" fall in love. It is kind of a fast relationship, but I thought it was well done. She has to make a decision to be with him forever because Gargoyles, once they find "the one" they mate forever. I know she is only 16, but I was okay with it. I met my husband at 15 and we have been married for 27 years, so I know this decision can be made at an early age.Mac is left alone a lot because her parent's jobs keep them away for extended periods of time. She is mature and is able to handle this and it also allows her to spend time with and help the gargoyles. It helps us to get to know the characters better because of the available time they get to spend together. Mac and her mom have a great relationship, but Mac does not much care for her stepdad.  Her mom does seem a little too trusting when it comes to Mac's explanations, but I think it is because her mom seems to truly trust her daughter.The characters in this book are really endearing. I love the character's strong family bond. Mac is also very loyal to her family.This a clean book with only a little mild language and some kissing. I would recommend this book to all ages. I have already purchased the second book, Dare, and am looking for to reading his story.

$REVIEW.: For years, I'd avoided reading the Legacy comics. There was so much about them that seemed off from Star Wars as we know it, such as the return of the Sith and Skywalker's heir as a druggie. However, there's enough in Legacy to make it feel like Star Wars.This was the last arc of the original run, but you'd never know it. It leaves dozens of key plot points unresolved. For example, Darth Krayt is still alive and causing trouble. The climax in this arc is a fight against mad Sith scientist Vul Isen in order to save Utapau. I was forced to ask why this guy was so important, why Utapau was so important, and why the this arc was so important to Cades' mission. On that note, I'm sick of the whole trope of the mad scientist poisoning worlds.In retrospect, Legacy started off great but got derailed around the Vector arc. This definitely should not have been the climax of the original series.

$REVIEW.: The Governess of Highland Hall is written by Carrie Turansky and is part of the Edwardian Brides series. Julia Foster is a young missionary who lives with her parents in India when they must return to England because of illness. Julia soon finds herself working as a Governess for Sir William Ramsey because she must earn money to help provide for her parents in the late 1800s - early 1900s. As you would expect, Julia finds herself becoming attracted to Sir William Ramsey, which is not appropriate since she works for him. There are various obstacles they must face in the story: the fact that the two young girls do not feel that they need Julia as a Governess and that Sir William Ramsey finds himself needing the appropriate funds to pay the taxes on his home.I really like learning more about this time-period, and the characters were ones I was really rooting for. Although they were not perfect, they really grew throughout the story which always makes the characters more relatable.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Blogging for Books.

That said, Konkoly is still a master of suspenseful plot, evocative details and capturing the monkey wrench human emotions always throw into critical decisions.  It's no longer really about an ordinary family prepping and surviving, but don't we all wish the Marines would show up as backup if and when things bottom out?  If you've been around military men and women who take their oath seriously, you'll recognize a lot of the characters in this story.  All in all, well worth the money, just a bit of a different focus.  I'll be buying the next one.

$review_text.: The story of Dev and Leslie is so heartbreaking.  To have such an incredible connection and love at such a young age and not know what it it is or what to do about it.  Dev actually puts it all out there only to get rejected.  They both close themselves off from ever allowing another to get too close or maybe it's the strength of that connection that tells them deep down that there will never be anything that can touch it.  It can be hard just getting through high school, but adding the fact that you're gay in a place where it is never talked about or seen can do a number on a person's journey of discovering themselves.  Absolutely loved it and can definitely be enjoyed again.

$REVIEW.: Overall this is a great little light, the only issue I have with it is that the clip on the back is a little too big. If you're reading from a paperback, the weight/shape of it tends to make reading a little uncomfortable.aside from that I would recommend this for all of the readers out there.

$review_text.: The Fallen Angel's Book Club is a story about a book club for felon's. It was created by a parole officer who thought it a good idea to get convicted felon's together. These people in the club are not murders...or is there one in the group?? The main character Hollis Morgan just wants to get on with her life after spending time for fraud. Her now ex husband left her holding the bag and she does not want to have any further contact with him. Since getting out of prison and putting the past behind her all she wants to do is get a pardon and go back to school to get her law degree. Someone in the book club has other ideas though and when a murder victim, a member of the book club,is found, everyone in the club is suspect. Hollis is the main suspect and she decides that she will not sit back and be a victim again so she decides that she will investigate to see who the real killer is. This is a fast paced mystery that keeps the reader wanting more. I loved a good mystery and this is one of the better ones I have read in awhile. A fun story for sure!!!I received a copy of this book for review and was not monetarily compensated for my review.

$review_text.: What an epic read! I loved it, make no mistake if you've read all these books and have gotten to love the characters as much as I, than this will be a roller coaster for your emotions! I felt every type of emotion you can have, sadness, happiness, hope, anger, loss, love it's great. Everything kicks off fast picking up from the last book and the sacrifice one of the character makes for the ones they loves is heart breaking beautiful. The trials they all go through after just getting out of something so traumatic will suck the reader right in, hoping for the best outcome. It will definitely have you reeling at the end

$review_text.: Vows to Kill by Mark Capell is an intricately layered story of a myriad of characters' lives, at one point in time, all intersect. It felt like I was reading a sup-upped, crime version of Love Actually, which actually made this a pretty fun read.The book follows the intersecting lives of a police officer, his fianc&eacute;, his ex-wife, his co-workers, the mob, and some shady characters that have been imprisoned and more than should have been imprisoned.The first few chapters were slightly confusing; it took a little bit of time for my brain to fit the puzzle pieces of the characters and the different chapters together. At the end of the book though, it was a great looking puzzle (once everything was put together) and as I kept reading the puzzle just got better and better.Overall, Vows to Kill is a good book, especially for a rainy day, when you're looking to get lost in someone else's life.

$REVIEW.: If you where to own one baking book this book that would give you variety and great recipes this would be it.I grew up with a Swedish mother that loved to fix crisscross coffeecakes.  She titled them Swedish.  She made them for bake sales and even baked them and delivered them to her ortho doctor to pay her surgery bill.  She was a retired registered nurse with no health insurance.  They were even titled B's coffeecakes.  This last week I made them for the church coffee and used Rebecca.s suggestion for Marmalade/apricot mix preserves with a pinch of nutmeg.  Was that fantastic and they were a hit.Boy was I surprised to see the illustrated recipe for these crisscross coffeecakes in this cookbook with other scandinavian treats.Last night I just paged through it in amazement of how many recipes that interested me that I would fix and the variety that interested me..

No doubt this book is full of common sense information on how to make changes in your life, but I was so bored I never was able to finish the book. I know that to make a change you set a goal...blah blah blah... Motivation is what I need, something to set the fires burning and jar me out of depression. I know I need to make changes, what I need is something to help motivate me to do it! I didn't find it in this book.Rearrange the words a bit and slap a new cover on it, it's just like many others.

$REVIEW.: Everyone enjoys a good, well explained theory
This book contains no theory, and the explanations are comedically bad

The mark of a great teacher is the ability to explain complicated concepts so simply that anyone can understand
Bloom just quotes Wikipedia.Bloom appears to be under the impression that comparing quarks to Harry Potter bridges some gap in understanding


It doesn't


Instead he winds up with a volume that should have been 1/5th the size, where seemingly half the sentences end in question marks and which appears intended to stroke the ego of a four year old rather than the intellect of an adult
Who cares whether Bloom has a point or not? Wading through this monstrosity wouldn't be worth the effort if he did.And by the way, he doesn't have a point

None


After 558 pages there is a 5 page &#34;conclusion&#34; which just restates questions


The subtitle of the book &#34;How a Godless Universe Creates&#34; is answered with a 5 page version of 'we don't know.'I doubt anyone reading this review will get a visceral sense of just how bad this book is without a quote, so here goes:&#34;And what does that mean for us human beings? It is our obligation to defeat this annihilation by squeezing all that we are, all that we value, through the annihilation at the bagel's edge, through the anally tiny hole at the next universe's center, and into the universe to come
It is our task to come through the next annihilation rejoicing

Intact and giddy with the power of our feat.&#34;Yes, that really is the punctuation Bloom uses


No, putting the line into context doesn't help.If you are looking for a good book then keep looking


This should never have been published, and showing it to children should be considered per se child abuse and a crime against their basic human rights.

There are a few in the set that are a bit weird but that is fine with me because I can use those for swaps on Swapbot. The cards are made of sturdy card-stock and the images (comics) on them are nicely done. Great colors. I can actually remember a few of these from my childhood.

$REVIEW.: I definitely enjoyed Hell&#8217;s Knights.  I love it when an author plays with flashbacks to explain the characters lives, rather than a prologue, so two thumbs up there.  I&#8217;m also a fan of the first person perspective.  It allows me to lose myself and become the character while I&#8217;m reading.I thought the main characters were awesome, and their stories were heart-breaking.  I felt for both Addi and Cade and all the shit they went through before meeting.  Backgrounds like theirs are difficult to overcome enough to let someone in, and I think Bella Jewel did an excellent job smoothly transitioning from hardened heart to love.You&#8217;ll hear me say it a lot, but I LOVE an alpha male, and Cade was no exception to that.  YUM!  I can pinpoint the exact sentence that I fell a little in love with him.  It&#8217;s so disappointing sometimes to finish a book and realize it&#8217;s not real.Addi is a very guarded person, and it&#8217;s pretty obvious why from the get-go.  Her struggle to let go of the past and the inner strength inside her made me root for her to get her happy ending.I did have one issue with a piece of background detail, and it was kind of an important foundation detail, so it stuck with me.  I hate to say it, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever heard of a lifelong prostitute that has a lawyer and a will.  I&#8217;m not saying it is impossible, but maybe it wasn&#8217;t explained enough as to how that came about.  I just think there were more believable options as to how Addi got the piece of information that came from there.Overall, that didn&#8217;t stop me from enjoying Hell&#8217;s Knights, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on Heaven&#8217;s Sinners!Read more reviews @ rawbooksonline.com

$REVIEW.: The thing I like most about this book was it was succinct. Let's be honest, most of us aren't going to get through a 300 page book on body language (or any other book for that matter) unless we are making a study of it. This book, however, is succinct and manageable, focusing on useful basics, like the use of body language in interviews to position yourself more favourably.If you want a quick primer, an introduction with useful body language skills, this is as good a starting place as any I have come across.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't going to read this book, but then began and I'm glad I did. I learned that there are several different ways to set up facebook pages as well as profile pages and how to use them to promote one's business.  Lots of new apps and tools were presented to help set up the desired look and function of one's page.The one thing I found difficult was the step by step charts and screenshots were too small to read clearly. It might be better if the author enlarged the images and put them on their own "page" area instead of next to each other. Enlarging the text didn't help the charts. I do recommend it for anyone interested in exploring the wide range of facebook possibilities.

I thought he died in &#34;The Templar's Relic&#34;, but I was mistaken.I couldn't help but wonder why everyone used the Hamas tunnel when there apparently was a tour bus to the monastery. They had passports.This book is about tracking down the twelfth skull. It isn't where everyone thought it was. It isn't where the coded message said it was. It isn't where it was supposed to be taken. Then again, neither was the corpse. In the end, all is found.Except for the skull the Deniers are still in possession of. Another book, maybe?

The writing is fantastic, it had me laughing out loud at the realness (and ridiculousness) of the Tweets, overall it was great.  My ONLY complaint is that it is SO short!  I bought it on my phone and didn't see the page count, if I had I honestly wouldn't have bought it, and that's why I considered giving it the 4 star review.  I'm all for short stories that are truly stories, beginning, middle, and conclusion - but I won't get hooked on a series of 40 page books.  I'm dying to know what happens next, but unless it's an actual book I probably won't buy part 2 despite how good, and how much I enjoyed this one.

$REVIEW.: This book is smaller than it looks like pocketbook size, it's really tiny, I bought it for my grandma (obviously) she didn't complain about how small the print is, but I know she's worried about it because she doesn't want to write in it, she's using a tab to write her life stories on instead. If this book was normal size, she wouldn't hesitate. The book contains writing props and a few pages to fill the props in, the paper is also glossy, so using a liquid based ball point pen probably wouldn't be best because it would smudge. The book arrived in time for christmas and my grandma was happy to have it, but I wish the book as a whole would have been bigger.

$review_text.: Eh, it was OK I suppose. I imagine some people will really enjoy it. Personally, I found it to be a continuous string of painful fantasy & romance clich&eacute;s. I found myself cringing after a while. But I'll be the first to admit these tropes are so frequently used because people generally like them. So there will be a subset of readers who are thrilled to see so many of them together in one place. I'm just not one of them.I did very much appreciate that Siobhan was a truly strong female lead. She was equally as strong as the male leads, certainly she was given more time to demonstrate her strength. There was one fairly mild m&eacute;nage scene (the only sex in the story) that I liked well enough. I even liked all three of them...I think.I say I think because they all felt a little shallow and could have done with a little depth. I also found some of the language stiff. Part of this was the effect of 'fantasy language.' Yes, I made that phrase up, but I imagine any frequent reader of high fantasy will recognise what I mean. The fae always seem to be written to sound posh, for example. But some of it was just stilted writing.All in all, I don't consider this one a fail, but I'm not rushing out to find out if there is a sequel either.

 If you just want a few cookie recipes already written out in one place, then this is your book

Otherwise, this little book was free from Amazon so that certainly makes it worth the price.

$review_text.: Lately, I have noticed the rise of the &quot;tv evangelists&quot; of free thought. When a Christian, Barker was involved in producing some of the most groan inducing versions of the mass marketed American version of &quot;Christianity.&quot; He has simply switched products. One cannot play his atheist music, for example, without fealing a bit guilty. His &quot;Happy as can be. . . I am your neighborhood atheist&quot; gives Shatner a run for his money for unintentional musical parody. Do yourself a favor listen to his music... and then consider: if his music is this bad (where you have some ability to judge and where his &quot;credentials&quot; are strongest), what does that suggest about his philosophy?Barker has little or no training in philosophy and then deals with what he has read in a juvenile manner. His story begs several questions. . . including personal motivations for leaving the faith.

$review_text.: This was the first disher book I read, I have since consumed a number of others including the first 4 Challis and Destry novels. He is an impressive writer of the genre and different settings to much of the norm and his communication of distance and remoteness is well nuanced, no leaving the city and 5 minutes later be pulling into a dusty 1 pub town on the red dirt tracks.Bitter Wash Road built suspense well, both in relation to the crime plot  but also the romance and intrigues he developed along the way. Perhaps the denouement was a bit neatly tied up, but that tends to be the way of the genre and your not left with too many unanswered questions.His characterisations of the children was well thought through a testament to his other work in younger readers fiction, they are believable and not any more or less heroic than the adults. A great author to discover.

$review_text.: If someone were standing and reading "The Flying Troutmans" by Miriam Toews before me in a group, I would be embarrassed. If I could take off my "serious" hat, I could find it very funny . . . throughout. But I would have to read the book on my own and not have it shared publicly.I know all the words -- barnyard, sexual, excretory, profane -- but I choose not to use them, whether in polite company or not. Some might argue that the world would be a better place, more honest, less hypocritical, if everyone did speak the way the characters do in Toews' book.Some people, perhaps more and more people these days, do speak that way -- in the locker room at the gym, in the pickup game in the neighborhood, and almost every last Marine I met years and years ago as a young enlisted man in the Corps, and on the final auto assembly line in Michigan, or in the car repair shop, as a badge of membership in some "in" group, among the fashionable and "in-the-know" frequenters of the bar scene, also myself when I'm angry, frustrated, or generally feeling down on someone or some situation. But I prefer not.Toews, presumably, is attempting to make her characters real, their emotions real. I will grant her that, but I don't have to like what they say and do. Her characters are young, poor, nave, undereducated, frustrated, buffeted by life, in need of mothering and fathering, trying to be worldly wise, dealing with literally crazy people and often with crazy bureaucracies. She is describing them and their world. Okay, but I do not need to know more about that world.Well, one might object, her characters have many saving graces: are funny and smart, have potential, can draft a cohesive statement, are interested in new words, are creative, and are loving and forgiving, especially within the family. Sure, they exhibit many of the more admirable human traits. And Toews' plotting and even minor characterizations are very well done.Some readers will identify with parts of Toews' world and relish sharing it. However, one does not have to like it. One may just not be interested. For those who are, she has written an excellent book, and for them I would give it five stars.

$REVIEW.: Josh Lanyon's long awaited opus on the essentials of crafting a successful M/M novel hit the bookstores recently after a whirlwind of publicity and it was well worth the wait. This book is a step by step tutorial for both the novice and experienced writer on how to write the next great M/M novel. In his book Josh provides the reader with his own observations as well as astute and perceptive comments from others in the business such as publishers, writers, editors, reviewers and a host of insiders on how to create believable masculine characters while ensuring that the essential elements of a good novel are present in a story.In Man, Oh Man! Writing M/M Fiction for Kinks and Cash Josh covers the basic fundamentals of good writing such as Hook, Characterizations, Dialogue and Conflict and he overlays this with the creative elements that are absolutely necessary for M/M romance in order for the book to grab the attention of editors, publishers and readers. Josh cautions that M/M romantic fiction should be from the male perspective and not stories about women masquerading as men and it must also be able to stand on its own without the sex.I have been reviewing M/M romances for some time but didn't quite grasp the difference between M/M romance and gay fiction until I read Josh's succinct explanation in the book, and I'm sure that I am not the only one who was unaware of this distinction.This is one of the most impressive how-to books that I have read in a while. What made this book different is Josh's easy, laid back, armchair style of imparting knowledge as a result of his years as a published author.  The book provides practical examples and ideas that even a novice writer could easily grasp and implement. Josh uses humour in the book which makes communicating his knowledge easy on the reader. This book is rich in content based on Josh's experience, but he also gives us valuable information gleaned through a series of interviews conducted with industry insiders over the course of several months and offers the combined expertise of professionals in the business. Publishers give their take on what the current trends are in M/M fiction and offer a range of opinions based on reader surveys.Josh takes us through the creative process starting with how and where to find fresh ideas and strong hooks, to creating believable masculine characters (since the majority of M/M authors today are women, I think they will find this very revealing) ,  to "selling" your carefully edited manuscript to a publisher and marketing the book after its release.  Writers can take a page out of Josh's book, literally, and copy some of his strategies on the marketing of this book which were extremely effective.Man, Oh Man! is geared to the rapidly expanding market of M/M romance and I would anticipate that the numbers of authors in this genre will grow exponentially as the market continues to increase. I attended Josh's recent on-line workshop for Cobblestone Press, which took place just prior to the release of the book and I was struck by the clarity of his presentation.If I may, I would like to recommend a few chapters I found extremely relevant and informative - Looking for a Few Good Men - A strong character can carry a weak story; Cheat Sheets for Chicks -What makes a man and a woman different; Do the Math - Pacing -  moving the story forward;  What's it all about Alfie -Theme;  MM! MM! Good and Rent Boys. I am not going to elaborate on all of the chapters because that would be a disservice to the reader and the book, plus there's only so much information that a reviewer should convey.Each chapter is a little gem but there is not enough space to mention all of them. In order to get the full flavour and Josh's expert knowledge you need to read the book for yourself. Suffice it to say that I was inspired to write after reading Man, Oh Man! Writing M/M Fiction for Kinks and Cash, and if you've ever thought of writing for this genre then I think you`ll be motivated too. Authors and would-be writers of the genre should have a copy of this excellent reference source or your competition will blow you away. One bit of advice from Josh that resonated with me - write what you enjoy reading, make it fresh and write your passion.

$REVIEW.: In this entertaining sequel to Harassment, Darline Flowers has rapidly risen the corporate ranks at Maximus and is now in the big leagues. The company president, Clayton Weimar, takes her along on a negotiation to buy out another company, and she is shocked to see that the hot guy she keeps seeing around town is the owner&#8217;s son. Her boss warns her that he thinks something is wrong with the guy, but she wasn't planning on hooking up with him anyway. Later that evening after a long, relaxing shower, Darline comes out to discover the Tic Tac Toe killer is in her house, thanks to a front door she forgot to lock. Using her wits and showing a spine of steel, she turns the tables on the would-be rapist in a most shocking way.

$REVIEW.: I like the book, but it is not the alternative modern-day undergrad textbook for Programming Languages (PL) that I was seeking. It is inexpensive and it encourages a hands-on treatment of PL concepts across several language paradigms. However, its coverage of PL concepts is incomplete and the languages (Io, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell, Prolog, Ruby) will be unfamiliar to most who are not CS professionals or who are unfamiliar with ACM/SIGPLAN. So I am still looking for the PL "textbook" that includes several popular languages from the Info/Web Tech industry (e.g., JavaScript, PHP, Python, HTML5) as a way to introduce some PL terminology and make comparisons with less familiar languages/paradigms. So this was not the book to do that. None the less, I like this book and I recommend it to other computing professionals. I see this as a textbook for the computing professional to use for "continuing ed" to expand their horizons as software developers.The author's writing style is first person and conversational. He illustrates a selection of features and syntax that is specific to each language using code clips and narrative text about it. There are not many illustrative diagrams or figures. Each chapter that covers one of the languages is best read from beginning to end since it is written in tutorial sequence rather than in "reference" style. The author likes to use movie references as metaphors, which for me were more distracting. The coding examples throughout are good. I liked those for Prolog which included a Sudoku program. The coverage for each language includes an interview-dialog with an expert or inventor of the language (which further contributes to the textual/conversational style). PL terminology is encountered and defined throughout and the index is helpful for finding them, but this is not the definitive text for programming language terms and definitions (e.g., Scoping is not mentioned and several terms are defined mostly by example). The author offers minimal guidance on how to get started (download/installation) with these languages. A companion web site for this book would be nice, especially if it provided details regarding downloads, installation, setup, and use of the development tools available (even at the risk of becoming outdated). But that can easily be found online, as the author points out.Once again, I am glad I purchased the text.

Then it was some random chick who had nothing to do w/the book at all.Ms. Brown, please work on the coherence of the book before putting out another one.

$review_text.: This is the Book 2 of The Lost Girls and it can be read as a standalone, but let me recap what I learned previously. From Book 1, we know that Shelly is Allie's best friend, she is a prostitute, who helped Allie's financially when she was pregnant and homeless. Although help sounds like an understatement, she practically sacrifices herself for her best friend. So you see, how much I admire Shelly. She fell for a cop though, named Luke Cameron, by being his informant and betrayal she sugar-daddy, Philip, a rich guy who hired her.Selling Out started off with Shelly leaving her escorting career behind and looking for a normal job. Things doesn't went well and she realize that prostituting is the only skill she had. It was mentioned that she wanted to be worthy of him. If you read Book 1, you will know she is thinking of Luke and wanted to change for him. She know she is doomed anyway. He looks so righteous and perfect, while she is a hooker.But as Shelly said, prostituting is like a poison, slowly eating her up and it refuse to let her go. The villain pimp Henri is such a bastard. When Shelly saved a young girl, Ella away from Henri's party, he hunted her down and framed them for murder. That's when Shelly had to seek help from both Philip and Luke to sort out the mess.We know very little of Luke previously, besides him being a goody cop wanted to bring down the prostituting industry and he cares deeply for Shelly. Half way into the book, I still think he is just that. But damn, I'm so wrong. He is much much more complicated than that. He had his own motivation and when the revelation of his past came out, I was kind of stunned. Really didn't see that one coming. Is heartbreaking and emotional and I grabbed my Kleenex.As in previous book, the story is dark, raw and gritty. It started out slow and I thought is going to be another predictable romantic suspense. But when I reached past half the book, that's where the goods are. The things that both Shelly and Luke went through in their lives, the sacrifices they make, the pain they had to endure breaks my heart to read about it. I'm glad the author sweetened it up by a HEA, or else I would definitely threw my Kindle or something to that extend. I can't wait her Amber Lin's next release.

$review_text.: Jessica never ceases to amaze me with her ability to expertly craft and weave a wondrous story, and Reviving Izabel is no exception. This novel picks up several months after Killing Sarai left off. Sarai is &#34;moving on&#34; with her life; she has a best friend, even a boyfriend, but it's all a lie. Plus, she can't get a certain someone out of her mind. This was an excellent addition to the In the Company of Killers series. We see an amazing growth in every single character, and there's the introduction of some new, interesting characters as well.Sarai shows the most growth in this novel. She is no longer timid or scared of Victor. In fact, she's quite the opposite. She wants to learn from Victor, and seek her revenge on those that deserve it. However, throughout the story she never loses her humanity, and by the end, Sarai is Izabel, in every way possible. She also has a great effect on Victor. Because of this, Victor also experiences great changes. He allows himself to be more open and emotional where Sarai is concerned. I loved seeing this side of him because it showed that he is capable of loving despite everything he has gone through and seen, and isn't just a cold-blooded killer. I thought something fishy was going on, but I honestly never expected the major twist in this book with Victor and Sarai. I think it showed a good view of the world that Sarai was being inducted to. I loved the introduction of Fredrick. His character was awesome, dark, twisted, and sexy. Throughout the novel, I was constantly wondering about his character and his back-story, and I definitely wanted more of him. I recently found out that we'll be treated to Fredrick's story, so I'm super excited about that!This novel was fast-paced, and action packed. Everything was very well described, and the story has your heart racing. There's plenty of steamy moments between Victor and Sarai, and I loved every minute. Jessica is an amazing and extraordinary author who can take any idea, and create an entirely new and original idea that will blow your mind. This is definitely a must read for fans of the series (trust me, it won't disappoint), and fans of Jessica. This is a unique and original concept and story, and I've never read anything like it! If you want to be swept off your feet, this is the book for you. I can't wait to see what Jessica has in store for us next! Happy reading :)

$REVIEW.: This is another nail-biting thriller that grabs you and doesn't let you go.  They just keep getting better and better.  I continue to be most impressed with Hamer's ability to weave historical facts into a modern crime story.  The historical element was a Roman invasion of the island Mona Insulis, an attempt to destroy the Druids.  The parallel stories are expertly interwoven and independently compelling.This is the third book that features the team of detectives in North Wales.  They are a wonderfully flawed bunch but their investigative skills are exceptional.  The supporting characters were intriguing and essential to the plot.  I found I was able to identify the killer fairly early, which is unusual for a Hamer book, but the ending surprised me none the less.There is always an element of historical fiction in Hamer's books but it was far more prevalent in this book than in the others.  I felt it really gave us a look into the true nature of the ancient Druids.  It was also a very vital part of the plot as a whole.This is a book I would definitely recommend.  Hamer's knowledge of the region of North Wales and its history shines through in her writing.  She has a talent for making the reader feel like they are a part of the landscape.  I am anxious to see what comes next.

$review_text.: I received a copy of Fifty Three by Rosanita Ratcliff in exchange for an honest review.Jelynda's life has not always gone as planned. Born with congestive heart failure, she's had to go through a few surgeries and because of her health and her fear of the unknown future, she's always held her feelings close to her heart. She's got a supportive close circle of friends and a great family but after her last boyfriend left her immediately following her last surgery, she hasn't tried to get close to anyone else since.I did enjoy the story. But I think it could use some more editing. Some of the conversations were a little confusing because they were just paragraphs of full conversations and I had to reread a few of them to try to figure out which character was saying which lines. And while the book is mostly written in the past tense, too many times it would revert to the present. It didn't detract from the story itself, but it was distracting to the flow of the story.

$review_text.: &#8220;Invisible&#8221; by L.A. Remenicky4 out of 5 starsIf you are looking for a quick afternoon read then this book is for you.  &#8220;Invisible&#8221; tells an age old tale of unlikely young love ripped apart by circumstance only to be reunited later in life.  Elaine met Jackson in high school when she was asked to tutor him.  He was the popular jock and due to unfortunate family circumstances she spent her days trying to be invisible.  As they get to know each other, he brings her out of her shell and she opens his eyes to the possibility of a world beyond basketball.  They are unlikely soul mates but the bond of love is quick and strong between them.  The events of one night set them on two different paths that cross again as adults and lead them into imminent danger.The pacing on this book is fast.  Sometimes that can lead to a lack of character development but not here.  Remenicky is smart and uses flashbacks of their early days together as a way to set up the present day story but also to allow us to get to know the characters.  It was easy to see how the strength of their bond could stand the test of time and made you root for them in the present.  She also doesn&#8217;t rush the development of their present-day relationship.  There is adequate build up and nothing about their coupling feels forced.My only wish would be to see more of Elaine&#8217;s mother.  It was apparent that there had been contact between them over the years but I wanted more.  The two of them suffered together and I expected more of a bond over that.  They seemed almost strangers and I would have liked to see more development of their relationship.Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for anyone looking for a quick read.*I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*Shannon

$REVIEW.: I'm a long time fan of Graham Hancock and his last book, Supernatural, impressed me big time. Hancock is far from the cowardly journalist caste that he came from, not just because he isn't afraid of exploring the mystery that is out there, rather, Graham Hancock is one of those nice guys you come across now and again, a savvy guy who knows how to mine an industry, but in an honest gentlemanly British way and so I was excited about his first novel, Entangled.The obvious stealing from the late, great Terence McKenna isn't a problem. McKenna is dead already and so mining the body of the dead poet is a noble cause. (Just check out Joe Rogan's brilliant McKenna talk about DMT on You Tube). This way we can pump out McKenna's best t-shirt syllogisms for the 21st century generation, but repackaged and improved upon! Hence Mr Hancocks novel about DMT lifting the great veil off her material hinges, to peep inside the elf nest.Now if this book sells as much as Fingerprints of the Gods, then the Genie is out if the bottle! As far as I am aware, Graham Hancock is the only person who has stepped up to the challenge of writing a novel on this theme. This doesn't bold well to the entheogenic thinkers out there (if any exist, I haven't seen them). What are they waiting for!!!  McKenna used to say that in a society free from the propaganda wing of the cr'p excreter , the DMT experience would make headlines ten feet tall. This is why Graham Hancock needed to write this novel. It's a sort of Trojan horse that will open the eyes of those who think that Simon Cowell will bring them transcendence.However, I must say that even though this is a fine effort, the way it mixes the parallel worlds described by experienced psychonats, it would never have got published if it wasn't Hancock, because, and this hurts, it isn't that well written. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, it really is. Characters just talk to the screen, like in old C movies, to explain the plot to the viewer and the characters are not that well fattened out and there is no scenery descriptions of the sights and smells and moods etc, of various places, you see. I'm not passing myself off as one of those literature nerdy types you see on telly, but even I noticed that this isn't really a well written novel, and if I noticed it, then that is really bad!!  I still give it 5 stars because, even though the Terence McKenna cognoscenti will roll their eyeballs at this c minus effort, virgins out there will hopefully see the rubbish peddled at them, by their loving government, as what it really is, rubbish!

$REVIEW.: Review by Hetty, BestSellers & BestStellars of Romance"I don't want to be here without you
I don't know how..
I don't know how to live without you here." ~AddisonI must start by saying that Tara Sivec amazes me

First, she had me howling with laughter with the Chocolate Lovers Series

Then, I was on the edge of my seat with her thrilling and suspenseful Playing With Fire Series


And NOW..


she proves that her talent never ending with this New Age emotional story that grips your heart
Wow
You'll be calling your mother after reading this one."It's life
It's the bumps and the bruises, the pain and the fear; it's messy and it's real and it's not some perfect little story that can be tied up in a bow." ~ZanderAddison is a beautifully created character people can actually relate to
Her story is raw and broken yet realistic
Being nineteen is difficult enough without losing the most important person in your life

After her mother died, Addison's life flipped upside down

She had perfect grades, dreams of college, a large social circle..


overall a great, carefree life that shattered and has been long lost

Addison doesn't recognize the young woman she has become and is just trying to survive."I've put up walls and I've locked away all of my feelings because I've been crippled by the pain of being so alone, and I'm mistrustful of everyone around me.""No memories, no emotions, just keep moving forward and pretend like she never existed."Addison's journey over the past year has been an extreme struggle


I constantly had tears in my eyes as her past was replayed and her memories filled the pages

Addison is full of pain and rather than dealing with it, she does her best to hide it away

The flashbacks are perfectly placed and always fit right into the present
I especially loved that each chapter began with a therapeutic session between Addison and Dr


Thompson
This aspect brought a lot of understanding and insight into Addison's character development."Even if I did want someone in my life just to scratch an itch, they would always want more

More information, more history, more answers to questions I wouldn't give-more of me that I stopped giving away a year and a half ago."Zander is a breath of fresh air for Addison, no matter how hard she fights it


He makes her smile for the first time in months and makes her feel things she didn't think were possible ever again


Those napkin notes were brilliant! Zander is SO strong and positive, everything Addison needs to finally deal with her mother's loss


I absolutely loved his personality and everything he brought to this terrific romance


Their chemistry sizzles and steams page after page


Zander has a few secrets of his own which make him even better but will Addison think so?"I have loved you from the first moment I saw you."The deflated relationship between Addison and her father was heartbreaking


His absence left her to become the adult and take care of all the responsibilities
Addison's relationship with Megan was another important underlying piece of this novel


Addison's father and Megan bring a lot of additional depth to this novel.Watch Over Me is a MUST read! It is a stunning example of how precious life is and you can always find a way out of the darkness


As always, Tara Sivec created a magnificent novel that all romance readers will enjoy!5+ Diamonds


$SUMMARY.: AMAZING! I LOVED this book! 5+ Stars!!!

$REVIEW.: I first want to say that I feel totally honored that I was given an ARC of this book from the author.You know when you finish a book that it is going to be one that sticks with for a long time....well The Light in the Wound is one of those books. This book will forever live in my head. The emotions that this book exudes was beyond amazing. The author made this book feel so realistic. Every feeling that Isabel felt during this journey I felt with her. This was a book that made me think what I would do in this situation. I would like to think I would make the right choice but I just don't know.I don't want to say to much more because it would truly spoil this story but I will say that this was a book about first loves, loves lost and then found, and truly about realizing what is the best for yourself.I was 100% happy with how this book ended. I felt that the book flowed really well and that by the end we get closure on this story. I will also say that this was one of the cleanest books I have read in a long time, when it comes to grammar and editing. I didn't notice any misspelled words or wrong words used. Let me tell you that is really refreshing.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for an emotional love story about first loves and making the right decision.I thought this was a wonderful debut novel!!!

$review_text.: The understatement, subtlety, and gentle irony which served Catherine Barnett so well in her first poetic foray, "Into Perfect Spheres Such Holes Are Pierced", fail to sustain her in this second collection

 In her earlier work, the death of her nieces provided a powerful thematic crux
 Here she offers, among other notions, that mothers cannot (or will not) answer children's questions about life and the world


 But for the rare instance (e.g


"From the Doorway," "Prima Materia), such a notion doesn't take flight or sustain her vision

 Her problem is evident from the number of unexceptional, and just plain flat, endings of poems


 Perhaps a greater urgency would have served her better; this is a disappointing follow-up to her first volume.

The research that was done on the time period and nautical knowledge is impressive to say the least. I find her style of writing thoughtful, mindful, and refreshing when it comes to true feelings and emotions.

$REVIEW.: "Miles" captures what I remember about being a teenager.  Although the story is about a boy discovering and then exploring his homosexuality, the emotions are universal. As a reader, I heard the work through the classical music and jazz references that score the emotions of Adam Henry Carriere's protagonists. The detailed study of the shifting social geography of Chicago 1970's grounded the novel in time and place. Sensual details - Russian bread and a slice of cheese shared with a lover, an uncle's bitter wine, or the comfort of a hug engaged my senses and made me smile and remember . . .and made me wince and remember because the author's honesty - brutal honesty - captures not only the pain we feel as we leave childhood and struggle with becoming adults, we are also selfish and cruel and destructive in the process.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good read.

$REVIEW.: I have waited several weeks to write this review because I wanted to mellow out a little after being so frustrated with this book.First I'd like to say that Paul Kenyon seems like a nice, likable guy...nothing against him at all.I do think, however, that his publisher or someone should have cut about 250-300 pages of this "way too long" book.In the beginning of the book I was really trying to pay close attention to every single detail that Paul wrote...and he wrote plenty. In depth descriptions of old stores in town, a business he used to own, the furniture it contained, the people who worked around this store..... all the while I'm trying to remember all this minutia because it must relate to the story about the ghosts, right? I mean, this is what the book is supposed to be about so why would the author go to such great lengths (and I mean great lengths) to describe all this STUFF if it isn't going to relate to the ghost story? Well, you guessed it, it never amounted to anything relating to the ghost story it was just a walk down memory lane for the author.My opinion of this book is that it is an autobiographical slice of life for Paul Kenyon. If I were his first wife, one of his kids, his ex-friend Tim or anyone that actually knew him during those times, like the family that was haunted.... then the book would be interesting.As it stands I found the book to be very hard to finish. Most of the detail that is written about never relates to the story of ghosts. This book is marketed as a ghost story.... so be a ghost story with a little personal interest added for flavor.... not the other way around.When Paul was relating the actual scary experiences that he and the family went through, that was great. It was well written and believable. Absolutely believable. However, I only give two stars because I was forced to read through so much STUFF that I had no interest in whatsoever to get to the good nuggets that would pop up through out the book.

$REVIEW.: I'm an evangelical who is deeply interested in the evangelical-catholic debate


It is necassary to discuss the agreements and differences between both sides

But in a loving and honest manner! The academic and theological standard of this book is below zero
It's very interesting that Hunt relies heaviliy on a book of Peter de Rosa (without any footnotes!), a former priest and now attacking the church and the whole faith

What a reliable source! Will the real heretics please stand up


If you are interested to get an accurate overview over catholicism read the book of Geisler/Nix and original catholic sources
You can't get any position right if you don't read the original material
This is true for any controversial discussion

Anyone who is judging others in this way will be jugded by god in the same way
If Hunt is right OK., but if not ...


This book is fantastic for all catholic haters, but not for a person who is really seeking the truth.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to like this book, as it was praised by many bloggers who focused on China.  It held promise from the description I read that the story concerned possible Uighur separatists, Chinese internet, and an American former soldier living in China.  However, what it did leave me with after completing the book was a lot more questions than when I first started.  Those who are expecting a neat and tidy ending will be sorely disappointed.  Maybe that was the author's intent.  The book frankly is more about the self-discovery of the protagonist, Ellie Cooper, than what is really going on outside of her field of vision.  She really doesn't understand what is going on around her with her "friends" or antagonists, and that is at the crux of her problems.  Shall we say that she has "issues" that needed to be resolved.  At the book's end, some of them have been, but others are still there.  It was an interesting read, but not entirely satisfying.

$review_text.: As a TV writer who worked on staff consistently in the late 90's and early 2000's, when I came across this book I was immediately curious and interested to see what the author had to say about the TV writing business


 Although our paths never crossed during that time, many of Stepakoff's anecdotes could have been my own.Stepakoff interweaves his own experiences in the biz with the changing business as a whole and does so extremely successfully


 Even though I was in the midst of the changing TV business (specifically the recent demise of scripted television), I was never fully aware of the far-reaching reasons behind it


 Stepakoff has done a magnificent job of meticulously researching this book and for that, it serves not only as a fun memoir, but a legitimate historical accounting of the rise and fall of the TV writer and scripted television as a whole.I whole-heartedly recommend this book for anyone who has any interest in what goes on behind the scenes in the life of a TV writer
 It is especially relevant now given the current writer's strike as well
 It should seriously be required reading for any college TV writing course

 I know I'm going to make it required reading for my husband!!!

Well, if you are rich as Crosus, or own a quilt shop that specializes in florals, that may be easy. But me? No way! I love the look, but panic at the idea of having to find that many little pieces of fabrics (you usually only need a few square inches of each for your quilt).Then, along comes Dina, and suddenly, the world opens up! These are beautiful quilts, and from them the ideas simply pour for other patterns using Dina's beautifully simple technique. Put your gridded layout on the wall, cut up 3 to 5 fabrics (one a simple background fabric) and you are on your way to something that looks like you slaved away on for days!Hooray for Dina, and all those wonderful quilters out there who make even the beginning quilter feel brilliant, and lets the advanced quilter do something fun and easy with fabric she has laying around waiting for just the right use. Your friends and family will never know you didn't spend hours choosing just the right fabrics and slaving away!And remember, Christmas is coming - these little beauties whip up FAST, and look like a million bucks - the perfect thing to impress the mother-in-law or that difficult to please 'has it all' girlfriend!I have had my book since it first came out, have made several quilts from these patterns, and am using her idea to do some other quilts in different themes with the same idea.

$REVIEW.: I am a little bit late with my review of Under Fire by Rita Henuber
Work has been a bit crazy and with other obligations taking up my precious reading time, I have been a bit swamped so to speak
But I am a girl who always believes in the "better late than never" adage and though my review is a trifle bit late in coming, it comes with all good tidings and recommendations for fans of the genre to give this one a try!Rico Cortes is a DEA agent who has been working deep undercover in the midst of Miami's drug world


With a past that has put him on a course to do his bit to rid his country of drugs, Rico is at the verge of wondering who the real Rico is as his job pulls him deeper into a world filled with treachery and deceit.Coast Guard Lt


Commander Olivia Carver is one determined woman, whose twin brother Danny was murdered whilst working undercover in the Miami drug scene

Her vow to avenge the death of her twin is one that constantly rings through her very soul and the only thing that stops her from quitting her job to embark on a full fledged search for the killer is the fact that her position brings her intel that she otherwise would not have access to.When Olivia and Rico's worlds collide, a meeting machinated by Rico in order to throw Olivia off the course of Rico's investigation, the one thing neither counts on is the volatile sexual need that practically wipes every other thought from their minds
A one night stand that leaves both wanting more takes a darker turn when Rico is forced to make use of Olivia in their joint quest to bring their mutual enemy to justice - or wipe him off the face of the Earth once and for all!Under Fire is an appropriate title for a book which is filled with action of the heart pounding variety that never lets up

The constant kick-ass action that is always a part of this story held my undivided attention as I sped through the pages


With a thrilling chase that kickstarts the story sets the tone for the whole novel as Olivia and Rico pulls out all the stops to lure one of the worst drug lords in their country to his ultimate demise

I loved the fact that Rita Henuber doesn't pull any punches and delivered that realistic edge to the action, not doing a complete 360 degree turnabout at the end where forgiveness and doing the right thing takes precedence over the goal that had been set at the beginning.The passion that ignites between Olivia and Rico is one to be savored in the story


Though the scenes aren't explicitly detailed each and every single time, Rita does know how to keep the adrenaline pumping with the constant arcs of awareness that leaps forth between Olivia and Rico

I loved the heat and sultriness of the first encounter between them and I've just got one word for Rico - HOT!For me, though Olivia tended to be the centrepoint of the story as it unfolded, Rico's character turned out to be the most endearing one
His painful past when it comes to light made me want to wrap my arms around him and never let go

As the shades of his undercover persona is left behind bit by bit, there emerges a man that wants above all to do the right thing and to find that one person in the world who would love him completely, his darkness and all.Olivia makes for one kick-ass chick, whose sheer determination to find her twin brother's killer obliterates everything else in her life - even her burgoening feelings towards Rico

I think it was because of that reason that I couldn't completely warm up to Olivia's character towards the end though she makes you want to learn one of those few dangerous manueuvers of your own to dish out every now and then.The humor that is so intrisically woven together in a story that practically vibrates with adrenaline overload turned out to be one of the reasons I kept coming back for more of Olivia and Rico


I kept going LOL even during those tense moments fraught with either danger or sexual tension that just somehow seemed to fit right in making this romantic suspense a well balanced one.One of my peeves with the book turned out to be how things ended in the story

I was clamoring so bad for an epilogue that would depict Olivia and Rico as a couple, maybe a couple of years in the future, both settled in and adjusting to life at a different pace than the ones they have led up till and throughout the story
The way how things ended is the only reason that prevented me from giving this one a whopping 5-stars though Under Fire still makes for an awesome read!Recommended for those who love their heroines to be of the kick-ass variety, their heroes to be ultra sexy and for the story to practically burst at the seams from the continuous stream of non-stop action!Rating=4/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer (MBR)

$REVIEW.: Chocolate Lovers series, winners. First book of the Chocoholics series,Love and Lists, another winner. That's four books leading up to Passion and Ponies. Four books that I thoroughly enjoyed, each building off of the preceding book(s). But when an author continues a series (I'll consider this one series, even though the Chocoholics is a spin-off of the Chocolate Lovers, it's a continuation as well) into a fifth book, some doubts might arise about it bringing something new to the playing field or whether the series will run out of steam. Early on in reading P&P; I knew that Sivec had done it again. This is another great book filled with not just hilarious moments that have become a trademark of Sivec's writing, but also a deeper look into some characters that might not have been taken seriously in the past.This book focuses a relationship that was hinted at in Love and Lists, Ava and Tyler's strange attraction. Before this book, Tyler is really only seen as an overgrown child (much like many of the characters during the Chocolate Lovers series). Being able to get part of this story from Tyler's point of view added depth to his and an understanding about who he actually is. He wasn't just Gavin's roommate who tagged along all the time. The same can be said about Ava and getting her point of view. Seeing the development of these two characters over the course of the book gave me a better appreciation for these books, even though I enjoyed them already.As always, this book doesn't lack in laugh out loud moments (I maybe have actually laughed a few times). The same crude humor can be found within the pages, but it doesn't get in the way of the main storyline. It only enhances the book. In past books, as a reader, my enjoyment was focused more on the comedy than on what the bigger picture was. I think Sivec shows that she's grown as a writer since then to improve her story telling even more.Will I read another Chocoholics book if there is to be another? Of course. I don't think I'll be getting tired of these characters for a long time. It seems that there is an endless supply of great stories that can come out of this side of Tara Sivec.

$REVIEW.: I love this series. I love Zita. I am so sad that the series is ending but I think Ben Hatke ends it well. It brings back many of the well-loved characters and introduces new ones. All of his characters have personality, big and small. His imagination amazes me. I follow his blog and Twitter and love to see his sketches and ideas.I read this series and immediately told my teacher and librarian friends they had to get it if they didn't have it already. Boys and girls will enjoy Zita's adventures. It's a fun journey but it's also an important lesson about friendship. Highly recommend it.

The book could use more of the in-depth design areas (Like Master Bedroom, Kitchen, etc...)  There are "tips" spread throughout the plans, and I really enjoy the color photos with room specs on the floor plans.  It can keep my 5 stars, but please add the above items to keep getting those stars in future additions.

$REVIEW.: A lot here looks like it's based firmly in fact. The Pentagon, which is the setting for the main action (not all the action, though, because this is a global techno with many separate events taking place around the world that have direct impact on the action at the Pentagon, and also there are a lot of strong espionage and global crime elements in addition to the military and thriller side of the book).The assault on the Pentagon that gives the book its subtitle concerns a move by a disgraced former US general to get his revenge on the defense department, the Washington establishment, the Joint Chiefs, Congress, and many another target by taking over the huge building and holding VIPs and rank and file staff hostage until his demands are met. In time, however, it becomes very clear that the kidnapping, ransom demands and a lot of the angry rhetoric of the general is part of an artfully concocted cover for the real purpose of the assault and takeover (which I won't reveal to you of course) but which gave me this really "Oh gee whiz, why didn't I catch on sooner?" kind of moment that is one of the things that keep me returning as a fan of this type of literature.It takes a really good hand to deliver the goods with such verve and skill, but with Threatcon Delta it was a done deal.

 I thought I am not going to like this book at all


 However, I don't usually give up on a book so soon so I decided I would read a couple of chapters and if I still didn't like it I would stop and move on.Thank god I didn't stop


 This was a fabulously written book

 The story held my interest throughout


 I loved the characters...flaws and all
 Thanks to the fantastic writing, I could feel all the emotions of Styx and Mae

 It was very dark, but light as well
 I'm not sure how exactly to describe it


 I guess the love story made you accept the darkness...like Mae's love for Styx.If you are reading this review, please know I highly recommend it

 I am so glad I gave it a chance.

$REVIEW.: Josh has spent several years crafting this book and it shows.  The concepts are well-organized into linked chapters and 1-2 page sub-chapters, each with references to other books and helpful links for sharing.  He shares stories of his own life and others to keep the material engaging and relevant.  His writing is clear and understandable--making the knowledge of business accessible for people with little or no education in the field.For me, The Personal MBA was a great book to read to refresh myself on concepts that I had learned and forgotten long ago.  It also helped me identify some new tools that I can put to work in my role in analyzing my own and clients' businesses and markets.  In the handful of days since finishing it, I have already gone back to Josh's book a few times to look up something he covered.What I like most about The Personal MBA is that it does not simply cover the class structure of today's masters of business program--instead, Josh provides new, more relevant material that MBA programs still don't teach.  For example, he includes a cperhapter on how the mind works, which is incredibly useful for understanding our customers no matter what our business is.  And he sprinkles the book with concepts from the self-improvement world.  Josh understands that those of us who work in business also live in business.  Our minds, bodies, emotions, relationships and personalities come into play on the job every moment we are there, and we need to look inside to be more effective in the outside business world.

$review_text.: All I can say is Lord have Mercy! LITERALLY! I don't know how this girl keeps her feet underneath her!First and foremost, I do care for Mercy, deeply, and I trusted the way her heart was steering her...until halfway through the book! I'm ready to scream! The fan girl inside of me that root for everything good and holy is ready to RUMBLE! Mercy is always the hot topic, on the main radar of not only a Golden Boy Angel, Luke...but also a Dark Prince Sebastian and her equal in every way, Demon resident hottie Flynn


Sprinkle in a little Paul and you've basically got the hole team
But with Paul under a spell, and Flynn steering clear of her, Mercy has all the time in the world to swoon over Angel boy.Definate twists, and unpredictable turns


I found myself in awe, in tears and nearly willing to snap my kindle in half
I'm Team Flynn, so don't even get it wrong, I'm all about Angel boy and happiness, but not with our girl---I mean, Flynn's girl

A girl doesn't want a guy that will give her everything all the time, we need a challenge, Mercy needs someone that isn't always willing to do whatever spills out of her mouth! Come on, on a heart racing meter, Flynn takes that cake, no questions asked.I can't handle Luke, and I *HOPE* that's unforeseen angle..


I will rip my eyes out if Flynn doesn't have a freakin' chance in the next book, ESPEICALLY after the heart stopping ending! How can Mercy deny him any longer?!?I was blindsided, taken completely off guard....Shannon did you really have the melons to really axe that one off??!!! Let me tell you, if I feel a swift 'nevermind all is well in paradise' snafu, I'll really break a reading device.I need to see the light at the end of the tunnel, I'm itching for MORE! These characters *cough*Flynn*cough* stay with you and leave you wanting more
The Cambions series doesn't disappoint, and I'm sitting pretty for more!! If you haven't picked these up yet, might as well drown yourself in a shallow puddle for denying yourself the simplest pleasures in life, like Flynn's sexy sarcasm and rude gestures that leave you wanting more.

$REVIEW.: I found this book very intriguing.  It's not a kind of book I normally read as it is more science-fictiony than my regular mystery or smutty romance story.  I thought the idea of a town being quarantined due to a chemical spill fascinating.  Maybe it was because in my mind, that is not outside the realm of possible in real life.  The way the author described the details, like how these exposed people smelled, was very believable to me.  I actually smelled/tasted what the author described.  Very good descriptive writing without being to detailed it got boring.  Most of the characters were likable and the story unfolded with enthusiasm and swiftness without being rushed.  I was surprised at the end in a good way but I also felt very sorry for the characters.

$review_text.: As a programmer (both professionally and for fun), I often get stuck in a rut while working on complex software projects that span long amounts of time
Everyone has been in this position.For me, it doesn't matter what sort of project it is, there is always the initial period of creation / idea generation where I am extremely motivated and hard working, which always seems to abruptly end after several weeks.I tend to have a lot of project ideas, start working on them, then get bored and begin working on a new project, which is the main reason the title of this book caught my attention.I have a problem making my ideas happen


But not anymore.Scott's book is full of extremely useful advice, case studies, and experiences from numerous successful people in various fields (CEOs, artists, programmers, etc.)The book is broken into several sections, each of which discusses separate ways to help push yourself to be a more productive, efficient, happy, and motivated person.Some ideas pitched throughout the book are:- Stay organized

Keep a TODO list each day, and make each object on the TODO list simple and unambiguous.- Surround yourself with examples of your previous successes

Crossed off items from TODO lists, finished products, happy customer reviews, whatever.- Surround yourself with people who complement your skills
If you are a 'big idea' person, find a friend who is very concerned with the details of projects, and let them keep you on track
If you are a very meticulous person, pair up with a creative, who can help drive your work.- Set daily goals, and reach them


The best way to improve your work is by doing it.- Use your community (coworkers, managers, etc.) to debate with

Don't be hesitant to argue and discuss new ideas and concepts
Only through sufficient debate can the value of an idea truly be determined.Among other things, this book is practical


It has great advice, great ideas, and a good message.If you are anything like I am, always finding it hard to stay focused and motivated, then this book will be immensely useful.

$review_text.: The Good:Love the sense of reality in which the author brings us the character. There are no dainty girls who never snort or get drunk. I liked the fact that she brings the every day life events into the book, like a hormonal woman during her monthly cycle, a broken tooth that needs an emergency visit to the dentist, the simple act of changing your contact lenses or a kid waking up in the middle of the night wanting to be cuddled.  This book was very realistic and very well writtenThe author delves in very delicate subjects that unfortunately happen more often than we know. Child abuse, being overlooked simply because of the social status of the abuser. Today's economy taking its tow on businesses.This book felt like a roller coaster. One minute I was laughing and the next I was crying. I literally felt my heart flutter several times and more than once I had to stop reading to clear my vision. I haven't read a romance this good in a while.The parallel story of Jondi, Vory and Thorn was a great addition to the book and gave me a little more inside on John's mind.The Bad:Why on earth (and this is for 99% of the romance books out there), the first time the hero says "I am sorry" the heroine falls at his feet and forgives him? What happened to the "You have to work for it"?I understand John, I really do. I understand the reasons behind him hurting Livvy, but honestly, he got off the hook too easily! Although I would probably find him hard to resist too if I was Livvy...Overall, the good is so good and the bad is so insignificant that I would give it 5 stars or more! This was a fabulous book!
$SUMMARY.: Fantastic Book! It deserves more than 5 Starts.

$REVIEW.: After working undercover as gay lovers for the better part of a year, returning back to their lives wasn't easy for FBI Special Agents Alex Ware and Shawn Matthews, especially when it turns out Shawn wants to continue being Alex's lover.  Shawn has been in love with Alex for years, but out of respect for their friendship and working environment, he never revealed his feelings.  Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be, and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay. This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive.  The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable.  Once the sting was over and they made their case, things would go back to normal, so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama.  Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it.  Who wouldn't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you?  Alex wanted to believe he didn't want Shawn, but he knew he would be lying.  He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him, but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay.  I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man, and Shawn's sweet, lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle.  Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship, they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other.  The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag, with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story.  I very much enjoyed reading A Matter of Necessity, a definite Joyfully Recommended read.Leyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: This book was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was the best ever. It had an interesting premise and there was plenty of good imagery around the setting of the island. The problem for me was the characters, they fell completely flat. I didn't feel like any of them where good people and all of them were far to annoying and whiny. They constantly felt like Mary Sue characters to me each of them acted just exactly as cliche dictates they should. I will definitely keep an eye out for the next book to see if the character building improves because like I said this story has a very interesting premise.

$REVIEW.: I follow Holley Gerth's contributions to the wonderful blog, (In)courage, so I was excited to read this short e-book she wrote for the new year.  It's only 60 pages, but it's packed full with inspirational and motivational truths.  Studies show that it takes 21 days to form new, or break old, habits.  This book is divided into 21 short chapters, one for each of these habit changing days.  Gerth encourages her readers to set faithful goals and dream God-sized dreams.  She asks thought-provoking, and sometimes tough, questions but remains encouraging and judgement-free.  I recommend this book for anyone looking for her place in the world.  A practical and affirming read.4.5/5 stars

$review_text.: I've known Myke Cole had a novel coming out for the past six months. Myke and I are both part of the same medieval reenactment fighting group. I've known him for the past fifteen years, although I don't get to see him much these days. Myke is one of the most intense people I know: he's got a degree in history, worked as a civilian contractor in Iraq and currently serves as an officer in the U. S. Coast Guard. Naturally, I bought the kindle edition the first day it was available.He recently talked about the genesis of the book in a podcast interview. While working as a civilian contractor at the Pentagon, Myke started wondering what would happen if, in the myriad of departments, there was an office devoted to magical creatures. Military spec elves, werewolves, etc. Combining this with his work around the defense department, Shadow Ops was born.The book starts off with plenty of action. Oscar Britton is serving with the New Jersey Air National Guard and is flying in to stop a group of kids from burning down a high school. They're working with a federal counter-terrorism agency and closing in fast on the burning building. Just before they make contact, Their Special Ops commander, call sign "Harlequin", leaps out of the chopper and soars into the sky.Welcome to the world of the Great Reawakening.At some point in the near future, magic has begun to manifest itself in the world. People with natural magical abilities, known as "Latents" can summon fire, control water, reanimate the dead, or heal. Most of the abilities fall into designated categories: a healer is known as a "Physiomancer" for his or her ability to repair or damage flesh. Certain classifications of offensive magic, known as "Probes" (as in Prohibited) are forbidden by Geneva conventions.Since all Latents are considered potential dangers to society, they are rounded up and pressed into the Supernatural Operations Core (SOC) in the United States. Other countries have similar laws. Most Latents have very little understanding of their powers when they first manifest, each one is a potential time bomb. The novel makes references to buildings collapsing and acts of congress to suppress the Latents. The book never gives statistics, but the reader gets the feeling Latents make up less than %0.5 of the population.Those Latents who don't want to end up as state property have the choice of fleeing or joining groups of others who've manifested supernatural abilities. Known as "Selfers" they are outside the law and quickly vanish into secret government camps if arrested. In one sense, it's not hard to understand the state of emergency surrounding the manifestations. What happens when a fourteen-year-old kid suddenly can send fire down on anyone who  pisses him off? And what happens when a serial killer discovers she has magical powers?Oscar Britton soon discovers that he has prohibited powers: he can bring a gateway into place. He's a "Portamancer", one of the prohibited magical abilities. But he doesn't know how to control the ability and suddenly the gate snaps open, sending into our world dangerous creatures from the "Source", or magical, plane. All of which makes him a dangerous fugitive from the law. Britton decides to run, but, like the song says, he doesn't get far.Britton finds himself thrown into a training coven of the Sorcerer's Apprentice program in the US Army. He's given the choice of signing up or execution. Naturally, he chooses to sign. But the government has another way of keeping him in line: an explosive implant next to his heart. If Britton runs or gates out, they will detonate it. The training camp where he finds himself is on the Source world where the army has established a Forward Operating Base (FOB). Many of the local inhabitants, small green-skinned creatures known as goblins, have declared war on the base and are constantly bombarding it with magical weapons at every chance. Others work inside the base with the humans.It's a little to easy to compare this novel with current events. And I do see lot of similarities between the Jihadis in Afghanistan or Iraq. But this is a fantasy novel first and foremost. Myke does tackle a lot of moral issues in Shadow Ops: what is the right thing to do if your government is taking immoral actions to stop evil? How do you keep society intact without become a sadistic monster? The military doesn't come off in the best light in this novel: Britton's training warrant office, Fitzsimmons is portrayed as a brute.At the same time, the Selfers aren't shown to be much better. The Apache nation rises up in revolt against the US government with the help of magic. The rebels have no hesitation of massacring anyone who opposes them. There's a gripping scene in a New York Sewer where the SOC conscripts and the local SWAT team battles a protoplasmic Selfer monstrosity.The novel ends with a lot of the issues unresolved. We never really do find out why the military has established a fire base on the Source world. Nor do we find out why some of the Goblins cooperate with the human military. I suspect more will be revealed in the next book since it's been marketed as a series. Still, I'm old-fashioned enough to want my books concluded by the final page.This is an excellent first novel by a new writer. Don't go into this book expecting Starship Troopers with wizards. But it is a compelling read.

$REVIEW.: 3.5 StarsI always love a good story that has some mythology and gods to it. In this one we get to see a little known goddess, Nemesis, daughter of Hera and Zeus. In this version, Zeus is just as nasty as the myths would have us believe. Rape and lies to get what he wants. This is the first version I've seen where Hera wasn't depicted as a petty, vindictive shrew and that was a nice surprise. There are other supernatural creatures in this and we get to meet a couple. The mystery was solid and the romance was well played out.The serial killer angle was underexplored, I felt. We had a brief glimpse into his twisted psyche and that was all. A couple other glances during the ongoing search for the serial killer would have fleshed it out nicely I think. Also it was mentioned several times that the helper to the killer had some evil energy emanating from him. Then nothing was ever done with it or explained further so I was left mildly confused by that.This book is the first in a series that is a spin-off of a previous series written by Ms. Pineiro. There is mention of other characters that I am sure if I had read the previous series, I might know who they were. Also other mentions of other immortals but not many details are given. I felt like I might have been missing something. I would not recommend this book as a standalone.That said, I still enjoyed the book and the romance between Helene and Miguel was wonderful. I love how you could see her change as she fell more in love with him. Slowly you could feel him healing from his past experiences. I really loved the progression of their story. This is the first book I have read by Ms. Pineiro and not the last. I will be interested to go back and read the series that comes before this one.

$REVIEW.: Most hard-core 6-day, young earth creationists will absolutely hate this book.  The thought is that the historical church has always taught from a young earth perspective.  The fact is that a large number of great figures in chuch history held vastly different ideas about the age of the earth and the six days of creation.  Ross' progressive creationism, or day-age theory, is not a new idea.  Most young earthers hear &quot;billion year old universe&quot; and immediately connect it to Darwinian evolution.  Hugh Ross is not proposing Darwinism.  In fact, his position adamantly opposes Darwinism and gives the Christian real, scientific evidence to discredit it.Although I don't agree with everything that Hugh Ross teaches, I think we have to consider the possibility of the day-age theory.  In an evangelical world where Christians are called to deny all scientific knowledge of the age of the universe, Ross' treatment of the Genesis creation account is a refreshing look at how science does not oppose Biblical Christianity.

I believe that statement is self serving from  Muslim who dosn't want to admit that his religion is one of hate for non-believers. The message enclosed in this book is a wakeup call from someone who, centuries ago, changed his writings based on his perception of how the world should be, not how people can be.

$REVIEW.: If I had to use one word to describe this book it would Strange, but it was a good strange. The start was pretty rocky and I know a couple of people who gave up on it because of it, I only kept reading cause it was just so strange I had to find out what was going on, and that's basically what kept me going through the first half of the book.The MC, Alice, was soo wishy washy...It's like she was in shock or something throughout most of the book, she just goes along with everything and barely questions what is going on. I get the Angels were being incredibly evasive with everything AND underhanded, sneaky little bastards really, but mygod, everyone kept saying how important Alice was, but she just takes it anyway! She doesn't use it for her advantage. She only gets somewhat of a backbone by the last 1/3rd of the book, and her being the 'secret weapon' it makes for a very disappointing one.Alice's lack of toughness for the majority of the book aside, the single most frustrating and annoying thing were the Angels. They were sneaky, evasive, underhanded, manipulative and just plain a-holes. They were so bad I was rooting for the Fallen, which is saying something seeing as how they torture people for fun. I was so happy when they got what they deserved by the end :DThe turning point for me in the story was when Alice goes down to Hell, now that's when the good stuff starts (which is like halfway through the book). The descriptions of the levels of hell, the punishments, the cold gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'when hell freezes over'. This is when Morgan's unique writing style really shines, and the epic battle that takes place is pretty damn awesome. Everything more or less gets explained at the end, and it was incredibly satisfying when Micheal dishes out the punishment, it totally made up for my wanting to beat up some of them throughout the book *cough*Gywn*cough*Gabriel*cough*. Divine retribution at it's best!So, for those of you who gave up during the first half, try to soldier on, because the second half totally makes up for it.

$review_text.: Sophie just started college and feels like she has enough going on in her life with missing her long distance relationship, her family drama and school. When she gets kidnapped and dragged to another realm to meet the mysterious Adrian, she had no idea what was really in store for her.I really liked the idea for this book, a retelling of the Hades/Persephone story, which is right up there with my favorite tale period. Unfortunately, this book fell a little flat for me. It is completely possible that it was my fault because my expectations were too high and I judge harshly when it comes to a story that I know so well.The modern day story was really great, how everyone has past lives and no memories of them, a secret society trying to stop people from becoming immortals, the realm of the dead. All of it was an interesting twist, and like nothing else I have read before. Where I started to have problems was the past life story as the &#8220;Gods&#8221;. I found myself disengaging from the book when the two main characters were having flash backs, because at times it felt so tedious. Yes I was interested in finding out their origins, but there was a lot of repetition going on. I feel like I was hit over the head with the fact Hades was a young strong man of 17, and that he had a sweet wife who died. I really only need to be told something once and I am good. I just wanted it to wrap up already and get to the part about him and Persephone, instead of tons of back story I actually received. I guess I needed it to get a feel for all the characters, but I got to the point where I just didn&#8217;t care anymore. Maybe it is prudish of me, but I didn&#8217;t want to hear about Hades sexual prowess and romances before Persephone. In my head, it is only the two of them, always and forever. Sappy and unrealistic, I know, but that is how it is. I sped through it to get to the modern day story that I had become invested in.I thought Sophie was kind of wishy-washy. She goes to a strange realm, is told about her past and starts dreaming about it, including being fluent in a new language, and she believes she must have been drugged and is hallucinating. If there is a drug that causes someone to learn a foreign language overnight, sign me up. I understand the need to not necessarily join the band wagon of crazy instantly, but when given facts it is hard to hold on to doubt. There were so many cases of her fluctuating between completely believing everything and thinking it was all made up and that Adrian was insane and dangerous. There were a few moments where I wanted to shake her and tell her to accept being Persephone and jump Hades, who obviously is hers. But alas, she did not hear me. By the end of the book I liked her much better and it seemed like she finally got her head on straight to embrace the insane.Adrian was easier for me to like instantly. He may have kept things hidden from Sophie for her &#8220;protection&#8221;, but his mind was completely straightforward and he really was devoted to Sophie. I just wanted him to sweep her off her feet and give her no choices, but alas he is not that alpha/caveman.Overall it was a really unique story and an ok read. There were parts I did not like and parts I absolutely loved. This is definitely the first in a new series and I think I will need to read the next book to see what happens next.I received this book from the author and Goodreads in exchange for my honest review

$REVIEW.: The common wisdom as expressed in dozens of World War II histories was that the German army developed 'Blitzkrieg' tactics of mast moving armor using air power as front line artillery between the wars, field tested the concept in Poland and then put it to it's full us in France.Dr. Frieser, is an infantry officer in the Military History Research Institute of the Bundeswehr in Potsdam. He analyzed the French campaign -- called 'Case Yellow' by the German Army and says, 'No.'He presents some excellent arguments that the Germans were as surprised as the rest of the world at how fast the Allied armies collapsed.This book is likely to become one of the standard references on the German campaign in France. First it is written from the German side - not all that common in the available literature. Second it is extensively researched and references point to a huge array of material not commonly seen. Third, it illustrates that there was no magic on the part of the German officers, just good leadership, especially at the middle levels.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: A great start to a new series by Jessie Evans. Set in a great small town with tons of fabulous characters, the story of Mia and Sawyer is a fun sexy read you don't want to miss. She is back in her hometown taking care of herself after a disastrous prior relationship. He is in town to bid on a job, that's it. No relationships for him!! But the attraction between them is undeniable. I highly recommend everyone read this one!

$REVIEW.: Although i found it a little repetitive and long-winded in parts, the story was still compelling and should be compulsory reading for anyone in an abusive/manipulating relationship or in the dating scene. Having said that, I'm still finding it hard to believe that this story is true! Yes, you can be blinded by love, conned etc but to have a man who works for the government and has no money for food?? Who year after year comes up with dire, life-threatening reasons for urgent large amounts of cash?? To never actually meet any of his family in 6 years?? 6 YEARS OF THIS?? I found it eye-opening and informative but at the same time I found it almost impossible to feel any kind of empathy for this daft, gullible woman. I'm sorry but anyone that stupid for that long is just asking to be taken for a ride....it's just plain sad. And to liken it to the abuse suffered by rape and molestation victims in terms of not being ashamed to speak up...pfft...there is no choice in rape or molestation, whereas the author did have a choice and more or less allowed herself to be a victim...and that IS shameworthy.

$REVIEW.: Sasha McCandless and Leo Connelly are facing their hardest challenge at the weekend - planning their wedding to satisfy Sasha's demanding mother. Their plans are thwarted on Friday afternoon when a huge amount of discovery paper for contract case due to be heard on Monday about the supply of herbal ingredients for a popular health kick drink is delivered by her old employer who represents the other party. The weekend becomes a paper trail not a wedding trail.On the same day Bodhi King, the forensic pathologist who carried out the autopsies three young women who died recently in Pittsburgh from Myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart muscle, finds that the computer files of the autopsies have been deleted from both his office network and from his laptop and his notebook containing jottings on these cases has disappeared. He is told by his boss not to worry and not to investigate if there is a connection between these deaths. He goes to Leo for advice because he is the only person he knows with the kind of background that might help him. The next day Leo finds that Bodhi is to be dismissed for improper conduct.Leo calls Sasha "A trouble magnet". Bodhi's troubles becomes Sasha's troubles as the two issues converge when it becomes clear the ingredients of the health drink may have caused the deaths. Along the way Sasha and Leo uncover a lot of  dirty business and political deals, even involving murder.Melissa Miller has crafted another complex and at times pretty unbelievable plot with her favourite characters mixing law with trouble. I have read all of Melissa Miller's legal thrillers featuring Sasha McCandless and have enjoyed them despite some unbelievable plots.Read the book to find out more about the fate of the wedding plans.
$SUMMARY.: Another easy-reading Sasha McCandless legal thriller

$review_text.: This book started out with some potential, but goes downhill quickly. The dialogue is plodding and never-ending. The leads arent all that likable. She is an odd throwback to June Cleaver, but somehow is a top news anchor, highly unbelievable rather bimbo like female. He is supposed to be some super smart alpha male, but he's a bully and a jerk most of the time, with not alot of saving graces. Before I quit reading this I wondered if it was written decades ago and just released, it has the flavor of an older 80's romance novel. Perhaps that is what "classic" in the title means. My recommendation is to pass on this one.

$REVIEW.: I must confess that I didn't find this books as impressive asMuscling Through, but it's difficult to reach the heights of Al's narration.The protagonist, Tim, was very likable. He's at a life-changing moment. His wife left him for another guy, his brother had an accident and he asks Tim to help him keep his bike shop open. Matt is his brother's employee, he's nice, open and a klutz. He also stirs what Tim has tried to deny for a lifetime.The book's romantic story is slow building, because there are a lot of issues the two protagonists have to solve. Tim has to come out to the world and to win Matt over. Matt is in a relationship with a man who appears to be overly possessive. The story develops in a matter of weeks, but it doesn't feel too rushed. Tim is really at a point in his life where he is re-evaluating everything. I liked his relationship with his family, the fact that he was always almost dismissed in his endeavors because he was the quiet one. It was as if Tim didn't want to engage with life. There are a few things Tim does for himself, like karate, but everything else just happens to him, from the job to his wife and finally to the new chapter of his life. Matt's the key who makes Tim consider something different. With Matt's mirage Tim rides a bike instead of his BMW after ten years, he tries vegetarian food and he finally accepts and explores his sexuality. In the meantime, Matt's relationship reveals some unsettling trouble.The humor is wonderful, there's an interesting Brit flavour, the writing must be really good because I didn't give it a thought, and there's Wolverine, one of the best cats I've met in a book. The secondary characters - Tim's wife, his whole family, Matt's mate Adam, the deplorable Steve - are well developed and all show different sides during the story. I realize I haven't written very much about Matt, but he's such an adorable klutz and so so young, almost lost until Tim shakes him up and makes him re-think his relationship with Steve more by example than by talking.There's a little bit of insta-love, I think, and it doesn't take much for Tim to change everything in his life, but it's a feel-good book and even if it doesn't have a mystery, the most dramatic events are dealt with a sort of understatement, there's nothing paranormal, it settles around you and it's a wonderful contemporary romance.Worth a re-read or two or three. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: I love this series. If you are looking for sci-fi romance/space travel, then this is the book for you. The characters, Becca, Far and Truth each had their dark moments to deal. Just when you think you have it figured out&#8230;something else happens. Ms Anderson has definitely explained the journey of these three very well with easy flow descriptions in such a way, you cannot put this book down. Due to my own real life issues at home, it took me three days to read the book. But let me tell you... i was definitely asking questions in between. I loved how Garron was introduced and OMG! i think im in love, lol. I was feeling all the emotions the reader is meant to feel whilst reading. I cried a little, but it was worth it. I simply cannot wait for the next one. One last thing&#8230;the length of this book is what really made it. If it was any shorter&#8230;i feel alot of the story would have been lacking.

$review_text.: I read the first book a while back but could not forget the love story between Yani and Alex.  They share a love that many search for but never find.  The sequel is just as heart-warming, gut wrenching and entertaining as the first.  Through Alex and Yani you find that love is all that matters and the stuff in between builds up the love not tear it down.  And with Asia, playing it safe just because the person is seen as a good catch means nothing to heart.  The heart wants what the heart wants it is up to the owner of the heart to decide if it is worth it.  I highly recommend the book for a good read.  You will not put it down!

And you know what they say about judging books by covers . . .This is a perfect MG story:* young, brilliant, and brave characters* non-stop, Indiana Jones-style storyline (which is doubly true since it's an archaeology adventure)* biblical myths, hidden treasure, booby traps, scorpions, and faceless beasts* kidnapping and world traveling* and ALL things awesome!It hooked me right away and held me riveted all the way through.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 Stars ~ A dear friend of mine (you know who you are) can't read anything scary or disturbing. I adore it, which is why I'm always the one reading zombie apocalypse and serial killer stories. I'm just slightly twisted that way. Apparently, so are authors Sue Brown, Jamie Fessenden, Eli Easton, and Kim Fielding, as they've written this anthology of stories entitled 'Stitch', a play on the Frankenstein myths. I was deliriously happy to read it and adored every moment of spine-tingling chills combined with moments of absolute beauty and heartbreak.The Golem of Mala Lubovnya by Kim FieldingThe golem was created by the town's Rabbi to protect his congregation against power hungry men. But the golem grows lonely, living alone in the attic, only looking out the window at the world, watching people go by, and especially watching the father and sons building the house below. The youngest son, Jakob, a stone mason, the golem watches particularly intensely. He seems lonely, too, even though he is surrounded by family and can walk about in the world. The golem is left in the attic for a long time and he wonders if his master has forgotten about him.Then it seems that danger might come to Mala Lubovnya, so the Rabbi lets his people know about the golem. That is how the golem ends up working outside with Jakob, helping Jakob to build his home. Jakob calls him Emet, which means 'truth', and is what the Rabbi stenciled into the golem's clay chest. Jakob and Emet become friends and Emet begins to learn why Jakob is so sad all the time. For, you see, Jakob is not interested in girls and this is a sin against his God. Emet doesn't understand how two people loving each other could be worse than hate and violence, but he keeps his questions to himself, just happy to spend time with Jakob. And Emet and Jakob fall in love. Soon the violence comes to their village and it is up to Emet to fulfill his duty.Kim Fielding is a much loved author of mine because of the beauty in her writing. In this short story 'The Golem of Mala Lubovnya', the author has created an incredible story, not just of love, but of life and what it means to live it.Watchworks by Jamie FessendenI couldn't help but be reminded of Johnny Depp in 'Edward Scissorhands' when I started reading about Luke Prescott. Luke has a prosthetic/mechanical arm which has broken. His employer, Dr. Stewart, has become too old and his hands too arthritic to be able to fix Luke's arm. Which is why Dr. Stewart has retained the services of prominent watchmaker Harland Wallace. Harland is shocked when he discovers what he is to work on, but feels it's only fair to help the poor man. Little does Harland know the full extent of what he's getting himself into.Harland is beyond traumatized when he discovers that Luke isn't a man, at all, but the most advanced automaton Dr. Stewart could build. Besides this fact, Harland is horrified to discover he feels arousal over this machine, this creature that isn't even a man. Harland tries to stay away but in the face of the doctor&#8217;s declining health, Harland is the only one who can properly care for Luke. It is during these times that Harland must face the fact that Luke may be a machine, but for all intents and purposes, he thinks, he feels, and he reasons, making him very attractive to Harland.When the doctor passes away from his illness, the servants attack and desecrate Luke in their fear and hatred of him. Luckily for Harland, the doctor leaves everything to Harland in his will, thus ensuring that Luke will be taken care of. However, Harland must repair the damage done to Luke, to the man he's grown to love, before they can move forward.An utterly fascinating addition to this book, Jamie Fessenden gave me a story to think about, to ponder what makes us who we are, and to wonder whether a soul can live within a machine. I greatly enjoyed this story and will need to look for more works by this author.Reparation by Eli EastonI'm a true fan of science fiction and of Eli Easton, so I was not surprised, in the least, that she delivered such an incredible addition to this anthology. Edward is a spore farmer on his home world of Kalan, a harsh and desolate planet that can kill the weak in an instant. After a carriage accident, Edward is rescued by Knox, one of his recon laborers, half man and half machine. Knox is different from the other recons whom Edward employs. Knox almost looks human, he can read, and he seems to recall bits and pieces of knowledge from the human part of him who lived before. This is not normal for reconstituted slaves, built from machines and human remains of executed prisoners, cyborgs, essentially.Because of Edward's injuries from the accident, and the loss of his right-hand man, he takes a chance and asks Knox to manage the spore harvest, overseeing the other laborers too, while Edward works the factory. Edward also insists that Knox move into the house from the barracks to now separate him from the other slaves. Winter begins, the workdays grow shorter, and Edward and Knox's time together in the evenings in front of the fire, reading, talking, playing chess, grows longer. The attraction they both feel intensifies. But, as the days go by, Knox's memories become more clear and he understands that he was a prisoner, executed, and his brain put into a different body. Knox remembers his other body and begins to know who he was, before. Unfortunately, who Knox was before is the reason that Edward lost his father and his brother and why he is all alone now struggling to run the farm.What an incredible story! I loved every minute of it, Eli. Knox and Edward are amazing characters and their love story is sublime. A true tale of heartache and redemption.Made for Aaron by Sue BrownAaron's parents had him committed to an insane asylum when he was a teenager because Aaron is a homosexual. It wasn't illegal to be gay, but his parents were very religious and they had a lot of influence and money so people looked the other way. In the asylum is where Aaron met and fell in love with Damon, a nurse. They've been together for over eighteen years and have now married and made a life and a home together. Until Aaron receives a call from the hospital that Damon has been in a car accident and Aaron needs to get there as soon as possible. Except, when Aaron gets there, Damon is gone. He has disappeared. Damon was pronounced dead at the hospital and forty-five minutes later, he got up and walked out.Strangely enough, just a day after Damon's Lazarus routine, their home is burglarized and trashed. The police are investigating but it all seems rather odd. What I thought was unusual was that Aaron and Damon didn't have any friends or family, no one Aaron can call for help or support. They both devoted their lives solely to one another. Damon appears to be the only person Aaron ever needed, and because of Aaron's trauma with the asylum, Damon took the role of gently asserting dominance over Aaron in decision making and dealing with any authority figures. A picture begins to form for the police and Aaron. A picture that shows there is no record of Damon existing before he met Aaron, no record of his graduating from nursing school, no family, no prior jobs. No life.Oh how I would love to tell you what Aaron discovered, but, I can't. You're going to have to read this incredible final story in the book to get the answers. Believe me when I say, I thought it was going one way and then it zigged and zagged in a whole new direction. Absolutely fabulous, Sue!NOTE: This book was provided by Dreamspinner Press for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews

$REVIEW.: Let me start this by saying that when I first read this book, I had just started delving into the subject of "other religions".  So, if you are in that position, wanting to see what other belief systems have to say, READ THIS BOOK.  He discusses how Christianity and Buddhism are related in their beliefs.  Truth is truth no matter who says it.  Being able to see how Christian truth is similar to, or the same as, Buddhist truth was very enlightening.  Before reading this, Buddhism was a foreign object to me.  After reading this, Buddhism was still foreign but it made me want to read more about Buddhism to become more familiar with it.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I was really looking forward to reading this book due to the whammy of a cliffhanger book one ended with, but unfortunately this one didn't wow me like Ruined By You did.I found Maggie to be very immature compared to book one. &lt;spoiler> 1) The way she wanted to break-up with Haden so that he would go on tour instead of just talking to him. 2) Dropping college to go on tour with him without a second thought....what about a long distance relationship? 3) The whole getting drunk & making a fool of herself in the bar was a bit uncomfortable.I understand that they love each other but Haden being willing to drop all of his life long dreams to stay with Maggie is a little unrealistic. If he had done that he would have eventually resented her.I didn't really like the way that Maggie just decided to not go to college to follow him on tour. She needs to be a bit more independent before making such an enormous decision.The author did a WONDERFUL job of handling Maggie's mothers illness and death. I have witnessed a loved one dying from cancer and her depiction of it was spot on. She captured all of the pain and regret that goes along with it. &lt;/spoiler>This book was enjoyable but it lacked the intensity that book one had. I look forward to read more of Kelly Harper's books.

$REVIEW.: I have to admit, I absolutely love Red! That pup has the greatest mix of sarcasm, intelligence, and puppy attitude EVER!This story is a bit different than most romances given the nature of the main character who just so happens to be blind


The story is told from her PoV so the people, places, things, etc don't have much of a physical description other than what Red or someone else tells her


there is a lot of description for smell, touch, hearing, and tasting though


Especially in the sex scenes

Which to me gave those scenes a more intimate feel


Instead of the description of the sex scenes focusing on the looks of the lovers, it delves deeper to an almost emotional level.I did spot a few small errors here and there.


I think it was like two and it just a wrong tense of a word


Nothing drastic
It won't impede reading and won't distract very much either.I particularly liked the military tactics Bas and David use to sabotage each other

Those scenes will give the reader many times of giggles I can assure you.I'm still trying to figure out how Red can talk, I guess that's a mystery to every one.I look forward to reading Color Blind which is book 2 in this series to find out what mischief Red can get Teresa, David, and Bas in next.I give this book 5 of 5 pawscusreviewsS

$REVIEW.: I like everyone else have done pretty much every diet there is.  I'm even a Weight Watcher's lifetime member of over 20 years.  The thing is, I'm  in my mid 50's and I now realize that with WW's it's not just about points.  I now know that it's alot harder now to lose any weight and it's not just about losing weight.  It's about eating healthy foods and retaining muscle, but not gaining in the process of aging.This program was almost overwhelming when I got the program.  There was alot of information.  Best thing to do is open it up and do exactly what they say...use the "Start Here First" dvd.  IF you just following along, it isn't bad at all.  There is a series of dvd's that are around 10- 15 mins that I just listened to when I was getting ready for work every morning.  The dvd's actually reinforces and answers questions to the daily planner book.  It's not hard either to following the planner.  It's basically a daily bit of information and some checkoff's of things like drinking water and whatever they ask you to change.Let's see... I'm past the 21 days program and am very happy after many months of not losing any pounds or inches actually seeing some results.  A little is great for me.  I found the program is very easy to follow and I really like that I don't have to count points or calories.  I did count calories in the beginning because I was sceptical at first that I wouldn't gain weight.  I finally got to where I figured I wasn't going to be any worse off than I was when I started.I was surprise that by just combining protein, slow carbs and fast carbs that I could lose weight.  I used to read about plans which were like 50%- 25% - 25% plans and had a hard time understanding how to do that.  I wasn't confused on this planPro's:After the first week, a very easy plan to follow.Actually seeing resultsPackage of information is very thoroughLike that there's also information for continuing the plan after hitting my goalI bought it here on Amazon for $80 instead of $120 (not that it isn't worth it)I like that I'm not restricted to one type food.Cons:Hmmm...I don't mind carrying my book around to help me remember fast and slow carbs, but it would be nice if Provida offered the online plan to people who own the handon program.  Guess it's no different than Weight Watchers offering their plan separately, but really...what's the difference if you have it in print already.Honestly, that's about the only con other than sometimes I have a hard time getting in the slow carbs.  I really do like the "bad stuff" :)

$REVIEW.: This is a must read for romance lovers and BDSM lovers alike. I rarely write reviews for books, but this one had me feeling the emotions of the heroine. I caught myself tearing up when she was in pain, and actually smiling when she was happy. Well written, never boring, and it's quite obvious the author knows her stuff when it comes to BDSM.

$REVIEW.: Smith analyzes with remarkable precision the decline of a singular, Midwestern church and, by doing so, throws into stark relief the plague that has been festering and afflicting the new generation of Christians who have increasingly voiced discontent with the U.S. church. Smith provides with ironic conciseness a prognosis for the church to find its way to meaningful existence and success within local communities.Smith's command of the English language and his exhaustive understanding of contemporary Christian issues crystallizes into a sound argument bound to provide overwhelming relief to a sub-population among U.S. Christians who have long suspected that Christianity meant something more than what they currently see.

 The setting was unusual and it could have led to an interesting story, but it didn't, at least for me
 I couldn't care about the main character and found her wishy-washy and whiny about her personal life
I gave up a little over halfway through the book

I thought most of the character dysfunctional, and couldn't get into the &#34;mystery&#34;.If you can't care who did it, why bother?

$REVIEW.: After falling for a "bad guy" in college that ended in heartbreak and her mother beating her over the head with I told you so Elle Walser has decided to go for a safe man even if its not one that gets her heart racing but at least it wont be one of the boring men her mother keeps picking out for her. She decides she is going crawl into bed with her boss who hasn't taken any of the clues she has been leaving that she would like to start a relationship. She works as a art coordinator at gallery owned by Nathan Schultz who was in the army with her brother Ian and who she thinks she is crawling into bed with. Well turns out Nathan's older brother is in town and is sleeping in the master bedroom in the loft above the gallery.Things are going really well - Elle is so turned on by what this man is doing to her and ends up having the best orgasm of her life when he speaks and she realizes this isnt Nathan. When the lights come on and she see that he is covered in tattoos and that turns her on her old issues of "bad guys" return she runs out in embarrassment before finding out who the man really was.Gabe Schultz thinks he is having the best dream of his life. It doesn't take him long to realize its not a dream but who is he to stop this woman that is so set on seducing him. After she runs he goes to wake his brother up to find out who this woman was. He decides that he wants to get to know her better and he is tired of living the single life and this woman intrigued him.From here we get a double personality Elle. In Elle's heart she knows the type of man she really wants but her head wont let her go down what it thinks is road to heart break and with the years of her mother's opinion on what a lady should act like and go for in a man Elle comes off as a snobby stuck up woman to Gabe as he tries and pursues her. Gabe doesn't let this deter him and finally breaks Elle down to give him a chance.This was a great story about two people who on the outside are complete opposites but cupid doesn't always care about that.I hope that in the future there are books for Nathan and Ian.

$review_text.: Or should I say Aiken/ Laurenston /Ashley/ Gardner/ James? Very prolific writer and I love her shifter and dragon stories for a light hearted read. This is a novella and that is reflected in the price which was reasonable. I wish she could pull her stories from the anthologies her work appears in and publish them in one volume. I read this one almost as soon as I downloaded it and it will probably become one of my bedtime books as I prefer light reading then. Buy this one and have a fun evening.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a huge wine drinker. Okay, not even a sometimes wine drinker. I'll have a sangria once in awhile, but never order wine with my dinner or when at a bar. What this means when I'm invited over for wine with friends, is usually beating a path directly to their liquor cabinet. Finally, this book (which all of my friends are getting copies of) lets me appreciate wine, with the extra punch of juice/soda/liqueur I require in order to find it tasty.The recipes are so good here, that there really doesn't seem to be a good enough reason to drink wine on its own anymore anyway. And honestly, who can resist drinks with names like the Italian Adonis, Monks Converge, Magic Man, and Witch in White?

I love itwhen authors of historical fiction discuss period philosophy.

 WTF was all those tag warnings for?  The book is almost done and there has still not been any sex in the book

$REVIEW.: Some of my favorite movies are about returning to earth after dying; Merullo's Revere beach Boulevard is one of my all-time favorite novels; and I enjoy golf

Golfing With God seemed to be a perfect novel for me! Merullo's story of a golfer in heaven who returns to earth to help God with His/Her golf game was a bit obvious and simplistic in its lessons about life
There were enough scenes and lines that did make me smile, and there were some golf scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed


This earned three stars from me mostly because I liked it enough that I was not really tempted to stop partway through
This is a short, fast read, and had it been longer, I may have decided to stop, but I was curious about where it was going

I found this novel mildly amusing for the most part, and if you love golf, you might enjoy it, too

I do not recommend this to non-golfers, as the golf was the best part
I actually hope that Merullo someday writes another novel about golf, a more earthly undertaking.

As opposed to the other reviewer I felt there was only one story where the man "manipulated" and worked the situation, but by all means the girl never demured and did in fact play along. Nothing explotatie here except the great sex. Fun little scenarios of fantasy that most, if not all of us have had. To each their own though. I really found these stories fun.

$REVIEW.: I read a Lot of paranormal. Let's face it, I need a twelve step program, I read so much. I initially rated this 4 stars but the went back to 3 because I'm just not emotionally invested enough to buy the next book. if there Is another book? I assume so as it was left, not exactly with a cliffhanger ending, but open ended. This book has some differences from every other vampire, Lycan book out there which set it off to a good start. It had Real potential.The storyline had me invested as did most of the characters. I wanted to feel empathy for Kate but she was very selfish and self centered. Of course, the coven mostly encouraged and enabled that. I totally loved Lucas. There were lots of editing issues. Typos, grammatical errors. Sometimes you just fixed the entire sentence in your head. Annoying and not deserving of a 5 star rating. I don't understand Why I keep seeing so much of this, because most of us would not turn this in to our high school English teacher. Sigh. But the real reason for the reduction to 3 stars stems from my disappointment with a bit of a spoiler......stop reading here if that bugs you. There is a big fight scene that is so totally unrealistic that I was disgusted with it. I Know it's Fiction and Paranormal Fiction at that but apparently I am more willing to believe in a Vampire/Lycan fight than I am fighters stopping to chat and hold Hallmark touchy freely moments in the middle of a battle for life and death. A good story gone bad.

$REVIEW.: This was the perfect ending for an incredible and amazing series. You Mrs. Romig are the master of deceit and appearances. I loved your books. All of them. there wasn't one book where I didn't want to cry or felt angst, or wanted to cut someone's ba"#%&$#/s. I was immensely happy on how this book was written and finished. I think The Missing Years provided a great closure to this long and wonderful journey. This story will be in my heart forever. This book exceeded my expectations and even though I knew what was at the end of it I still felt stressed for everyone's future. All those POV gave me a different perspective of certain characters and others just made me hate them more. I don't say they can't be forgiven, but at least Tony owned his sh"#&t; and was upfront of how evil he could be or he would be. I also love how easy she can make us fall off track with all those twists and turns. I wish I could say more without spoiling anything but unfortunately that something that I'll do on goodreads and hide them as spoilers because I just need to get somethings out of my chest. Of course it won't be anything we already read on Convicted...but still. I want to congratulate Aleatha for that sharp and witty mind of hers that made this series possible. I loved your books! I will definitely read anything else you write and of course I already requested my papaebacks for 1.5, 2.5 and 4. this is a must have in paperback story.Oh! and after everything I've seen on Game of Thrones on HBO everything is valid on TV and I pray that someday someone will want to make this series a TV show or at least a mini-show with enough episodes to cover the whole 6 books.

$review_text.: I have to say, I was disheartened by the previous Kalquor book, "Sister Katherine" which was too much of a sexathon for me, but I'm interested in the series again with "Alien Caged."  Again, the author has found a way to portray another aspect of Earthlings & Kalquorians.  Here, the Kalquorians are the ones at the mercy of the Earthlings and also for another cool unique approach, the heroine is middle aged and post menopause.  This story is much more romantic than others in this genre as the heroine and her Kalquor hunks gradually got to know each other.  Their relationship was built up slowly and convincingly - not the usual, alpha male conking the female on the head and then dragging her off to the cave for sex.  "Alien Caged" was also written in a wonderful thriller tone so you kept wondering how some of the side characters would fare.  I also appreciated that the side characters were flawed (as in the reluctant captain of the ship) and weren't two-dimensional.I'm really glad that the author toned down the BDSM element she usually has in her Kalquor books.  I never really liked that and usually skipped those sections.  Also, I think I only heard the word "warbled" once which always gave me a "huh?, what is the heroine, a bird?" moment as I was reading her past books.Look forward to the next installation in the Kalquor series if it's as good as this one.

$REVIEW.: Brilliant book. The reasoning is tight and solid. The "meditation" chapters, while they seem to slow down the "action", are very germane and contain things I have never thought of about many difficult Scriptural passages. Not to mention intriguing ire toward even God occasionally, and much honest confessions of confusion on the part of the author. The chapters that directly reason on the topic of pacifism are great. Brimlow shows how just war theory is self-contradictory - a great but subtle argument, and then shows how Jesus' teachings are uncompromisingly pacifistic. His actions were too, as when he told Peter to put the sword away. No one could be more innocent than Christ, and if defending the most innocent person who ever lived is not allowed, how can it be allowed for others less innocent? Brimlow then argues that, while pacifism appears ineffective, that is the short term view. Look at Jesus' pacifistic yielding to death. Just after the crucifixion, his life appeared a total failure. Yet he has influenced western culture for 2000 years more than any other individual. Brimlow's final argument is that what we are called to do is cull out violence even from our thinking, and we do this by prayer and lives dedicated to merciful acts toward those less fortunate than ourselves. A great book. A wonderful, but almost terrifying argument, full of emotion as well as logic.
$SUMMARY.: Fabulous, glorious book

$review_text.: This was the first book that I've read written by Cassia Leo and let me say that it was amazing! I love the development of the story, especially the characters


For me, Claire was a great heroine


She has the good, innocent traits but she has these deep secrets that made up her nature and they all go perfectly together


I felt like I was on the emotional rollercoaster with her
You couldn't help but like her and all that she went through

I loved loved loved Adam Parker!! He was the perfect bad boy! He had all the typical bad boy traits that made him sexy and mysterious but deep inside was that sweet nature that made you fall in love with him
I was very happy with the outcome of this first book
I really hope the story turns out the way that I would like it to cause I don't know if I can handle anything different

But I'm sure it will be great anyway and I can't wait for more

I will definitely be reading more from Cassia Leo! What a great writer and story teller!*Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review*

The author Betty is a modest teenager who is bold while being matter of fact and subtle- and she is able to convey with great nuance what is felt like to navigate the Nazi oocupied Poland during the height of the madness as a teenager .This lengthy memoir, a tale of youthful triumph against such huge odds, is satisfying and keeps the reader on the edge of one's seat.

$review_text.: I was so excited about this project until I found that Mr. Morford has gone through the Bible from front to back, changing the word fear to reverence. I don't want to be unkind but this is simply a lack of experience in that he has allowed himself to be led down a path so easily. Is Mr. Morford offended by the concept of fear of God? There is one who is much more offended than he.Like Genesis 3:11, We have to ask, Who told you that fear just means reverence? When he found something that "didn't make sense," perhaps he should be digging a little deeper to let the Bible interpret itself. Although I am saddened, I am far from surprised. For the last 20 years, at least, the idea that fear just means reverence has been sweeping through western Christianity.You cannot dabble long in spiritual things without coming to the realization that intelligent evil exists in the unseen realm. If you are wise you will study God's word with humility to discover how this evil typically misleads us and what doorway it uses. Beginning in the Garden of Eden we see that evil aims its attack directly at our reasoning capacity. Why? As you should know as a Christian, your thinking ability is inferior to that of your enemy. The first word God uses to describe the serpent is "subtle." That means you aren't going to catch the lie unless you are equipped as we will soon discuss.Following the fall in the Garden, and by "fall" understand it was falling from walking by spiritual communication with God down into walking solely in the thoughts and reasonings of the human brain -  not a good place to be in regards to dealing with intelligent evil - God gave us a new technique, which is really nothing more than a mental trick - once you understand how different parts of the brain operate - to snatch you out of your human reasonings and back into paying attention to God. The trick happens in fear. If you have ever had a sudden terror or fear come upon you, you remember how quickly you entered into a different mental functioning.This is how God created us - to make us respond to danger before our reasoning fouls us up - Isaiah 11:3. There is a reason that Proverbs says that fear is the beginning of wisdom. In fact, fear is the doorway to joy and everything you have ever wanted. Ps 25:14 - The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him. Stop being afraid of fear and understand it is the secret of the Lord.So it's not surprising that the enemy is marshalling all of his forces to get you to disregard this tool that God has given you. Because the fear of God is an impenetrable wall against deception. When fear focuses all of your attention upon your Heavenly Father, His words and His guidance suddenly become your whole being and you stop listening to the enemy's attempts to lead you down a path.It is because few have sought to understand the fear of God, (it must be learned, it does not come naturally, Proverbs 2:3-6), that the doorway of human reasoning is standing wide open to the enemy's attack. So the enemy will typically say, "God is love, you're not supposed to fear him, fear just means reverence."This is the enemy's typical approach, to get you to reason with him as he did with Eve. This fundamental weakness in our human reasoning is the whole purpose of the fear of God. It is why Proverbs 3:7 says, Don't be wise in your own eyes, (but rather); Fear the Lord and depart from evil. Proverbs 3:5 - Lean not unto your own understanding. Isaiah 5:21 - Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.Because if you rely upon your reason, you will be led down a false path time and time again. Fear is an Involuntary response to God whereupon all of your attention is focused on Him.Reverence is Voluntary and is only for you to give the King or Priests. Know your Bible! 1 Peter 2:17 - Love the brotherhood, Fear God, Honor (or reverence) the King. God does not want your reverence. It is improper. God does not receive honor from men. John 5:41.There is not space to continue with all of the verses that are violated by the change the editor has made to his Bible version. The enemy knows that reverence "doesn't work." So that is why he is tempting everyone to make this change to God's Word. So that he can render the Word of God of none effect and continue his free assault upon your mind and thoughts. Predators never want their prey to fear.Take the challenge of Isaiah 8:13 "Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" - and I promise your mind will be set free and you will be the happiest person on earth!

$REVIEW.: This dystopian novel was a fast paced, interesting read.  The pot smoking, aggressive protagonist is a refreshing departure from the usual "beautiful woman as victim/romantic object".  She is combative, clever, smart, humorous, determined, inventive and never quits. Her often sarcastic, sometimes humorous dialogue and thoughts break otherwise tense bleak scenarios.The plot takes unexpected twists, if not outright 180's leaving the reader not knowing who to trust.The closing line cements the characterization and leaves the reader to hope the saga may continue.

$REVIEW.: At first I thought this book was a total ripoff.  I was expecting a "How-To" book inspired by graffiti and street artists.  But I gave it to my son anyway as a sort of coloring book and he was fascinated by it for hours.  He kept using the white space in it to copy some of the drawings and create his own ideas.  After watching him work with it for so long, I realized that the book was doing exactly what it was designed to do: inspire creativity through showing the end product, not the process.  Some of the drawings are a little weird, but overall, it was fun.  The book is fairly large and is well made.  But the price is a little steep for most.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive.

$review_text.: There are so many things wrong with the story it's impossible to list them all.  I'll try.  I found it bizarre beyond description that Libby would actually believe this Sheikh was in love with her (Ch. 1)..  I mean, the guy is so desperate and will say anything to her to obtain his goal and she DOESN'T PICK UP ON THIS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT??  She doesn't appear to be an idiot yet she doesn't even question him when he professes his love for her...gads...HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HER!!  How can she believe, even minutely, that he'd love her??  Then to actually LEAVE with him to his country is unbelievable!!  I mean, I wanted to slap her...then slap the Author for writing this drivel..and proceed to slap myself for reading this tripe!  TO THE END!!  Cripes!  The characters of this story were painfully weak and woefully underdeveloped...Pathetic!  And it was incredible that Rasyn, supposedly full of wisdom... couldn't see Imaran for who he is!  Don't get me started on THAT!  I mean, even when Libby finally..FINALLY wises up to the kind of creep she's married to, she's still an idiot (by virtue of her uneducated choice of words)...and when her moment finally arrives and she has center stage...and she's got Rasyn where she wants him...her argument is so embarrassingly weak and she simply falls flat!The foundation and premise of this story is so far fetched, it's impossible to believe...even with the longest stretch of the imagination.  When Rasyn's betrayal if finally revealed (which he STILL could've kept hidden had he spoken his guilt to Imaran in Arabic instead of English), it's STILL full of holes!!  CRIPES!!  And how many times is she gonna lose a frikkin' shoe??!!??The bottom line is....there simply is no connection to these characters.  AND WHAT AN ABRUPT ENDING...EVEN WITH AN EPILOGUE!!!  aaarrrgh!!!

$REVIEW.: In this compendium of three of Alcorn's novels (Deadline, Dominion, Deception), readers are treated to three superbly written and thought-provoking books that keep you engaged and interested throughout


Alcorn's style is consistent

Each book contains a main storyline, in these works a murder mystery.This main storyline drives the books and surrounds a cast of characters that remains pretty consistent in each book, but focusing on a different member of central casting in each


If Alcorn stuck to just the mystery storyline, the books would be excellent stories running around 200-300 pages each

But that would be too simple


Instead, Alcorn adds layers to the stories, generally dealing with social/spiritual issues

He includes aspects of both heaven and hell in each book, emphasizing the rewards of choosing a life redeemed by Christ and the consequences of living a life apart from Christ.In this Alcorn pulls no punches- he makes it clear that being a "good" person or an "evil" person makes no difference
Both will spend eternity apart from God if they reject redemption


If this is not enough, Alcorn also tackles social/Biblical issues in each book


Things like racism and racial reconciliation, abortion, homosexuality, premarital sex and STDs, and a variety of other conservative/liberal issues are found in the pages.Alcorn uses a fictional storyline to advance Biblical teaching, a feature that adds layers to the stories but also can be distracting at times


That leads to my only criticism of the books, and it is a minor one
Each book is hundreds of pages longer than it would be if boiled down to its basic storyline, and all the added elements can be difficult to wade through

I would not let that stop anyone from reading the books- they are excellent examples of well written Christian fiction.I give them 5 out of 5 stars.I received a free e-copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah publishing in exchange for a fair and honest review.

In addition, the book focuses some attention on Kellhus's wife Esmenet, and in what appears to be a major developing side story, their son, Kelmomas.The book is extremely well written and easy to follow, with chapters alternating between the different characters' stories. Chapters tend to end leaving you wishing for more and eager to get back to that particular tale.I enjoyed this book much more that Bakker's trilogy ending 'The Thousandfold Thought', which seemed to me to contain a great deal of  philosophical discussions that I personally found somewhat difficult to follow and understand. By comparison this novel was more 'story' and thus easier to understand and a joy to read.In addition to a well written with a host of great characters, the book features (as per all previous Bakker books) an excellent glossary of character names with a brief description of their roles. It also has a detailed map of the area involved. And last but not least there is a brief summary of the story of 'Prince of Nothing' trilogy so you won't be totally lost if you don't read the initial trilogy (but you probably should).Conclusion:Bakker is back; this is as fine a continuum as I could have hoped for to one of my favorite fantasy/adventure series. I can hardly wait for the next installment. Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson
$SUMMARY.: Bakker continues the 'Prince of Nothing' series with this excellent follow-up

$review_text.: I've read several books encompassing plots that include a battered woman aspect.  In my experience, more often than not, authors get it wrong...the woman's reactions are all off, or they overcome their violent pasts so fast as to almost trivialize them.  In this instance, I'd have to say that Ms. Bonner's writing demonstrates a superior grasp of the issue of domestic violence, and all that it entails.  Her understanding is so pervasive, I could easily believe that Ms. Bonner either has experience with DV, whether personally or through someone close to her, or she has taken the time to extensively research the issue.  The end result, is a poignant story about a woman who has known nothing but violence at the hands of men, who finally finds her God appointed soul mate...a man who helps to heal not only her heart, but also her soul.Brooke is desperately afraid when she is told by her uncle that he has sold her as a mail order bride.  Terrified of being under the control of yet another man, she makes the strenuous six month journey west, via wagon train.  Through Divine intervention, Brooke finds herself married to a wonderful, loving, God fearing man.  One who shows her that not all men are evil monsters, and teaches her that she is worthy of love...no matter what her past.  Brooke's internal struggle as she tries to overcome her fears and learn to trust her husband is so realistic.  But that is only the beginning of Brooke's difficulties, as she must also learn to forgive herself and accept that she is worthy of God's love and forgiveness.This book encompasses a thoroughly dynamic plot, with three dimensional characters who come to life within its pages.  As if the romance isn't enough, intrigue is added to the story with murder, revenge, and kidnapping.  All in all, an amazing read!  I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: OK, first of all this a lot of really great writing at a tiny cost!  I mean bargain! By good writing I mean that by today's standards this was a freaking epic.  Often while reading a modern book or magazine I think to myself, "Authors should be required to read a book or two before they write one."  The authors in this missal obviously did that and more.  This is a case of obviously intelligent and imaginative people describing a new concept for most of their readership I expect and the amazing thing is you feel as if they are not talking down to you but actually expect you to keep up, I did and was rewarded with some excellent content.  Having had some experience with Steampunk myself, no, wait, let me rephrase that.  I have been exposed to Steampunk already.  At my age I do not really have the potential to be as much a Steampunk, or any other kind of punk, as I might have been in my earlier years.  Still, the cool pictures, the expressive writing, the rich humor and the pie!  OK, the pie recipe was a huge thing for me, it is quite easy and quite delicious and I happened to have all the ingredients in my larder so it made a day stuck home, sick in bed, much easier to tolerate!  I am a fan and will certainly buy the other issues as I get the opportunity, in fact this is exactly the sort of publication I would love to write for at some point if they would have me.  Thank you to all the authors who contributed to this fine work...

$review_text.: I loved the way this was written, you were just sucked into this story within the very first page. The authors have created a very different world full of fae and you can't help but to be intrigued by it. The characters are very thoughtful of what they do, especially Ansleigh, and you just have to feel what they feel. The ending was very bittersweet for me and I just have to read Armored Hearts now.Ansleigh, I feel, is a little bit of a romantic. Against her father's wishes, she crosses the vines separating fae and man and causes chaos back home when she trades her birthright in order to have a child with a lord that she had thought would be able to love her. Sadly, all doesn't go as planned. What happens when her sins become the death of her and more?The authors have created a short story that leaves you with a dozen answers that you'll only get if you read Armored Hearts.

$REVIEW.: I have read two books by Weston Ochse, Velvet Dogma and Seal Team 666, and enjoyed both.  Then I read Grunt Life.  I have to say this is his best yet.  There are books that deal with military life, Heinlein's Starship Troopers, Haldeman's The Forever War, Richard K. Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs novels and E.E. Knight's Vampire Earth Series.  This is among the best of them.  The protagonist, Benjamin Mason is a suicidal vet looking to put down the burden of having survived the deaths of many team members.  As he is about to end his life on the Vincent Thomas Bridge, he is approached by recruiters for a special mission and is pressganged into service.  What follows changes everything; training, building a new team and the challenge that only a few special, broken people can hope to fight.  Ochse brings each character to life and allows them to develop building a tight narrative and characters you really care about.Be careful when you start reading this, you will not want to put it down.

Since Win8 and supporting technology is in beta, Direct3 and Direc2 are not well documented, yet, and this book is not a replacement for the documentation.Update on VS 2013: This one of the few books that has been written with an eye on the latest DirectX and 3D, however, with VS 2013, there are number of changes that break the code you download from the d3dcoder site.  xnamath.h has been changed to review how to update the code see:[...]********END of Update for VS 2013 ***************I give the book a 5 star rating as it is a useful and well written book.  My criticism is that you may purchase this book, as I did, in hopes that you could use it for the Visual Studio 11 and the "Direct3".Buy it if you are need DirectX 11, but it isn't going to be a big help with the new Win8 approach if you are new to Windows programming, or learned to program games using XNA but not DirectX or Direct3.  However, it will work with the Visual Studio 11 Ultimate Beta running on Windows 7, although, do not run the VS 11 Ultimate beta on a production machine, use the Virtual PC included with Windows 7.See my blog at [...] where I am working through some of these issues.  As well as other things.Frank Luna is a good author who writes well and samples work, so do not take this as a negative review.

$review_text.: As a long time Boulder area resident I enjoyed the mystery set in my home town entitled TOO NEAR THE EDGE.  The book is very detailed about the area and many Boulder favorites including the Pearl Street Mall, Chautauqua Trails and Dining Hall, Mt. Sanitas, the Boulder Creek Path are mentioned in the course of the story and fully described.  Although I enjoyed reading about and recognizing places I am familiar with I'm afraid someone not particularly interested in the vicinity would find all this detail a tad boring.  And of course  typical Boulder personality types and lifestyles are fully on display as well with lots of therapists and new age thinkers included.Cleo the heroine of TOO NEAR THE EDGE has an "out there" profession since she works as a grief counselor who specializes in actually getting the bereaved in touch with their deceased loved one.  She somehow does this by having them stare in to a mirror in a darkened room or something like that.  Cleo's own ghost "friend" is a surfer named Tyler though he remains frustratingly undeveloped in at least this outing.  In TO NEAR THE EDGE Cleo becomes involved in finding out what really happened to the husband of a recent client who died while hiking in the Grand Canyon.  Was his death suicide, an accident or something more sinister?  And if foul play was involved which of the four or five possible suspects actually did the deed and what was the motive?  Cleo and some friends investigate the suspects and do some sleuthing. And all is resolved after a preposterous hostage situation.The style of TOO NEAR THE EDGE is very readable and coherent but sometimes seems so simplistic it reminded me of a book written for children or young adults rather than for adults.  And credulity is strained with all the coincidences that aid Cleo in her detective work but maybe that's just the result of good karma.  This is an interesting book for anyone who loves Boulder but as far as mystery/thrillers go is just mediocre.

$review_text.: I started reading this book without much knowledge about it; neither did I read the first book in this series (yet), both books in this series (book 3 to be released soon) are standalones so you are capable of reading one without the other

This was quite an unexpected read for me, in a good way


The authors are brave enough to write about some controversial themes that each and every one of us encounters on a daily basis
In this book they tackle 2 main themes: relationships between people from different races and rape

Prepare yourself for the unexpected with this book!Our two lead characters are Charlotte and Calvin, one of them white the other black, enter controversial theme number one


For a long time they have shared an undeniable attraction towards one another, an attraction that is getting harder and harder to deny


Charlotte has been through a lot in her life already; murder, rape, discrimination &#8230; Years after the events she still has a hard time dealing with things and finds it hard to move on with her life accordingly


Will Calvin be the one to break her out of her shell? Maybe he will, maybe he won&#8217;t&#8230; The one thing we know for sure is that they will go on a rollercoaster ride together.So once again expect the unexpected! ;-)The one thing I enjoyed most about this book is that the themes that were discussed in this book where real life issues


The authors handled this in a very good way and should be proud of themselves that they were brave enough to write about difficult and controversial themes like these


Give this book a chance, I am sure you will not be disappointed.

I was intrigued by the description that mentioned the main character was moving to a small town to "start over" in her life, to run from a lifestyle or past she could not bear any longer.It was a clean cute romance that was an easy relaxing day read. The storyline flowed, some of the characters were really good and the interactions and dialogue was easy to follow.  A good book for people who enjoy Christian Romance.

This is not a could be made into a romcom type of book. Also read At His Pleasure first, yes they can stand alone but they go so much better together.Michelle has done it again, yet another hot, what's gonna happen next, erotic romance staring a very Alpha make (Koti) and his better half (Kota). If you thought you knew what was going to happen, think again, sometimes you have to look at the heart to see the steel in the spine.Love doesn't mean you're weak; but that you're strong enough to trust someone else with your heart. Will our Koti learn this or will the prophecy kill them all?Our two lovebirds are making their way across the lands and experiencing what happens after the 'honeymoon' is over and real life kicks in. Secrets, visions, a lil TLC from our Alpha male and did I mention rattling scorpions...I'm not giving it away.Can't wait for the third installment!!!!

$REVIEW.: A collection of short stories, I read this book after finishing "Fire Baptized" and it was a good way to get a better understanding of the characters


McShack gives his POV and the short story is about his mother going missing and Lanore helps him search for her
He discusses his feelings for her and what he is thinking about their complex relationship


No real updates with Lanore's tale as she is just as confused and mixed up about men


Zulu gives us a more in depth look about his past and why he is feared on the streets of Santeria and it looks like both he and Lanore could do with a good anger management class or two


Chameleon was interesting and it could be a good book so I will keep an eye out for that one.

$REVIEW.: With This Ring is a fast, fun, read


In it we meet Lily, the owner of a bridal shop that is suffering with the struggling economy, and Drew, an attorney and investor

The two meet at the wedding for a friend of Drew&#8217;s and what starts as a quick hookup in the heat of passion, turns into a business proposal that will ultimately benefit them both

Lily must decide if Drew&#8217;s proposal is really with securing her future, or if it will only secure future heartbreak


With This Ring is well written and a lot of fun, my only issue is the brevity

I&#8217;m not a big fan of serials that drag out a story through a series of novellas and unfortunately that is what is going on here
At the .99 price point it&#8217;s not an issue, but I&#8217;d rather have a complete book and pay just a bit more, just to have the complete story in one volume

I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the next installment.

$REVIEW.: King Blood is a much better title, but that doesn't change the fact that I loved this book when I first read it in paperback a few years ago.  If you enjoy epic apocalyptic fiction and are a bit tired of the onslaught of zombie novels, try this out.  It's the first book I read by Simon Clark and it remains of my favorites.

It had a lot of great ideas (ideas for me - facts for them) on how versatile casting agents can be when peopling your films.  It definitely came along at the right time for me.

$review_text.: HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!  The author covers every area to kick &#34;bad debt&#34; out the door, as Scott clearly states in the beginning of this easy and enjoyable read on a subject that most people are unclear about
 The author is quick to mention that we want to kick &#34;Bad Debt - Out the Door&#34; and YES there is such thing as Good Debt.The Author clearly gets the point across and this is a must read for all (not solely those that may be in bad debt)

 Scott covers the &#34;little expenses&#34; in which we can eliminate, such as eliminating that extra 5 dollar coffee, as well as negotiating with C.C
companies to get the best interest rates (yes, you should negotiate)....Well written, step by step guide to turning your 'Bad Debt' into 'Good Debt.'  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!

$REVIEW.: I recommend to anyone who wants to understand the Biblical view of manhood.  This book goes to the basics of what it means to be a man as God designed it.  The book introduces the idea of manhood, which is essentially the mandate God gave to Adam - to work and to keep what God has given us.  Adam was given the Garden of Eden and we have our own Edens, whether it be cultivating our families, our relationships, our careers, etc.  Of course, the fall altered many things - but our mandate remains.  The ultimate goal, of course, is to glorify God by building up others in Christ.  In the end, that is the thesis of the book.  Philips goes through the major callings of man - building a career, becoming a husband, and a father.  The unifying theme is that men must serve Christ by serving others in all areas of his life.The book neatly takes the reader through a very organized, progression of logic, but always based on Biblical truth.  The heart of the book, appropriately, is the three chapters in the middle on marriage.  Phillips successfully utilizes sound Biblical logic to demonstrate what logic cannot entirely capture: the astonishing beauty of God's design for marriage.The reader will also appreciate Phillip's highly accessible, easy-to-read style.  I recommend to both men (who hope to grow in obedience to God's plan for men) and women (who hope to find a Godly man as a husband).

$review_text.: Robbie McEwen is one of Australia's greatest ever cyclists. While the spotlight might be focused on Cadel Evans, McEwen's career is equally noteworthy. He has won over 200 races including 12 stages of the Tour de France and three green jerseys.In this book McEwen gives lots of insights into the world of professional cycling. There are interesting details about the tactics used to win races and the internal politics of cycling teams. McEwen also seeks to counter the way he is often portrayed as an aggressive sprinter. To win sprints cyclists often clash physically, but this is just a part of racing and not because McEwen is an aggressive person. The character traits of McEwen's that shines through in this book is determination and toughness. These qualities are what made him the world's best sprinter.

$REVIEW.: It's fun and entertaining to watch Nick try to get to fencing, technique, etc., as he just can't resist "one more story." Even when he titles a chapter "technique," it begins... but before we get to that, here's a story and some history...The past reviews on this book are now out of date. There are plenty of good books (dozens) on all levels of fencing, and even some outstanding DVDs (LEARN FENCING - FOIL - A DVD Beginers Guide to the Olympic Sport of Sword Fighting) is an example, which also comes in a 3 DVD set for foil, epee and sabre. These ship from UK when ordered on Amazon, but the shipping is fast and vendor (Russel Swords) extremely high rated and reliable, and the series is awesome. Even the older (2002) Elaine Cheris book (Fencing: Steps to Success (Steps to Success Activity Series)) is inexpensive, filled with great illustrations, and covers a wealth of detailed technique.At from 5 to 14 bucks, the Evangelista book is worth every penny for the stories alone. Sure, Evangelista is full of himself and his ridiculous pronouncements about the good old days (trying to convince us we should wait a year before picking up a foil and another year before trying a bout!) are way outdated (not only for the impatient young, but also we older fencers who don't have long enough left to live to put off the fun parts). BUT, the stories have a LOT of timeless strategy that can be applied to your current game.For example (p. 247), Nick gives a detailed account of Aldo Nadi's method of not letting even the best opponents get a single strike in. This comes down to pure aggressiveness, controlling the opponent so he only strikes from weakness, and the very modern (for a guy born in 1899) attitude of "attack, attack attack, THEN ATTACK." This is Fairbairn's knife fighting philosophy and I use it in my blade combat courses, which are about real life survival, not just sport.If you're impatient to get to the how, not just the why or deeper strategy, pass on this and get Cheris, Hutton, Agrippa, Paul Wagner, Cohen, etc. (Search Amazon with any of their names and the word fencing). BUT, if you want to deepen your game strategically, the stories here DO give timeless tips, including a few that have even been forgotten by now that will help you both on the street and in competition.I teach knife combat at blade combat dot com and have no relationship with the author, publisher or Amazon, and LP always pays for the books we review. Our recommendations are solely for the benefit of the Amazon shopper and Library procurement, with no vested interests.

$review_text.: Honestly, I never thought of Reza getting his own story. I don't know why. I guess a lot has to do with he seriously messed up in Until There Was You. Quite frankly, I thought he would get kicked out. Obviously that wasn't case, because I just finished his story. Anyway, I liked the story and how it touched on the things that affect the men and women in the service. I understand that suicide and addiction effect those who are not in the service, but I like how Jessica touches on them in All for You.Now about Reza and Emily's story.I did like their story. I love how they are drawn to each other even though they shouldn't really be. Reza is a smart-ass that seems to get his mouth in trouble. On top of his smart-ass he's trying to stay sober, which in his job isn't the easiest thing to do. Yes, a couple times in the story he slips up. Emily basically joined the army to try to make a difference. However, she's finding that it's harder than she realizes. As the story continues, Reza and Emily try to understand where each one is coming from.Overall, a great read. If you are looking for a story that will you give a real taste of military life with a romance you won't find anything better than Jessica Scott's stories. I believe it helps that her real life experience help to produce these wonderful stories. However, I do have one gripe and that is the ambiguous ending of the epilogue. There's room for more stories for this couple or maybe we will see it  settle more in the next book. That is my only gripe about the story. I still enjoyed the story and love how Jessica tackle some serious issues in the story. So, if you are looking for a military read, you might give All for You a try.Side note: you can read this without the other books.

$REVIEW.: It is with three thumbs up, if only I had that many to raise, that I would give Living the Savvy Life: The Savvy Woman's Guide to Smart Spending and Rich Living written by Melissa Tosetti and Kevin Gibbons.Beginning with the premise that a savvy life is one which includes balance, it continues to go in depth with individual chapters focused on money, home organization, entertainment, wardrobe, beauty and food. After all, Tosetti and Gibbons remind the reader continually, that in order to create the life we want, we must prioritize - saving money by not purchasing and spending money on things that are of little or no importance to us, so that we may be able to spend our hard earned money on things that are of great priority.While this concept may sound simple, living a savvy life is one that involves discipline, and whether we want to admit it or not, money is at the bottom of the foundation of the life we want to build.Financially speaking, the authors speak to the readers, as though you are having a conversation. Examples from their own experiences are given which makes it much more personable and honest. I particularly appreciated their approach in how they talk about money. The concept of planning to be successful will ultimately help lead to a more confident person who steps forward in pursuit of the life they want. Most importantly, we must all know where our money is going and exactly how much we make and thus spend, but instead of purchasing an expensive Microsoft Money or Quicken program, why not just use Excel?Now if talking about money for an entire book seems a bit much, don't worry.  There are wonderful chapters on how to be a savvy shopper for your kitchen and your closet, as well as simple ways to make sure you are able to enjoy the entertainment you wish to spend your money on.One of the tests I have in determining whether a book will be passed on to my friends and family, and now my readers, is if I am annotating madly as I read. And, in this case, it began on the first page, while at the same time I was jotting down notes in my notebook. Here are just a few of the many specific ideas suggested on how to create a more savvy way of life that immediately caught my attention:*Create a weekly cleaning list*Create a spa-like atmosphere in your master bath (add an orchid, bamboo, etc)*Drink 1 glass of water with each meal*Enter expenditures daily into Excel program*Sign-up for Ebates*Call cable, telephone and credit card companies quarterly to look into lowering bills or taking advantages of special offers*Only purchase things you love*Create a family cookbook, complete with plastic covers to protect each recipe*Do not use a credit card a second time until you have paid off the balance in full*Come up with five different dishes you can serve when you have guests over that allow you to enjoy your company and give you the peace of mind that dinner will be delicious and very much enjoyed by your company*Create your own style bookThe list could go on and on.  The specifics that are given endlessly is one of the reasons I know this book will be a resource for me.  Not only do the authors share their own ideas, but they share interviews with respected professionals in their fields - for example, with Michael Chiarello (of Food Network fame), excerpts from Debra Ollivier's A Woman's Guide To Finding Her Inner French Girl, five pages full of titles of books suggested as references on all of the topics discussed in the book and at the end of each themed chapter, a list of 10 Tips for that particular topic.The beauty of this book is that it reminds us that we truly are "the designers of our lives".  Because as they see it, and I couldn't agree more, "You are the artist and a savvy life is yours to create."I highly recommend this book for anyone who desires to perpetually grow, live their best life and create their very own success story.

$review_text.: I love cozy mysteries most.  This is a step up.  You enjoy everyone of these people.  The writing is in first person (of the ghost), and these people are all a little quirky, but believable.  I read the first book in the series (Morgue Drawer 4) and almost put it down after a few pages, but stuck with it and am I ever so glad.  I loved the book.  I got this one and now being familiar with the characters, I enjoyed it soooo much.  I just couldn't put it down, carried my Kindle with me everywhere and read it when I could sneak some time in.  I actually found myself sitting outside a hospital in mid 80 temperatures, very warm, waiting for a patient discharge.  I took out my Kindle and was shocked to see that over an hour had passed.  I was so into the book, I didn't even notice how hot it was or get anxious about waiting so long!!!  This book was even harder to put down than the first one was after I got into it.  I'm on the next one already.  I'm not even getting bored reading about the same people.  This is a great series....  The only bad thing.... the next one is the last one and I can't find any more by this lady in this series.  I'm going to sooo miss this story line.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't so sure I could come to like HAVOC.  He's rough, wounded, harsh, and has some serious demons rattling around in his past.  He's also very quietly kind, loving, and loyal.  The love he shows for his sister is simply beyond wrenching.  Needless, to say, this book is capable of breaking the readers heart and in turn.....patching it back together.I think that is what this series is doing: breaking my heart, and then putting it back into shape but it's not the shape it started in!This is the one series that is serious about freaking-about with the reader's head!  You come to care for this group of MC folk only to have so many of them hurt, killed, or maimed.This book just added to the losses.And yet.......I'm loving it and watching my calendar for the next book to be released......in May 2014, I hope.I do think if any woman in this world was right for HAVOC (aka Joe) it is Corinne.  She and her son manage to go where no woman has ever gone before and that is deeply into the heart and soul of HAVOC.  The process is slow and sure.  For HAVOC, however, the process is painful.  He fights it at every turn and holds fast to his belief about women being trouble.  This is not a hearts and flowers romance; not at all.  It takes one fine woman of character to stand up to what HAVOC is all about and realize that her love may not change him but that her love for him can be everything to his future.  I liked Corinne, a lot.  She wasn't whiny or bitchy.  She stood strong and protected her son and the life she'd worked to build for them.I hated some of the bad things that happened in this book.  My heart broke for the lost.  My soul cheered for those left to build-onto what they were left with.  I'm now wondering how the MC club can go on and hope for those new members.....we shall see.I'd have to say that Ms. Fanetti is a very fine writer.  Each book in this series proves her skill and each book moves that skill to a higher notch.  Well done, dear authoress......very well done.  Thank you.

$REVIEW.: Dante is a bounty hunter. He doesn't want to be a bounty hunter anymore and the money Vandergriff offers him could make this his last job. Dante has lost his own daughter, so helping Vandergriff get his estranged daughter back feels like the right thing to do.Vandergriff gives Dante a picture of Nadia, and he is stunned by her beauty. Seeing her in person, he is overwhelmed by his attraction to her. Soon after Dante finds Nadia, her life is threatened and he helps her escape the men chasing her. When the danger has passed, Nadia's bodyguards arrive to bring her safely back home, once there, Dante meets Nadia's stepfather Nick.The attraction between Nadia and Dante is growing and a bond is slowly forming, so when Nick offers Dante the job of being Nadia's bodyguard, he takes it as he is eager to stay with her. He realizes that this gives him the opportunity to get Nadia back to Vandergriff, but something doesn't feel right when Dante manages to deliver Nadia to the man that originally hires him. Realizing that he has made a terrible mistake, Dante now has to save Nadia and earn back her trust in the process. If he can't convince her and her family that he is on their side, the cost will be his life and Nadia's as well.In Enemy Hands is fantastic! It is action packed and deeply sensual and I was on the edge of my seat from the first page to the last. Nadia is just as strong and smart as she is gorgeous. Dante is all Alpha male; handsome and tough, he doesn't hesitate to protect Nadia in any situation. I felt that In Enemy Hands is perfectly written. The storyline is intense and riveting, and the secondary characters are very well developed. The sexual tension between Nadia and Dante had me so eager I was panting with each kiss they shared. Michelle Perry has written a truly captivating and thrilling book with In Enemy Hands. It's a must read for any romantic suspense fan. I can't wait to read it again!NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$review_text.: Angela has had a tough life and when her son Jake came into her life it was the best thing to happen to her. Until her barbaric cult leader parents kidnapped him and took him to Mexico. Since the US FBI wouldn't help she gained help with a notorious drug lord in Mexico. Isabella (The drug lord) is a mother and sympathetic to Angela and is will to use her sources to get the baby back.This is another one of those books that are out of my comfort zone for reading but I took the chance and found this book great.I loved the strength Angela had, she managed to come from a total abusive past, went through her own issued and made her life better. With a past like hers she could've easily just continued with her drug use, become a horrible parent, or abuse her child. But, she strived to be better and do everything in her power to be a better mother and get her child back. She went against her beliefs and seeked help from drug dealers when all else failed.I loved that the characters were complex which made them more real. I loved that I got to know some of the back story of what happened to Angela in the past to backup for the readers to care for her. I loved that there was more point of views to see what was happening on Angela's side and and what was going on on her fathers side.This book is a real page turner, full of suspense, and had me till the end. I also like that it had a supernatural element in there.Overall I loved the book, you lovely readers should check out this great book. Highly Recommend.

$REVIEW.: Cherrie Lynn! Wow! I absolutely loved Brian from Rock Me and now with Ghost, Leave Me Breathless did just that, left me breathless!Seth "Ghost" Warren, Brian's best friend and fellow tattoo artist, is just as bad boy hot as you can get! Him and Macy Rodgers are as complete opposite as they could possibly be but they have an undeniable chemistry.  Although both of them have been burned before, they are willing to work past that in order to find their forever with each other."He was part of a world so separate from her own it would be impossible to bridge the chasm between them. He was heavy metal. She was all country, all the time. He wouldn't belong at a rodeo, and she wouldn't belong at one of his wild concerts where they probably sacrificed live chickens or bit the heads off bats onstage."What a great series and this book was worth the wait! We get more of Brian and Candace in this book too which was a huge bonus. Ghost and Macy are great characters and have amazing  Hope we get more of them soon![...]

$REVIEW.: This was one of those books, that you start off dry , boring , wonder if you are going to finish it. Then you think nah it just doesn't do anything for me , but then the heroine get kidnap.  Then it is like OOH wait now it getting interesting. I both loved and like and even disliked this book all that the same time. It has a great story to it and even I some good one liners. But it dragged for me so much at times. I gave up on this book four times , but I did keep going back to it. And in the end I loved it, and I am looking forward to reading DJ's book.  I recommend this book with a few cautionary points. One , it will drag , you will think OH COME ON. Second you will cry and yell at the hero and heroine but in a good way. Third and finally it is about the MARINES!! And a wonderful awareness of PSTD.  So my advice is read it , and get to know Roy and Laura and think about what your scent name would be if you was to turn wolf...haha

$review_text.: Now this is Sasha's story and he has the most incredible power I've ever read. I'm not going to tell you what it is. His name "The Scribe" might give you some indication but it is a powerful thing and any of the Clans would want him. But he's escaped to Julian. He wants to never use his "power" ever again. It takes a piece of him every time he uses it and he's used it so many times under his old Clan leader who basically raised him. Now that Clan leader is back and he wants the helpless girl that's just fled to Julian. As Arlis, the Clan leader lays seige to Julian and Sasha's new base of operations, Sasha has to war with himself, can he use his power for good instead of evil and at what cost to him? Will he stay sane if he uses it this time?I'm not really sure what Sasha's power does to him, but it's painful for him as well as his victim. Maybe because he's a good soul who's been forced to do so many wrong's. But I think he also has to see all the wrong's the person he is working on has done and it's painful and he gets afraid that he'll get lost in the craziness. But you'll have to see how he ends up and who helps him. This is a story I really wanted to read because once you read about his "talent" you don't forget it. He will stick with you in Closed Hearts. Most everyone will. I loved this story and seeing him find his peace and safety. Another excellent tide over until FREE SOULS comes out!

$review_text.: This was surprisingly good; I didn't think I would enjoy this as much as I did. I was really surprised by the honesty that the author seemed to give. I have read a few books having to do with polygamy, but I always felt like the author held back a lot. I didn't get that feeling here, she seemed to tell her story the way she remembered it. She does mention leaving some stuff out, but it looks like she made that into a whole other book to be released later this year. Definitely worth your time if you are a memoir reader or just interested in learning more about the subject matter.As for me, even after reading this, I don't understand how a woman can allow herself to be pulled into this life. I keep reminding myself that they were only 15/16, but I still don't really get it. Then again, I guess there are things that I do and say that others would understand. But still... I dunno. It's tough.

Cherie Marks has offered us a very engaging lead couple, and it was easy to become emotionally involved in their happily ever after. The story is written with humor, there is some light mystery, but I came for the romance and was quite satisfied. Superb primary and secondary characters, quirky townspeople, and lots of witty dialogue make this a 4 star read for me.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: In Rediscovering God in America: Reflections on the Role of Faith in our Nation's History and Future, Newt and Callista Gingrich take the reader on a "walking tour" of Washington D.C. According to Speaker Gingrich, "There is no attack on American culture more destructive and more historically dishonest than the secular left's relentless effort to drive God out of America's public square." This book is a defense against that attack.There are thirteen stops on the walking tour. Each features the photography of Mrs. Gingrich, while Mr. Gingrich gives proof that the founding fathers did not intend for the separation of church and state to be a prohibition of religious expression. From the engraved quotation of Scripture in the reading room of the Library of Congress to the statue of Moses in the Supreme Court building, Washington is a perpetual reminder that the earliest Americans knew that "the blessings of God are the basis of our liberty, prosperity, and survival as a unique country."Like many apologetic works, this book does not promote any particular religion. That is not the author's purpose. Mr. Gingrich aims to protect the nation's freedom of (and diversity of) religious expression, as did the authors of the Bill of Rights.Rediscovering God in America was originally published in 2006 and was a New York Times best seller. The Thomas Nelson version was just released (October 2009). I missed the first one but am glad to have read this one. It is both enjoyable and educational, and it's just long enough to make you want to learn more. It will make a good addition to our home-school library and will be useful in teaching history and government.I received this book through the Thomas Nelson Book Review Blogger Program.

$review_text.: I have always loved looking to the wisdom of others when I am struggling through a problem or a crisis of faith of any sort. Quotes have always been an interest of mine, as I think it's fascinating that certain words, said in certain ways, can somehow stand the test of time and be linked to one person's mind. They are short and succinct pockets of advice and wisdom, and yet they transcend time and cultures to communicate knowledge to us. My father suggested that I give this book a try, knowing my penchant for quotes, epigrams, sayings, and adages. He was right. I loved it, and I particularly liked that many of these epigrams were not ones I had come across before. The author does a great job of creating an admirable collection that I will certainly return to time and time again. We always have troubles, but the advice of others sometimes seems so much more relevant and powerful. This isn't something you read cover-to-cover; just pick it up and flip to a page; you're sure to find something that does you more good than you'd expect.

$review_text.: I started this book and then had to put it down and wait a couple of days and begin reading it again. Raven Is the daughter of a kingpin. She asks for nothing. She has everything she could every ask for.That is until she meets Mizan. Mizan is the stick up kid who wants Raven's Father's place. Raven's actions prove to be the answer to Mizans wants. While the book was good and quick to read, i hate books where the characters do not show any growth. I wanted to shake her and say "GET A GRIP!" Some of the things Mizan does and the way he sets things up, she's just plain....dumb. For her to not realize any of the manipulting that Mizan is doing, she clearly was not truly raised as a Kingpins daughter or perhaps she was VERY VERY sheltered as a child. Which was ultimately her downfall.

$review_text.: This book kept me up into the wee hours of the night on several occasions to see what would become of its wonderful cast of characters on their perilous journey. To say that Ms. Tyndall leaves you gripping the edge of your seat is an understatement. My recliner has claw marks in it now, thanks to her superb suspenseful writing and intriguing plot twists. And yet, Forsaken Dreams is not primarily a suspense or even an epic journey, but a romance. And it is that romance that kept me reading to the very last page, longing and aching for the hero and the heroine to overcome the impossible odds against them and find their happily ever after.Eliza Crawford holds a secret that she prays the passengers of the New Hope never discover. An expedition to Brazil gives these displaced southerners a new chance at living the rest of their lives in peace after the bitter defeat of the Civil War. They seek a fresh start after the home they love is no longer a welcoming place, and dauntless Colonel Blake Wallace is just the man to lead them.The war has left a toll on Blake--health, sanity, family, fortune, career. . . even his very life if they had captured and tried him as a southern war criminal. The last thing he wants is a reminder of all the North has taken from him. Smooth sailing to Brazil and the affection and care of a lovely nurse promise to heal him. Until everything is turned upside down.Once again, the plot, characters and rich writing of this author held me in their charms to the very last satisfied sigh. The spiritual elements create tension, sometimes spine tingling, and always ring true. Subplots and minor characters set up story questions for sequels, and make me want to know what becomes of them all. I am so glad I will not have to bid a permanent adieu to these heart-stealing people.

$REVIEW.: **This review contains spoilersWow.I am left speechless.Just...wow.I love this book.I hate this book.I love this book.I seriously debated whether or not to review this book
It's unlike anything I've ever read, and I thought I knew what erotica was

I thought I was prepared for reading something so dark


I mean, Tara Brown warned her readers about her book, The Lonely, and I didn't think it was as dark as she made it out to be (and I LOVE The Lonely), but this book...it goes there.I don't even know how I found this book on Amazon
When I read the reviews I was left confused

No one really explained the plot, and I was curious


I downloaded the sample, and I was hooked
I bought the book, and stayed up until 6 AM to finished it.Morgan is on the run


At 18 years old, her abusive father sold her to a very rich man from Las Vegas


Morgan leaves her West Virginia trailer for the luxury of Las Vegas, and straight into the arms of her abusive husband, Drew

After being emotionally and physically abused for 6 years, Morgan plans her escape
It took her 9 months with a little help, but then Riley is born.Riley goes to the little town of Misty Bay, Maine to begin a new life
She buys a little house to start over, meets her new best friend Lauren, starts a job at a coffee shop owned by a bohemian named Star, and starts dating the sheriff, Dawson.Dawson is unlike anything Riley knows

He's sweet, kind, and treats her with respect


He makes love to Riley, but she's not used to such kindness

A part of her craves the dark side of what Drew used to give her


He still haunts her dreams, yet she wants Dawson to treat her with more than kid gloves

Dawson knows Riley is hiding from an abusive ex, and little by little he gets Riley to open up to him about her marriage


She lets Dawson get glimpses of what life with Drew used to be like without giving away to much detail

Eventually, Riley and Dawson get engaged, but Riley is dragged back to reality when Star drags her to Las Vegas for a trade show for her little coffee shop.In Las Vegas, Morgan has been found

In an effort to get away, she's in a car accident that leaves her in a coma

She wakes up with memory loss, and doesn't recognize her husband, Drew


He takes her home to recover, but Morgan isn't the same timid girl she was when she left

She know she doesn't belong with Drew or their lavish lifestyle, so she rebels


She doesn't put up with his crap, and Drew likes that about her
Seeing it as a way to start over, Drew becomes a completely different husband than what he was before


Morgan gets through his tough exterior, and they begin to fall in love.Then Dawson shows up one day

He never gave up looking for her, and as soon as she sees him, all of her memories come rushing back


Unsure of what to do, she goes back to Maine where she feels her real home is


Torn between two men, and being Morgan or Riley, she almost lives two separate lives while going back and forth between Drew and Dawson.And then she ends up pregnant, and this is the really frustrating part

She knows Dawson is who she should be with, but she craves Drew


Not knowing who the father is, she decides she'll choose one man or the other once the baby is born, but she can't separate herself from Drew or Dawson.I wanted to scream

I wanted to yell

I wanted to forget all about this book and never go back to it again as Morgan/Riley goes back and forth between the two men, but I couldn't

I couldn't let go of the book or the characters
I know this wrong, but I felt torn between Dawson and Drew as well
Even though we know what kind of man Drew was in the beginning of their marriage, Morgan is intensely attracted to him and can't fight her feelings


I had to finish this book!While Morgan/Riley is torn, Drew reveals why he married her


He tells her everything about the reason he bought her from her father, where her mother and brother are, and why he behaved the way he did in the beginning of their marriage


She takes the information Drew gives her to go discover herself and her relationship with her mother.There are so many more details to this book
There is so much more I'm leaving out (So


Much

More), including who the father of the baby is


This was one intense ride, and I was relieved and sad to finally get off this crazy train
Trust me, this book is unlike anything I've ever read

I think I need a drink.

$REVIEW.: A Little Bit Scandalous is the third book of the Forbidden Love series. I have read all of the series up to this point but believe this book can be read on its own and the reader will not be lost. That being said however, one of the things I really enjoy about this series to date is that ancillary characters that are depicted in one book then become the main characters in the next book; almost like a vinette. For example, book 2 started up towards what is the end of the first book but from the view point of Clarissa and Justin who we got to know a little in the first book. A Little Bit Scandalous does the same, picking up the story with Monroe (Roe) and Caroline.All of these stories are a light but not fivoulous love story that invloves mystery and danger. Robyn DeHart keeps enough of the historical accuracy to satisfy fans of the time period, but also make some "artistic changes" to keep the story relevant to a modern readership. In this book as well as her others of the series, the heroine is intelligent and indepedent, overall making smart decisions. Roe is sex on legs *yummy*. An aspect specific to this story I found quite appealing was the younger "innocent" female seducing the slightly older worldly male. Solid story and great series.

$REVIEW.: If you follow Harvey's &#34;work&#34; at all - and I never would have heard of her if some specific websites I read had directed me to it - you will know that she's not just a typical anti-gay religious right figure, she's a raving lunatic with dangerous, half-baked ideas and exists with her hysteria dial cranked up to 10. Demeaning gay people is all she does; she seems to have nothing else to say. The woman is obsessed, so there's really no reason to read even one paragraph of this book without knowing exactly where it's going. Harvey praised the Uganda &#34;kill the gays&#34; bill and said that the US needs to adopt an antigay law like Russia's. That should tell you all you need to know.

$REVIEW.: (This is my overall review for the series) An great continuation of a fantastic series
I was completely engaged from the first page through the end of the series

 This was one of those books (series) that when all is said and done, it makes you want to be a better person; to treat people better and to take action against injustices you see rather than just being an observer in the world

 I highly recommend this series - to EVERYONE - those with kids, those thinking about having kids, those who know people who have kids, those who just want to read a great story

 I started this book because I really enjoy the m/m genre and read a great review for the final book in the series that said if I hadn't read Foster High I definitely needed to and I must start at the beginning

 So that's what I did


 I started the book because I heard good things and then continued to read the entire series in a weekend because it is THAT good

 This is a great story - it is YA/NA so it is not hot and heavy - it is, however, a beautiful, touching and sometimes tragic story that draws you in and teaches you

The characters (ALL of them) are so well done - even the ones you're &#34;supposed&#34; to hate you can't


 READ IT!

$SUMMARY.: 2nd book in a great series

$REVIEW.: Amateur cookbooks are notorious for being imprecise
Thus, the fact that this cookbook is a compilation of community cookbooks should have been a warning.The recipes in the book are simple, but among the ingredient list of the very first recipe I decided I wanted to make were the following to ingredients:1 onion, chopped1 can pork and beansWhy is that a problem? Because the ingredients don't include measurements: How large an onion? What sized can of pork and beans


If I make this recipe with a 15-1/2 ounce can of pork and beans, will that be enough? If I make it with a 28-ounce can will that be too much?Since the author states that this book is a compilation from other cookbooks, I don't really blame her--but if I had been the compiler, I surely would have skipped over recipes that filed to give precise measurements.My rating of two stars is because I will not be able to use all of the recipes with confidence and I don't feel like experimenting to determine the missing measurements.

$REVIEW.: Of course I knew the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Or, at least I thought I did. Everybody has heard of the story of the good Dr. and the evil Hyde.  But there is more to it than that.  On a whim, I picked up this novella and became caught up not only in the tale, but the magnificent writing of Stevenson, which is going to inspire me to read more of his work.  Considered one of the first, if not the first literature rendering of the effect of personality changing drugs, this tale got me deeply involved in the characters and their moving story.  Stevenson captures the mood in his descriptions of the setting of this dark tale and elicits our sympathy for the struggles of the Dr. Beyond that, let me say a word about the format of the book as published by the University of Nebraska Press.  It&#8217;s small size, 4  by 7 inches, and it&#8217;s wide margins on every page, made for a very pleasant reading experience.  Great job UNP!

$REVIEW.: Unlike many of the other reviews i don't fault the art; it is typical Frank Miller along the lines of Die Hard.  My problem is the story - or lack there of.  Miller seems determined to create a scenario of butchering the Muslim antagonists because - they are Muslim.  There is no story here, no interesting character, no tension, no plot.  It is just a vehicle that is really bizarre because no one else would release such a book.  I guess his name power is so great that he can do whatever he wants but his editors should have teamed him up with a competent story teller or refused to publish this.  The main beef I have isn't his message - he can say whatever he wants - but it seems misleading to fans to market this as a new story and it makes me think Frank Miller is just completely crazy (well we knew that but crazy used to be in a good, creative way).  Sad, disappointing waste of effort and for us the customer, time and money.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Holy, F-ing, Batman!!!  This book starts out explosive and continues to be explosive until the very end.  Slade is a typical manwhore.  Due to circumstances in his past, he's using sex to numb himself from his heartache.  He works as a stripper and bartender.  He's willing to have sex anytime, anywhere.  He just has one rule, you get one night with him then you have to move on.  He only has sex with a woman once.  I think it's his way of avoiding developing feelings for anyone.  In walks Aspen, a woman with secrets of her own.  She wants nothing to do with a sex fiend like Slade.  Unfortunately, her body has other ideas, and Slade knows she wants him.Starting this book, my chest felt tight, I just knew there was going to be heartache somewhere in this book.  I just didn't know when it would come.  Victoria did a very good job of drawing out the feelings in her readers.  I could feel Slade's frustration when Aspen kept turning him down.  I could feel Aspen's indecision and anger at her own body for betraying her.  If you've read any of my reviews, you know I hate the manwhores.  I hate it even more when they continue their manwhore ways after they've met that special someone.  Slade was a shocker.  He actually didn't give himself away to others after meeting Aspen.  I found that to be so refreshing.  I loved it.  I'm anxiously awaiting book two in this series.  I can't wait to read Hemy's story.5-BombsReviewed by Tracy

Required reading  for all Christians, especially those within denominations where the topic  of homosexual relations and &quot;gay marriage&quot; is a divisive issue up  for debate
 This book exposes the many myths and arguments by  pro-homosexual lifestyle activists and gives hope to those struggling with  homosexual tempations

$review_text.: Annabelle Delancey was a single, white female who made a great pay check working in the Public Relations Department of a base. She had an abusive and snobbish boyfriend and the feeling of absolute aloneness. But she also had no idea of how to change her situation.Brianca Fuetes was a single, Hispanic female who worked at the front desk of a hotel. Her boyfriend, Alex, died two years ago, before they could marry. But Brianca still had Daniel, their (now) seven year old son, as well as, her sister Flo and Flo's entire family. Even with so little income and living in a bad neighborhood, she counted her blessings. All she lacked was the love of someone as wonderful as her Alex had been.Fate had both taking the same every other Friday flights to LA and Sunday flights back to Albuquerque. They noticed each other and often wondered what the other's life was like. When one of the flights had a long delay, they had a small lunch together and exchanged phone numbers. That would have been the end of it, but when Annabelle was attacked and left injured, she had no one to help. So she called Brianca who immediately came to her aide. The time Brianca and Annabelle spent together showed them how much they had in common. As their friendship strengthened, each had a major impact on the other's life.[4 stars] An amazing story of strength, family, friendships, and love! It had me grinning at some points and teary eyed at other! This is the perfect book to curl up in bed with on a cool, quiet evening! It left me with such a feeling of warmth and happiness!

$REVIEW.: This novel bristles with stripped-down, sharp, muscular, just-the-facts-ma'am prose -- which is just fine by me.Although I found the ultra-short, POV-driven, character-titled chapters confusing (to a point), the characters themselves came off as sympathetic and identifiable, with the possible exception of Rossi...and even he wasn't ALL bad; just human.My one quibble is the parenthetical subtitle "a screwball noir," as I believe dubbing it "screwball" does it a disservice. It reads more like what Elmore Leonard (or even James Ellroy) would write if he were transplanted from Detroit to the Emerald Isle.Nicely done. Now I need to read more of Declan Burke's work.

$REVIEW.: Undercover Professor was not really what I expected, but it was a fun and sexy read, anyhow.I adore romances about social opposites coming together and falling in love
I guess to some degree this was sort of the case

It was the case in Lucy's mind when she fell for Andy


Lucy is a successful hardworking responsible girl who's been burned by love

Because of this, she compiles a list of "don'ts" for men


This way she'll end up with someone who won't stomp all over her heart and someone who is looking for the same things in life as she is

Her number one rule is: does not lie

By all appearances, Andy lives with his mother, has no job and spends him time talking about or playing online games, so yes, completely opposite to Lucy


But this isn't true.Andy breaks the most important of Lucy's rules, don't lie, because he hiding his identity and posing as something he is not


Andy is in town undercover to do research for a gaming article he wants to publish

He's a pretty famous professor in the gaming world and couldn't do the research in his own town, so the fact that his mother needs care after hip surgery works out perfect for him
He'll stay with his mom to help her recuperate while posing as a between jobs gamer and be able to gather information incognito

What he doesn't count on is meeting and falling for Lucy


She lives in the same building as his mother and they immediately are attracted to each other with easy conversation, witty banter, and off-the-charts chemistry
Lucy doesn't want to fall for Andy because he breaks so many rules on her list, so she thinks

But she can't help the way they connect, and have fun together, and did I mention the off-the-charts chemistry?!! Well, that she can't ignore.I had fun reading Undercover Professor, and it is a relatively short read, but for some reason, it felt like it took me ages to get through
There is a miscommunication with Lucy's cousin, Becca and Andy in the beginning, where Becca, who is highly delusional, thinks Andy is going for her


Lucy doesn't want to hurt her cousin by carrying on with Andy until he gets it straightened out


This goes on for about 50% of the story, and it annoyed the heck out of me

I hate miscommunications that drag on and seem completely senseless.The relationship between Lucy and Andy was very magnetic and I really liked them together, but the cover-up that Andy goes on with for his article seemed ridiculous
I can't imagine not fessing up with this sooner, especially if he really cared for Lucy

I didn't see the need for secrecy that would've made this situation believable


At any rate, I do think this author can write captivating chemistry and characters, and some spice that got my blood pumping! I look forward to what she'll come up with next.A copy of this was provided by Carina Press through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review

Thank you!

$review_text.: The introduction didn&#8217;t really explain as much as I would have liked about the theory behind the diet or how it compares to other diets.  On the other hand, this is probably a diet that many people were recommended to by their doctors, so it may not need an extensive introduction.  I think following the diet completely would be hard since it tries to reduce both salty and sweet foods.  The recipes themselves weren&#8217;t brilliant, but there were some that showed how a normally unhealthy food could be made a part of the diet &#8212; for instance, the cheesecake bites.  I thought clever recipes like that made the diet seem less strict and more manageable.

$REVIEW.: I first read &quot;David and the Phoenix&quot; in 1958 when it became a selection of the Weekly Reader Chilren's Book Club.  I loved it then and I love it still.  I cannot think of another book which quite so filled me with a sense of wonder.  Edward Ormondroyd's vivid descriptions paint bright scenes of characters and places in the reader's imagination.  It is the kind of book that a child takes to heart, where it very well may remain ever after.  I know that, even before reading the recently reprinted edition, I could recount virtually every episode in the tale, with Joan Raysor's simple pen sketches still providing the framework for my mind's eye recreation of the story.  The book is full of humor, adventure, wonder, and gentle wisdom.  This is a genuine classic of imaginative children's literature.

$REVIEW.: First, there's novel tech trees I've never even heard of in here, such as the nanoweave clothing; the novella is emersed in this stuff! It's genuine scifi because you get just enough for it to be plausible and it's probably stuff that **will** be invented, in the medium term.Second, I felt far more strongly for both the protagonist and antagonist (both beautifully mastered, tempered and explored in this story) after about 30 pages than I did about any of the characters of most books after 300
I really got into their heads, could empathize with both, and at the end, I totally couldn't choose one over the other.Tl;dr: For $1, The Epoch Index is a steal! In 30 years, people will probably point to it as prophetic, just as we do to 2001: A Space Odyssey today.I don't know how he did it! By all means and purposes, after about 30 pages, I felt like I had read a 300 page novel

The closest experience I can relate this to is The Unincorporated Man (one of my favorite works of fiction); but The Epoch Index got close in about 1/10th of the words.Oustanding!

$REVIEW.: I had read Kurtz' previous Science fiction novels and enjoyed all of them, so I expected to enjoy this one. I was not disappointed. It is quite different from her previous novels.  What they have in common is a radically changed world (in this novel fairly soon, 2146), in this one not quite as desolate as in The Browne Candidate.  I would like a little more information as to how the US wound up divided into quadrants and what that means, perhaps that will come in future episodes.  [The others reviewers have done plot summaries so I will not do that.]But on to what we do have.  A fascinating lead character, Cybil Lewis, a private inspector (read investigaator), and a supporting cast who each have interesting backgrounds.  This includes Trey,a gorgeous male --created not born and Jane, a lesbian/bi-sexual inspector-in-training and Jane's aunt the mayor of Memphis.  The plot is a little strained in spots, but pulls together nicely toward the end of the book. Cybil is able to push through red tape, obfuscation and danger to herself to find out what happened to Jane's cousin.Kurtz has a way of creating characters that whet both the imagination and the curiousity of the reader.  I am looking forward to learning more about Cybil, Jane and Trey and their world as the series progresses.  Word is that the second volume will be out next year. I await its publication eagerly.

Not a single sex scene, except kisses and believe me, I am not the one to complain, it is just in all books I have read from her till my self imposed break there was A LOT of sex.So, I was very pleased, I also was very happy with the historical setting
Whatever I know of ancient Rome felt well researched and believable and if something was not, I have not noticed.I also loved the interesting and fast moving plot, loved that the writer did not shy away from the cruelty and violence which absolutely made sense for time period.And then comes the ending and I was laughing and shaking my head and not in a good way

Now, do not get me wrong, of course it is possible that stunts like that happened in history
It just did not feel believable to me

$review_text.: I found this book when I was on a military sci-fi binge. Of all the books I read, this stood out as one of the top. It mixes two of my favorite things - military and magic. The characters were great and developed well. There were some characters I hated and some I loved, because they were so well written and fit the role they had so well. There's nothing I can really think to complain about. I am giving this book 4/5 stars because I felt the pace was a tad to slow (At least in the beginning/middle part of the book) for the type of book I got the impression the author wanted to write.I also want to mention that I really enjoyed the the type of magic that exists in Shadow Ops. Each person that manifests has one type of magic, but there are many ways they can utilize it.

$REVIEW.: This a very, very well written story and I loved it!  I've read about everything out there that has to do with vampires and I've moved to stories with werewolves --- this is the best on I've read so far!  I wish there was whole series based on Bryn and her pack.  You really care for all the main characters and the story is full of surprise, action, and suspense!  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading fantasy.

$REVIEW.: This novel by Emlyn Rees tells the story of Danny Shanklin, he is a man with a past, and if his enemies have anything to do with it, no future beyond some excessive pain. He is a sort of private detective, who gets hired to find and or protect people. He is on a mission in London, when things go not quite according to plan.His story is mixed up with a Georgian Colonel, some Russia Mafiosi types and his family. After things go wrong, he has no choice but to show a clean pair of heels and do a runner. This is where the book kicks off, but it is fair to say that he manages to keep you gripped from the very start, he does sign post some of the tragedies early on but this is a way of ramping up the tension, and increase the empathy with Danny's plight.The plot unwraps in London, which has the most number of CCTV cameras anywhere in the world. They are linked to numerous systems, and some are SMART. We also have the police, numerous intelligence agencies, and a heightened awareness of Counter Terrorism methods. So once a man hunt has started, you need to be particularly good at not getting caught. Rees does a good and believable job, with only a couple of minor plot holes, which do not detract from the story. The story is more than a chase and there is loads more going on to keep you glued to the page.This is a page turner as other reviewers have said, but it is the action that does that, as the writing is unimaginative at times, but this is an action, crime thriller and not poetry, so not really a grumble. If you like action packed, often violent plots with more twists than a very twisty thing, then this is one you will love. It also seems to have left room for a sequel of sorts- and if that is the case I am definitely going to get it.

$REVIEW.: Imagine finding the man of your dreams but then instead of him making the first move you do, only your move is not the standard romance your way into his life move, it is moving away to a complete different town! Talk about getting out of Dodge!But would you feel as if life is not fair or would you try to find a way to make it work and somehow get the guy's attention? Or how about if the guy comes after you to show you he is ready to make any move you want him to, would you consider taking the plunge and tell yourself a long distance relationship can indeed work?These are only some of the endless questions that Melanie has to face when she finally has the job of her dreams and the man of her dreams in her sight, only when she discovers the deep, dark secret her dream man stripping-you-naked-is-all-I-need Raine carries she needs him to prove that he is worth the risk , the only and most important question left is will he,or will she be left with a broken heart?The main characters of both Melanie and Raine we very well written by the author. Melanie was a lot like some woman today very focused on her work and I adored that she pushes so hard to make her career a success, but I also felt that she was pushing a little too hard. As in real life today many woman tend to forget about that life has other elements to it, and keep going after the "my job is almost done just one more push and I will be there and able to relax" thus marriages end, relationships are destroyed beyond repair, parent child emotions are affected, the list goes on, but it made the character of Melanie very real to me and that I simply adored. I loved that the author used her work as a backdrop to not only take her back to her hometown and have a change at repairing her family ties but that she also used it as a buffer between Melanie and Raine, it showed that we can all do well in remembering that all work and no play indeed makes us very dull.The character of Raine was simply delicious and the author gave him so many yummy layers it left me breathless. I adored that he was mysterious it kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to find out what he was hiding. He was the kind of hero that when you start the read and he makes his move you think "awh how sweet and so incredibly romantic" then as the read continues you start thinking " okay that is still sexy but what is he hiding and just how bad it is?"  I adored how the author peeled back his layers to reveal the real man but not by giving too much or too little of the mystery at a time rather letting it unfold in such a manner that you know you need to keep going the best is going to come any minute now!I am taking away a message of life is not always all about work, if that is the only thing you focus on you will for sure end up alone and with only the memory that once you could have had it all. And most importantly never hold someone's past or current situations against them, rather let go and step up to the plate with the knowing of taking a risk once in a while could lead you to the kind of happiness you never imagined.I highly recommend this read for all fans of romance with a different approach. The author has a fun and fresh writing style and intertwines the lives of her main and secondary character with vivid detail. The read does start off a little slow but do not let that discourage you from going on, trust me it gets better and the more the various elements start to take life and the more characters are introduced into the read the better it gets.A sweet,sensual and emotional read!4.5 star review" He opens up her eyes to love but will she risk her heart for it?"I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for a honest review

$review_text.: Self esteem allows you to live an emotionally healthy and strong life. People with good self esteem are capable of handling any situation, no matter what happens. If you feel good about yourself, you can deal with anything. Self esteem is something you have to build for yourself; positive self image is not something that can happen when we passively rely on outside sources. If you leave your self esteem in the hands of others, you will always be susceptible to other people's ideas.How you view yourself is what's important. People with high self esteem are healthier, happier, and more comfortable in social situations. People with high self esteem also tend to be highly productive. Once you learn how to pull your own strings, so to speak, you can be one of these people too.This guide will show you how to do just that in a simple and straightforward manner. And, by following the strategies and techniques outlined in the book, you also could start `Feeling Great in 30 Minutes' - or less!This is a nicely written guide that I'm sure a lot of people will benefit from.

$review_text.: This book is just so likeable


If you like Chick Lit, then you're bound to like this book


It's an easy read, and you can speed right through it


But is speeding though what a reader really wants to do when she (or perhaps "he") wants a guide to writing Chick Lit? I suppose this is debatable.The writing is fun and entertaining

Perfect for the wannabe Chick Lit writer

A straight-laced, muted tone would not resonate with the intended audience, so this was done perfectly
Also, some of the topics are very well done in that they aren't "OVER done." For example, the Grammar and Punctuation chapter has some great examples of common mistakes and how to spot inconsistencies and more
And it is all done in a way in which your head doesn't want to explode.Giving it 4 stars because the book does fall short in some other areas - but let's face it, there are loads of guides out there to get you through various stages of writing a book

If you're interested in writing Chick Lit, or are new to the Chick Lit genre, this is a good one to have on your reading list.

$review_text.: I loved this book. I laughed so much at Frannie's unfortunate missteps. Her two best friends try to help her get together with a past crush from high school who returns home after years away. What happens is a hilarious story but a sweet romance too!! I did shed a few tears in the process along with Frannie. I really loved the HEA she got as that is what I look for in my romance reads. I really would have liked to read more about her romance at the end with the certain man(not giving away spoilers).  I am looking forward to reading more about Bliss Harbor, hopefully including her best friends.  This book has some steamy kisses but that is it. It is a clean romance, take a chance, I think you will like it.

$review_text.: There are several kinds of werewolves in modern fiction.  There are the misunderstood "good" werewolves, people who are afflicted with the lycanthropic curse, but who try to blend into society and cause no harm.  There are the purely evil werewolves, creatures bent on death and destruction.  And there are the more recent renditions who seem to either be falling in love with vampires or getting depressed when the pretty human girl falls for the vampire instead of him.  In Wolf Hunt, the werewolf is decidedly of the second version.  Ivan, the werewolf in question, is 100% evil.The book opens with George and Lou, two thugs for hire, breaking the thumbs of someone who ran afoul of some drug dealers.  Despite this pretty brutal act, they come across as somewhat nice guys, if thugs can be nice.  They do have limits, and to them, their violence is merely a job.  Their banter throughout the book is reminiscent of the characters in Pulp Fiction; bad, but good.Tasked with transporting a skinny man in a cage, they are told the man is a werewolf and should be left completely alone.  Of course, they don't believe the man is a werewolf, and Ivan keeps denying that he is.  George and Lou should have believed it.  Through a series of events, the two save Michele, an innocent bystander from death by dogs driven to a frenzy by Ivan, and then let Ivan escape.Initially fearful of how their client would react to them losing the werewolf, George and Lou decide to track Ivan down and recapture him.  But as Ivan goes on an orgy of death, they realize they have to stop Ivan, feeling guilty about allowing all those people to be killed and anxious to stop the bloodbath.Ivan is a pretty powerful werewolf.  He can control his changing so he is not dependant on a full moon.  And he can take an inordinate amount of punishment to include bullets to the head and huge gashes.  Only silver seems to slow him down.  And Ivan is very adept at killing.  George and Lou have a very difficult task ahead of them.Jeff Strand's writing style is light and witty.  The banter between the main characters is almost flippant, but not quite.  This is a dangerous path to take as most writers do not seem to be able to pull it off, but Strand only approaches "too much" and keeps just on this side of enjoyable.  The dialogue adds to the violent romp without crossing over into camp.Characterization is another major accomplishment.  In too many novels which take this approach, characterization suffers.  But the four main characters in this tale are well-fleshed and believable.The violence and death are continual and very graphic.  And that leads to a problem.  How can an author keep up the dramatic tension throughout an entire novel when one character is so obviously more adept and killing than the other characters?  In this case, why doesn't Ivan just kill George and Lou in their first fight rather than let them escape death over and over when other spear-carriers are dropping like flies?Strand uses Ivan's desire to make George, especially, suffer as more people are killed before he plans to kill him, and that works to an extent.  But even after Ivan finally decides it is time to kill George and Lou, he can't quite seem to do it despite his fervent intentions.  Either his blows do not kill them or he decides to run away when one of them has a gun or a grenade despite the fact that bullets, while painful, do not seem to cause him permanent damage.This is a tough quandary to an author, and Strand's method of dealing with it result in George and Lou being too robust and durable to fit the storyline.  Some of the tension seeps away once we see escape after escape by them.There were some other minor issues, such as when in a car chase, the use of grenades and dynamite did not follow reality, or if a werewolf's bite can make another person change into a werewolf, why did biting off the hand of one character not cause him to change as well?  But for the most part, the story flowed well.Wolf Hunt is a fun romp of death and destruction.  Its fast pace and light tone make for an easy read.  And Ivan hearkens back to the old, malevolent versions of werewolves, not the modern versions who seem to be more interested in fashion and getting the girl.  No brooding, handsome misunderstood soul, Ivan is the epitome of evil in the world, someone who kills simply because he can.And to me, at least, that makes him far more interesting.

$REVIEW.: While this story initially appears to be a stand-alone within the author's universe, the story's conclusion shows that it is, in fact, a part of the &#34;Demon Accord&#34; universe -- just a side issue, that may come into play in future stories.The story begins with another plane or universe broaching our own, with those crossing over &#34;stealing&#34; persons with special talents as part of a breeding program to supplement (their) population that has gone on for a very long time. Action sequences are targeted towards dealing with the &#34;invaders&#34;, eventually crossing over into the &#34;invaders&#34; plane/universe, with an interesting twist as the story's conclusion.
