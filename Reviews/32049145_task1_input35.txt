$REVIEW.: From The Ashes is the official prequel to TERMINATOR SALVATION and forms the first of a trilogy(Zahn's Trial By Fire follows the movie).We get introduced to all the primary characters in the film, John and Kate Connor, Barnes and Blair, a young Kyle Reese.Two threads here: Connor's group has a plan to take a staging area for Skynet intact and a building that had been surviving in the ruins for years is about to be assaulted by a band of Terminators. Hundreds of men, women, and children. Connor tries to help them as well.Nicely addition to the Terminator series.

$REVIEW.: Eric S

Brown is at it again
 He not only brings in the terror he's created with his Bigfoot series, but adds the madness of zombie horror to the world of his latest book, "Last Stand in a Dead Land".Brown brings the heat once again with his signature style: fast storytelling combined with wild action


 And this tale ends with a crazy swerve at the end that will make you shiver with delight


 It's another great entry to Brown's body of work and for any collector of his writings.

$review_text.: Vegan crockpotting is the best thing ever. This cookbook was not my first foray into this made-for-lazy-people-like-me brand of cooking that is sweeping the nation; after finding countless creative, delicious and easy recipes for free on the internets, I thought it would be nice to have a book to consult, rather than the unglamorous and dangerous way I'd prop my laptop on the kitchen counter to consult as a I dropped things in my crockpot.There's no delicate or easy way to say it: This cute little cookbook basically stinks. First of all, there aren't very many recipes, but the worst part is that the recipes aren't very tastey or interesting---and they heavily rely on very processed foods like "canned vegan gravy" (what the heck is that?) and "vegan sausage" (gag). I am giving this two stars because if you are brand spankin' new to crock-potting, and don't give a darn that your food is not especially nutritious or interesting, then heck: this might be the perfect cookbook for you.There's a terrific database of WONDERFUL vegan crockpot recipes on the fatfreevegan dot blogspot dot com website that'll make you want to crockpot until your fingers bleed. This one will only inspire you to put your crockpot back for another thirty years, which you absolutely should not do. Trust me.

$REVIEW.: Book Review of Children of Destruction by Al PhilipsonA Faster Than Light Book, copyright 2011 by Al PhilipsonChildren of Destruction is a fast-paced science fiction thriller that shows how all things, are, indeed, connected.The book opens on an alien world that is running out of resources for its intelligent, reptilian populace.  An unfortunate accident occurs with an advanced machine and suddenly most of the human life on Earth vanishes.  Philipson's clear imagery and quick time and dimensional shifts help the reader identify with the complex plot as two worlds unwittingly prepare to merge.The human contingency consists of a growing group of cooperative survivors, led by a man named Buck who realizes most of his fellow humans have disappeared when he arrives in Spokane, Washington.  The focus on Earth then becomes one of creating a sustainable farm with peaceful people.  Buck ends up being the only "safe" male so since the Earth timeline moves more quickly than the alien timeline, the reader watches as he and several women manage a farm, find resources and create a group marriage so that the planet can be repopulated.Meanwhile, the reptilians are preparing to leave their planet, with the usual dirty politics leaving behind parts of the slave races, and parts of the populace who don't agree with the main philosophy of power and control.  It will take many years, lifetimes, even, for the reptilians to reach their new home--guess where?And what will happen to Buck and his peaceful village of family members when the two worlds combine?Philipson's crisp style and subtle weaving of plots is reminiscent of Heinlein's work, making this an enjoyable read.

$REVIEW.: This is an odd little book, apparently written as a collaborative effort by a bunch of authors - who are not identified, and appear not to be active traders or knowledgeable technical analysts. That's the simplistic way the Stikky books are put together, apparently.The book has a very dismissive tone toward charting techniques that they (whoever 'they' are) don't understand. For example, it is dismissive of Fibonacci, wave theory, candlesticks (page 234) - and get this - would have you believe that true charting was only just discovered by a Professor Lo at MIT in 2000(page 126).The arrogance is a bit much (pages 229-234). For example, they are also dismissive of the classic book Technical Analysis of Stock Trends.Bottom line - This book is something to have a child or teenager read for a 'quicky' on charting - but it's a library loan - don't spend any money on it.If you do technical analysis and charting as an investor, you'll find it of little or no value - and the 'attitude' is a bit much.

$review_text.: ***I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review***While this book bills itself as "Bisexual Women's Erotica," the most intriguing stories to my mind were ones that might best be described as pansexual. In these stories, gender identity is fluid and not necessarily tied to chromosomes, such as Sinclair Sexsmith's "Right-Red Flagging," Giselle Renarde's "Glitter in the Gutter," and Cheyenne Blue's "Page of Wands," or both biological sex and gender identity are less a factor in attraction than some other spark, such as Jean Roberta's delightfully odd "Operetta". Relatively few stories are stereotypical tales of a woman having a menage with both male and female lovers, so if that's your particular fantasy (or your lifestyle that you'd like to see mirrored in some hot stories, you lucky person), this anthology may surprise you. Rest assured, though, there are some fun stories playing with that trope as well.Several reviewers took exception to the borderline non-con elements in Kay Jaybee's "The Wife." I can understand why some people found it disturbing. For me, on the other hand, it proved one of the sexiest and most memorable stories in the collection, playing with common fantasies about being "forced" to submit to something you want to do, all the while knowing you actually could get away if you wanted to. Different strokes for different folks!I rarely give a solid 5 stars to anthologies, since inevitably some stories are weaker or less to my taste than others, and this was true of Twice the Pleasure. But this is definitely worth a read, and enough of the stories are worth a reread that it's highly recommended for lovers of bisexual/pansexual erotic tales.

$REVIEW.: This book has a lot going for it. Ancient evil, witches, Pan, and good old Rock N Roll. How could you go wrong?As a huge fan of rock music and the blues, I'm on board with the whole Robert Johnson "sold his soul" train. This book was an original twist on that story, with the modern accoutrements of an evil record producer and an ogre of a music label.For a while in the middle portion, the pacing slowed down a lot, (technical stuff in the recording studio), but then the story began to get more complicated and from there this tale came alive. That's also when that originality kicked in and delivered some spice and surprise.Overall, I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it for horror fans that don't mind a slow burning story, without much gore, and for fans of old school stories like The Great God Pan.

$REVIEW.: This is a must-read, especially if you're thinking about going vegan

This book addresses everything that you, as a meat eater, wish that you knew when your vegan friend is lecturing you about the &#34;dangers&#34; of animal meat.You will learn about how you cannot eat anything without some animal dying for it at some point.You will learn about how reckless forms of agriculture, but more specifically monocrops such as wheat, corn, and soy, destroy entire ecosystems.You will learn about the politics of big-name food companies like Monsanto that are working hard to destroy economies in the US and abroad, all while producing addictive, non-nutritious &#34;food&#34; products like processed, packaged junk food, soda, etc., some even under the guise of healthy foods.You will learn about why you need protein, why saturated fat isn't all that bad, why you need a certain amount of cholesterol in order for certain bodily functions to take place, and why sugar and grains are the cause of most of our current health epidemics in the country.You will learn how meat got a bad name through practices of feeding grains to cows who should be eating grass, feeding a vegetarian diet to chickens, who hunt for worms, other insects, and even sometimes small animals, and therefore are omnivores, and thus making livestock sick

(And a sick animal means less than optimal nutrition when you eat their flesh; happy cows are healthy cows are tasty cows are nutritious cows.)Even if you don't agree with everything in this book, it will give you a lot to mull over


So give it a chance, at least.

$review_text.: Although I am late to read this series, I am so glad that I found this book on NetGalley.  I grew up in the sixties in a small town; and reading this book brought back so many memories -both sweet and sad.  Ava Miles had created a typical small town with all of the colorful characters and attitudes of small towns throughout America.Arthur Hale was a strong young man who believed that the American people of the west should have a voice that could be heard throughout America.  He wanted to share not only his own voice but theirs so that the &#34;big&#34; industries and policitians on the east coast would know how all people feel about politics and international affairs.Harriet was beautiful, smart and efficient.  She captured Arthur from their first meeting.  Their story was filled with twists and turns that all great love stories need for the two main characters to grow.  The supporting cast was so perfect in this small town in the sixties.  Arthur's family and the others that I got to meet as Arthur and Harriet's story progressed were all people that I would love to meet.  It was a unique love story because of the circumstances that brought Harriet to Dare Valley;but it was complete with the HEA that I want in each of the romances that I read.  I am looking forward to the next book in this series by Ava Miles.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Nick has something Willow wants. But in order to get it, it comes with strings attached. Ones she&#8217;s not sure are a good idea. Ones she&#8217;s familiar with. And even though she knows there is the possibility that he will burn her&#8230; again, she accepts the terms and decides to go along with his little game.Willow has something Nick wants. And it&#8217;s pretty simple&#8230; her. All of her. And he&#8217;s determined to make her see that he&#8217;s the man she belongs with.Now don&#8217;t all good love stories begin with a little blackmail? Just kidding, Nick is so sweet that I don&#8217;t really think he knows the right way of going after a women that he actually wants, and one that he&#8217;s willing to keep forever. So he does it the only way he knows how, and in some ways he actually made it work. I kind of felt sorry for the poor sap at times though. He seemed to get conflicting advice from his friends. It&#8217;s a good thing he stuck with it and eventually got what he wanted.Now as much as Willow and her insecure, poor me attitude made me want to shake the ever living sh!t out of her, Nick&#8217;s swoony, smooth talking, football-stud-hunkiness, with just the right amount of alpha male, totally made the story and kept me wanting more from him. And to tell you the truth, I would still like some more of him! Now, I wasn&#8217;t always hating on Willow. She was strong willed; determine to succeed without any help from her sometimes overbearing rich daddy. Yes, she was wronged by Nick in the past, but she really doesn&#8217;t know the truth why he left her behind the first time. No one can really fault a young up-and-coming football player for doing what he did either, he made the right decision for him, at the time.I would have liked to replace Willow in the book with someone more like myself. Who&#8217;d be at his mercy day and night. On second thought&#8230; that story would have only been about lots of hot steamy sex, with no actual plot, and who wants to read that? Not I! That&#8217;s right, leave the story line to the professionals. I guess on that thought, Willow does add some feistiness and boldness to the story. I suppose she wasn&#8217;t all that bad, she was just protecting her heart, and I sort of get that. And kudos to her for being able to resist Nick as long as she did. If Nick loves her and momma Hamilton loves her, then I guess I can too. Just as long as she makes him happy.I also love that Karen still gave us glimpses of Jared and Sheridan from the first book in the series, Game for Marriage, I&#8217;ve seriously missed those two.Karen never fails to give us the steamy sex and I especially liked the restaurant roof top at the Wharf. And Willow definitely had me laughing at her silly little leg routine, you&#8217;ll need to read it to find out what I mean. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy the story as much as I did, and now it starts all over again, with the long wait for the next book in the series.flag

$review_text.: Around Halloween, I always like to delve into something paranormal. Lola James' Bound to Remember is a fun autumn read with vampires, witches, and just a bit of mytholgoy. It's a short read that I breezed through in one sitting, and one that I enjoyed for the most part.Bound to Remember's main character, Toni Hollander, is an ER doctor who is given the task of introducing the new nurse, Benjamin Slaton, to the workings of their hospital. As they get to know one another, their attraction begins to turn into something more. Their relationship progresses quite a bit over the course of several days, but again, this is a very short book, and that sort of thing happens. It's not entirely unbelievable because they're two &#34;young&#34; people who are lonely and unable to socialize in the same manner as most other people. Though I would like to have seen more development, I still liked the book.One thing that I did have a problem with in Bound to Remember is the editing. There were a LOT of errors that could have been caught by an editor or even Microsoft Office's spell check. I think some aspects of the story would be more enjoyable if they were tightened up, and again, that is something an editor could potentially help with.Overall, I enjoyed the time I spent reading Bound to Remember, and I will probably make time to read Unbound in the future because it was a cute story. I would like to see where things go from the cliffhanger ending of Bound to Remember.

 What is most enjoyable about it, to me, is the voice of each character

 I loved Olly


 His sleazy ex is crazy as all get out


 I wonder what is motives were for doing all that crazy stuff
 We never learn that

 Probably just crazy
 I sure wish they had done more to him (both in the club and later)
 I would have enjoyed that.I like the fact that Olly is still open to seeking a dom
 I like the fact that despite everything that happened to him, he knew what he needed and sought it out.I liked Joe, the dom
 Joe is a much better man than even he thought since all his friends thought he would be the perfect person/dom to help Olly.It's a nice idea that there are places for doms to go to learn how to be doms

 I hope there are more stories.I can't wait to read Heath's story.

Stratton changed my mind, if they are like what I just read, then I have found a new genre I love!It has everything you would need in a good story ROMANCE, INTRIGUE, LAUGHTER, and of course SUSPENSE


It keeps you on the edge of your seat gasping and holding your breathe at times or laughing at the antics of some certain old ladies ;)I was captivated and swept away from the moment I opened up my e-reader and read Prologue basically! YOU had me at 'THE', M.Stratton, You had my hooked!The cast of characters are as follows: the damaged but strong willed survivor Alexia (Lexi), The gorgeous and sexy rock star who has his own personal turmoil Noah , A psycho creeper and stalker named Anthony and the drum roll please ..
Three of the most endearing and HILARIOUS older ladies you could ever meet: Evelyne, Marie and Leigh.It will lead you into a world of twists and turns, ups and downs, survival and triumphs, love and heartbreak

I cringed and cried, laughed so hard my sides hurt and ran to check to see if my doors and windows were locked! The only one thing this novel will not provide to you ladies is the ability to PUT IT DOWN!I really loved the fact that we were provided with the POV'S of all three characters, as I have stated before I love that about books, you know me though I lose concentration if too many &#34;voices&#34; are talking but ohhh did this author do one heck of a job, in my humble opinion it was BRILLIANCE! and made this already fantastic novel even richer!Both coming to a place where they can decompress and focus on themselves, these two characters are attracted to each other from the moment they set eyes on one another

$review_text.: This was an excellent book. Warning: this is heavy BDSM/sadism, M/M. The characters are phenomenal. Jonathan and Brandon are both very compelling in their own way. Brandon is tough but you know there's more to him, a vulnerability that needs to be exposed. Jonathan is sure of himself, cocky, and knows what he wants, but when faced with Brandon, he falters in his beliefs in a very vulnerable way.The actual BDSM/sadism "play" in this book can be extreme. Jonathan enjoys causing pain and as he's trying to break Brandon down in order to get through the barriers he's erected to his true self, it gets quite harsh in a few places. Be aware.I loved the ending. The realizations that both men come to are very authentic. This is a two book story arc, but the ending of Resistance is at a good spot. I will be buying the next book in the next week so that I can dive back in because I can see where the story is (I hope) going and I very much want to get to that.The writing is excellent. Truly. Rich descriptions of food, the BDSM play, and of the feelings of each man. It's written in dual POV third person so you get very familiar with the thoughts of both men.Highly recommended, but definitely be aware that sadism plays a role here.

$REVIEW.: Granted I haven't read a lot of steampunk books but I thought this was excellent.  I am no expert on the steampunk genre but I am an expert on what I like and this fit into THAT genre just right.  It starts off very well.  Inspector William Thomas was an interesting character and the crime mystery element was excellently done.  I liked how independent Lady Pheobe Hughes was and her take on tinkering (really distilling with a dash of pharmaceuticals manufacturing) was fun.  Her lost love coming back allowed us to skip over the 'getting to know each other' aspect of a romance novel.  Everyone in this book had their secrets and the writing was good enough to make me suspect each character for a bit based on that.  This was a romance and had plenty of sex to keep the attention of a connoisseur of adult books like myself.Well written characters, dialogue, plot, red herrings, romance and mystery with a dash of faux Victorian made Viridis an enjoyable read.  I highly recommend.

$review_text.: Maeve Haile and Kate Hanson have been best friends since childhood. Now, middle-aged and busy caring for their families, they have found a nice, quiet life for themselves in Elkhorn, Colorado, the same small town they both grew up in.The two friends, while out enjoying dinner at a restaurant one night, witnessed the shooting of Vivian Astaire, one of the few wealthy women in Elkhorn. Naturally, the murder falls into the hands of the local police who were unable to uncover very much. Afraid that the murder would get swept under the rug, and inspired by the Nancy Drew books that they used to read as kids, Maeve and Kate decides to take the murder mystery into their own hands, thus prompting them to ask: "What Would Nancy Do?"What Would Nancy Do? by Maureen Mullis is a fun and cozy murder mystery that felt like a cross between (of course, excluding the Nancy Drew series) Scooby-Doo and the eighties sitcom, Cagney and Lacey. I also felt that the story was probably near and dear to Mrs. Mullis, as many aspects of the book seemed autobiographical--based solely off her bio.Being a fan of cozy murder mysteries myself, I found this story extremely fun to read. After the requisite introductions and backstories, the murder mystery instantly takes off--which is awesome! The pacing afterwards was also great, keeping consistent and exciting by giving the reader morsels of information, but never too much--which is always a good sign of a splendid mystery novel.The characterization of the huge cast was also commendable. I think Mullis gave each of the important characters a well-defined personality and backstory, as well as motive to play with the reader's mind on whether or not they were somehow responsible/connectedto the shooting. Mullis also did a fine job keeping the story cohesive and tight, and when the mystery was finally revealed at the end, the explanation was well-told and sensible.The only potential drawback is perhaps the reader's inability to connect with Maeve and Kate (though this did not happen to me) because they are both women in their fifties, thus diminishing the reader's ability to fully connect with the story. In addition, the general story was light and fun, and perhaps not suitable to the taste of readers who are looking for something that's darker or grittier in nature.Overall, I really enjoyed reading What Would Nancy Do? because it was fun, fast-paced, humorous, and well-expressed. I want to give a big kudos to Maureen Mullis for creating such an entertaining story.

$review_text.: I'm going to have to concur with the comments of Conrad. I think the author did a great disservice to her audience by giving such a marginal advice as to how to start and run a photo business. Further, time and again she is simply stating the obvious (i.e. if you don't know how to file your taxes, hire an accountant).What really threw me off, though, is that she seems to be giving advice as to how to start a business under the assumption that the person has unlimited resources at his or her disposal. This is her approach (hyper-abridged): Buy all the equipment/rent studio space, hire a CPA, hire a lawyer, promote yourself, mass advertising, get line of credit, expand.The author's overly simplistic model seems to be out of touch with the realities facing most, if not all, start-up businesses which is funding, funding, funding, funding and more funding. No matter how good a plan or how good idea you might have without proper funding you won't make it--period! Furthermore, it's unbelievably hard to get decently-priced business loans for a start-up (assuming you can get one at all).This book simply put is mediocre and needs work. I gave three stars because I thought some of the advice she gives is definitely good advice; that said, I don't think this primer in and of itself is very good for photo start-ups or people considering becoming one.

$REVIEW.: This book takes you on a wild 737 roller-coaster ride with the CIA, aliens, a movie star and a secret agent named Cleo Matts who works for a deep cover agency embedded within the CIA.  Get ready for interplanetary action and lots of hilarious interdisplinary dialogue.  I was reminded at times of the classic Hitchhiker's Ride to the Galaxy while reading Terminal Departure, with smaller doses of Get Smart.  Cleo Matts is an eminently likable and capable spy, but can one man save the world?  I liked this book and look forward to seeing what crazy scheme Cleo will have to unravel next.

I could easily envision the setting of the Mallace estate in lovely Eureka Springs. That city has always captured my imagination. It isn't difficult to become absorbed in this incredible story where the house is as much a character as the people.  You'll keep reading just to know what happens to Carin as her life becomes increasingly more complicated by the mystery surrounding her. There were surprises from the first chapter until the last page. This book is not meant for very young readers as it deals with some intense drama, but teens and adults alike should enjoy it.

$REVIEW.: Reiki Meditations for Self-Healing: Traditional Japanese Practices for Your Energy and VitalityI highly recommend this set of 2 audio CD's

When I first heard that this CD set was out I thought, "why should I purchase this? I already have all of Bronwen's audio meditations via their website and on CD


This will just be what I already teach and work with." A friend of mine just raved about the new CD so I bought it to see for myself

I am so happy that I purchased it

This set is completely different from any other offerings from the International House of Reiki
I highly recommend this audio CD set to all of my Reiki students, friends and to anyone that is just curious about what Reiki is and how it works.Browne Stiene is a co-founder of The International House of Reiki in Australia

She and her husband Frans have done extensive research into the history of Reiki in Japan and are bringing to the world all that they have learned and discovered

This 2 CD set brings all of their findings and teaching together in a compact form

Be guided and taught by Bronwen's beautiful and sweet voice as she shares the history of the International House of Reiki (founded by her husband Frans Stiene and herself) and the history of Reiki itself


You will learn Reiki as a spiritual practice from the Japanese perspective

There are many beautiful guided meditations that will help you build a strong foundation for your Reiki practice.Bronwen teaches in a very beautiful way, the system of Reiki
You will learn what the 3 diamonds are as she tells wonderful stories and then guides you through beautiful meditations that will connect you deeply with earth energy, heavenly energy and heart energy


Bronwen teaches and guides you through a very powerful meditation that is so simple and yet I feel is the key to working with the Reiki energy.Most people that practice Reiki know the system of Reiki:The 5 PreceptsMeditations & techniquesHands on healingSymbols and mantrasReiju/ spiritual blessingBronwen teaches wonderful meditations and shares stories that are wonderful food for thought about each of the 5 precepts
The 5 precepts are the foundation of the system of Reiki
Bronwen tells delightful and thought provoking stories about each of the 5 precepts.Bronwen teaches us how Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki, practiced teaching hands on healing and then she does a guided meditation to teach you how to do a hands on self healing treatment on yourself.There are many wonderful techniques that Bronwen teaches and shares through out the CD


These techniques are so simple, but even the most advanced Reiki practitioner will deepen and strengthen their Reiki practice if they learn and practice any of these techniques.The next element in the system of Reiki is the symbols and mantras

I first learned Reiki via Western teachings


The symbols and mantras were kept secret and had totally different meaning from what was originally taught
Bronwen shares with us how to connect to the energy of the symbols and mantras (earth energy, heavenly energy, heart energy) with out telling the non-Reiki practitioner what they actually are
Learn how to open to your unlimited potential.Finally we are taught about Reiju
Reiju translated means spiritual blessing

Reiju is commonly known as an attunement today.I can not say enough good things about this CD series

It is a must have for your library


This CD is for everyone from people that are curious about what Reiki is, to beginning Reiki students, to practicing Reiki teachers

I can make this promise, if you practice just one of the meditations or techniques on this CD your Reiki energy as well as practice will grow and your connection will deepen
Thank you Bronwen for making this beautiful CD.

$REVIEW.: Self publishing has become so popular. But this does not mean that anyone should try to write an ebook. This is just a jumbled bunch of  substandard writing with some sex, including BDSM elements to get attention. The protagonist Izzy has recently left a damaging relationship in which she was submissive. Basically in the majority of the novel the Dom was refered to as HE(also HIM and HIS) which was so annoying! The characters were undeveloped , and the plot lame. I can't for the life of me understand those that thought this was well written!  I found it ok if you want to skim the novel in about 30 minutes. Lacking substance and interesting characters were the least of its problems. There is absolutely no comparison to the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day,or anything at all by Tiffany Reisz. In fact, the author should be locked in a room and forced to read Tiffany Reisz or Sylvia Day's books to see what a well written erotic novel is really like. Reading this ebook is like wearing Payless shoes and convincing yourself that they look just like a pair of Jimmy Choos!  Ms. Baker, you've got some writing potential but reading this was not enjoyable.

$REVIEW.: I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!Enjoy &lt;3

This probably won't get re-read, but it really is 'better' than "I like it".Entertaining addition to the Roger and Suzanne series of mysteries. Could probably be read as a stand alone but the background and character development from previous books in the series would make this much more enjoyable.Very well crafted, tightly written novelette with returning characters from a series I enjoy. I particularly like this series for the way the characters are presented, a married couple, mature, well educated and sensible. The author manages the plot lines very well without having to resort to "doing something stupid" which is something that is more rare than I'd like it to be.

The Past- day 1 of the apocalypse3. Back story - of 1 of 2 people Harry is trying to kill. They are going to die. Why do we need to know if they are liked or not by the other tenants?4. So we're back in the past now but wait...5. Back story on Harry the cop before he was Harry to building manager6. In the back story, we take a side trip on shoot-to-kill vs shoot-to-wound. Important why?7. We do end up back in the past again, with Harry the cop, but only for a line or two. then...8. We get the side story on the Mozambique Drill...something Harry learned as a trainee cop.9. We end section 1 - which can't be more than a few hundred words - still in the past as he watches the two ladies he shot get back to their feet.We have 2 or 3 sentences on the story &#34;present day&#34; before we are swept back time and time again to learn things we don't need to know, don't need to know now or things used to simply push up the word count. Stories need to move forward. The important aspects of the characters' background can be introduced but at least set up your world and characters.

$review_text.: You know what you finish a book and as you reach the last page all you want to do is turn to the beginning and start it all over again? The truths it spoke were just that thirst-quenching, the ways in which it spoke them are just that captivating
"Rumors of God" by Darren Whitehead and Jon Tyson was just that book for me.Captivated by the C.S
Lewis quote above, the two Aussie pastors in America set out to explore various "rumors" of the Christian life, what truths can be found in the rumors, and how those truths are holding up in the life of the average Christian

Where we are lacking, why are we lacking? What does this say about God? What does this say about us? It looks challengingly at the claims we make about Jesus and about what it looks like to be His followers and examines the way our lives reflect that to a world which has only heard the rumors..
Painting pictures with historical stories of experiences of faith, on both an individual and a corporate level, this book has influenced the way I pray, and awakened in me a greater desire not only for His Kingdom come on earth, but a greater passion to BE His Kingdom coming TO the world He's placed us in.My copy is now riddled with underlining and stars in the margins :) I'd love to lend it to you, if you're in my neck of the woods!! Because He is so much more than a rumor, and our lives are meant to say so much more than we are letting them...

Because of that Dennis missed out on his Daughters childhood and several people he cared about died without ever learning of final success in proving his innocence. Oh and he spent 12 years in jail for something he didn't do. He never gave up. I met Dennis at a Barnes and Nobles at a book signing in Tucson. He struck me as quiet and contemplative.

 This story ensnared me from the very beginning
The Marquess of Montfort accosted Lady Allison in a secluded garden, mistaken her for someone else he is to meet
 She slaps him!(twice I might add) and the chase begins
He is a rakehell of the first order and she doesn't want anything to do with him

 But that doesn't stop him from seeking her out at every ball for the waltz and she denies him every time
 What start off as a game of challenge to him ends up in a marriage that neither want but both need

$review_text.: This book was so awesome. Move over Charlie's Angels, here come the Stilettos. This was one of the most entertaining reads I have read in a while.  It is so light, and easy that it makes it almost impossible to put down. There are so many different things happening in the story which would normally make it confusing and hard to keep up with but Lexi does is perfectly. I cannot wait until book 2.Book 1 is about Paige, who seems to be the main girl, leader of the group.  Although each female brings her own power and strength to the group, Paige has a magnetism that brings them all to her. Right off the bat in the first chapter we have action and a bit of steam. Love it! and it only continues. Paige has been recently dumped by the man who literally pulled her off the streets and saved her, Collin.  In a time of revenge and weakness, she found herself in the arms of Darian, a fellow agent. Specials, people with some special abilities, have been disappearing without a trace.  Paige and her girls have been tasked with solving the disappearances and the conspiracy against the president.  When Paige's ex becomes the number one suspect, she must put her feelings aside to solve the case.  Darian and his team are also trying to solve the disappearances while keeping an eye on the girls, especially Paige.  When Darius keeps information about the case from the girls, Paige refuses to be sidelined because of Darius's need to protect her.

$review_text.: Thank you to Pepper Winters for sending me an ARC copy of Quintessentially Q for an honest review.I completely fell in love with Tess and Q in the first book of the dark erotica Monsters in the Dark series, Tears of Tess, so I jumped at the chance to read this ARC
I don't consider this sequel to be a standalone

A lot of things were left unexplained because the reader is already expected to know it.Please read the first book or you most likely won't like, appreciate or understand this book.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *****(Some spoilers were deleted by request of the author)*****Tess and Q are already in love (she says it, he doesn't, but they both feel it)
The sex is HOT and it takes up the majority of the first third of the book


We feel their emotions, learn about their expectations of one another, but they are both too afraid to really give in and trust the other completely, especially Q

Communication has always been a problem for them and it continues all throughout the book.Both Q and Tess forgot to remove the tracking device in her neck--which is a totally stupid move on their part--which led the bad guys right to her
My only problem with her kidnapping is that I had no idea it was going to happen
The blurb for QQ doesn't state anything about it


I had heard that this book was darker than the first--and it is--but I expected it to be darker with Q and Tess in the bedroom, not at the hands of traffickers


According to the last book and the beginning of this book, Q and Tess planned to go after the bad guys to make them pay so I wasn't surprised that they had a big part in the book


What confused me was how they were introduced.My main question that I had for the original book was finally answered in this book

The question: Why did Q string Tess up during the dinner party? Frederick asks this and Q explains


I totally forgive Q for doing this horrible thing because his explanation made perfect sense
My only problem is that Q didn't tell Tess and she still wonders why he hurt her like that.We first meet Frederick in the previous book and, even though I knew he was a good guy, I still didn't like him
I just didn't trust him or know much about him


I now love Frederick thanks to this book

He plays a much bigger role and I loved the scenes where he stood up to Q, his best friend, and beats the crap out of him

He doesn't fear Q at all, which is great, and Q cares for him like brother


Their scenes together were some of the best.I loved seeing Franco as a badass! I knew he was tough--after all, he is Q's head of security--but seeing him kick ass, murder rapists and treat the blonde girl with the belly button ring with such kindness makes me swoon.I wish we saw more of Suzette
She's an awesome character.I loved watching Q get his hands dirty--literally

He's so determined and headstrong, even though he's breaking on the inside and suffering from deliberating migraines.One of the final scenes left me in awe


I had hope Q would submit to Tess and it finally happened!!! She beat the crap out of him and I loved every minute of it.Even though a lot of horrible things happened to this couple, the bad was needed to bring them closer together

The bad made Tess darker and, once Q submitted himself to her darkness, he became lighter
He found balance with the beast, which is what Tess had wanted since the beginning of the book--for him to be both man and monster at the same time.I really liked this story, it moved me to tears several times, but I found myself distracted and a little bored because of the book's repetitious nature
At times I felt that the author just copied sentences from a previous passage and pasted it into a new section
My sympathy for the characters faded in the middle of the book--where most of the drama and pain should be felt--because of the repetition
I understand that Q and Tess went through hell, physically and mentally, and I know that it takes time to heal, but the author used the same words, again and again, to express how the characters' felt.When the author didn't repeat herself, she used lots of interesting similes to describe emotions and surroundings

That's normally great but I felt that it took away from the story because she used so many

It made the story sound wordy

 On top of that, for all the hell the characters went through, I was surprised that they were sane enough to come up with some of these very detailed similes to describe what they felt or what had happened


Their brains should be mush from drugs, pain, guilt, lack of sleep, etc; not well enough to overly describe their surroundings.Overall, I really enjoyed this book


I loved watching Q and Tess grow as humans, monsters, friends and lovers

They deserve a happily ever after


Let's hope they get it! ;)4 Stars!

Can't get much fluffier!Myrtle Clover is a retired English teacher with a Chief-of-Police son.  She writes a helpful tips column for the local paper but that isn't enough to keep her mind busy and when a dead body shows up in her local beauty parlor, she can't help herself.  She has to find out what happened.  Over the protests of her son and the state police detective, Myrtle sets out to solve the case.  Since all the suspects are her friends, neighbors and acquaintances, she might have more luck than the officials!This book is light, fun and, as I've said, fluffy.  The characters are definite &#34;types&#34;, the stressed out mom, the socialite, the old maid, the reformed bad girl.  This isn't a drawback, it's one of the things that makes it comfy.  Quick and easy reading, nothing stressful, controversial or disturbing.  A fun way to spend a couple of hours and you could recommend it to your 13 year old daughter or your 83 year old grandmother.

There are dogs, cats, snowmen, forest animals, Christmas globes, Santas, sledding, Vintage, toys, Noah's ark, bears and, of course, the Nativity for the themes.Each pattern is two pages so seeing the counted cross stitch graph is not too hard.  A color photo accompanies each project.  All you have to do to get the template for the stocking itself is enlarge one of the color photos 169%.  A copy store can help with this.  There are two pages of general instruction that show what the symbols mean and they also explain how to create each stitch.My only problem was I didn't know which one to start with.  Hopefully, you will be able to choose one!  My needle and I will be working into the night on these wonderful projects.

$review_text.: I just love the characters Robin Bielman has created for this series. They're a lot of fun to read about and root for, especially Shane and Kagan, the hero and heroine--but really, readers will find themselves caring just as much about the secondary characters as well. (I'm going to say it now--Kagan's best friend Charlotte had better get her own book somewhere down the line. She totally deserves it!) The town that the Secret Wishes books take place in--Cascade, Oregon--has a homey, small-town feel to it without being overly treacly. The townspeople are quirky and of course want to get involved in the lives of our hero and heroine, but aren't overbearing and annoying about it. Their actions give our two main characters just the right amount of "push" throughout the story.The development from fake relationship to real one was nicely done. Shane and Kagan have some obvious chemistry going on here, and the sparks fly pretty quickly. Being a Bliss novel, the physical parts of their relationship were closed door, but there were some delicious kissing scenes.The very few things that gave me pause in this story--like Shane's boss's attitude, Kagan's father's ultimatum, and Shane's reasons for never again having a real girlfriend--are either eventually explained in a way that makes them more palatable or end up being resolved in a satisfactorily believable way. Things do move a bit fast in the story, but as there's an end date to Kagan's time in town, that too doesn't end up being too much of a stretch.Overall, this was another sweetly satisfying and sexy read. I am definitely on board for the next one in the series. Though can I just say--this novel has one of the best "get the girl back" scenes I've read in a long time? I'm not sure how Robin will be able to top that next time. Oh, and the (slight spoiler alert) proposal scene is just too sweet. I absolutely love the ring!A- rating.I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Well written erotica, a bit redundant sometimes (repeating the same stuff over, using different words- couldn't figure out if writer was trying to up word count, or just assumed the reader was too dumb to figure it out the first time (I noticed same tendency in the next book).

$review_text.: I purchased Story of the World (all volumes) after reading Well Trained Mind, signing up for Classical Conversations, and hearing friends rave about them.  It seems to be a great historical narrative for grade school ages.  My only hesitation is on the first few chapters of volume 1. I bought thinking this was a Christian home school curriculum, yet the first few chapters seem to indicate an older earth with thousands of years of nomadic and cavemen life.  The book begins with nomadic life and early settlements in Mesopotamia followed by Egyptian Old Kingdom and then Sargon and then onto Abram. No creation. No flood. No indication there were great cities built pre-flood.  We are working thru book 1 over the summer and I hope my uneasiness subsides as we get into more documented history. But as the author is using the old testament as a ancient source to draw from, I question why she starts where she starts instead of at the beginning.....

Extremely well put together in terms of logical flow from one topic to the next, and good examples and case histories to illustrate her points. Caroline covers the meaning of Archetypes and their impact on our lives from an energetic standpoint. This is the best description of Archetypes that I have come across so far. She makes it easy to recognize these Archetypes at work in ourselves and in others.  Among other things, she covers the significant differences between a job, a career and a vocation, and the spiritual energies that push us towards expanding our awareness of why we are here.

$REVIEW.: AFTERMATH  (1920's Oxford) by Charlie CochraneWhen shy Edward Easterby first sees the popular Hugo Lamont, he's both envious of the man's social skills and ashamed of finding him so attractive.Edward is a very shy young man who is miserable in his first year at university and he would do anything to switch places with the popular Hugo who seems to tower above him. Their first meeting is disastrous and does not augur well for any future friendship let alone an intimate relationship.This turns out to be a tender story about two young men just finding their way who are uncertain about their feelings for someone of the same sex and concerned about how any expression of these feelings could impact their future. There is quite a bit of angst as they seem to go over the same ground amidst the tea and crumpets and a bit of cricket but they eventually figure out that "To thine own self be true" is more than just a platitude. Although there wasn't much sex in this tale I found it quite entertaining.GENTLEMAN'S GENTLEMAN (Victorian) by Lee RowanLord Robert Scoville has lived in a reasonably comfortable Victorian closet, without hope of real love, or any notion that it's right there in front of him if he would only open his eyes and take notice of his right-hand man, Jack Darling. Jack has done his best to be satisfied with the lesser intimacy of caring for the man he loves, but his feigned role as a below-stairs ladies' man leaves his heart empty.This is such a beautifully told story. The level of detail in the background was so well done I felt that I lived it. The intrigue and espionage in the plot and pace of the action built up my anticipation for what would surely come next.The main difference between a contemporary and historical story is, I believe, the ability of the historical writer to immerse the reader in a world that is purely imaginary but described in such loving detail that you feel you're actually living in the period and Lee Rowan does this very successfully in Gentleman's Gentleman. The characterizations are bang on from Jack and his Robert to the smaller role occupied by Captain Cecil McDonald; they were all well drawn for such a short story. The dialogue was so full of euphemisms that I laughed out loud on occasion - very upper class English society. The hint of espionage and criminal wrongdoings add spice to the story and help to throw Jack and Robert together. Imagine living together for 10 years in close quarters with no moves by either one to test the waters!HARD AND FAST (Regency) by ErastesMajor Geoffrey Chaloner, recently returned from the Napoleonic war is the impoverished third son of a wealthy father who wants to improve his own social status by marrying Geoffrey off to a young lady, The Honourable Emily Pelham who is from a very noble family that could use a bit of cash. However, standing in the way of this very suitable match is the fact that the potential groom is not the slightest bit interested in marriage and is much more attracted to Emily's cousin, Adam Heyward.Geoffrey's character is big and muscular and he struggles with his feelings for Adam who is physically the weaker of the two, partially crippled by a club foot, but who is the stronger one in the relationship and is more experienced in the ways of the world. Adam makes life extremely difficult for Geoffrey by questioning his motives for wanting to marry his cousin. The two men are driven by an emotion neither has felt before and they become more and more involved with no way out until a solution is provided from a completely unexpected source.I was entranced by the passion between Geoffrey and Adam and the shifts in power between them as their very short dalliance progressed. I thought that this was by far the most sensuous of the three novellas and Erastes certainly knows how to keep the reader's interest at peak level throughout the story. I was totally engaged until the very last page.SPEAK ITS NAME: Trilogy No. III is a wonderful anthology as it covers three different historical periods which added to the appeal of the stories and characters. This book was a delight and it was easy to immerse myself in the prose and characters as well as the leisurely pace. In my opinion this book is a credit to its genre and I highly recommend it as one that readers would definitely want to have on their bookshelves.

$review_text.: She was a widow, a businesswoman, an adulteress.In her lifetime, she knew murder, prejudice, and faith. She transformed from a Jewish girl longing for family to one of the closest friends of Jesus of Nazareth -- the Son of God.HER NAME WAS MARY MAGDALENE.In this fictionalized story of one of the Bible's most compelling women, New York Times best-selling author Joan Wolf beautifully recreates the history, romance, and tradition of Mary's world. Daughter of Jerusalem follows Mary's life from her first love through her loveless marriage, to the moment she heard of a miracle worker in her own town -- and ultimately to the moment she saw Him risen from the dead.As this inspiring chronicle reminds us, Mary was the first to witness history's greatest moment. She was a woman who sought forgiveness for her sins, and a follower of God who yearned for a deeper faith. She was Jesus' beloved disciple. Read Mary Magdalene's story and find yourself in this remarkable woman's journey to discover the Kingdom of God.________________________________________A spiritual masterpiece, and by far the wisest and most profound book ever written on Mary Magdalene. A remarkable invitation into the origins and wisdom of Christianity, through the apostolic witness of Mary Magdalene. Expect a challenge, perhaps more than you're ready for. This book should change something, as it invites you to deepen your capacity for love, through the witness of Jesus's beloved disciple. It takes courage, intelligence, maturity, but mostly Christian intuitive wisdom to write a book such as this. Joan Wolf succeeds grandly!Wolf masterfully takes the best of tradition, history, and recent scholarship, sums it up with clarity, and then respectfully and artfully flings open new doors of insight, wisdom, and possibility.  She offers completely unique and stirring insights about Mary Magdalene. At a time when much is being written about Mary Magdalene, Wolf's volume is totally readable, inspiring and well documented with reliable source material. This is a volume to be read and reread by student and seasoned reader alike.I was given this book by Christian Review of Books.

But the deeper that Foster investigates behind the town and Lovecraft's visit the more dark secret he starts to uncover...The book is well paced with plenty of suspense and is easy to get into even if you've never read a Lovecraft book (I havn't). If you are a Lovecraft fan then you will enjoy this although will find more sex and gore than Lovecraft's work although not enough to ruin a brilliant tale.4/5

$REVIEW.: I'm one of those people that read Year of the Black Rainbow before I read the Armory Wars. I'm glad I did, because this would be hard to follow otherwise. You can tell this is Claudio's first work- I believe that YotBR let you get more attached to the characters so you felt more of a loss in a certain chapter. While Armory Wars isn't bad - the shifts in artistry and VERY fast moving plot make it a popcorn read. I love the music and this is a fantastic hint at the stories behind all of Coheed & Cambria's music. Props to Claudio for producing his story, because it is a fantastic sci-fi adventure. I think if he was given the time to re-produce it, even as an animated mini-series, he could do wonders with it.In short, it's a great base, read Year of the Black Rainbow first. And it's totally worth owning the HC version, it fits nicely next to my YotBR box set.

There are many many films out there that could be deemed "artsy" - from the closing scenes of "2001 a Space Odyssey" to the long one-take shots from the film "Children of Men."  Bad acting, bad directing, bad set direction pale in comparison to bad sound.  If the sounds in the above mentioned films were terrible - people would have been running for the exits.Before I made my film, I took a free class from a local filmmaker and he couldn't stress sound enough.  I did not realize this until I was well into making my film and was shooting a scene in a local coffee shop.  What sounded great to me was actually filled with layers and layers of massive HUUUUMMMMMMMMMM from the various refrigerators, coffee makers, florescent bulbs, etc.  It took me hours of going through those shots and manually removing all the background hum.  But the first time I heard it?  I thought I was going to vomit, it was so painful.Take the film "Birdemic."  It is what it sounds like; a terrible low-budget, done on the cheap - on top of cheap, production.  It could have been a silly fun campy romp - but the sound was so absolutely terrible that it was akin to sticking hot fire-place pokers in your ears and twisting - while having a rabid cat claw your face.  At one moment I saw that the main characters were headed towards the beach and I said:  "Oh, God, no."  Not because the birds were going to attack - but because I knew they would not be able to control beach sounds at all and - it was terrible.  Watch it - if only you want to see how NOT to do sound in a film.Ric Viers's "The Location Sound Bible" is truly the only book you need to know, or have, on the subject of sound.  It is highly detailed and beyond thorough - touching on everything possible in terms of sound and sound equipment.  Static mics, lavalieres, shotgun mics, booms, records, mixers, pre-production set-ups, how to deal with the talent, how to get a job, the list goes on and on.Told in a basic, reference, style - the book could easily be used on and off the set to help the reader get the best possible sound.There were only a couple places where the book was lacking.  No comments about editing software and which was best for post-production sound work.  Having used "Sony Vegas Pro 11" to fix sound, how would that compare to "Final Cut Pro?"  What of cheaper and more general consumer based product?  Should one even try to do much fixing in post production?  Maybe a list of certain programs that may be helpful in terms of tweaking sound in post production.And for people out there with various sound budgets - would have liked to have seen a quick breakdown as to:  If you have $100 budget for sound, here's what you should buy.  $500, $1,000, etc.  For many filmmakers just starting - what are the down and dirty basics one should have when they hit the ground running?  Maybe even a basic shopping list or a "how to make your own boom" instruction sheet for those of us with miniscule budgets.Ultimately, don't discount sound.  After the screenplay/story it is THIS most important part of filmmaking.  The Location Sound Bible gives you all the information you need to succeed.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent, thorough book on sound

$REVIEW.: After discovering John Shirley through his short horror fiction, I bought a copy of Eclipse and sat motionless for days to read it.  In other words, I could not put it down.  While this would be shelved in a store's science fiction section, it really is more than typical spaceships and lasergun fare.  It falls more towards cyberpunk but exceeds it with a focus on characters instead of technology.The basic premise of the rise of a neo-fascist "security" corporation during the starts of a limited nuclear war between the USA and Russia sets the background for the very believable characters, each with distinct personalities and flaws that come to life from the printed page.  Mr. Shirley weaves a complex and intertwined tale of guerilla mercenaries, fading rock stars, and fasicst powermongers that would stand proudly with the great works on science fiction.  If not for any other reason, his interpretation of developing cultural trends is at the same time illuminating and frightening.Having only read the first book*, I am anticipating no less enjoyment from Penumbra and Corona, the second and third works in the series.I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a complicated read where each page yields a small reward.* Sometimes I do need to spend a little time reading my college textbooks, too.

$review_text.: MegaTokyo started as an online web-comic made by two American dudes, partly based on their lives


 It became a hit fast, and since then the creator has been working like crazy trying to keep the series going.Megatokyo is about two lazy American guys - a manga-reader and dating sim gamer named Piro & a l33ter and 1st-person gamer named Largo

 After going to E3 one day the two friends abruptly leave for Tokyo..
 Where they run out of money and get stuck there for months and bum off of Piro's Japanese penpal.The comic is very hillarious and serious at the same time, but I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone so all I can say is check it out at [...] sometime and see what you think of it


 Yes, you can read all of the comics so far online, but you miss out on early character sketches, creator commentary, and worst of all you don't "own" the comics unless you buy the manga


 Not to mention it takes a long time to sit and click through all of the pages online - if you have dial-up like me it is impossible to sit and try to read the whole thing.So, to sum things up - this manga collects all of the comics from the first year Megatokyo was online complete with creator commentary, original artwork, fill-ins that were added on days when a real comic couldn't be made, and lots of other comic goodness
 It is very organized as well and is a must for Megatokyo fans, so what are you waiting for, try it out!

$REVIEW.: In this book, the author describes current theories in science and applies them to human organizational management.  She develops a number of concepts that I think are applicable to organizational management, such as flexibility, greater communication within an organization, the importance of information, and valuing the intelligence of individual workers.However, the reasons for applying these principles developed from science to organizations are not well established in this book, in my opinion.  The applications may be valid, but a strong case for them is not made here.  For example, one claim made to justify one conclusion is that &quot;organizations are open systems and are responsive to the same self-organizing dynamics as all other life.&quot; (p. 97).  This is a bold claim, to link life sciences to management, that is not well substantiated in the book.The author seems to revel in the ancient (and ongoing) philosophical tension between the parts and the whole, calling us to look at the whole of a system, though rejecting objective reality (an ultimate whole), and with a bit of Gnostic thinking as well: &quot;Matter doesn't matter&quot; (p. 153),Also, this is not an informative work, rather its intention appears to be persuasive.  The author does reference many works in the scientific literature, but it is not intended to be a review or strict proof (I hope) of her position.  Some aspects of science that seem to me to contradict some of her conclusions are not discussed, such as the order imposed top-down in the theory of relativity (according to my limited understanding of it), and the fact that some changes must be wholly destructive and cannot have positive effects (e.g., certain genetic mutations).Again, some good points are made, but their basis is not well established here.  As an industrial engineer, I do not think we should throw away all the current practices, and hopefully that attitude is not simply self-serving.  I cannot recommend this particular book, but hope there is a more substantial treatment of these concepts elsewhere.

$REVIEW.: Jon Harrison has written a real winner in The Banks of Certain Rivers. I am truly impressed with his ability to build suspense and then pile it on until the reader is just as breathless as the characters. This is a novel filled with personal grief and struggle, but all the characters finally overcome the greatest tragedy of all, the death of a family member -- a mother and wife. I don't usually read "angst novels" but this one was recommended by Goodreads, and it was just that ... a "good read." Even with all this praise, there are a few issues that should not be difficult for the author to address in his next novel. They include: more thorough proof-reading [capitalize on 'beta readers' and a professional proofreader], believability was a struggle sometimes [authors need to maintain believability even in the most traumatic situations], make us love the characters [no matter how traumatized they may be]. My favorite character is the book is Chris, the coach/father's son. I truly cared about him. The coach/father becomes over-the-top hysterical, not analytical enough, and he didn't learn from past mistakes -- use birth control!Overall, this was a well written suspense-packed novel about real people. I look for move to come from this author.

$REVIEW.: 5 StarsThis was a refreshing change of pace for me; I haven't read many paranormal books about witches but I really enjoyed this one!The paranormal &#34;creatures&#34; involved in this story are witches, Sidhe fey, demons, changelings (new to me, but I adored Bubba!) and Unseelie fey
The characters were great, particularly the three main witches, Collen, Jenna and Roz


They are kick-ass demon-hunter warriors and with attitude and sarcasm in spades

The hero of the story is Duncan, he's a Lord of the Sidhe race, I wouldn't say he's overly Alpha but he's definitely a rather swoon-worthy gent, very dashing and chivalrous.The pace of the book is quite fast-moving with plenty of action to keep you engaged, the only thing that could have made this book even better for me would have been if there was more build up in the relationship between Colleen and Duncan.I really enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to fans of paranormal with a side of erotica.

$REVIEW.: Nina Weaver and her Pa have come to Coburn Station to trade for supplies.  They barely leave town with their lives.  Dead West - Book One: Those Poor, Poor Bastards opens with a bit of a ruckus that quickly erupts into full-blown chaos.I've read a lot of Zombie tales over the years, but none has ever begun as strangely as this one.  There are some genre bending twists right at the start which I really enjoyed and then we were quickly on more familiar ground, albeit dusty ground, this is the old west in the 1800's, after all.The language is as raw as the times and that's pretty rough.  I can't even post the quote I want to here, or Amazon would be editing me when I post the review there.  Let's just say it's rough enough to have ladies of the evening tossing liquid waste from second story windows.  In addition to the language there is plenty of offensive stereotyping complete with the slang that, thanks to modern political correctness, has all but been elimited from polite conversation.  However, in the post Civil War 1800's, it's still commonplace.For the most part  Dead West - Book One: Those Poor, Poor Bastards Is fast paced and entertaining as all get out.  The writers certainly managed to come up with a diverse group of characters who played well off one another creating both friction and friendships leading to plenty of internal conflict as well as having to fend off the deaduns.I did think things got a bit bogged down in the second half, but overall I found Dead West - Book One: Those Poor, Poor Bastards to be a very quick and enjoyable read that left me wanting more.  Fortunately, I shouldn't have long to wait, as Book Two is due next month and a third book in the series is already in the works.Dead West - Book One: Those Poor, Poor Bastards is available now for the Kindle at Amazon.com and is published by Ragnarok Publications.

I can't think what logic applies here unless this book had been an early effort brought out to just add to the author's listings. Or perhaps this was ghost  written? In any case, I can't say there was any reason other than a lack of typos and good grammar to be found in this book.

$REVIEW.: CharactersCal Toleffson - The vet, who is also the newest member of the small town of Konigsburg. He brings so much more than his skill with animals to the town- the grapevine is all abuzz with who will be the lucky girl to get with him.Docia Kent - Trying too hard or just hiding from herself, with Docia you never can tell - when she spots Cal however - that's a decision that was definately not hard to make.The PlotAfter living in Konigsburg, Texas for two years, you would think the town would have embraced a newcomer by now, not so in Konigsburg - everything was politics and Docia Kent was most definitely not politically correct.Literally hiding her bushel under a light due to a past break-up she gets on with her days as best as she can. When she spots not only the newest resident of Konigsburg but someone who makes her sit up and take notice, she treads a weary path as everything is not always as it seems in small town Konigsburg.Vet Cal Toleffson knows exactly what he sees when he sets eyes on Docia - a goddess and he intends to get to know her better. Deciding that only one night is all they can give to each other, their plans becomes farcical when the entire town decides to give their opinion on any plans they have for romance.However with all the comedy around town, there is also something dark slithering through and it seems to have earmarked Docia and all she loves dear. With the town not embracing her with open arms, can she rely on Cal or is he just bidding his time to disappoint her as well?Surprise ElementThere was a lot of little gems in this story. Not only was the setting a pleasure (small town settings does it for me), but the characters that goes with it made me sit up and had a laugh, more laughs and i fell in love - even with the weirdest of the bunch.The fact that the mystery runs parallel to the romance between Cal and Docia was also another treat - and it really was a mystery - Ms. Benjamin has that little extra something with her tension filled scenes that you really won't want to put this one down until you have reach the very end.PredictabilityWith small town you never know what to expect. The fact that both Docia and Cal were not from Konigsburg, made all the difference to the story. Everything else going on was more or less par for the course and Ms. Benjamin run with it and i really like her take on what these people get up to in this small town.Smut/Ick FactorA fair amount of fun was to be had by all. These two made up for the time they were apart every chance they get. No shy wall flower was Docia and Cal was just waiting on someone like her - believe me they got it on as much as they could...I feared for the sanity of this little town - the heat flowing off these two was just phenomenal.PositiveA new to me author, Meg Benjamin has certainly made me sit up and take a second look with this wonderful read. Docia and Cal are really the life of the party and they make the most of the situation they are in and I had fun with them.This book had a little of everything, the warring community, the dysfunctional family situation, the love interest - that was a laugh a minute. Then there is the psycho neighbour with the even more psychotic dog - as I said - a laugh a minute.The town dynamics is so accurate of what small town living is like - you never know what the grapevine is up to at any hour of the day.Ms. Benjamin does a brilliant job with the small details like descriptions of places and the situation at hand  and this made a whole lot of difference to the shape of this book.A big hit in this book for me was how Ms. Benjamin highlighted all of Docia's assets - she was a full figured goddess and she had everything in all the right places - Ms. Benjamin dressed her nicely, she gave her the allure to have men breaking out in sweat and she had that holier than thou air (when she wanted to) to annoy the hell out of family, friends and warring neighbours...I can't say enough about how funny the characters in this book were, there were not only ha ha giggles funny moment - but they were also so sarcastically rude - I cracked up with laughter.The town and it's personalities were very well developed, I knew where the town was coming from and I got to know the stories behind local feuds and other minor happening in the town.There was a good pace to this book, and some characters were larger than life and although no one really scary, there was definately an eclectic bunch of people floating around  Konigsburg.NegativeThe one little niggle that stood out for me was the fact that that there was no chatter between Docia and Cal. With a relationship that is in the getting to know you stage, Docia and Cal spend more time getting their smut on or caught up in towns business than actually any quality time on them as a couple..This,I only picked up on at the end of the book - everything else was so nicely done, I almost missed the fact that these two did not spend anytime talking to each other about themselves as a unit.CoversI did like this cover, I am not a big fan of cover with actual face view - as I like to form my own opinion of what the main protags are like, however this cover does a really good job of what I picture Docia to look like.

$REVIEW.: I thought this would be a good read from the first few chapters but then it fell short.  The ending felt rushed and I can't help but dislike Dan's [deal with it] attitude not to mention adjusting Uncle Jack's habit of the type of women he invites to FAMILY gatherings.  Nor did they address the "college" buddies and the party she left.  I didn't get the feeling Dan had changed his ways...the author never addressed why he didn't answer his phone when Lexi called either.  YES Sabrina has some serious trust issues but since Dan is the cause it just seemed like he would have been more attuned to what she needed him to do/say to help her feel more secure in their relationship.  Not one of the MARRIED men on the team gave me the impression they respected their wives because of the barbeque scene.The book left me disappointed in both Dan and Sabrina.

If you have not read The Savannah Series you need to get the box set now. The Savannah Series has been my favorite series by far. I instantly fell in love with Kayden from the moment he was introduced in the story. He is everything a girl could want. He will have you swooning with his sexy southern drawl and amazing green eyes. He is beyond sexy and doesn't stop showing Savannah just how much he loves her. The Series will make you laugh, cry, blush, and say OMG many times. The series will have you drawn in right away and have you connecting with each person from the story. I was beyond excited for this book!  The Series was amazing and now we get all our favorite parts in Kayden's point of view! I hope everyone enjoys Kayden and Savannah's journey together just as much as I did. Thank you Danielle for letting us get the chance to be apart of Kayden and Savannah's story!! I will forever be a Kayden's Angel!!!

$review_text.: The plot and dialogue of George Lucas' STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE plus the iambic pentamater and rhyming couplets of William Shakespeare ends up totally equalling awesomeness.There was nary a moment where I wasn't smiling or laughing out loud at what Ian Doescher does with the fantastical elements of probably the best known sci-fi space opera of all time and giving it a rich, wondrous life in the form of a Shakespearean play.While there are many quotable moments from the book, I'll refrain from quoting them here, because this is a book that has truly to be read with little "spoilers" (I know that we all knows what happens in the story, and nothing changes here, but the wonder of reading this work isn't something that should be given away).Possibly the most wonderful character adaptation here is what they do with R2-D2. They give him many boops and beeps and whistles, but when he has a soliloqy moment, it's just beautiful.This is an enormously entertaining work and is certainly worth your hard-earned dollars if you're a fan of Shakespeare and of the STAR WARS universe.I can only pray that this continues with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI.

$review_text.: Christopher de Belliague is a respected British journalist who lived for almost thirteen years as an expatriate foreign correspondent for The Economist and The New York Review Of Books and other papers in Iran and Turkey. He spoke the languages. He knew the customs He obviously loved the area. He appears to have been the ideal reporter- honest, articulate, knowledgeable skillful, observant and, above all, non-judgmental.In 2001 he had written an article for the New York Review of Books in which he mentioned the alleged killings of Armenians in Anatolia (Eastern Turkey) in 1915 and was immediately besieged by letters saying he had missed the fact that it was more than that - it was Genocide with a capital G and it was carried out by the Turkish Government. So, being the investigative reporter that he is, he decided to look for himself; and over the course of a couple of years and in four extended visits to the village of Varto in the Province of Mus in Turkey he interviewed, lived with, got to know the people who were either there in 1915 or whose families were there or who knew by experience or tradition what had happened. This is the story of what he saw and heard; and it is particularly relevant because as this is written there is pending in the United States Congress a controversial Resolution condemning the Turkish Government for Genocide in the 1915 events.Before you read this book, however - and I do recommend it to you if you are interested either in this history or this area - there are two things which need to be said.First, get a map and see the area where the alleged Genocide took place. Varto is closer as the bird flies to Teheran and Baghdad than it is to Istanbul; it's 500 miles from Ankara, 125 miles from Yerevan the capital of he modern state of Armenia and in a somewhat lonely corner of the world that most of us in the West know nothing about - where a lot of killing could happen in 1915 and never be known to the historical record.  Yes, the event could have been covered up.Second, I will ask you to be the judge as you read this book. Was there a policy of killing the Armenians? Or was it just the fact that generational hatreds between Kurd and Turk and Armenian who had lived in the same inflammable territory for hundreds of years were suddenly put to the torch with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1914-15 and, out of control, the Turks wanted the Armenians out of the country they had called their home for generations. To this day the Turks deny having anything to do with what happened - and they contend that not much happened. (Parenthetically: Those of the generation of this writer - b. 4.27.17 - know that something happened. Every one of us was told as a child to "finish your cereal. Just think of the starving Armenians".) The Armenians contend that the pogrom killed 1,500,000 of their brothers and sisters and they want - what? And here is a question I found myself asking as I read the book. Just what do the Armenians want; and what good would it do today if they got it? Wouldn't it only serve to continue to irritate the festering wounds of the past?The book has so much evidence of generational hatred, blood feud, historical anger, hate and violence over hundreds of years by so many people and so many tribes against so many other people and so many other tribes that, were I a Judge here hearing the evidence to determine whether or not there was the Genocide as claimed I would have interrupted counsel about half way through the case and after hearing witness after witness repeat his or her particularly slanted story of events and would have said "Counsel, I've heard enough. .I'm sure that further testimony along this line would only be repetitious.  I'll take the case under submission and let you know my decision after I've thought about it for a while". Right or wrong that's what I did as the reader. I couldn't finish the book. It was just too much - the same story after story of hate and violence and blood. And the verdict? Apart from finding that thousands upon thousands of Armenians were killed fleeing out of the country in 1915 I don't think anyone can ever say with that certitude of decision which is so necessary in a matter like this that there was a Turkish policy of extermination. Nor does the author. But you should read the book and make your own judgment. It's a good book if for no other reason than, read as a travel book, it takes the 21st century reader back in time to a way of life that exists today the same as it did 200 years ago.

The way these two find common ground and compromise on their terms is endearing and HOT!  This book is the perfect combination of romance novella and erotica novella.  There is enough balance between the two make this the most easy read I have had in a while.  I haven't read Make Me Stay, but now I know I must read it.

$review_text.: I admit I went to sleep listening to the entire thing (they say that is normal).  But now that I know which tracks get to the beef, they are very good.  They help to make you mindful (the book comes with a CD).  The book is a bit boring but what is unique is it's not food plan and it's not quackery "you are getting sleepy" hypnosis.  I put it on my IPOD and listen before bed.  The net/net is that it makes you mindful during the day.  It helped me give myself a Girl Scout cookie Samoa intervention (I normally eat pretty good but those Samoas are down right evil I tell you!).  It worked.  I heard about it from Dr. Mark Hyman's emails that I get (he is awesome as well) and Dr. Weil also did a plug on these guys.  You do have to get past the corny parts "you can do it, yes you can" but it's worth it.  I also like Belleruth Naparstek.  Her voice is soothing and she has an entire series.  So, if you are struggling or need adjusting, add this to your aresenal and just use it as time to relax.  It may surprise you that it has some impact on your thinking (but I do recommend staying awake for tracks 6 & 7 where the real beef is).

$REVIEW.: In this fascinating "what -if" story, set in Philadelphia in 1959, Margie Franklin is working as a secretary at a Jewish-owned law firm


She lives a quiet life, and always wears a sweater, even on the hottest days

But Margie also has a "hidden " life, a legacy of invisible wounds
Then "The Diary of Anne Frank" is published and the movie follows, and these will shake Margie's "hidden" life to its core, as it portrays a life she one lived, a family and country she has left behind, and a past and religion which she denies.History tells us that Margo Frank died of thyphus, along with her mother and sister, Anne, in Bergen-Belsen, a Nazi prison camp, in 1944


But what if Margo didn't die? What if she somehow escaped, and, following the plans she made with Peter van Pels in the Annex before their capture, came to America, changed her name and her religion, and lived out her life anonymously? Would she be able to accept herself and her story after living through unspeakable horror? Would she be able to overcome her "survivor's guilt" and thrive? Would she be able to find and accept love and get the happy ending that she deserves?The author explores all these questions with intimacy and sensitivity

The book is also a prayer for all the voiceless millions who endured what she did, but are unknown to the world but who deserve our recognition and compassion.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like this book but I just didn't.  The story revolves around a teenage girl with a lot of family drama.  For some reason she's able to see her autistic sister's guardian angel and they "fall in love."  Who would've guessed?  And even though they "fall in love" you'd never really know it.  We don't ever read about how that happens.  We're just told that it has.  A huge majority of this story is so repetitive that several times I put the book down and was ready to give it up.  But I'm a glutton for punishment and continued on.  It feels like the movie "Groundhog Day."  Every day that you read about feels like you're reliving the same day over and over.  The book definitely deals with real life issues.  But the way it's written is so negative and it's depressing.  And the end.... don't get me started on the end.  Just not my cup of tea I guess.

$REVIEW.: I greatly enjoyed this collection of short stories. For the most part they are all excellent. There were a few that did not really capture me (thus only 4 stars), but the ones that did made the collection worth while.After finishing many of the stories I wished there was more, but satisfied with where they left off. When a short story ends like that, I consider it a win.A 'continuity' of sorts seemed to exist between some of the stories. It was nothing explicit, just some elements shared between them. However, it created a nice synergy. I don't know if any of them tie into any of the authors other books as I have not read them (though I have decided to purchase some of them after reading Velocity).I would definitely recommend this for a read.

$review_text.: I've wrapped up The Father's Child by Mark Adair, and even a few days later, I'm not sure what precisely I'm feeling about it.  There were parts that were very, very good.  There were parts where the writing got choppy and problematic.  It hit one of my personal pet peeves, and not in a good way.  It hit one of my best loves, in a very good way.So, let's start at the very beginning.  What is it about?A lot of things.  On one level it's a secret society thriller.  Go a little deeper and it's a treatises on power and the use thereof.  It's a study of love: romantic and platonic.  It's a story of friendship.I don't usually try to describe the plot of a book in a review.  Usually, I try to avoid spoilers, but I'll have a hard time getting into what I really liked, and didn't, without going into the plot.  So if you wish to avoid spoilers, now's the time to skip to the next review.In a nutshell John Eris Truman is a technological wunderkind.  He's got brains oozing out his ears.  He's also shy and not very good with people.  His best friend, Paul Eastman, is the yang to his yin.  He's outgoing, good with people, and not stupid, but not John's style of hyper-analytical either.  The story opens with their third buddy, George, being kidnapped by a group of exceptionally competent professionals at their bi-annual mid-term bash.  Fast forward two years, and the FBI still has no clue what happened to George.  Paul and John wrap up college and head west, starting anew amid the sunshine and beaches of California.Then things start to get a bit weird.  John starts to remember details about what happened right before George was kidnapped.  Those details get them noticed by a mysterious organization.  John gets 'kidnapped' and then 'rescued' and spends a few months in the care of his new friend, Sam, his 'rescuer.'  They spend hours talking about the fate of the world.  We learn how John has always felt a deep need to make the world a better place, a deep responsibility to better humanity.  And throughout this he's having some sort of religious/psychic visions (daymares he calls them).Meanwhile, Paul is looking for his friend.  He's aided in this endeavor by Julia; an ex-CIA member, hired by Susan's (more on her in a bit) father as head of his security, in charge with fighting the mysterious organization, called The New Dawn; and Susan, long time girlfriend/love of John.  Julia explains to them the New Dawn is a super-secret cabal with tentacles in every echelon of power.  They have a vision of the good that they will do whatever is necessary to achieve.  Susan's dad has been fighting them, and in retaliation, they kidnap kids dear to him, like George, and now that he's found out about it, John, and as soon as they can get their hands on him, Paul.Eventually, of course, Paul finds John, and it turns out the New Dawn is behind all of it.  Julia's a member.  It's hinted Susan's Dad is, too.) And once a mystical/technological ceremony; involving not just implanting a computer chip into John's brain, but a necromancer, three-hundred-year-old-blood, and a computer system that can rule the world; takes place, John will find himself a shadow king of Earth with Paul, Julia, and Susan as his highest counsel.Over the course of this, we learn that The New Dawn is not all puppies and sunshine.  Once John takes over he really will have the power to make the world a better place.  But some absolutely horrific things had to happen to get him that power.  If you can, imagine a hybrid of the Bene Gesserit, The Illuminati (Wilson and Shea's version), and a smattering of Cthulu, you'll have something that sort of gives you an idea of The New Dawn.So, with that set up, we run into my pet peeve: sloppy moral thinking.  Adair tells us that John really will have the power to make the world a better place.  We aren't talking Hope and Change here, where the words sound good, but very little actually happens.  We're talking about eradicating poverty and disease.  We're talking end of war.  Adair also tells us that John and The New Dawn will become one organism.  So, even if horrible things had to happen to get John the power to make the world a better place, they do not have to continue happening because John, by will alone, can wield this power, and there's no reason he has to continue in those plans.Basically, this is the Spiderman moment: with great power comes...  Nothing.  With an immensely powerful organization capable of changing the world, John, Paul and Susan decide to destroy it.  Sure, they could have saved the lives of billions of people, destroyed hunger, ended disease, stopped war, but The New Dawn was involved in some horrific things to get them that power, so they used John's access to kill it.Basically Peter Parker, upon noticing the research facility that created the spider was also doing absolutely evil genetic research, decided to set fire to it, stay a college student, majoring in journalism, and eventually became an investigative reporter.  The web slinger never sees the light of day.And this is where I, as a reader, start banging my head against the wall.  I get the point of where Adair was going.  I understand his play on turning away from the corrupting influence of almost infinite power.  The problem is, he didn't set up the New Dawn or John in such a way that the reader comes away impressed and relieved that John stepped back from the power.  Yes, the New Dawn is immensely creepy.  But John is an immensely good character. A character who, with almost limitless power and in an absolute frothing rage, gives the man who made him that angry a black eye, and then stalks off in a huff.  John is basically a Paladin. And he has complete and utter control over The New Dawn.  So instead of Darth Vader being seduced by the power of the dark side and turning away from it, all I was left with was a sense of the immense loss of opportunity.  Basically, John needed to be a whole lot darker for this plot to work convincingly.Since we're already on the negative side, let me talk a little about the writing as well.  For the most part the story is well written.  Then we get to the climax of the book.As an author there are two parts of the book you want to absolutely nail.  The beginning because that's where you attract your reader, and the climax because, well, it's the climax.  Adair did a fine job with the first 90ish percent of the story, then we get to the climax and the writing begins to feel rushed.  He starts bounding over details that would have been nice to see, though he does have John remember some of them later in a flashback. Which is remarkably unsatisfying.  He begins switching point of view rapidly, which isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me.  It's a good technique for building tension and giving us both story lines, but both of his POV characters are in first person.  Now, most of the time this isn't an issue.  Adair has done a good job of giving both characters very distinct voices, so figuring out who is who takes maybe a sentence or two tops.  But when you're flipping back and forth every few paragraphs, and it takes a line or two to figure out whose head you're in, it's more distracting than entrancing.Then, right as the climax is drawing near, he tosses in a twist that I was expecting, but hoping he'd restrain himself from doing.  He didn't set it up properly to have the sort of punch it needed, so it fizzled.  Like with the decision to destroy New Dawn, I could see what he was trying to do, but it needed a few extra pages of background and tension building to really pull off.Okay, enough of the stuff I didn't like, let's talk about the good stuff.Character voice: Adair absolutely nailed it.  John and Paul have distinct voices, both of which flow naturally, use words convincingly, and make me like the characters.  I'd be happy to have both Paul and John as friends.  They are fully rounded, vibrant characters.Humor: once again Adair does a great job with this element of the story.  The Father's Child could have been soul-suckingly grim, but it wasn't because of how well Paul is written.  He's funny, occasionally goofy, but not so much that you want to slap him.  He's a bit of a light-weight as a thinker, but it's an element this story badly needed.  If you've ever seen NCIS, he'll put you in mind of DiNozzo.The relationship between John and Paul.  This is something I love to see in a book: a well-written, convincing, deep male friendship.  Usually in thrillers men relate to each other in terms of killing one another or partnering up for the duration of the mission.  Sometimes there's a sidekick as well, whose main purpose is to provide comic relief.  Now, while it is true that Paul is there for comic relief, he's way past the 'sidekick' role.  He's a fully defined protagonist in his own right.  And between them is a relationship worth exploring.  A friendship that feels real, intimate, yet fully masculine as well.Lastly, Adair is handy with his visual imagery.  While in Paul's head he's funny and witty, in John's he's intensely visual, seeing and describing things in detailed shades of beautiful language.All of which is why, five days after finishing the book, I'm still not sure if I liked it or disliked it.  I know I'm frustrated.  I know Adair can write.  I saw him do it.  I read it.  But then the climax hits and the prose goes all wonky, and the penultimate scene of the book doesn't happen until a flashback at the end.  Which made me a very unhappy reader.  But it's got a great friendship, and some wonderful characters, and I really liked the use of visual imagery.  Which made me a very happy reader.On Amazon, three stars equals it's okay.  And I think that's where I'm going to leave The Father's Child.  I have high hopes that Mark Adair's further adventures with the written word will be excellent.

$REVIEW.: Rodney Stark - once again - takes on the liberal anti religious verities of the chattering class, and - once again - smashes them to bits and bits.  And he does it by using that one thing such people must  fear more than anything:  facts.For example, how often have the secularists sneered at the religious as fanatics or mentally ill?  Freud the adulterer dismissed religion as a "neurosis" (p 93).  Harvard's Allport called real religious belief "primitive credulity" (p 93).Yet there are decades of research proving the exact opposite. The faithful, weekly attenders of church have dramatically lower levels of depression, suicide, not to mention they were also much, much healthier in general than those who never attended church.  "The evidence shows overwhelmingly that religion protects against mental illness" (p 5).Yet another instance of Freud proven wrong.In fact, "The more often that Americans attend church, the more likely they are to be happy" (p 96) about their lives. And oh yes, they also, according to research, have happier sex lives.The religious also have been shown to  be better for society as a whole.  Surprise, research shows that those who deeply believe that theft and murder are wrong tend not to commit theft or murder.  On the other hand, in one study, only 13% of the nonreligious were found to be honest.Perhaps someone should pass this study on to the IRS agents who go over the taxes of those employed at the New York Times.In hundreds of way, religious citizens prove to be a benefit to society.  The religious volunteer to help other much more frequently than do the nonreligious.  Charities across America would have to fold if religious belief evaporated the way it has in Europe.The families of religious people are provably stronger than those of the nonreligious.  They divorce less, for one thing.  "Religious husbands are substantially less likely to abuse their wives or children" (p 4).  Not only that, religious students perform better in school.  And they are also provably more chaste.One very interesting phenomenon is that those who follow no religion come to believe in the most idiotic, nonscientific rubbish imaginable.  Those who espoused no religion were much, much more likely than other people to believe astrology, psychics, ESP, Tarot readings, and fully "two-thirds of the irreligious agreed that UFOs are probably real spaceships from the other world" (p 155).  Bring on the tinfoil hats.I loved how Stark, at the end of the book,  adds up how much the US would have the spend to make up for the religious, should they all be replaced by secularists.  For example, in crime alone, he estimates the financial burden would grow by 2.1 trillion dollars.Much recommended.

$review_text.: Spilled Milk: Breastfeeding Adventures and Advice from Less-Than-Perfect Moms by Andy Steiner (former senior editor at Utne) is a good reminder that breastfeeding is not perfect for every woman.I&#8217;m just as guilty as any lactivist about judging women who whip out a bottle. Maybe they aren&#8217;t comfortable breastfeeding in public. Maybe they were sexually abused as a child and can&#8217;t stand to have anyone or anything touching their breasts. Maybe their breasts are prosthetic after a double mastectomy. Maybe they need anti-psychotic medication and would rather bottle-feed than either give their kids bad drugs via the boob or throw their kid against the wall.Basically, you don&#8217;t know why someone is bottle-feeding, so get off their case.Read the rest of my titillating review here: [...]

$REVIEW.: Having recently visited Ireland, I can honestly say that this book is spot on.This is no mere "spots you should see" book. This Lonely Planet guide is filled with maps, pictures, and other information you'd expect, but it also contains addresses, phone numbers, festival dates, and more.  One of the best features is tips from locals on what you should see when you visit their town or county.The guide even includes tips on how to behave in an Irish Pub. While it does cover the "rounds" system, they've forgotten one very important tip I learned from local bartenders: don't order an Irish Coffee. The locals never do and it's a pain for the bartenders to make.  Keep your bartender happy: order a Bailey's and Coffee instead!  (Order your Irish Coffee when you visit San Francisco.)The photos are beautiful and give you a tantalizing glimpse of what awaits you on the Emerald Isle.The maps are incredibly helpful, as is the middle section of the book.  The middle section is a rundown of the different counties in Ireland.  It's particularly helpful because it's laid out how the locals think. (When in Cork City, don't talk about Dublin. It's true and it's in the book!)As a recent visitor, this book serves me as a wonderful reminder of pleasant vacation.  But if you're planning on visiting, this book should be read beforehand and taken with you!  Sl&aacute;inte!

$REVIEW.: ***original review by Jamie posted at Romancing Rakes For The Love of Romance***Sabrina Cassidy is in trouble so she calls the one guy who always drops everything for her, even if the last time she saw Luke Hamilton she turned down his proposal and ran right out of town. Unfortunately Luke doesn't answer but Marc Sterling does. Set on protecting Luke from Sabrina he goes to rescue her then send her off in the other direction.Sabrina is surprised when Marc shows up. She is also surprised by the attraction to him. She isn't surprised that he doesn't want to take her home. She knows he's protecting Luke but Sabrina is determined to head back since she's pregnant because she knows that Luke will take care of her. Expect she can't stop from kissing Marc.I was very close to putting Sabrina in the TSTL (too stupid too live) category. She was annoying and I just wanted to hit her and tell her that it's not all about you. But she grows on you. Is she annoying and a selfish brat? Yes. She used Luke for most of her life just because she could. It isn't until Marc comes along that he makes her see it and helps her grow up.There is no denying the chemistry between Sabrina and Marc. These two together are hot, even when they're bantering back and forth with sexual innuendos. Despite how much they say they don't like each other Marc is the only one that wanted her to be happy. He wanted her dreams to come true and did his best, even if it was behind her back, to try and make it happen.This was my first Erin Nicholas book and it will certainly not be my last. I can't wait to read the next in the series.***review copy provided by Goddess Fish Promotions in conjunction with Erin's review tour***

$review_text.: As the most chaotic of the earth's primal elements, fire is notoriously fickle and unstable. When wielded properly by the Knight of Flame, it burns like the sun. Otherwise, it slowly consumes the Knight, burning away his control, driving him to dark deeds.Stationed in Tampa, Florida, the sixth Knight of Flame, Develor Quinteele, waits impatiently for the prophesied emergence of the last Gray Lord, his Order's ancient nemesis. Hampered by the memories of a centuries-old tragedy, Dev knows of only one way to control his elemental power - rage. It simmers just beneath his surface - barely contained - igniting at the slightest provocation.After a brutal attack by the Gray Lord's minions for which Dev is blamed, he is stripped of his freedom until he learns to control his violent impulses. With the help of his fellow Knights, can Dev balance his rage and unlock his true elemental potential in time to prevent Tampa's devastation?I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was completely drawn into the story from the first page, and appreciated that while it possessed many romantic elements, the story wasn't overwhelmed by them. I give 'Knight of Flame' an A+! and look forward to reading the next book in the series.Full Disclosure: 'Knight of Flame' by Scott Eder read and reviewed by Mareena McGirr, an avid reader and book reviewer from Albany, New York.

$REVIEW.: Ransom Riggs is a very creative man. He has taken dozens of wacky old photos and built a story around them.Jacob's grandfather was a Jew who escaped Nazi Germany as a child. He was sent to Wales to live out the war. When Jacob was a child, Abe (his grandfather) told metaphorical stories about the monsters who killed his family and the fantastic children's home to which he escaped.He also had all these strange old photos that he made up stories about - like the cover photo: a girl who could float.But were they just stories?This is a tale in a tale - Jacob trying to find his grandfather's truth while also trying to find his own. I was extremely taken with the entire story, which I think is good for middle school level.I subtract a star because the story does not end cleanly, and there is a quite-too-obvious pitch for this to be 1 in a series. I don't like that. Write a story and finish it. Please.Anyway. I enjoyed this quick read.(*)>

$review_text.: Find this review and more at Lusty Penguin Reviews!Love, betrayal, and forgiveness combine into the captivating new adult romance Running from Forever, the fifth installment of The Forever series by Ashley Wilcox. Wilcox uses first person voice to uniquely tell this story through three different characters' voices, breaking up the story into three parts: Kayla's, Merrick's, and Miles's, respectively.Kayla opens the story as she realizes her relationship with Trevor isn't what she wants, so she accepts a job at a TV station in New York City and just leaves. For Kayla, New York represents becoming the woman she wants to be, which I really liked about her character. On her first day on the job, Kayla meets Miles Blackwell, the handsome part owner of the station. Surprised by Miles's compliments, Kayla is stunned to discover that she has an attraction to Miles. Meanwhile, Miles acknowledges that Kayla stirs up feelings he has never had for a young lady. Their chemistry sizzles from their first meeting forward, and their bedroom play is sensual and hot. Kayla is falling in love with Miles, which makes his betrayal that much more heartbreaking. Feeling lost and itching to run away, Kayla turns to the only person she can, Merrick, a local bartender.After the betrayal, the point of view shifts to Merrick. Upon seeing Kayla, Merrick instantly knows that Miles hurt her, but to his credit, he just takes care of her, which I just loved about his character. Merrick and Kayla hit it off because they have similar personalities, and I really enjoyed the time they spend learning more about each other. Wilcox does a beautiful job with this relationship, and without wanting to give too much away, I was pleased with where their relationship ends.At the beginning of the third part, we learn Miles is desperately in love with Kayla and devastated by his own actions. Now, for the first he first time in his life, he is determined work hard and mend their relationship with a one-of-a-kind plan, which I really liked. The inspired way Miles gets Kayla back will bring a smile to your face and drives this story to the perfect romantic conclusion.I wasn't sure if I would like the point of view changes the way it was done, but I quickly discovered that this technique really fit the story well. Furthermore, I did have some concerns entering an established series, even though these books supposedly can be read as stand-alone stories. Happily, I realized Running from Forever can definitely be read on its own. Engaging characters and an entertaining plot complete with interesting plot twists make Running from Forever a compelling page-turning read.I received an eBook copy of the book for the purpose of an honest review. I was not compensated for this review, and all conclusions are my own responsibility.

 The love Joseph and Sophie shared could be felt through the pages and it was a sweet story, especially when Sophie gets to meet her grandfather
 My only complaint is that I feel it ended rather abruptly, as thought there were still loose ends to tie up


I thought that would be taken care of in the epilogue, but instead was just a lead in to the next story


I really liked Lucas' character though and am hoping by a line in the epilogue we'll see more of him.

$review_text.: F. D. Davis has done an amazing job crafting the story of Adam Omega, an arrogant overly powerful vampire, and his obsession, Eve. From the moment I started reading the novel until I read the last sentence, I was glued to the page. The prose was captivating and Davis's gift for story telling shines through. What would you do if your dreams and soon even your waking moments were taken over by a man that exudes danger and an unresistable sexual draw? What would you do if you found yourself suddenly heart and soul deep in a centuries old love affair and every molecule in you called out to a man you loved and left lifetimes ago?At it's core this novel takes the age old battle between good and evil and blurs the lines so astutely you won't be able to pick a clear side. There is no black and white accuracy here, only bold, breathtaking, blood chilling shades of gray. As I read this novel I couldn't help but think of the wonderful author, Octavia Butler who left us too soon. Davis has created the same kinds of larger than life characters that Butler created in her Patternist Series with Doro and Anyanwu. We are just meeting Adam and Eve. And Davis has just given us a taste of what promises to be an exciting new paranormal series. But oh what a ride it promises to be. After reading F. D. Davis's IN THE BEGINNING: A VAMPIRE SERIES, I am convinced we have a wonderful and bold new voice in paranormal fiction to look forward to. And I can't wait to see what else that voice has to say. I strongly recommend this novel. Kudos F. D. Davis. Job well done!

Connor's this unattainable lady's man that any girl would be lucky to have, if he'd look at her as more than just another fling.  Mutual interests lead to mutual attraction.The pace of the book is good, without that drawn out feeling or that rushed at the end feeling. There's a good amount of conflict and turnmoil, a decent amount of passion, and enough excitement to keep the reader engaged without overwhelming.

$review_text.: St. Damien of Molokai is a national presence in Hawaii. When I visited there I saw his statue in front of a government building. We made a trip to Molokai and got a view of the leprosarium from the heights of a nearby cliff. The lepers still there are very few and do not wish to leave. Soon it will close. On a tour around the island there was yet another black statue of this wonderful man. It was outside a tiny chapel outside the colony where Damien used to say Mass.The book THE SPIRIT OF FATHER DAMIEN; THE LEPER PRIEST - A SAINT FOR OUR TIMES, is a moving and modern account of the development of Damien himself and his life and death on Molokai. Hagiography today is realistic, and more true to the whole person and their struggles and development.If you wish to learn about this priest-saint this book will serve you well. For those devoted to Damien this is yet another inspiring vehicle to find even more to ponder.

$review_text.: I know others have found this book a good read.  I have to disagree.  My bookgroup chose it and if it were not for that, I would not have finished it.  And in fact, I couldn't wait until I was through with it. Maybe if you have lived in Sarajevo or know the city, you would find this book interesting.  The unnecessarily long descriptions of streets, bridges, corners, buildings, etc. are tedious. We are inundated with descriptions of the devastation of the city. . over and over.  We GET IT! War is terrible. Half way through I was wondering where this story was going, and truthfully, it never did gel for me.  I didn't particularly care about the characters, and the long passages describing their problems, the endless rhetorical questions and ponderings only made this narrative drag.  I love the title and the concept of the cellist. But that is such a small part of the book, and truthfully, his influence on Arrow didn't really resonate with me.  I understand the author is a creative writing teacher, but I found the writing to be dull and repetitive. And this is in addition to being stylistically poor.  I guess I get bugged with sentences ending in prepositions and inexplicable shifts from third person to second.  Where was his editor?There are so many really good books out there. . spend your time and money on something else.
$SUMMARY.: save your time and money

$REVIEW.: I had mixed feelings about this book. I liked the characters, and the romance was a mixture of hot and sweet. Even though the author made me care for the main characters right away and made it believable they could care for each other, the relationship between the leads was a little too 'insta-love-ish' for me (well-developed romance is one of the reasons I read historicals in the first place). It would have been okay if the hero's recuperation had been longer, but a few days wasn't enough. I would have preferred a more practical motive for their choices and watched their feelings grow over time.A few plausibility issues pulled me out of the story, and some of the scenes were unusually violent and gritty. Most of the violence was well done, though, just not for the faint of heart.*spoiler alert*The plausibility issues I mentioned revolved around the author not giving the hero enough time to heal before having him do certain things. There's pushing the envelope to make him seem tough, and then there's impossible. Unless I'm mistaken, the time span of the entire book is not more than about two weeks. His bone (compound fracture) could not have set in that time.Another thing that had me shaking my head was the scene with the rabid pigs. One cannot get rabies from eating cooked meat, even if the animal is infected. One might be able to contract it from dressing the game, but even that is unlikely, as the virus would die quickly. But, either way, even if one DID contract it, symptoms would take days or longer to develop.*end of spoiler*Even with my favorite authors, I like some of their books more than others. This is the first book by Cheryl Pierson I have read. Because the writing in Fire Eyes is otherwise very good, I'm going to give this author another chance.

$REVIEW.: Lady Dearborn's Debut is an enticing romantic comedy of manners and is a fast-paced and enjoyable read. It was easy to see how the romantic relationships would turn out, but getting to that point was the fun part. This story is suitable for all ages and compared very much to the style and voice of Georgette Heyer's Georgian and Regency novels. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: A very good read. Just enough Hollywood references to keep the location interesting without it taking over the story. Fast paced and lots of characters just waiting for the next book. I especially liked the ex police chief but would have liked to see more of him, maybe next time. I only gave this book four stars as not being American some of the references were lost on me. A shame but a constructive criticism for the next book, that readers from all over the world now have access to ebooks at the press of a button so please help us to understand some of the local jargon and letter abbreviations.

$review_text.: Karen Cantwell has a funny sense of humor, but not something that makes me laugh out loud. This book she wrote titled &#34;Keep Me Ghosted&#34; had some good moments, but I prefer stories that don't have mention of sexual attraction. Her character, Sophie, seemed to be involved in sensuality every time she looked at a person of the opposite sex. She kind of gave wolf whistles as she sized up men. That, to me, is immature, and a turn off.Her story is about having a ghost as a constant companion. She had an elderly English gentleman, but she was a medium who could see ghosts. As she was searching for a job, she found a good prospect and not only did she immediately get unexpectedly hired, but she saw the perspective employer had a ghost attached around his neck too. He told her it attached itself to him when he moved into his new office. This ghost was haunting him. It was scaring all the clients that came into his office, and his clients were children. That will never be funny in my eyes.Of course there is an immediate sexual attraction between her and her new boss that they try to control. She brings up this subject several times in reminding herself that they end up doing things that are inappropriate in an employer-employee situation, yet she doesn't follow through with her resolve to stay out of temptation. That stuff was not funny either.I gave this author one star, because this story left a lot to be desired in character development in the field of morality.  Spiritually, it was impure.

$review_text.: As a mother who screens everything her 11-year-old daughter reads, and an ancient history lover, I had been curious about Caroline Lawrence's 'Roman Mysteries' series for a while now. I'd tried to read a couple of pages before, and was always distracted by some other book. Now I've finally managed to finish the first two books in the series, and I found them suitable to be passed on to said daughter, also a history buff, and fairly mature for her age. I have to agree with her take on 'The Thieves of Ostia.'First, the author is clearly meticulous in her research, and she has no qualms introducing - subjecting - her characters to uncomfortable, and ostensibly horrifying circumstances: beheading of dogs, death by rabies, slavery, religious persecution, child marriage, abduction and mutilation ... These are themes, that, under the most experienced hands, would need careful management to be served to the most open-minded of children and families. Ancient Rome - ancient society - and many modern ones - was a cruel place. But when such themes are introduced with an unabashedly Christian bias, and all in one book, one SHORT book, a lot of the necessary emotions and justifications - explanations - are left out, and this short changes those very ideas that I'm sure the author meant to be discussed. The 21st-century prejudices and sensibilities are too obvious, and the way the various "adventures" the children have occur non too subtly. It's hard to read a Cam Jensen-type story crossed with the Bible without feeling stifled and muzzled. This is not to say it cannot be done: I'm saying that 'The Thieves of Ostia' requires more careful reading than is first apparent. It's not really a book that one should give to their kids to read and expect them to come away feeling all is good, yay, the good guys win. Those parents that feel kids nowadays are growing up too fast can rest assured that kids back then grew up even faster. Said daughter, feeling the same, expresses her thoughts on the first book in the series below:"The book 'The Thieves of Ostia', is a good start to the Roman Mysteries series by Caroline Lawrence. When someone starts to kill the dogs on Flavia's street, she is determined to solve the mystery. As Flavia is unraveling the mystery, she buys a slave girl who becomes her friend, befriends a Christian Jew boy and a mute beggar boy, and discovers why someone would behead three dogs and sew their heads to one body."I thought the book was prejudiced and sick, especially when the dog murderer beheaded the dogs and sewed their heads to one body. My only favorite part was when Nubis found two puppies and kept them. Nubis was also my favorite character because I love dogs just like her and she is very nice and loyal. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes Rome and mysteries but I would give the book 3.5 stars."

$review_text.: The opening idea that a mammal brain might tune itself in reaction to its situation is fascinating

 Our brains were not tuned via natural selection for the sake of teenagers in American suburbs
 If one defines a human generation as 16 years (the time from the birth of a girl until she has her first baby), then over 200,000 years that line of homo sapiens would have gone through 12,500 generations, which is a lot of tuning

 And from the perspective of biology, that human males have aggressive and risk-taking tendencies would be evaluated by the end result of those tendencies (is that tribe still alive)

 So I found the author&#8217;s musings very interesting

 But parents who decide their job is to first, keep in mental tune with the little darlings, and then perhaps to occasionally offer a non-confrontational humble recommendation, look at his result


 His son came back from college with no self-limiting notion of respecting his parents (instead his son spread non-cleanliness in his wake at his pleasure; not in just his room, but throughout the house)
 His mental theory is interesting

 Self-absorbed offspring are not a plus to society.

The sex scenes were long drawn out to the point I would read a few pages and then oh look, more sex...........skim skim skim, back to the story, read a few more pages, oh look more of the same sex....really? After a while, what should have been steamy scenes grew tepid at best and didn't help the story.The saving grace was the plot twist at the end. Over all the book left me feeling it was a waste of reading time for the most part.

Where do I start from, Ambrose.....a very dignified hero, I looked passed his flaws to his beautiful heart, Bailey....the bravest, funniest, encouraging character I've ever seen in a book, fern....the strongest, kindest, most humbling female character I've ever met. Even the supporting characters, every one has a story to tell, an intricately beautiful story woven together about humanity, love and how you can see beauty in a different way. Making faces is a very beautiful read, Amy Harmon really gave me a different point of view.I cried so hard, it was worth it, the book was worth every single tears I shed.

Half the fun with this book is trying to play detective yourself & see if you can figure out who the guilty party is!**One of my favorite things about reading is being able to escape into the world between the pages


Connecting with the characters & visualizing the places they travel


Being a Kentucky girl, I can really connect with both the characters & town in this book

I love his humor & style, which makes all of his books perfect for those weekend reads that I desperately need after a hectic work week

$review_text.: ASDFGHJKL@#$%^&! You don't do this to me! Ending it that way.I. Insta-attraction. It's all about the physical. You know what I mean. The staring at the pecs, the abs, the curves, the lips... looks of intensity. It's everywhere in YA.II.A. World is reminiscent of the Nevernever/Faerie but not quite like it. Instead we have elementals who controls and maintains the balance of the elements. They have courts with royal families, too, each controlling an element. Then, the requisite ultimate being in the akasha who's the cousin of the Avatar which happens to be our heroine.B. But I like that world which is called Avalon (maybe King Arthur was the first Akasha? Hohoho). Not too much description though which is the weakness of this book. Minimal, I say. For example:Once my vision fully returned, I glanced over at a beautiful waterfall cascading gently over a large, rocky cliff. Butterflies circled the branches of the surrounding fruit trees. I was next to patches of picturesque multi-colored flowers adorning the side of the stream. It was one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen. If the Garden of Eden existed, this is what it must have looked like.Yeah, lady, my imagination is rich but I need more than that to feed it. You didn't let me immerse myself into that otherworldly place and made me feel that I was there.Exhibit B:She brought me some air court warrior-wear that looked like something straight out of Game of Thrones. I changed into a leather pleated skirt and thigh-high boots. The corset top matched my skirt with the exception of the breastplate, which was strung with chainmail.Okay, that last bit was overkill but not everyone watches Game of Thrones.III. Despite all that, I did like this book. So much that when I read the last sentence and turned the page to continue only to find out that there was nothing... You should have heard the growls of frustration.

$REVIEW.: Don't get me wrong, while the lack of action would normally facilitate a decrease in rating from me, the latest exploits of Jenetta Carver were far from a boring read.While lacking less space and strategic confrontations, Clones of Mawcett focuses on building both a race, a background, and a future for a race of people we have seemingly only found details of in passing. These details are well written and engaged upon as the plot progresses, and kept me interested even though there was very little 'action' going on.I strongly recommend this title only if you have read the first two books.

$REVIEW.: Every now and then a book comes out that sheds new light on an old issue.  Back of the Napkin is such a book because it provides a new way of approaching problems.  Roam explains how the way we physically see can translate into creative thinking.  For example, he explains how the basic process of seeing - looking, seeing, imagining and showing - converts easily to problem solving: observing the situation at a very raw level (looking); seeing patterns, relationships, etc, in the information that start us thinking (seeing); imagining ways in which what we learned by seeing can help our problem (imagining); and, finally, demonstrating to ourselves or others how these ideas will work or what our findings mean (showing). Combining this with the hand-eye coordination involved in drawing simple pictures triggers creative inspiration.  Roam also shows how, when we look at something or imagine something, we are, roughly in this sequence, looking at who/what, how much/many, where, when and why.  These ways of seeing fit neatly into the way problems break down.  They also apply to each of the ways that information can be presented.  A where problem, for example, can be depicted in a map; a how issue can be drawn in a flow chart.  These can be combined to reflect more complicated relationships, if necessary.  And, for each of these six ways of seeing, there are 5 options in how your picture is drawn (thought they may not apply fully to each way of seeing).  Here he introduces the SQVID, which is an acronym for the 5 scales, so to speak, which can be used: S - Simple or Complex; Q: Qualitative or Quantitative; V - Vision or Execution; I - Individual or Comparison; and D - Change (Delta) or Status Quo.  So for example, you can draw an execution flow chart that shows the status quo, or you can draw a vision flow chart for the future, and each can be drawn at a high level (simple) or at a very detailed level (complex).  Bringing all these visual thinking components together - the seeing process, the six ways of seeing, the five ranges of presentation, stimulate both right and left brain thinking and thus bring out better ideas.When I switched to another book while reading this one, I noticed myself thinking in pictures, and absorbing the material more deeply.  I am looking forward to re-reading this book again to fully grasp all the concepts, and to begin applying the steps.

$REVIEW.: From the moment I read the synopsis of Infinity+One I knew this was going to be one of those books that I would not be able to put down. So before reading I prepared the mood, pouring myself a glass of Moscato and settling into a hot bath in a room dimly lit only by my reader, my favorite way to start a book. Two hours later I was already half way done. I tried to put it down for bed at midnight but picked it back up again, finishing it by 3 am. I wasn't wrong, it was a gem!Infinity plus one is not your average boy meets girl , boy dumps girl, boy gets smart and gets girl back novel. There is no Alpha male nonsense bordering abusive and the main character&#8217;s , though damaged, are not so ridiculously over done that you feel like pulling your hair out from all the drama. It is a pretty straight forward, classic love story, IE: the kind you don&#8217;t often find these days but so often yearn for.With this book I was able to relax and enjoy the beautiful fated romance of Bonnie and Finn, otherwise known as Bonnie and Clyde, enjoying their cross country adventure almost as if I were sitting in the seat next to them. There were moments where I cried from sadness, moments I cried from joy and many beautifully written moments where I literally laughed until it hurt.This book is the whole package and I truly cannot wait to read it again. Maybe one day there will be an Infinity + two because I really want more.

$REVIEW.: 'Under the Tree' is Susan Waggoner's second dip into the festive market.  I thought her previous book: 'It's a Wonderful Christmas' was much better because it covered the overall Christmas experience rather than just toys.  The text in this latest book is a rather generalized historical view of toys and the magic of seeing them all under the tree on the twenty-fifth.  What gives the copy a lift are the frequent Santa's Shopping List panels throughout the book.  These list toys with a brief description and the prices and just wait until you see some of those prices.  For twenty bucks you could get a pretty good train set in 1954 or a Radio Flyer wagon for $7.29 in 1950 or how about, in 1947, a Betsy Wetsy sixteen inches tall doll for Sis at $8.79.Nostalgic as all this might be I thought the real disappointment was the picture content and the design.  Most of images are bits of pages from mail order catalogs showing generic toys and many of them have been reproduced too small and badly cropped making them look rather like something just to fill some page space.  Overall I thought the picture content very poor.  There are a couple of whole page ads included, Schwinn bikes and Brach's candy, and they really stand out from the other pictures.  It would have made the book much more interesting if there were lots more festive toy ads from the past.  None of this is helped by the bland page design which is the same as Waggoner's 'It's a Wonderful Christmas' book but at least that one had a much wider range of vintage illustrations and photos.Considering the subject matter of 'Under the Tree' it really should have sparkled visually to capture everyone's nostalgic Christmas imagination.Branded toys like Barbie, Lionel trains or Revell model kits get a mention but I think I much better toy book is Tim Walsh'sTimeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Thema beautifully designed three hundred page historical survey covering toys from 1900 to 2000.  A second choice might beThe Story of American Toys: From the Puritans to the Present.  Though neither of these are hung round a Christmas theme like 'Under the Tree' they are both wonderful celebrations of the goodies that filled Santa's sack.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.

It is her job to make arrangements so that all of the guests have their sexual fantasies fulfilled. For the last 3 years that she has worked their she has had a crush on Luke, he comes around each year for the new years celebration but he is her boss&#8217; best friend and her boss has one major rule, no fooling around with the guests.Luke is the heir to a winery and each year he visits New Orleans for the New Years celebration at his best friends hotel. Every yea he makes it his mission to crack the shell of Serephina. She is one sexy woman but puts off a straight laced front. She is also one of the few people who knows is voyeuristic kink.I apologize or the short review but since this is a short read I don&#8217;t want to give to much away.

$review_text.: Rae McAvoy is a demon fighter and carries the gene that allows her (and others) to mutate to carry a demon's essence. These people then have the same powers as the demon that attacked them - telepathic, war, lust etc. A profiler, Parker is Rae's ex but has recently been hanging around for an assignment, one Rae hopes is short-lived. Parker carries the lust demon gene, and their previous relationship showed just how lusty he could be.But after his mother was attacked by a demon and subsequently killed her daughter, Parker's life was ripped apart. Unable to carry on a meaningful relationship, Rae and Parker finally split. But love is still in the air.Rae's latest assignment involves finding missing children. Lawrence, a previous employee was experimenting with children and demons and now he is at it again. Rae has a personal reason why she wants on this case and is desperate to find him. Her boss throws Parker on it too, and together they hunt for Lawrence, fight demons and deal with the immense sexual tension that is simmering right at the surface.Dark Obsession is the second book I have read by Sydney Somers, the other being Primal Attraction (although in a different series) and I really enjoy her voice. Her characters are witty, very engaging, and she does a great job with combining strong sexual tension with very hot romance scenes.I think I would have done a little better with this book had I read the three previous in this series. The world was a bit confusing to me. We get a good deal of information right at the beginning, but I still felt like I didn't have a good grasp of exactly how the demon's essence gets carried over to certain individuals, nor exactly why and how these people are fighting them. I wanted a slower, more evolved explanation throughout the book.Parker is a great hero - with his internal struggle fighting his ever growing lust, to his pain and suffering of what happened to his family. Combine that with his need, and obsession to be with Rae, it is a little heartbreaking. But don't worry - he does not mope nor act pitiful in the bedroom. There he is all man, all in control. Rae tries her best to fight him off, not wanting to travel down the dark road with him again. When his life fell apart years ago, his unraveling nearly killed her too. She doesn't know if she can take that chance again - but Parker makes it very convincing.I really enjoy the way Sydney Somers writes and will definitely be checking out more from her in the future. This one needed a little more world building or needs to be read from book one. If you read it more for just the romantic relationship, you will not be disappointed.Rating: 3.5/5

$REVIEW.: This book was the first eBook I ever bought. I love zombies stories and I was curious to read the work of an independent author. And I was not disappointed !I logically started with "Zombie Bedtime Stories #1", and now I can say that I plan on reading the next stories.The title "Locked-in" explores the zombies myth from a different point of view and the result is great.I had to read the entire book in several sessions, my only regret is not having enough time to read the book in one breath.Although this is a short story, we still have a good look into the main character's psychology and thoughts.I would highly recommend that story to anyone who likes zombies stories or people who would like to have another look to that kind of books and not only have gory scenes to read.

$review_text.: Although I was raised in the 70s by uncles full of admiration of what the Finns did to the Russians for three months it is still a profound dissapointment that few people know, and even fewer people care about this profound struggle of 3 Million Finns -- a free people -- against the tyranny of Stalinst Russia.For a nation this small to have the stomach to thumb their noses at the Russians and then to systematically cut their attacks to ribbons -- inflicting colonial war casualties on the Russians -- it truly one of the David against Goliath matches in history.But there is more to the traditional interpretation notion of the "plucky Finns" and the "incompetent Russians:"  Finns eventually did succumb to the inevitable onslaught of the Russians. There were cases of the Finns actually breaking from the front, and Russians actually adapting tactics to overcome the Finnish ability to use their understanding of their own geography to dominate the Russians. That is perhaps not so hard to believe. What is harder to believe is miracles such as the battle of Soussalmi -- where Finnish ski troops cut to pieces 30,000 Russians for the total of 1,700 Finnish dead.The book is an overview only and does cover the various stages of the war -- the initial and failed Russian Offensive of December, the holding pattern of January and the final onslaugth that brought the end for Finland. But the book does not pretend to be a total overview of the fighting on the front -- on that point there still needs to be a definitive English edition of this war such as what Norman Davis' "Rising 44" did for the Warsaw Insurrection.There is also not enough background on the political developments surrounding the war and the geopolitical drivers of policy (the actions of the Western allies are a bit bewildering to those uninitiated in a good understanding of the history of these times).There is also a good chapter on Mannerheim. This man, so long assciated with both the fighting spirit of Finland is often equated totally as the heart of Finn resistance. His personality was in fact authoritarian, problematic and a direct result of the Tsarist officer corps he was raised within and whose spirit he imbided.A good read and well worth your time.

The author has written many books on high end point and shoot cameras
This book follows in this tradition

First, The camera is  much easier to learn when you have this book side by side with the camera

I highly recommend this book.Don't let the size and the print and pictures scare you off

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This was my 1st book by S. Walden, but I am going to read Going Under next which was on my TBR list.Well written book, great character development and a taboo student/teacher romance that was uncomfortable at times.  I felt fear for where this could all go, and where it went, which I never expected. I loved the growth between Mark and Cadence. Mark came off a little mysterious to me at times I really want to figure him out. Loved Avery and her wittiness and friendship to Cadence, and Gracie is such a BITCH. I also liked her brother Oliver who finally came around and was there for her.Also....this book does end in a cliffhanger but not a huge one in my mind.Can't wait for the 2nd book "Better" to come out.

$review_text.: I keep coming back to this author because she does great relationships.  Especially married couples relationships.This novella is a sweet take off of the O.Henry classicThe Gift of the Magi.  Eric and Nia are young marrieds who aren't exactly rich.  He is a resident at a local hospital, she is working two jobs so they can pay off their student loans and keep debt low.  They are also stupid in love with each other, with each not quite believing their luck having landed their soul-mate.  At Christmas, both make a sacrifice of something special to make sure that the other gets a wonderful Christmas gift.I totally bought Nia and Eric as this loving couple.  There was a rhythm to their dialogue that made me feel like they really knew each other.  Actually all the dialogue across the book was great.  I felt like I was listening to real people talk esp. with the peppering of pop-cultural references and the light humor throughout.  Nia was an especially great character, she was warm and optimistic without seeming overly naive.  Eric was a little more closed, but you also felt the sense of strain in him that came from his overwork and tiredness and his disaffection with their current life situation.  You could also tell he felt more vulnerable in the relationship, which I thought was also a nice realistic touch and a change because for once the heroine wasn't the one having the emotional journey.Oh yeah, the sex was also hot!Good book.

$REVIEW.: Moonlight is the 4th book in the Order of the Black Swan

 I must repeat myself and say, please read them in order (My Familiar Stranger, The Witch's Dream, and A Summoner's Tale)


 They flow into each other and the stories weave back and forth like a fugue.This one is not as dark as A Summoner's Tale

 It is a lot of fun

 Victoria Danann creates such wonderful, complex characters


 Take Stalkson Grey (a voice in my head just screamed "yes!")


 When he first appeared in The Witch's Dream, I didn't like him very much

 I thought he was all ego
 He did seem to admire Elora for standing up to him so I didn't reject him completely

 In this book, we get a deeper look at him and his life
 The choices he has to make and the pressures he is under being an Alpha

 Being werewolves, his pack needs lots of wild, forested space


 However, humans are developing the wilderness and encroaching on their territory


 There is no easy answer

 To they go against their nature and go along with the change?  Do they fight?  Do they move to another world?  We come to really love and respect Stalkson and the adjustments he has to make


 In one of these other worlds he meets the person that might be his true love


 At the last moment when it seems time is running out, the careful, conservative Stalkson gives into a spur of the moment impulse that changes quite a few lives.We also get more of Deliverance
 He is turning into one of my favourite characters


 I am also looking forward to finding out more about the Elf/Fairy feud

 Will Ram's sister Aelsong finally get her fairy prince?  I can't wait to see how this develops.Now that they have a cure for the vampire plague, the Order of the Black Swan has lost its original purpose

 The members of the B-Team have "retired." Although in truth, they seem to be just as involved and still seem to throw themselves into danger


With this story we gets hints of how things will move forward for the organization and for the individuals involved
 Then there is the matter of the people from Elora's home universe

 I am counting the days until the next book Gathering Storm.One last thing, I loved all the cover but this one of the wolf is my favourite- such incredible eyes.

$REVIEW.: Archer's Voice begins when Bree moves to a new town. She's had so much happen to her, and she just wants an escape so she leaves. She never expected what she would find in this new town, until she meets Archer. He has his won demons, and many other problems but they start to form a connection even though neither one of them are very sure about what is happening. They do however try very hard to push through it all to come out together in they end...This book was not at all what I was expected. I had actually been putting it off for a months because I just didn't think it was something I could get into... boy, do I feel stupid now! I should have read it as soon as I got it! The writing was really good, and the plot had me constantly wondering what was going to happen next. The heroine is fierce, but sweet and beautiful all in one. She's so strong for Archer, and she wasn't afraid to show him she wanted him. And Archer..  He is for sure in a league all on his own. I mean seriously he was a mixture of alpha male, with shyness, and lots of insecurities. I really admired both the heroine and hero though out this book. I couldn't believe they were so strong and had to go through all of that it was truly amazing! Then the epilogue just made it even better. This was a very wonderful story that I very much recommend!

$REVIEW.: The 13th Demon by Bruce Hennigan is the first book in the Chronicles of Jonathan Steel. Steel washed up on a beach two years ago with completely no memory of who he was or where he was from, but he had almost super human fighting abilities. When the woman he loved was killed by a vicious demon with a spiral eye, Steel committed his life to hunting own his nemesis. He arrives in the small town of Lakeside, Louisiana to help out a desperate pastor whose church has been taken over by demonic forces. Huge spiders and scorpions run around the sanctuary, blood pours out from the doors, and the baptistery holds a portal to another dimension. Steel calls on his mentor, Cephas, to send him to reinforcements, a linguist named Liz and a physicist named Claire who brings her troubled son, Joshua. Hennigan has an enigmatic hero in Steel, but he takes the mystery a bit too far at times. The story suffers from too much back story and introduction of characters. Hennigan obviously has plans to write a large series, but 300 pages are too few to include all of the story elements he wants to put into play. One thing that concerned me in reading is that Hennigan's descriptions of the evil forces are poetic and lengthy in nature, but the forces of good get far less detail, making them less real, more abstract for readers. The story moves so quickly, and so many characters are introduced, there is little time to grow to care for them. (SPOILER ALERT) When a major character dies at the end of the story, I had very little emotional response, because there hadn't been opportunity to grow to care.  I think that Hennigan has some terrific ideas, and Jonathan Steel could be a terrific hero, but it needs some work.

$REVIEW.: This story affected me in so many ways!  Not only did my hubby grow up in Avella, PA; 2 miles from Wellsburg, WV.... but our 4 yr old has ASD.  This book felt too personal.Ms. Walters did a wonderful job in writing Flynn's POV and truly understanding what its like for a person on the spectrum. I'm incredibly grateful for her and this story.I've read Ms. Walters other books and enjoyed each one. But this story is my favorite.This story gave me hope. I cried at parts of this book because Flynn's actions hit so close to home for me.  It made me think that maybe, one day, my son could have a girlfriend... yea I know that sounds superficial and trite but those little things that are just part of life for &#34;normal&#34; people. Not once did I really give thought to my son having a romantic future. I'm too focused on his therapy.&#34; Flynn didn't mean to be rude, He didn't think twice before voicing  a thought after it entered his head. He had absolutely no filter.&#34;I recommend this book because it honestly shows how hard it is for young adults on the spectrum to live in a society of ignorant people.Thank you Ms. Walters!

$REVIEW.: The Last Eagle is a good WW 2 sea adventure story


Somewhat slow start gradually builds to a page turning ending

 The story is loosely based on real events and told in a style reminiscent of a Douglas Reeman tale
 I thought the characters were intriguing and adequately fleshed out to make them interesting
 My only complaint was that some typos do distract.

$REVIEW.: OMFG did book was UNREAL! If you like raw books,nothing held back then this is the book for you. This isn't all rainbows and butterflies. You think the books you've read up until this point show you how D/s relationships. But you are wrong. Oh so wrong. That is the beautified version and this is the real one. This story is between Kelli and Erik. As soon as they see each other they want each other. Kelli wants him just not in the same way as Erik wants her. He wants to posses her. He wants to own every part of her. She thinks he is amazing all 6 foot odd,tattoo's and motor bike. The perfect man all wrapped up in a wife beater and tattoo's. The first time she see's him is at a bar when she walks by him. She's been away at college so she has no idea who this guy is. But she wants to find out. So what are the chances that he's just walk into her job....... He instantly starts him 'ways' with her when he see's her. Commanding her to do this and do that. And what does she do????? Yep she obeys!!! Right there no questions asks. This book will own you as Erik owned Kelli. You will feel things all threw this book. These characters get into your head and set up camp. Not planning to go anywhere. I finished this book a day ago and they still won't leave me. I keep going over different parts of the book. And I'm shocked. Shocked that this relationship seems so beautiful. Kelli always taught she was different. A 'freak'. But he changes that. That one person think's is weird is another man's vice. They can't get enough of one another. He adores his 'Baby Girl'. But under his tough shell is a broken man. He's alone in this big bad world. has he found the person to spend it with? Has the little rich girl robbed his heart. When this book owns you and you can't get it out of your head no matter how hard you try blame the author! And get ready because this is only the first in a series! There is so much more to come. Our minds will never be the same again. You will see things in a different light after reading this. You will either love it or hate it. But one things for sure you won't be able to stop thinking of it ;)

$review_text.: 2.5 starsDanielle (Dani) Jordan was running away from trouble and tragedy when she started working at the Diamond Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Jace Diamond, owner of the casino, was determined to have Danielle from the time he saw her sunbathing at the hotel's pool. Fireworks spark between the two and a stormy relationship ensues. When a stalker from Danielle's past suddenly appears, Dani's happiness and her life are threatened. Will Jace and Dani trust one another to confront the threat together, or will they continue to have doubts about each other?Although the plot of "Fair Play" is interesting, much of the book belabored the contrived conflict between Jace and Dani as Dani initially fought her attraction to Jace and then wrote him off without giving him a chance to explain himself when she suspected him of being unfaithful. The fighting-attraction-misunderstanding conflict is a little over used and annoying in my opinion, but might have worked more if the two main characters were better developed.The book starts with an opening scene that sets up the mutual attraction between Dani and Jace. After that the plot dragged so slowly that I almost quit reading 25 percent into the book. Once the real action kicked in that involves the threat from Dani's past, the plot was engaging enough that I finished the book. The action and pace at the ending redeems the story.

Will she lose herself if she finally lets herself go?Tanner is equally struggling with his desire for Natalie, if he fully lets go will he lose her when she sees him at his most bare?I am really enjoying this series,It is fast paced and gets right down to it, which lets be honest it's what we all want to read!

The Guide to Getting It On is without doubt the most comprehensive guide to all the physical and emotional components of quality sex and quality relationships


Still probably best suited for heterosexuals, it does include sections on gender bending and orientation; in addition, many of the tips and techniques can be applied by members of any type of relationship
I would strongly recommend this to parents of teenagers (your kids could really benefit from this!), but even experienced adults will find it helpful, entertaining and humorous.

$REVIEW.: First of all, I would like to say that the story itself is worth FIVE stars.  The artwork is very appealing, and small children should connect to it.  St. John draws with sophisticated simplicity - her human figures look very like what a small person would draw.  There aren't many pages, which is appropriate for the age group, but each page has many things to look at and discuss as you read it together.  And there is a joyous quality to the work that makes you smile with delight at each page.  I look forward to more Guelph adventures!The Kindle experience was frustrating however.  After registering for the Kindle app several times, I was still unable to download the book to my pc.  Finally I asked a friend to buy it on her Kindle and we each read it (she giggled the whole way through it so I'd consider that another positive review.)  I am not tempted to buy a Kindle of my own, given my first encounter with the product.I would like to see the Guelph books in a real book form, too.

It was interesting getting to know a bit about their pasts. I enjoyed seeing the connection between the two.  My only problem with this is very predictable book that I feel like I've read it before. Same characters, same situation just different names and places. There was just something missing from the book to really stand out to be unique.  Overall I still really liked this book.I've read many versions of this book to really put it says its worth 4 stars to me which means I would've loved it.

$review_text.: Even though Jack was clearly a pervert, and an emotional one at that, he managed to be the only likable character in the story.Holly was your typical stupid kid, Furio, an unshaven brute who had absolutely no personality whatsoever. And santa was a brainless twit.I prefer stories where the female characters have a bit more spunk and motivation. Holly's only motivation was giving it up to a grumpy dog.Santa was witless, and didn't care about the situation he was throwing his daughter into regardless of her protests, and informing him of Jack's perversion. How can santa care about the worlds children when he can't do the same for his own?Furio's lack of personality had me rooting for Jack during the slap fight, at least Jack acted on his feelings, whereas Furio laid back and waited for it to be served to him on a silver platter.A very frustrating story to say the least, but well written. But quality editing can't compensate for lousy characters.

$REVIEW.: Somehow Jake Needhams novels about Inspector Samuel Tay seem to me to be much better than his other stories. Why this should be is difficult to pin-point. As a reviewer I should be able to say why, but I can't right now. I'll have to get back to you on that. Perhaps its because the plots are set in Singapore, perhaps because the main character is of Chinese descent. Which actually is an important balancing point in multi-ethnic Singapore. I have to read more of these books and find out.The Umbrella Man follows the normal well-trodden path of a dectective who is told by his superior not to take part in an investigation. Inspector Tay is given a simple case to handle - far away from the big investigation. And of course, within 15% of the book, we all know as readers, that Tay's line of investigation will ultimately zero in on the BIG investigation he was told to avoid. I won't spoil the plot for you. But even then its a good read. The dialogue and the humour of Samuel Tay give him a a very believable and likeable character. Naturally the CIA or some other agency are portrayed in various guises as the villains. But that seems to be standard fare these days.Good book. Well screwed together. Enjoyable read. What more can you ask?

$REVIEW.: I'm not really a big romance reader. In fact, I only read it because I have a client that writes it. And I know she enjoyed the series.I'm glad I took her suggestion and read this set.The book actually consists of three independent stories. The first two novels are a continuation of the same story while the next two are independent (there is overlapping minor characters). All three stories take likeable characters and put them through h**l. You'll find yourself enthralled from beginning to end (and cursing the sadistic nature of the author towards her characters).I'm a little upset that the set doesn't continue the story of Zach and Katie (I was looking forward to their next trial) but the two other stories were just as good as the first so I'm still hungry to read more.If you enjoy romance and especially Amish romance, you will enjoy this set (and probably the entire series).

I must admit I had a hard time getting through this book because it didn't hold my interest right from the first page. It had too many characters to keep up with and seemed a bit disjointed at times. The book jumped around a lot and there were many times I felt I was walking into the middle of a conversation and had no idea what they were talking about.This is by far not one of the best books I have ever read but, having said that, there is a particular market this book will probably appeal to.

Watching Dalton struggle with breaking he labels that he has live with all his life was heartbreaking, as was learning the true depths of Caspers cruelty. Rarely have I wanted to jump into a book and punch a character as badly as I did with him. Thankfully he has Rory there to help him navigate his way. Seeing the family reconnect after being at such odds for so long was nice too.I did have some issues with the way Luke was put on a pedestal in this one though. I know he wasn't all bad but he was a jerk. Dying doesn't change that and in this one he seemed to be painted as a saint.

$REVIEW.: I will keep this short. I've read all of Nelson's books, starting with the Van Bender series. I've found all of them to be very enjoyable. This one, however, I particularly enjoyed. It combines three things I love: alternative history, fantasy, and zombies. James's style is easy to read. It's clear and flows well, without any literary trickery to try and show you how clever he is. Instead, his prose lets you get lost in the narrative. This book reminds me of Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, in that both worlds are set in an alternate historical America where magic exists. Also like Card, James isn't afraid to pose tricky moral questions and see them through to their logical conclusion.Although there are humorous elements in this book, it's not a comedy, and there are some very sad things that happen. He made me care about (and in some cases loathe) the characters, and I couldn't put the book down.James has created an interesting magic system and alludes to plenty of other events going on beyond the confines of the story he tells. It's a standalone book, but I sure would love to read more set in this world.
$SUMMARY.: Thoroughly enjoyable alternate history fantasy with zombies

$review_text.: Some say that John Bunyan's famous allegory about Pilgrim's journey to the Celestial City is second only to the Bible itself in the number of copies sold worldwide. First published in 1678, this 330 year old allegory written by John Bunyan while incarcerated for preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ without a license is as pertinent today as it was when it was written.Quick ReviewThis book is an essential read because of its simplicity and its depth. The Christian reader  will identify quickly with the main character and many (if not all depending on the readers disciplined walk) of the people, places, and themes encountered.  The reader will know that the issues he/she faces today are issues faced by all Christians as they walk through this life on their way to their eternal home.Reviewed by: Keiki HendrixReviewed for: Examiner.com

$review_text.: 'The Excellent Wife' was the first book I read of Martha Peace. I can not tell you what a joy it was to finally find a book that didn't just say 'it's biblical to be a submissive and loving wife' but actually gave examples in how to do so.Martha gives several scenarios that a wife might find herself in, in which she cleary gives the two obvious choices a wife has:1. to think as the world has taught us2. to think as the Bible has taught usIt was surprising to me - who thought of myself as a 'godly wife' to realize that given those scenarios, my first thought was exactly what it shouldn't be. Martha's book is written in a way that gently and throughly teaches women how to act, react, and think in a biblical manner.While she touches on the sticky issue of submission, she does an excellent job of explaining that submission does not mean being a doormat, it means giving yourself to God's sovereignty and trusting Him.Overall I encourage women of all ages and walks in their spiritual lives to read THE EXCELLENT WIFE.

$review_text.: This was not what I expected from a seasoned writer who used an editor, proofreader, and a couple beta readers.  Typos (lots of them), inconsistencies, lack of back story, repetitiveness, and even a character name spelled wrong.  Simply put, it needs an overhaul.  I&#8217;m sad to say that because I wanted to love this book.Spoilers below:The idea of an &#8220;innocent&#8221; girl meeting a &#8220;bad&#8221; boy is great.  But&#8230;Paisley isn&#8217;t the most likeable character.  She&#8217;s a virgin.  Fabulous!  She&#8217;s tired of people treating her like a baby.  Well, the first step is to stop acting like one.  She figures that will happen when she moves away to go to college.Her best friend, Evan, whom she&#8217;s known since they were in diapers, has already moved to the college town.  Evan has partied every chance he&#8217;s had with his roommate Pete.  When Paisley goes to the first party with him, he&#8217;s hanging all over her and acting like they&#8217;re together.  Seems Evan has changed his tune about Paisley, but we never find out why.  We do know that Evan hates Gabe strictly because of what Pete&#8217;s told him. Eventually we learn that Evan&#8217;s been drinking far too much and started doing drugs.  Shocking thing here is that innocent Paisley instantly knew he was snorting cocaine when she saw it, but had no clue what &#8220;swingers&#8221; meant.  Seriously?Now Gabe&#8230;he&#8217;s the farthest thing from a bad boy.  A &#8220;bad boy&#8221; is simply not a guy with a few tattoos, motorcycle, killer smile, and a reputation for getting girls to give up their virginity.  If so, a lot of guys would be considered one, right?While I found Gabe more likeable than Paisley, he had so much more potential.  He may have had a few moments when he was younger partying and doing some drugs, but he turned that around.  He gave college a try, it wasn&#8217;t his thing. In order to support himself he makes a living as a tattoo artist.  This screams he&#8217;s very artistic.  But, we quickly learn that to him it&#8217;s just a job that &#8220;pays the bills.&#8221; Most tattoo artists are just that&#8211;artists. They love drawing, it&#8217;s their passion.  But, not for this 23 year old who sits in his parent&#8217;s coffee shop all day trying to write a horror story, running an errand every now and again for them, and helping with the books because he&#8217;s good at math.  Hmmmm.He steps in and takes care of his younger half-brother because the poor little guy was an accident from one of his parent&#8217;s nights of swinging. His mother doesn&#8217;t have patience to be a mother. But, all this does is confirm that partying teenage Gabe grew up and became a good guy.That in a nutshell is all we really know of Gabe.  Paisley doesn&#8217;t ask.  I never could figure out why she didn&#8217;t.  That&#8217;s normal conversation when you start dating someone, especially if you&#8217;ve been told by a few people to stay away.  Wouldn&#8217;t you want to know what skeletons were in his closet? I sure would.As far as any potential book from the best friends&#8211;don&#8217;t.  I didn&#8217;t find them interesting enough in this to warrant their own story.

$review_text.: I saw this on the library shelf and wondered why only "liberals" would be considered do-gooders, and that it is wrong to be either a "liberal" or a "do-gooder". However the title is misleading and the text is more thoughtful and the ideas presented are less volitle than the title would suggest. Most conservative "books" are nothing more than smear filled screeds intending to demonize, not only "liberals", but the word liberal itself as though a dictionary definition is superfluous - the worst offenders of course of meaningless right wing propaganda are Ann Coulter (the queen of neurotic "lib-phobia"), Hannity (who doen't feel his bizarre opinions need facts and logic to back them up because his "lib-phobia is incurable), and of course Rush Limbaugh (who pretends he is the dean and only professor of an imaginary course of study called "Advanced Conservative studies") a man who hasn't been right about anything of consequence yet.So here is at least a reasonable thinking "conservative" view that seems well thought out, even if off track occasionally. The flaws, and there are a few, begin with the supposition that the things conservatives find fault with are all the fault of "liberals", or "liberal thinking". It is an all too common thread in rightwing conservative screeds that the word "liberal" applies to any thought, idea, action, or political stance that they deem "wrong". Few if any define "liberal thought", or what liberalism is by definition according to every dictioary of the English language. Rightwing conservativism is so locked into a world view that demonizing opposing views is the way to convince people they are right and all other thoughts are not only wrong, but evil, dangerous and destructive. In short, right wing conservatives are so fearful of rational, reasonable debate and disagreements that they can only rant and rave, attempt to silence all opposition and smear anyone who dares to question their secret motto, which is, and I know I am breaking a sacred code mentioning this, but conservatives and their minions live by the creed: "Don't confuse me with facts, I've already been told what to think."Mona Charen is a little above the worse offenders in the divisive fray that conservatives need to promote at every opportunity. She is a very adept author, is at least occasionally reasonable and defies the conservative mantra of "if you can't blind them with brilliance, baffle them with bull---t." In fact this is the first book by a shameless conservative that I would urge flaming "liberals" to read, if only to be reassured that all conservatives are not as evil as Halliburton, Cheney (Nixon White House Stooge), Rove, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld (also a Nixon  White House Stooge),Delay and their unwitting dupe, Dubya. It is good for once to read an opposing view that doesn't recite the lockstep party line to the exclusion of all reason.

$REVIEW.: (spoiler) I love books about the pioneers going west and most of the book seemed in line with all I have ever read. However, the main character was  unrealistic. A young woman with a nursing baby living alone in a covered wagon and chopping wood to build fences and chicken coops etc etc as well as cooking and washing etc. What was described would have been hard for a man to do let alone a woman and a woman who was trying to keep up her strength for nursing a baby . . and what about keeping up with a baby. Where was the baby when she and the friend went rolling down the hill? Where was he when she chopped wood until noon to build the fences. On her back? She sprained her ankle and was unconscious? Sorry, I just found it all to be a bit 'far fetched' since I have raised children and doubt she could have done all of that with a baby. Just the woman's work back then would have worked her from sun to sun but she was doing that and the man's work. I am only half way through the book but will finish it. Other than that, i do like the book.

$review_text.: This book was hilarious. I could not stop smiling and laughing at Rory and Connor's antics. I don't even know how to articulate how much I loved this book. R.L. Mathewson is becoming a favorite of mine.Rory and Connor have know and tortured each other all their lives. Their behavior towards each other is well known around town and has gotten them banned from 57 places. This all comes a head when they are forced to work on a project together.Rory and Connor's relationship was different than any other couple I've ever read. I love that the book didn't go the way I expected it too. There was no big break up over a misunderstanding. Connor plotted against Rory but he dropped it pretty quickly once Rory was in his arms and when his scheme (that never saw fruition) was discovered it wasn't a big deal (at least not to Rory lol). You see the return of Trevor,Zoe, Jason and Hayley in this novel along with Rory's brothers. It was nice to see family play a part in the novel.This is the first novel I've ended in a long time with a smile on my face. It's a light easy read. I think anyone not looking for something serious will enjoy it immensely.

This story show what cruel things happen when women aren't allowed to have autonomy over their own bodies. The One Child Policy has created a war between the state and a woman's son-obsessed husband over control of her womb. The heart-breaking reality of these women is truly shocking, but really not so far off from attempts in the US to legislate women's uteruses. Telling women how they 'ought' to behave, whether you feel it's right or wrong, for the good of the country or not, once you take away an individuals right to control their own body, you're really just taking control from them. Either way, it's an incredibly moving tale and a wonderful read.

$REVIEW.: Taft 2012 by Jason Heller was an enjoyable, if somewhat quirky, read

It is more of a polemic than a novel, commenting on the state of American society and politics in the second decade of the 21st century
In this alternate history, William Howard Taft suddenly appears on the White House lawn 100 years after he left the White House and disappeared in 1912


He naturally attracts immense media and public attention, and a grassroots Taft Party springs up to draft him for the presidency in 2012

But all is not as it seems, and this new version of a "T party" has secrets of its own
While the author does provide some interesting ruminations on life today as opposed to life in the past, Taft 2012 is pretty flat and does not take advantage of its opportunities for satire or wit

Overall, it's too preachy and the ending is forced.

$REVIEW.: A silly little novel that aspires to the fun and frivolous "drawing room" dramas of Georgette Heyer. Unfortunately it lacks Heyer's artful and witty prose in favor of a modern, pedestrian vernacular that sometimes clashes with the 18th Century setting of the story. The plot is lifted almost directly from Edith Wharton's 'The Buccaneers,' which, to the author's credit, she wisely acknowledges. This likely explains why the four main characters behave more like Victorian adventurers than Georgian damsels. In both behavior and attitude they are largely out of time and place, overall lacking a believable consistency. Particularly in the case of the heroine, Clementine Garland, who, as the novel progresses becomes increasingly erratic, with poorly executed motives that leaves the reader feeling unsympathetic towards her. I think in large part this may be due to the author's attempt to retro-fit Wharton's essentially Victorian novel into a French Revolutionary setting. It just doesn't work in this case, and it's precisely when the story approaches the revolution that Clementine's character begins to unravel. The revolution, in which all the characters become entangled, is dealt with in a light, absurd tone that is strikingly at odds with the seriousness of events. Without giving the plot away, Clementine's attitude goes something like this: "Oh dear! People are being butchered in the streets! How depressing! Hey, girls, let's put on velvet and diamonds and go party!" It becomes that ridiculous in the last half of the novel.Most readers will probably take no notice of such things, but Before the Storm is also laced with historical boo-boos. The 18th Century upper class did not "go shopping"; the shopping came to them. Nor did they flip through fashion magazines; there weren't any. And they certainly didn't dine at restaurants; there weren't any of those either. They dined at each other's houses, and even when the necessities of travel dictated eating at an inn or tavern, it was always in a private room, never in the "common" room.As I said, it's a silly story, made even more so by the author's choice of placing her fluffy characters in the midst of dire, life-or-death circumstances and behaving as if they're still at a garden party. Georgette Heyer and Edith Wharton knew enough to keep their heroines far away from the battlefields (least their pretty silk dresses become soiled) and Melanie Clegg should have taken the cue. It just doesn't work any other way.

$review_text.: I am not necessarily giving a one star to the book but instead to the fact that this may be the last book in what should have been a five book series. If you search the web for Rene Lyons you will find that she has turned to publishing and given up writing in the middle of this series.  She may have even been fired from this publisher but that could be only gossip. Anway she has left said publisher and she and her husband started a publishing company and then renamed that company.  It is now hard to say what she is doing, but just beware you may get hooked on this series and find yourself disappointed when no other books from Lyons on the Templers are published.  The book itself was ok.  Too much repetition,too much angst, too much regret and way too much violence.  In fact I find the whole series so far to be rather similar in content and repetitious.  I realize that most series are like that but somehow these seem like been there done that and the Templers all meld together.  I would still have liked to complete the series, since I started it and am trying to save someone else from repeating my mistake.

Easy to understand, takes you to another world, and has characters you can relate to

At first you may be wanting to stray away because of the setting of a female society, but give it a chance

The male lead knows what he is doing and can control his own destiny if he truly wants to


There is almost nothing that couldn't happen in this book

Sex, fights, blood, anger, and ulterior motives are only the beginning


You have to not be choosy when it comes to books sometimes and let the author take you for a ride


I almost didn't read this book and man would I have regretted this! S

$REVIEW.: In Melissa McClone's Home for Christmas, Rachel Murphy comes to Montana to spend Christmas with her brother Ty, foreman at the Bar V5 Ranch outside Marietta. Rachel has been going through a rough time professionally, placing all her trust in the wrong people. Now she needs a place to re-group and recover after all her bakery plans are stolen by her so-called friends and business partners. Ty is her only family, and he raised her after her parents were killed in an accident when she was 10. He left her in Arizona when she went to Culinary school, making a place for himself at the Bar V5 with Nate Vaughn. Nate took over the ranch after a successful career as a Venture Capitalist. He is home, and the ranch is successful, thanks to Ty. Rachel has stumbled on a way to make a little money by making Gingerbread houses, and finds herself using Nate's kitchen to do it. The attraction between the two is immediate, but she is Ty's sister and off limits to Nate. Instead, he works at ways to make her business grow, whether she wants the help or not.Rachel and Nate both have a lot to learn about themselves and how to make a relationship work. It is so much fun watching them both find their way, and realize they belong together. Christmas time in Marietta is beautiful, and Rachel's creations just add to the beauty and tradition. It is fun watching Rachel learn what Home really means.  A wonderful novella and addition to the Copper Mountain group. This novella makes me want to sit back with a cup of hot cocoa and a roaring fire, the smell of baking gingerbread in the air, and snow falling outside the window...

$REVIEW.: I'm still laughing queitly to myself from reading this book. It has everything I'm looking for in a contemporary romance. It's a friends to lovers story involving two strong, independent, smart, flawed but amusing characters. The pacing was even and the story well plotted - twists weren't telegraphed, which really delighted me. The sex scenes were sensual and passionate though not salacious and gratuitous. This appears to be the second book in a series, but I didn't suffer from not reading the first (Yet!). Ms. Scroeder really brings the funny as well - Thankfully she includes the recipe for a chocolate cake that is featured prominently in one of my favorite scenes.The secondary characters are strong, the setting well drawn, the dialogue witty, and the ease of immersion great. The ending was satisfying though it did leave room for more books.....Looking forward to those.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I've read all the regular UJBR books and some were stinkers and some were great.  This is just below great, but is better than the 25th version.  Interesting phallic cover art with the two P's and something dangling down from between them that resembles....um....well, you know.  I'm sure that was on purpose and not meant to be caught by just everybody....subliminal...someone with a dirty mind?  It wouldn't have been my choice for cover art.  Overall, worth getting, especially since the cover isn't that shabby thing that was on the 25th that fell apart, warped and otherwise ruined a good read.

$REVIEW.: This was my very first Kassandra Lamb novel and I can guarantee it will not be my last.This is the story of a man who was deemed a hero after running back into the WT CENTER and rescuing men and women in the burning and collapsing building. Never feeling quite comfortable with the title of hero:  Peter Jamison feels unworthy after harboring the guilt of not being able to save more: especially a little girl who&#8217;s limp body he carried away last.Peter falls into despair and depression and is diagnosed with PTSD, but cannot get the care he needs due to technical and uncaring health care insurers. But persistence and his own personal strength finds him on the right track to his recovery when the track takes a turn ten years later and the black cloud that follows him bursts and he gets accused of a homicide.This is a story of friendship and compassion of a group of attorneys, doctors and detectives who come together to help save a man who considers him self not deserving of the title of hero.Kassandra Lamb does an excellent job of involving the reader with her characters, so much so that I found myself having to put the book down because certain parts of the book brought back so many memories of that historic day and the losses this country sustained plus my own personal loss of a childhood friend who was on the plane that hit the pentagon.Bravo Kassandra Lamb. I am looking forward to reading the rest of your Kate Huntington series.

$review_text.: POV a gay cop in Honolulu?  And a crime that involves the sovereignty movement?  A novel about Hawaii that spends more time in Papakolea than Waikiki?  This is good stuff


 And it almost all works except for a strange self-consciousness about words that are in the Hawaiian language, or that reference local food and culture


 It's understandable that these words need some explanation but the explanations read like they've been cut from anthropology text books and are very disruptive to the flow of the novel
 In contrast, his handling of the main character's gay lifestyle is quite adroit

 Sometimes the pidgin English seems thrown in there just to be exotic, rather than authentic but I suppose that's artistic license


 The characters are widely varied and are most successful when they are the ones that show the grittier side of life in paradise
 The author has taken on a lot in this novel, and I am curious to see how the next one goes.

$review_text.: I recently received a copy of this book to see what the "incorrect" perspective is on global warming. This book isn't "politically incorrect." It's offensive, and goes far out of the way to be so. Glad I didn't pay retail.The section on p. 7 reads "Green on the outside, red to the core." The text (continuing from the previous section) reads "This raises the question of the company that greens keep and their shared bond. Communists and socialists may be environmental activists, and environmental activists may be communists or socialists, though to be one does not necessarily mean being the other. These birds of a feather do however flock together as simpatico wings of the modern Global Salvationist movement."What? "Yellow journalism" doesn't begin to describe the hyperbole used by Horner.As for the reviews printed on the cover: it's uhhhh... Feb 21 when I write this. The book is copyrighted "2007." The reviews on the cover tout it's impact and timely appearance. How did that happen? Sounds false, doesn't it?Given that Mr. Horner has a JD, and, as far as I can determine from a Web search, no scientific credentials, he appears quite unqualified to write anything other than an opinion piece. His "scientific analysis" reminds me a LOT of Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly doing "news analysis." Biased and nasty.Horner uses some quotes from the '70s to ridicule concerns. One of these is just great. On p. 45, in a sidebar labeled "False Prophecies," Horner quotes Paul Erlich: "... the oceans will die of DDT poisoning by 1979...". (Now, _Ramparts_ was well known to be an over-the-top (even at the time) liberal publication. Still, it had it's moments.) I live in Los Angeles. When DDT was banned, the local pelican population began to recover from egg failures that were traced directly to long-term DDT poisoning.  There is a spot off the local coast (Palos Verdes) where DDT was dumped in steel drums for a number of years. NOBODY goes fishing there, or in the southward-moving plume. We locals wonder what will happen when the drums rust through. Yep, them bad old environmentalists sure missed the call that time.To calibrate my review, I am still somewhat agnostic about global warming. I've never agreed with the "the earth is there to be used" philosophy, but I don't know about global warming. Still, some caution - both ways - is reasonable. This book doesn't provide a reasonable basis for forming an opinion.I would direct attention to the Wikipedia page on "greenhouse gas" to begin an informed introduction to global warming.

$review_text.: So a few weeks ago I decided to learn to knit. Well, decided might be too strong a word. Mike was learning to knit and I thought I might try it too, since I had done a little knitting as a child and figured I'd pick it right back up. I didn't. It was a disaster. I hated it. But, more importantly, I felt that knitting had defeated me and I couldn't have that (YOU WON'T BE ME, KNITTING!). So I kept at it, almost 100% out of spite. Who was the spite directed at? I dunno...the needles? It didn't matter. Eventually I got better. Sort of.It didn't take long before spite turned into cockiness. I could knit anything! I was well on my way to being a knitting master! I had knit! I had purled! I had cast on AND bound off (binded off?). What more did I need? I was officially a Beginner Knitter, I assumed.So when I saw this book that claimed to be "aimed at both beginning and more advanced knitters" I thought, "Aha! I'm totally ready for this!" I was wrong. So, so wrong.Turns out knitting is like its own language, and reading a knitting pattern is like reading music. You have to know what you're looking at and really understand how it relates to what you're supposed to be doing with your hands. Knowing how to do a purl stitch really isn't enough to be able to follow a "beginner" pattern any more than knowing how to bang your fingers on a piano is enough to be able to read--and play--a piece of sheet music. This book had me feeling in over my head pretty quickly.As cute as some of the sweaters in this book are (and some are very cute, though others just look dated and old-fashioned, if I'm honest), you really have to think about how you define "beginner" before attempting them. If you're completely fine with using patterns--and by patterns I mean a series of abbreviations and code that knitters use, not step-by-step directions--you might want to try some of these. If, like me, you would like more tutelage, you're probably not ready for this book. All but one of the photos are of the finished products; none of them (save one) are of the process itself. If this book is for beginners, I am clearly nowhere near "beginner" status.Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from the publisher from NetGalley. I was not obliged to write a favourable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own.

$REVIEW.: I loved This Heart Of Mine, it was the perfect ending to the series. I'm a little sad the series has finished, no more Madison :-( once I started reading I couldn't put it down.We pick up where we left off, Madison is dealing with the death of his grandfather. Kayla's test comes back positive being the day of Madison's grandfathers funeral she holds off on telling him. Not only does Madison past come back to haunt him, part of Kayla's does as well!Madison fights and does everything he can to protect and keep Kayla and the baby safe. When the unthinkable happens Kayla learns Madison has been keeping things from her, she does what she think is right to protect their little family...I can't say to much more without letting something slip. I love love loved this book it has the perfect ending for Madison and Kayla and left me wanting to know more about them. Cami, Glenn and Joey are great side characters who love and would do anything for their best friends. Loved we got to see Cami and Glens relationship become stronger. Kayla and Madison are one of my favourite couples they are perfect for each other. Madison made me melt at one stage.I have lived The Raine Series each book starts off with bang and keeps you hooked from start to finish, you won't want to put them down once you start. I'm a big Amanda Bennett fan and can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

$REVIEW.: This is a very interesting book of speculation about Mars based on the evidence. This is a subject I have been interested in all of my life and I was enlightened and excited by the information I read in the book. However, I know that in writing a good review, I will be attacked by trolls who feel the need to sling insults and bizarre accusations at Mr. Bara and anyone who likes his work. I don't think most people  enjoy being insulted and challenged by trolls. I certainly don't. I find that sort of activity sad and disgusting and I am ashamed to say that I took down my good review of Ancient Aliens on the Moon because of troll attacks. There are thousands of books on Amazon that speculate on subjects based on evidence and I have purchased many, yet I have never seen anything close to the slings and arrows aimed at this author. It makes me wonder why they protest so much. Hmmm...just saying.In any event, if you are open to the idea that there may have been intelligent life on Mars, this is the book for you. I read it in one night. Couldn't put it down. You might also like the Cydonia books speculating on Mars and our ancient history by the late, great David Flynn. As for the trolls, I won't be reading nasty comments and biting their hooks this time.
$SUMMARY.: IGNORE THE TROLLS AND BUY THE BOOK!

$REVIEW.: This is a typically excellent book from Osprey, about an airplane I feel has been somewhat neglected by the aviation press in recent years. I have always thought the F-105 Thunderchief was one of the most heroic aircraft the US has ever sent to war, as they suffered terribly in Vietnam (mostly due to awful decisions and doctrine from Washington), but did a great job anyway. And in addition to that, it is one of the most beautiful aircraft ever. Peter Davies does an excellent job of telling the story of the F-105 in Vietnam. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: With only a chapter to go in reading Maria Sutton's The Night Sky, I was very much "on the fence" as to whether her account of the search for her biological father was a good book.  While the book was keeping my interest mainly because of Sutton's writing style, there weren't many differences between Sutton's story and the stories of other adult children who search for a biological parent.  The commonality of her tale was particularly evident when Sutton describes her emotions, like fantasizing about her biological father's personality and the obsessive need to find her missing parent, that are also depicted by many adult children who didn't know their biological parents.  Though the similarities made the book seem unoriginal, Sutton did insert some differences to distinguish her story.  Unfortunately, I thought that many of those changes tended to bog down the story instead of distinguish it.  The most glaring difference which didn't work for me was the manner in which Sutton organized her story.  Because her story spans a few decades, Sutton organized the book around the various clues to her father's identity that she was provided and how she followed up on those clues.  Even though I understood the reason why Sutton organized the book in this manner (because, if she had organized it chronologically, the first half of the book would have been about gathering clues and the second half would have been about following up on those clues), I still found the book's overall flow to be compromised by the story being yanked back and forth in time as Sutton conducted her search.But, at the end of the book, Sutton made one authorial choice that salvaged the book for me.  The choice she made was to dedicate an entire chapter as a reflection on her search.  Written in an almost rustic style that invokes feelings of one neighbor telling news to another neighbor, the last chapter movingly depicts the effect that her search had on her life and the lives of her family.  The final chapter not only serves as a perfect coda for the book, it also serves as a reminder that the journey often teaches as much (if not more) than the destination.There are a lot of books written by an adult who had a parent or parents that weren't part of their lives.  But, the truly inspirational works among that set of books impart a lesson that can be used by those of us who were blessed to have our parents throughout our formative years.  Thanks to the candid introspection Sutton provided at the end of her book, The Night Sky turns out to be one such inspirational work.

There's lots of action from my favorite girl--Infiniti--and the development of the super-sexy Fleet was an excellent twist. The action, as with the first book, is very intense and makes it hard to put this down until the very last page. I love that this has turned into a series about more than a girl facing off with her archvillain. Instead, it plays with the question of what happens when the archvillain is dead, but evil remains ...

$review_text.: Let me start by saying Shameek you did it again. This book was a page turner from beginning to end. Snow I can't believe how his friends turned on him like that. G-Boog and Mel-Murder was foul and they got what they deserved. I just couldn't believe that Snow got locked up for what happened at his house. Goes to show you how defending what's yours can sometimes get you in trouble. I felt bad for what happened to Snow's Wife and Daughter that shouldn't had to go through that cause of someone Else's jealous. Daytona why couldn't he just listen to his Uncle and brother cause they were only telling him from their own experiences. Why did he have to fall in love with a gold digging slut. Some of his friends did him dirty just like his brother Snow friends did him. I really wished that he would of listened before it was to late. Now I'm waiting for part 2 cause the little part that you put in the book to read I can't wait to read it

$review_text.: I am extremely thrilled that I had the opportunity to read your memoir Denise!! Reading this allowed me to get to know you better as a person and I think that's a good thing
I read this in less than 24 hours even with having to work tonight

The words that you poured out into this opened my heart and touched my soul and I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart!! You have inspired me!! Out of it all one important thing that stood out to me about you is when you said you are not brave nor strong but only a human who is surviving, something like that


I can relate to that on my own levels
Even though I have never met you in person I am blessed to have you part of my writers network and I know that you are not only a splendid person but also an amazing woman
It would be an honor to be able to meet you one day
Thank you again for sharing this with the world
I can only imagine how difficult it had to be to write it.JamieLynn Boothe

$review_text.: CN: THIS BOOK AND REVIEW INVOLVE FORCED WEIGHT LOSS, FOOD RESTRICTION, and FAT-SHAMINGI am a sucker for free e-books, so if they sound remotely interesting, I'm probably gonna snatch them up


The premise for Gone - a girl who finds herself in a parallel universe where the government strictly enforces what citizens weigh and eat - had potential, but the story just didn't deliver


Not a *bad* book, just one I found unremarkable


I also didn't think the body-policing aspects were explored well enough to really make any strong point about the glorification of a thin body type as ideal

Add to that the fact that it's undeniably the first act of an inseparable trilogy, and I'd have to say give it a pass.If you really like alternate universes and high-school girl protagonists, or really want to watch a gal who &#34;could lose a couple pounds, but totally isn't, like, FAT fat, gosh!&#34; try to deal with a society that enforces body size (but mostly a new school, the snooty Queen Bee, and a totallyhotguy crush), go for it.

Aleks is struggling to move forward with the death of his mentor and Izzy is also struggling with the guilt that she feels about the suicide of her sister. Both characters pull you in from the very first time that you meet them. One of my favorite scenes from this book is when Izzy is getting drenched, I felt as if I was there with her. Another scene that I liked was when Aleks ties Izzy up, boy was that hot!!!

$REVIEW.: I was expecting an amazing thriller.  True, there was action and mystery and murder but the way it was written left me disillusioned. The plot itself was okay but the main character kept referring to her past, which was never clearly explained.  Why were she and her sister on the run?  Who is their father?  It was a bit slow for me and the characters didn't have as much depth as I would have liked.  It seemed as if there should have been a prequel to this.

Her brother loves her so much, willing to go to any lengths to protect her and keep her safe, it's beautiful. You rarely see that kind of sibling affection very often.All it was lacking was her love interest, which will come out in the next book, which will be coming out... when? Please hurry with it.

$REVIEW.: Anyone who is a parent with a child that has begged, hollered, and begged some more for a pet will enjoy Crash and Marcelo, the little boy who gets his wish

The glee and joy in his cute little face is described vividly by author Mayra Calvani.Reading Crash, a child and a parent discover the responsibilities that come with owning a pet

Marcelo also discovers that naming his new family member is not as easy as he thought

Many ideas come to his head, none really fitting in with the cute Golden Retriever.The name he finally picks surprises his parents


But as you read, you realize this is the PERFECT name..





This is a great book to buy for your child, you know, the one who is begging and hollering and begging some more for a pet

It will teach and prepare them for the responsibilities surely to come when a pet finally comes gift-wrapped."(Review first appeared in Muse Book Reviews.)NOTE: Author is donating 50% of royalties to Almost Heaven Golden Retriever Rescue and Sanctuary, a non-profit organization.Armchair Interviews says: Nice way to help children learn about responsibilities

$review_text.: My experience in college has taught me that Reye's situation is more common than we think. Not sure about the race part but the friends with benefits who hope to become more thing. I could totally identify with Reye. Even though they'd laid out the terms beforehand, you can't control where your feelings will lead. Stephen saw what was happening, knew he wouldn't go any further with Reye but still kept spending all of his time at her place nurturing her feelings and making matters worse. For that I really didn't like Stephen and was actually rooting for Joe to move in and show him how he should be treating Reye.Joe started off as a jerk but I like the way the author explains the way that he came to his racial hang-ups and Stephen's mom as well. Joe is MUCH MORE LIKEABLE THAN STEPHEN because he works hard, takes care of his nephew and is upfront about his B.S. Stephen's just a spoiled rich brat who is used to getting what he wants and never considers what it must be like for anyone other than himself.I also found it strange that there were no positive female relationships for Reye in this book. Sure she had her mentor but the only conversations are with her brother & father. Her mother isn't much the picture unless Reye's discussing what she's taught her or her rules.I liked the book. The only thing I didn't like was Stephen.

The language in the Duke Demon was way to foul, every other word was the f bomb.  This author should  be writing for  Hustler or Penthouse, or open her own sex phone business.  Seriously, all the pages she wasted on porn could have been spent on developing stronger story lines and characters.  Very off putting and needless.  This author also needs a proofreader!!!!  So many better books and authors out there, don't waste your time on this one!!

$review_text.: I first became aware of author Shey Stahl through her Racing on the Edge series


 Her writing hooked me and I loved the characters and stories about their lives she shared

 However, just because I liked one book or series from an author does not guarantee that I will like everything they put out there
 But, no worries, Shey has still got it and keeps getting better.This book was a new direction for me since I was accustomed to the Racing on the Edge books, but I certainly wasn't disappointed with Waiting For You

 The main characters in this story are young (18) but I still connected to them deeply despite my not having seen my teens in a couple of years (ha!).Bailey Gray is a recent high school graduate who has been controlled by her parents

 They were up in her business about everything: who she dated, who she was friends with, what she ate

 Everything!  And they are unrelenting.Dylan Wade is the rebel, bad boy who is complex and misunderstood

 On their journey, Dylan and Bailey reconnect the friendship they had as children and rebuild the connection that tied them together through the years

 Over the miles traveled and distance from home, Bailey learns who she is and what she wants

 She learns to trust herself and make decisions for herself


 Memories are made and Dylan is right beside Bailey as she goes through this journey of discovery.Here's what I liked or really liked:  the characters

 The author knows how to create interesting characters that you can connect with regardless of their age, experience, or their story

 I was instantly pulled into this story and stayed glued to it from beginning to end


 I like that the characters weren't just a story but had a story and I wanted to know it and it needed to be told


 The writing made me feel connected and feel the story emotionally

 I also loved the link to the Racing on the Edge series within Waiting For You

 This was a unique, interesting and fun way to bring the stories together and it was done fantastically

 I thought to myself that this really showed me that the author lives and breathes her characters


 I loved this and even if you haven't read the other books, you can still appreciate the way this was done and not feel misplaced


 While reading this story I thought to myself that I was actually learning something


 Dylan and Bailey's "story" had something to teach me and those lessons will stay with me
 That was a beautiful part of the story to be able to feel a connection, have an interesting, enjoyable read that is emotionally engaging and to leave with something new learned

 Wow


 I hope each person that reads this book can get a little something from the story

 I will forever think of making memories in a new way.All this being said, I need to mention that I felt the ending climax was a wee bit rushed
 Also, to be fair, I felt the book needed some editing work to smooth it out
 Although I don't think in this case it caused a distraction for me

 However, I liked the way this story ended


 It ended true to the characters and the way it needed to be


 It was their deal


 I look forward to more from this author

 Give it a try!!  4.0-4.5~Stars

$review_text.: The ex-wife of a successful attorney, wife of a real estate tycoon and mother of a teenage son, Nikki Johnson has her hands full with life.  Just when she doesn't think she can juggle anything else, life has a way of throwing more things at her.  Can Nikki meet the new challenges?"Darling Nikki" got me from page one.  E.V. Adams skillfully pulled readers into her imagination and Nikki's world.  You couldn't help turning the pages to see what would happen next and how things would eventually play out.  Entertaining and with a brisk pace, I really enjoyed "Darling Nikki" up to a certain point.  As the book neared its end, the story seemed to have gotten away from the author.  The care and detail given to the first part of the book was no longer there. The conclusion seemed somewhat rushed and less thought out.  I got where the author was going, but I would have preferred a better execution with the same care and detail for the concluding chapters, resulting in a smoother read.  It's that feeling that I got toward the end of the book that brought down my overall feel for the entire book.Also, I'm not sure what was going on with the title.  I expected a little more on the Prince tip or that Nikki would be like the Nikki described in the song and I didn't get that from this book.All in all, "Darling Nikki" is a pretty good read.  I just didn't care for the ending, not the choice of an ending but the execution of the ending.  I look forward to Adams' next release.***Side note*** The synopsis gave away WAY too much information.  I learned from previous experience with Strebor not to read the synopsis before starting this book.  And I'm glad that I didn't until I completed the novel.  Note to Strebor: A synopsis should pique one's interest so they'll want to read the book, not tell the whole story.

So I decided to continue.While the first part of the story is shocking, it does get better


Well, it doesn't have as much of the shocking factor I read in the beginning


This story tells the tale of two lost souls, William and Jessica, coming together when they needed each other the most


They use each other, unbeknownst to one another, to help them overcome their past and present struggles

There is sadness through out the book, a lot of it, though with the hope of surviving.I have to say that while the story is bleak and dark at times, it didn't tug at me like other stories would


With the exception of the beginning
I'm not sure why though I think it was because the story was just so real that I can't even begin to think about what the characters went through on real terms


It was probably a defense/survival mechanism in me where I decided to separate myself from the characters so as to not feel their anguish and pain
I know that the things the main characters went through happen every single day and it is very real.I do have to say that this story is certainly not for the faint of heart

It is shocking and will make you angry but it will also make you want to root for the characters so that they come out surviving.Do I recommend this story? Hard for me to say simply because of what the story is about


It is a good one though I know it's not for everyone
So, if you can read about atrocities committed to the innocent and are not easily offended by such acts, then yes I do recommend because in the end there is hope


However, if you can't but decide to still read, don't say you weren't warned.

$review_text.: Troy Blackford is quickly becoming one of my favorite young writers. His quirky take on established genres reminds me of when I first discovered Tom Robbins - his novellas are fresh, exciting, quirky, and always fun to read.Booster and Reeves, as previous reviewers have stated, is a horror twist on PG Wodehouse. Yet, if you are not familiar with Wodehouse, Blackford sets up his characters so you are never in doubt to their personalities and motivations.This novella is highly recommended. But don't think all of Blackford's writing is the same. Every piece I've read has a completely different tone, but still retains his unique outlook of life and character development.

$REVIEW.: I can't give the content of this book ENOUGH stars!  The &quot;Guide&quot; is divided into three parts: Home, School, and Work.  The  &quot;at Work&quot; section is a complete reprint of one of Hartmann's  prior books, &quot;Focus Your Energy: Hunting for Success in Business with  Attention Deficit Disorder,&quot; with a few updates and corrections and  additions (nothing taken out).I am the founder &amp; CEO of The Optimal  Functioning Institute&trade;, which trains ADD Coaches in a comprehensive 2-year  training; &quot;Focus&quot; has been one of five ADD books that are  REQUIRED reading for my students since 1994. I mourned the fact that it was  taken out of print.  Even though my students could still get it through a  special agreement with the author, I rejoice that it is back so that  everyone can read it.  The &quot;Guide&quot; has now replaced  &quot;Focus&quot; on our required reading list.Hartmann is  knowledgeable, imminently readable, and never pathologizes ADD.  His use of  the &quot;hunter/farmer&quot; metaphor to differentiate the ADD brain  wiring from non-ADD, allows those of us with that kind of brain to focus on  what is GOOD about us rather than trying to &quot;fix&quot; what's  &quot;bad.&quot;I have always recommended FOCUS as a &quot;first  read&quot; for certain individuals, and will now recommend the Guide in its  stead.  In my experience with thousands of ADDers, entrepreneurs, people  who are fearful of &quot;labels&quot; yet searching for help, those who  have been prescribed medication but no practical help to support them, and  those who have read the sensationalist press primarily and are looking at  ADD with a jaundiced eye as a result, have all responded positively to  FOCUS.  Because Hartmann writes so clearly and economically, it has always  been my choice for ADDers who have trouble reading because they just can't  concentrate long enough to get through a paragraph, much less a book.This is a &quot;feel good&quot; book -- buy it and read it for the  afterglow as much as the information.Sincerely, Madelyn Griffith-Haynie,  CTP, A.C.T., MCC The Optimal Functioning Institute&trade;  founder &amp; CEO

$REVIEW.: I didn't want to like this book, but we don't always get what we want.Honestly given the name of the series I would never have read this book. I have no desire to read the other "50 Shades ..." books or any other copycat books that are trying to capitalize on the similar sounding name. In fact that is one of only two problems I have with this series of books. The other is that the author uses way too many parenthesis (to tell the reader inside jokes) &lt;-- like that. If you get past these two limitations, you will be thoroughly entertained.The book is about the misadventures of a guy who accidentally finds a cure for the zombie plague and tries to spread the word. It's funny and sophomoric, but in that good way. Each book in the series is only a few chapters long. I think they were originally released in a serial format and the story flows nearly seamlessly from one book to the next. Some people say things like "I couldn't put it down!"; well I could totally put it down, but I always wanted to pick it back up again. It is lighthearted and doesn't take itself seriously at all.If you have got the time, check it out.

$REVIEW.: FULL DISCLOSURE: I did not read the entire synopsis before I started reading Flat-Out Matt by Jessica Park.  Honestly, I saw the words &#34;Flat-Out Matt&#34; and &#34;Matt's perspective&#34; and I snapped this novella up from Amazon.com in five seconds flat.  Therefore, I was slightly disappointed that this novella didn't flow like a typical story.  That said, it was partly my fault for not reading the full synopsis because the synopsis specifically states that Flat-Out Matt includes &#34;two prequel chapters and seven Flat-Out Love chapters retold from his perspective, and a brand-new steamy finale chapter from Julie.&#34;  For those of you who haven't read this novella or the full synopsis for this novella yet, then I can go ahead and fill you in...Flat-Out Matt by Jessica Park is a hilarious novella told from Matt's perspectives.  It's extremely enjoyable and entertaining, but it doesn't flow like a typical story.  There are a few chapters with Matt and Finn, there are a few chapters from Flat-Out Love,and there is a bonus chapter at the end.  It's just like the synopsis states.&#34;Happy New Year, Matty.&#34;  It was quiet.  &#34;Matty, I have another question for you.&#34;&#34;Un-oh.&#34;&#34;Are you a skilled lover?&#34;  The seriousness of her tone was beyond words.&#34;And that concludes our evening chat.&#34;&#34;I bet I could be a skilled lover.  I'm very energetic.  And a quick learner.&#34;I gave Flat-Out Matt (Flat-Out Love #1.5) by Jessica Park 4 STARS (3.5 STARS).  I greatly enjoyed the first novel in this series, Flat-Out Love and I also enjoyed this bonus novella!  I strongly recommend both the novel and the novella to everyone!

$review_text.: A great short (too short) story from Kelley's Otherworld. I have to say that I was disappointed in the cover and interior artwork and much preferred the design of &#34;Hidden&#34;...but I'll take anything about Elena and Clay as they are my 2 favourite characters.I like the dynamic and the love between them both, and that Clay is happy to let Elena take the lead as Alpha-in-waiting. He's got her back (and who else would she want?) They make a good team. While Clay may be uber intelligent, he's not great on the &#34;human&#34; interpersonal level (which I've always loved about him). He's unapolegetically more a werewolf than a human on most levels. He's more the muscle of the team. While Elena has the strength, senses and instincts of a werewolf too, she's more able to handle the &#34;human&#34; level of their existence, at least on a &#34;human to human&#34; level.The story itself was good and interesting. Mind you I've never seen an &#34;Otherworld&#34; story that wasn't. Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: As I said in the title, this book is NOT for adults. Silly me, I obviously didnt read enough previous reviews! This book is written for tikes, not even tweens. The only reason it got 2 stars is that the writing itself is decent. That said, the characters, their motivation and the general story line is beyond SIMPLE. The author also has no idea how to write fight scenes - such as what happens when a human being is thrown into a tree, what a dagger can easily penetrate, hand-to-hand fighting and the list goes on. To compound these flaws, the first half of the book is straight out of a blend of standard fairy tales. Seems to be written for a parent to read to a child. So unless you're buying it to read to your six year old, don't bother.

My children have grown and moved on starting families of their own, but with the shifting economy it seems crazy to pay rent while my children are paying a mortgage. We have had discussions recently on the issue of my living in an in-law suite in one of their homes. Instead of paying rent to a near-stranger I could be helping them with their mortgage and would be closer to my grand children.This book has everything we need to know to convert a space just for that purpose, from the construction to the legalities. In addition, while many books lack the pictures to truly envision the spaces discussed, this book is filled from front to back with beautiful pictures of spaces anyone would love to live in.

$REVIEW.: Some books stay with you long after the last page. This is one of them. I finished the book in one sitting, sighing and clutching my e-reader with joy. This story is an awakening and I fell in love with it on the first page. Rose is an unhappy woman, trapped in a life with an abusive man she hates. When she by chance meets the enigmatic Eve at a party, she knows her life will never be the same. Hunger like she has never known stirs her blood and she feels alive. Eve is captivating and the contrast between the fragile Rose and the more worldly and evocative Eve is breathtaking. It is sweet, beautifully written and has haunted my dreams ever since.Author Beatrice Donahue has ensnared my heart with this thoughtfully written tale. The words are like a finely wrought tapestry full of beauty, sadness and hope for the future in a time that made it difficult for a woman to stand up to abuse and truly live. Erotic, beautiful and luminous as a pearl, this short novelette is one I will return to again and again for a touch of blue and the brush of a rose petal on the skin. Many are being struck by the 1920's and the Gatsby craze. This is one you won't want to miss.5/5

$REVIEW.: Alan Clark's latest book is a spellbinding work that held my interest from start to finish


A Parliament of Crows shows the reader how madness can turn peoples' lives into living nightmares


Clark captures the essence of a true story of dysfunctional sisters and their struggle to survive in post-Civil War times, when women were not valued for their intelligence or abilities
These women were willing to do whatever it took to survive

He asks and answers the question of just how far people might be willing to go to protect their family

The things that happen to them seem so unfair that you may ask yourself if the ends justifies the means in this case.

Sound like a lot?&#8220;Jumping Ship&#8221; was a very short read and the author tried to cram too much into this story. It should&#8217;ve been longer so that it wouldn&#8217;t have been as confusing. I had to read back several times to make sure I understood what was going on.Ross started with somewhat of a prologue that was a sensory overload.  Writing a bunch of beautiful sentences did not make a big impact in such a short story. The time spent crafting sentences could&#8217;ve been spent giving more story.  The bulk of the story, which focused on Petrina, wasn&#8217;t so bad but it was written in a totally different style than the prologue. While the prologue was romantically descriptive, the beginning and middle was more straightforward and pointed.  The end seemed to take on another writing style that was more like a research paper and these styles just didn&#8217;t mesh well.Reviewed by: Trenika

$REVIEW.: If you love books written in the 60's, this one won't disappoint.  Emily is a divorced woman, pining for her husband who left her.  For those who lived in the late 60's, you will relate (pushing aside the hippie mentality that was also prevalent) to the fact that relationships were to be cherished and held onto, not pushed aside for something "better" like in our present culture.  You'll also enjoy the references to 60's salaries, decorating, etc.  Well written, and definitely brings back a "feel" for an era long gone.

$REVIEW.: This second book is yet to convince me about the plot of this series. This is still a lot of 'girl's time', dress fittings, and frivolous dross. As cute and lovely as Lillie and Aidan are, they remain weak characters. Aidan is portrayed as a man driven purely by his emotions. I don't know, this book fell flat for me.

$REVIEW.: "Funny thing about ice. When light hits it, God, how it shines."I'm going to start by getting a little business out of the way. Yes, I loved Sun-Kissed. Yes, I think you should read it. You being, all of you, because this story is gorgeous and brilliant and I loved everything about it. I will also say that Laura Florand is so enormously talented that I'm beginning to run out of new ways to praise her!I was surprised when Laura Florand shared a bit of Sun-Kissed a few months ago. I loved it, but was still surprised about the story because of the lead characters. Mack Corey is the father of Cade and Jamie of the Amour et Chocolat series. I've always liked Mack, despite him being a bit (or a lot) overbearing. As for Anne Winters, well, based on her description in Snow-Kissed, she didn't seem exactly like the heroine type. Honestly, the fact that the main characters are so different-surprising- is a big part of the beauty in Sun-Kissed. We have these two characters who aren't exactly gentle and easy to like, and they have such a emotionally powerful story to tell. It was a story of a friendship that has weathered his wife's death, the raising of children, a short term in prison for one.  It's a slow-building relationship built on trust and mutual appreciation. And really, isn't that sort of trust and affection the most perfect foundation for a life-changing relationship?When Sun-Kissed begins, it's immediately clear that Mack's feelings for Anne go beyond friendship. She's owned a starring role in his dreams for years. He's in love with her. The question becomes, will he finally act on those feelings, and will Anne reciprocate? The battle of wills was amazing. And funny! The almost angry  passion between them was eye-opening. You would think neither Mack nor Anne knows how to give, to be weak and allow needing someone. It does come easier for Mack, he's never hardened his heart to the world as fully as Anne. I was surprised how quickly Anne allowed Mack in, though it was extremely hard for her. But knowing Mack Corey, I should never be surprised..Snow-Kissed was one of the most beautiful, heart-breaking stories I've ever read. I was sure that Sun-Kissed would never affect me on quite that level. And though it have that same level of... hurt, it did affect me deeply. I'm not even kidding, I was crying by page five. Sun-Kissed is a powerful story. Mack's bittersweet emotions at his daughter's wedding, missing his wife, letting his daughters go, the quiet longing for Anne. Anne's long-held pain in longing for another child, knowing she didn't always love her son in the way he needed, happiness in seeing Kurt happy once again. And, Anne and Mack's devotion to one another, their passion, their recognition that they could be so very happy together.With the way I've just described this story, you would think it was at least four hundred pages long. Sun-Kissed is a little over two hundred pages of pure perfection. Florand has a gift for taking life's big and small moments, and wrenching every single, teeny-tiny bit of emotion out of them. Sun-Kissed made me cry. Yes, there were very, very sad moments. And bittersweet. And very, very funny moments too! But when I got the tears in my eyes and a knot in my throat, it was mostly because Sun-Kissed was so beautiful, I could hardly stand it.Fans of both the Amour et Chocolat series and Snow-Kissed will love Sun-Kissed. All leading couples of Amour et Chocolat are present and bring such humor and love to the story. Fans of Snow-Kissed should consider this a must-read, especially considering Kurt and Kai are very much a part of the story.I will never be able to fully put my affection and appreciation for Laura Florand's work into words. Just, trust me when I say Sun-Kissed is undoubtedly worth your time.Favorite QuotesWonder washed through her. She couldn't help it--she rubbed her temple against his fingertips."You're so pretty," he said incredulously. "Oh, my God, you're pretty, in the moonlight, with your lashes lowering just like that. S***, Anne." His hand curved under her jaw, big and warm against her fine bones, and kept her face up so he could enjoy it. "It's like I've captured a star-queen.""You have to learn it new, with each new person, if you want to do it right. You're the first you I've ever kissed." She smiled a little into his chest. "We're like a snowflake." She could whisper that fancy into this moonlit, ocean-washed night. "No two pairs of lips meet the same."

$review_text.: As a family of 6, I&#8217;ve noticed that we have accumulated more than our fair share of clutter. I wouldn&#8217;t call Hoarders just yet but why do I still find baby clothes around the house when our youngest is 5? It&#8217;s time for a change. I got this book because a friend of mine has a very successful time with living a minimalist lifestyle with her family and I wanted to see if it was a possibility with mine. This book gets you on the right track. The first step is getting rid of all the junk! You can&#8217;t clean clutter. If you don&#8217;t love it, get rid of it. We started the kids out on a challenge. Get rid of one item of clothing and one toy a day until you&#8217;re down to what you love. They could pass it down to a younger sibling but that sibling then had to get rid of two things. Then we donated them to a local charity service as long as it was in good repair and condition. It makes a huge difference in just a few days. I love the tips in this book. I can&#8217;t wait to see the bigger picture when we&#8217;re finally done!

$review_text.: If you are new to the Lords of Deliverance Series, I suggest you do not begin here.  I strongly recommend you read the series in order (Eternal Rider and Immortal Rider) prior to reading this novella.This is a fabulous prequel.  The story was very short but also very sweet.  While I was a bit disappointed that the novella wasn't a bit longer, the story itself was solid.  The anterior section of the book was very informative.  Anything you've always wanted to know, or anything you've always wanted clarified for this series, the Demonica series  or the "Demonica World" in general is breakdown and explained in great detail.This shorty story was well done and despite the length, felt complete and all around perfect tease.  My motivation and love for this fabulous series has been rekindled after reading this novella.I strongly recommend this novella and series to fellow dark urban fantasy readers and I can't wait to read the next book in the series Lethal Rider due out  6/22/12.I also recommend:Father Mine: Zsadist and Bella's Story: A Black Dagger Brotherhood NovellaViolet TendenciesEtched in Silver: An Otherworld Novella(An eSpecial from Berkley)Succubus BluesFirst Drop of Crimson (Night Huntress World, Book 1)

$REVIEW.: I appreciated the opportunity to review Faithful. It was a true-to-life story of a single 40-year-old Christian woman whose life isn't going at all the way she expected. To add to her confusion, her friends and sister are having problems of their own, but with different issues. It wasn't my favorite genre of fiction, but I appreciated the reminder that God is always there for us, working in ways we can't always see. I received a review copy of this book from Thomas Nelson.

Gillian keeps a devastating secret regarding her sister from long ago when they were children.  To get away from England to start a new life she must try and seduce a handsome american into marrying her.  What she didn't bargain for however, was the handsome rake Alexander entering her life and distracting her from her mission.  He is totally wrong for her and has no interest in marrying anytime soon - but how do they resist one another?  This is a page turner and a very good book.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this author and this series was another hit! The whole trilogy was fantastic, exciting and brilliant. The story was about love, hope, faith and the classic case of Good vs. Evil. Though the main characters endure heartache both physical and emotional the story itself was written beautifully over the three books and the third installment was definitely a Wonderful Ending! I mean I'm still so happy just thinking about it but I won't spoil it for others, but I will say just believe in the prophecy ;). After finishing this book know these books are definitely worth the time and money to read and dwell on. I mean I was on the verge of tears at one point, but that's when I know the author has gotten me emotionally invested in characters and their plight in the story, or else I wouldn't care so much. So all that to say (or write), great series and amazing trilogy ending. Keep them coming Melissa Pearl!!

$review_text.: "The Essential Hal Clement, Volume 2: Music of Many Spheres" is the second in a three volume set which introduces a new generation of readers to Hal Clement's unique style.  Hal Clement is the pseudonym of Harry C. Stubbs a scientist who first used this pseudonym because he didn't want his professor to think he was wasting his time; later he found out that the same professor was also writing science fiction stories, although with less success.  Clement's stories are hard science fiction, using the science of the day to create futuristic stories involving mystery or problem solving.This volume was published in 2000, and features a nice selection of his short fiction.  This collection includes his first story, "Proof", which was first published in "Astounding Science Fiction" in June of 1942.  It also includes his four Laird Cunningham stories, and 12 other stories spanning his career.  There doesn't seem to be any organization to this particular collection.  The stories are not put in chronological order, or even alphabetically.  While the Laird Cunningham stories are grouped together at the end of the collection, even those are not put into any kind of logical order.Despite the lack of organization, this is still an enjoyable collection of stories.  Some of these stories have become out-of-date as a result of scientific learning, but thanks to Clement's storytelling ability, the reader is still entertained.  In 1996, "Uncommon Sense" was awarded the Retro Hugo for best Short Story written in 1945, which is a testament to Clement's ability to craft a story that stands the test of time.

wrapped up, updated and expanded and with new material


It's an indispensable guide for Catholics both in terms of apologetics and for responding to those who are even further outside of the Christian faith

5-stars even though some of the chapters have repetitive explanations (it is, I assume, made up of Catholic Answers tracts, so that's to be expected I suppose).

$REVIEW.: This book is a good overview of some basic health issues and some simple changes you can make to improve your health and quality of life
 It was interesting reading.Healthy eating is not necessarily what most of us think it is

Many attempts to eat clean or eat healthy end up doing more harm than good.When I hear someone I know talking about dieting, I cringe at the things they are planning to do to their bodies


 Usually they are depriving themselves of things their bodies need to function properly, and I know they will end up in worse shape than they started
 I wrecked my already fragile metabolism in an effort to improve my health, and a year after returning to &#34;normal&#34; eating I am still trying to recover
 I am getting better and with what I learned from this book I expect things will improve even more

 I hope this book will help many others improve their health, not through unsustainable diets or rigid eating and exercise habits, but through common-sense, easy to follow and understand guidelines.The authors do not try to guilt you into eating nasty things or buying expensive supplements

 I think the ideas in this book are easy to implement and follow through

 I appreciate the call for moderation

 Figure out what works for you in your lifestyle and means, and do that.One reviewer said &#34;Maybe it (sugar) doesn't cause huge insulin and blood sugar issues, but it sure seems like it to me when I eat it


 If he is correct, show me/explain to me/give me some proof and better scientific understanding of why and how.&#34;I thought the book did explain this

 Our bodies take time to adjust to dietary changes.

$review_text.: Loved Loved Loved this!I have a very love/hate relationship with love triangle books. I loved the likes of Thoughtless but had a real hard time getting through From Ashes. I've come to the realization that my issue is with the characters in said books, not the love triangle aspect itself. If I'm reading about young, teen girls in a love triangle then I find myself wanting to strangle and kill them. If they are adult characters, in adult situations then I find that I can deal with it much better. Thankfully The Mourning After was about adult characters in established relationships and I felt that the heroine was truly torn over what to do for the best.Georgia has been with her current boyfriend, Kyle, a LONG TIME. I'm talking childhood friends to lovers long time, but lately their relationship has been strained. Kyle is working towards a promotion at the law firm where he works and his head is constantly stuck in a book or at an office, leaving Georgia alone 90% of the time. Instead of working through the issue together, Georgia ends up buying a house on the beach 300 miles away and decides to spend the summer there with her best friends.I adored Georgia's best friends. Originally it was supposed to be her gay best friend, Silas and her other friend Drew. There wasn't one thing I could dislike about these two friends, they are the sort that every body should have in their life. As usual though, plans aren't always stuck to and Drew ends up not only inviting her latest boyfriend, but his friend Tristan too. And this is where all the fun starts."I knew he was trouble wrapped up in a sexy, charming, seductive package."From the off I was a massive fan of Tristan's and knew for sure that if Georgia didn't end up with him then I was going to have a fit. He was absolutely everything you could wish for in a book boyfriend (maybe not an actual boyfriend so much though..). He was gorgeous, a mahoosive flirt and knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to women. The only problem? He is a huge manwh0re. He isn't one for settling down and he sure as hell isn't afraid to show you that.The relationship between Georgia and Tristan didn't start up instantly and I have to give the author credit for not making Georgia like some easy girl who just jumps in to bed with a new man straight away. Georgia was very much aware of the fact she had a boyfriend who she loved but at the same time, she knew that their relationship hadn't been right for a long time. Of course though, Tristan wanted Georgia and he was going to do everything in his power to get her."If you're not ready I won't force you. But I'm going to spend the entire summer helping you come to the realization that you want me too."I whizzed through reading this and ended up reading the last 40% or so in one big chunk because I just couldn't put it down. I needed to know that, despite her reservations, Georgia was going to make the right decision not only for the two men in her life, but for herself. She's lived through an awful time in her past and is so used to thinking of others and thanking others for getting her through it that she ends up forgetting about herself. I hoped she would make the decision that made her happy for once.The last 20% had my stomach in knots. I could never truly tell which way the author was going to go. Would she stay with Kyle because she felt like she owed him for all he has helped her with in the past? Or would she follow what her heart really wants and go with Tristan because he finally makes her feel alive? I had no clue. One minute I thought one thing, the next I'd had a complete 180 and thought the other. Even though it had me feeling all sorts of crazy, the author did a great job of keeping you on your toes."If you let go of the past - let go of the pain - if you followed your heart, you may find something beautiful."If you are a fan of a love triangle with more mature characters then I would say this one is for you. I was comparing it to Thoughtless a lot of the time and can honestly say Georgia is in no way as annoying as Keira. I really felt her pain and her reasons for being so unsure were valid. I loved every minute."I want you, all of you, Georgia. And I want you to want me too. I know you're with him, but he's not here. He's not with you, not really. And I am."

We conduct a support group at the local county jail based on this incredible book, "Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul"
In our group, inmates take turns reading the stories out loud and many times we have to pass the tissues around
These true life stories open all of our hearts as they help us to realize our connection with one another
One man read a story about a Dad and his son and when he was finished he began to cry openly

He shared that he knew he needed to talk to his Dad and that he was so ashamed

Another woman cried as she read the words of a poem, "I'm scared, alone and stuck in this place." These are stories that touch the Souls of those incarcerated since they are so very real and personal
The inmates cherish these books and treat their copies like a treasure

Our second recommendation for everyone is to not only read this book but to buy another copy and ask that it be sent to your local prison library! Thank you Tom Lagana, for authoring this much needed book!

$review_text.: I picked this book up because it just sounded so fascinating.  I mean, can you imagine a life without money?  It's pretty hard for me to do so I just had to read about someone who had done it.  I was curious about how he made it work and why he chose that lifestyle.  Plus I'd heard of a book by a German woman named Heidemarie Schwermer who did something similar, but I don't think her book is available in English.Anyway, I started reading and was really surprised to find this book had way more depth than I'd anticipated.  I thought it'd basically tell about Suelo, why he decided to live without money, and then give a lot of examples about how he manages his lifestyle.Instead the book goes into his background growing up in a fundamentalist religious family and his search for meaning in his life.  His decision to live without money didn't happen overnight as he traveled, studied, and looked for different solutions to the world's problems.The book also discusses the role money plays in our lives and how the system of money came about, as well as its flaws.  There are also examples of other people who are choosing to remove themselves from the "system" and use bartering, for example, instead of money.Suelo is able to survive most of the time on things people throw away and it really hit me just how wasteful most people in the United States are and how greed is corrupting us and our planet.  According to the book, we throw away 40% of our food yet others are starving in other parts of the world.Based on some of his own observations and experiences, Suelo came to understand that "the more people have, the less they give."  He also observed that money causes anxiety and many people are wasting their lives and feel miserable just to attain money to buy things they don't need.Overall I found the book very interesting and eye-opening.  The author explored some complex topics like economics and religion but did so in a very easy to understand way. I think Suelo is definitely searching for some answers and living without money has brought him peace.  While this might not be the answer for everyone, it's still a great book that can make you consider your own perspective, how you might be contributing to the problem, and ways you can change your actions to make the world a better place.

A mystery about low-level prescription drug trafficking in the US pharmaceutical industry that involves a ghost. What a great protagonist Olivia Sacks is! Head Case had me chuckling out loud, but also was emotional at times.  Nuff said.  Read it yourself!

$review_text.: Have I mentioned how much I love this whole series? Just when you think you have it all figured out with this series you learn a new piece of information and your back at square one trying to put it all together. I still don't trust Riley, maybe her motives are good, but I just can't help but feel like she is just plotting against Jess. Nick knows way more than he is letting on Nick has redeemed himself a little in my eyes and even given the proverbial olive branch. He has taken away the cameras and also given Jess a little information about his background. Mr. Morris is a great business man. I have a hard time thinking that he does not know all that happens at his business and so Nick telling Jess not to reveal anything about the &#34;eye candy&#34; department is really futile. I also think he will be a force to be reckoned with in the end. Jess and Dylan still have that great chemistry and of course there are some scorching hot sex scenes to entice you with. Dylan admits that he is falling for Jess and Jess even despite being pushed by Nick to break up with Dylan, professes her love for him. She has a hard time believe that there will be room for her in Dylan's new life no matter how much he tries to convince her otherwise.I can't express enough how much I love this series and how sad I will be to see it come to a close in the next book. I have been kept on the edge of my seat for so long I will admit to being very excited to see how it all pans out and if any of my predictions are correct. I look forward to reading more Of J.J. Knight's books after this series is over she will be added to my list of go to authors. Read and enjoy*I was given and ARC of Revenge #4 in exchange for an honest review.*

$REVIEW.: OverviewThis book is a combination of personal anecdotes and argument by the author in favor of what he calls &#34;a lifestyle of generosity.&#34; Formsma writes in a pleasant, conversational style and has a lot of natural warmth, so the juxtaposition of story and persuasion feels seamless and organic.Formsma finds fulfillment in looking for ways to be generous (not just financially, but with his time and other resources) and has turned that into a full-time job/ministry

 He discusses the difference between guilt motivated giving and giving based on a sincere desire to do something nice
He also points out that &#34;giving&#34; is not just something we can do with our money


One of the book's main selling points was &#34;practical tips,&#34; but practicality is really not this book's strong suit.The book is a pleasant afternoon read, and a good reminder for those of us who tend to get caught up in the daily grind


It also may be a good source of encouragement for those who feel that they have little to offer in the way of resources they can use to benefit other people
The practical section of the book really focuses more on &#34;how to give with your finances without embarrassing anyone,&#34; and readers who have the financial resources to give that way may find it helpful.WaterBrook Multnomah publishes Christian books, and this book does talk openly about God


It doesn't feel like a sermon, a religious tract, or a book that only members of the &#34;Jesus club&#34; will be able to relate to
 If you are interested in broadening your perspective on generosity and finding ways to give in your life, I would give the book a go.What I Liked&#8226; Each anecdote is relatively short, so the sections aren't overwhelming

It's easy to find a stopping place and pick up again later.&#8226; The anecdotes are diverse

Not all of them turned out well, and there are several from the POV of people who had been on the receiving end of generous gifts from others


 So, there's more to the book than the element of &#34;giving to make ourselves feel good.&#34;&#8226; The book makes an effort to include giving that isn't centered around money and finances.What I Didn't Like&#8226; Repeated in-text links and encouragement to submit &#34;Giving Stories&#34; to the author's website

I'm not sure the idea of a website for collecting &#34;I did a good deed&#34; anecdotes is really in keeping with Jesus' instruction to do our giving in secret


 The author does make the point that we need to give out of sincere motives and not to make ourselves look good, but saying that doesn't negate the disparity between constant references to God and an archive for personal generosity anecdotes.&#8226; The topics I was most interested in (practical tips and ways to involve children in giving without forcing them to participate) were the least developed.&#8226; God is treated like a genie or a vending machine
This is a common thing with a lot of the Christian nonfiction I've read

 The attitude seems to be that you ask God for what you want (in this case, &#34;please give me an opportunity to do something nice today&#34;) and then you wait around for the Holy Spirit to do something or tell you what to do
There's also a pre-fabricated  prayer in the text that you're supposed to pray

 My prayer life is pretty casual, and I do ask God to show me ways to give or do nice things
I don't treat that like a daily ritual
 I have experienced what I call &#34;God moments&#34; when I know I need to do something but can't put my finger on why, but I also think it's important to be observant, think critically, and cultivate my talents and skills in God's service
 I also know that it's important to use discernment and ask for guidance when I'm not sure
 In general, though, I think God has given me enough innate intelligence to find small ways to serve without having to be led around by the nose
 The idea that we need to be &#34;nudged&#34; by the Holy Spirit in every little interaction is just silly


 Intelligence may not be listed as a gift of the Spirit in the Bible, but it IS a gift from God that we can use to decide whether we should take ten minutes to carry someone's groceries for them.The Bottom LineRead this book if you're looking for a pleasant diversion or some general encouragement


If you're looking for real guidance and practical help for cultivating generosity in your life, look elsewhere.I'm on the lookout for more practical books on this topic
 Do you have any recommendations?Disclaimer: I received a free e-book copy of this text from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: Since I have been married I have fallen in love with my Crock-Pot!  We both work and it is just the most wonderful thing to come home in the evening and already have dinner ready to go.  Sometimes it just doesn't seem worth the effort to cook for just the two of us, but the Crock Pot always makes it just SO easy.  Using my Crock-Pot has saved us SO much money by not eating out, and the ingredients that this book calls for are very inexpensive for the most part.  It is also much healthier than eating out several nights a week.  The best part of this book is that you can always find a recipe that sounds great and you have all the stuff that you need for it in the house.  Really, all it takes is five minutes in the morning to throw it all in the Crock-Pot and then you have a great dinner!  I almost always just put the meat in there straight from the freezer and just add an hour or so of cooking time.  This would be a great gift for a shower or housewarming.  Overall, it is a very simple book that always produces tasty and healthy dinners.

$REVIEW.: A significant portion of the book is about Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
This topic may be the most important idea about how to promote your website


Sweeney explains that if your site can get returned high enough in a search engine's results for a query, then you can get many visitors

Ideally, you would like to be the first result

But at least on the first page, since many people don't look beyond this

Plus, getting in these results is free


You don't have to buy ads from the engine.Sweeney talks about various ways to do SEO
Like using descriptive anchor text and titles in your pages

Don't do the easy thing of ignoring to write a title for a page
The text in this is used by a engine with reasonably high weighting

But she also warns about SEO methods to avoid
Don't do keyword stacking or stuffing


Or tiny text
Or invisible or near invisible text

Or serve an engine one page and normal users another


And above all, don't join a link farm.

Kerry's father, Jack does his best to do right by her, but he's a con man and a gambler and doesn't set the best example for a young girl.After Jack dies, Kerry goes to live with Dr Addison Grant, an acquaintance of her father's, and his prim and proper wife, Laura. Kerry is determined to make a better life for herself. She begins work at the Palace Hotel as a dishwasher. After a great battle of wits, she works her way up to become a cook.Beth Hammond's life hasn't been easy. She grew up with unsupportive parents, her father was a domineering man, and seemed to think Beth should work all hours in his store. All Beth can think about is escaping and studying nursing. Which eventually she is able to do.Kerry and Beth first meet at the home of Addison and Laura. For Kerry, it is love at first sight. But Kerry has known for years she prefers women. What will Kerry do? Will Kerry trust that Beth won't run away if she tells her how she feels? Beth, although she has strong feelings for Kerry, has no idea why or what it means. Beth is also hiding a dark secret, which if she divulges, could lose her Kerry's friendship forever. What will Beth do? Will Beth trust Kerry?This is a wonderfully well written debut book. It doesn't read like a debut book. Now and then I read a debut book and it is so good, I find it hard to believe the author hasn't published before. This is one of those books.The book is set in San Francisco and the story begins in 1880. It is quite obvious that Kathleen Knowles has done extensive research into the history of turn of the century San Francisco, for this book. It is far more than just a simple lesbian romance. The history comes alive.As I began to read this story, I felt as though I had been transported back in time. The descriptive settings were so vivid, I could almost smell the aroma of the Bay area.For anyone who has visited San Francisco, they will know some of these places still exist and some things haven't changed at all. It is very easy to get lost into the story and to become a part of it.The two main characters, Kerry and Beth, are well formed and loveable and there is a strong cast of supporting characters to progress the story along it's way.This is a story of courage, first love, romance and how women could make a life outside of marriage, which was the norm for women of those times.The story of these two courageous women will remain with me for a long time. This is definitely a re-read for me. I look forward to more from this promising new author soon.

$review_text.: I am embarrassed to say that I somehow completely missed this book when it was released in 2013
I call myself a pretty solid Ilona Andrews (husband and wife Ilona + Gordon writing team) fan, and I have seen the book mentioned on the website, but must have completely bypassed the publication


I was fortunate to get a hardcopy of the book and meet the couple at the Romantic Times Booklover Convention in New Orleans
Gordon and Ilona signed the book for me, and they are very funny and easily approachable in person, even for people who are fangirling pretty hardcore


This story (and the second book) has been shared piece by piece with devoted fans, allowing the fans to push feedback to the authors while they write and compose the story


I do not think it is necessary to point out that these authors are completely unique in their genres, and I count myself very lucky to have met them in person
The paperback book comes in a dark blue-ish black with an artfully done female centering the cover
The female is wearing a dark blue-ish gray hooded robed, her long blond hair mostly hidden by the hood, but you can see four bracelets dangling from her right wrist as her hand wraps around the handle of a broom


Magic is evident on the cover, as the broom bears wisps of something unexplainable, and in the background a dark Victorian house&#8230;every aspect of the artwork on the cover comes to play in the story.The genre of this book easily touches paranormal, but I think the bulk of this book remains firmly in urban fantasy with (of course) romantic flavor
The Innkeeper world that the couple has created is virtually limitless, incorporating planets, aliens, and seemingly anything that the mind can imagine

Everything has its place, as they say, and there is a place for everything

When Dina realizes that the community surrounding Gertrude Stein, the inn to which she is connected, is under attack from other-worldly entities &#8211; she decides to break with Innkeeper strictures and make a stand

Throw in the new kid in the neighborhood, an alpha strain werewolf named Sean, and a vampire serving as the Marshall of House Krahr named Arland, and things start to heat up for the young Innkeeper
The skirmishes between allies and the aggressors in this book are exciting, colorfully written, and above all realistic (as realistic as you can be when you are talking about aliens and magic).With a female lead that is capable of defending herself and those she feels responsible for and romantically interesting male characters, this series has a lot of promise


Do not expect dishrag females in these books &#8211; as with The Edge series, the fights are rough and unlike many fights I have read in numerous books, both sides come away with damage
I highly encourage this book for fans of all ages because despite the romantic flair that is in this first book, there is no hanky panky (and it is not required to keep the book flowing)

I file this book under Young Adult, New Adult, I&#8217;m Never Going to Grow Up, and Urban Fantasy/Paranormal Romance
I will be purchasing more of the series!Ruckie[...]

Exercise and diet play a very important part in weight loss, but should not be the only thing you should stay focused on. This book will help you learn about many things that could cause you to gain weight that you might not have ever thought about before. The author also gives you web sites to go to for added advice. We should all pamper our self once in a while to help reduce stress. Stress is a big factor in weight gain. There is so much valuable information in this book that will interest you, especially if you are on a journey to lose weight. I recommend everyone on a journey to lose weight to buy this book. It will help you to understand how you can be a success with losing weight.

$review_text.: With a great opening, Wareeze Woodson draws you in immediately to the heroine&#8217;s plight and the hero&#8217;s goals. The author gives you strong characters with very different agendas, which makes their growing attraction all the more unlikely.Readers will root for Laurel immediately when her son, for no apparent reason, is stolen from her. Her constant struggle to prove herself as a mother reveals her strong nature and, ultimately, the fact that she has been wronged.Adron seems to be a callous male of the regency period. Yet the author creates sympathy for him. The male voice seems very believable with his rational approach to the situation as he understands it. He thinks with his brain not other parts of his anatomy as many romance heroes do. This is not to say that he doesn&#8217;t get caught in the end by Laurel.&#8220;CONGRATULATIONS&#8221; for portraying Adron as a true male with his reasoning well thought out from his viewpoint. Adron says to Laurel &#8220;Most men are primitive, savage creatures full of pride. That&#8217;s the way we are, simply men.&#8221; Other than &#8220;savage&#8221; you have nailed what most women romance authors don&#8217;t understand.This well written regency romance is an exciting mix of a mother&#8217;s love, intrigue, mystery, the problems of family expectations, and a search for true love. Strong competing characters keep the story moving as each tries to get what they expect as their due. An artfully designed twist at the end will keep you guessing.

 Showing how a person deals with grief and the help that puts them back on the right path is one of the great aspects of this book

$REVIEW.: I don't know how today goodbye. Well I do, but I don't want to. At least we will have Cam's book coming, so I don't have to say goodbye to this world. I digress, back to  Olivia and Alexander.  This is the final installment of their wonderful adventure.I had a lot of expectations with this book, I had questions and I wanted answers. T.K set her own bar high with the pervious books and did so well knowing that she would shatter us with this novel.  Shatter is exactly what she did.Olivia has a lot to find out, and a lot to come to terms with once she does FIND OUT. Alex has a lot of secrets that he is holding close to his heart.  DOn't fret though, even with all this weighing down on him, he's still got it.Some of the scenes in this book had me fanning self.  Oh My, Mr. Burnham.GorgeousChaosSo much needed to come out during this book, and I really didn't know how we were going to get all the answers without it feeling rushed. How was Olivia going to deal with it all? Well T.K. does it flawlessly.  I NEVER saw some parts coming. They were out of the left field for me.This book is really  like watching a movie.  Some parts had you on the endue of your seats, while some were so emotional your breath gets caught in your throat.&#34;I know, Olivia, and I will never stop loving you. I've loved you since the day you were born, and I'll love you until the day you die. And I plan on making it up to you every day in between.&#34;A 5 star read for sure. If I could rate it higher I would. A Perfect ending to this wonderful series.Arc provided for Honest Review.

$REVIEW.: What a rush!  This novella is action packed and suspenseful with enough romance to make your heart soar


 The illustrative language that Nuest uses paints a beautiful picture for the reader


 It is so easy to get lost in this world alongside the characters

 Nuest develops everything to its fullest, without losing the action of the story in descriptions


 The entire story is in perfect balance.The stark contrast between the two main characters is absolutely breathtaking


 It&#8217;s also completely comical at times

 You can&#8217;t help but giggle at the things that they come up with

 Their back and forth is extremely striking
 These characters are also so well developed by this point in time in the series that they easily carry the story on their own


 The minimal supporting cast barely registered I was so focused on these two.My final thoughts on this one?  You&#8217;re killing me!!!!  I need more now


 I can&#8217;t believe this series will be over with just one more instalment

 I definitely won&#8217;t be ready to give these characters up.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: I was privileged to get an early copy of the book prior to its official release date. I fell in love with Aries from the start - she's a solid, engaging heroine who is extremely compassionate. While this is clearly a dystopian science fiction book akin with novels such as Divergent and Hunger Games (in that there is a very controlling government/ruling party, advanced technology and a population of people that are oppressed), there are elements of fantasy as well as a compelling mystery that kept me turning pages long after I should've gone to bed.What I liked best about the book was the connection that the characters had with each other which was strongly driven by Aries, the main protagonist. Aries is flawed, brave, intelligent and very real - a character you can't help but fall in love with and route for. Her connection with Born-of-Night is endearing and often harrowing and I found myself holding my breath whenever they lost contact.This is the second book of Mr. Bolz's that I've read - the first was The Three Feathers which is referenced at the start of this book. Aries' own journey mirrors that of Joshua's (from The Three Featheres) in many ways. She's forced to make hard decisions and show true bravery, and she makes unexpected friends in the process. I love that this story is so character driven, but also that the world is very real. I'm very much looking forward to the next installment in this series.

$REVIEW.: This book is not one I would read typically.  I am more into science fiction, fantasy, time travel.  However, this book is an action adventure comedy and is very enjoyable as is.  A con man finds a mere shoal that no country has laid claim.  Then through massing grabage builds an island...for the purpose of making money and conning the uber wealthy.  The characters are fun, each play a role in establishing the island.  Vickers, the military minded, Harry the master mind, Captain Pettigrew the tug boat captain...This book was written in 1987 and I kept trying to imagine could an island come into being in the modern era of internet and communications.  The CIA and US government were monitoring the circumstances and pandemonium ensues.

$review_text.: Savor You takes place at the same time as Devoured so I suggest reading Devoured first. Savor You is the story of Kylie Wolfe, the younger sister to Lucas Wolfe. She works as Lucas's personal assistant and interacts daily with his band members. Kylie has been in love with Wyatt (guitar player) since she was a teen-ager but things just never worked out. She can't get her heart to move forward though. Wyatt follows her on vacation and is determined to show her he is committed and loves her. The bouncy ride they experience will leave you sad AS secrets and past events that affect them both are revealed, but the love scenes are off the chart! I also fell in love with Heidi (Kylie's BFF and Cal another band member) and can only hope they will have a story out soon!Also as a bonus there is deleted scene from Devoured at the end!!!!

$REVIEW.: Mr. Shore says that the Greatest Commandment (Love God and love people) is incompatible with the Great "Commission" (tell people about Christ)?  How idiotic.  These are two things God has commanded us to do... love others and tell others about Christ.  In fact, the most loving thing we can possibly do for others is tell them about Christ.In summary his book's real message isn't about loving God and loving people... it's about self-love.  His message is, "Love yourself enough to avoid potentially uncomfortable situations that may occur during witnessing."Poor Mr. Shore, I wonder how he could possibly actually be a Christian with this theology.  It makes me heartsick that the Navigators published this garbage.In third world countries thousands of babies are born with neonatal conjunctivitis, a serious infection of the eye that causes blindness.  In 1995 an eye drop was created by UCLA that can kill the infectious bacteria and prevent sight loss.  Imagine you are walking into a hut where a mother is clutching her infant. The child's eyes are red and puffy with crusted swollen lids.  In your hand you have a bottle of this miraculous drug -- one drop in each eye, and this child will not go blind.  However, before you can put the drops in those eyes, you're going to have to talk to the mother about the fact that something is wrong with her baby.  You're going to have to say, in essence, "you're not OK."But, imagine that you are so frightened that this may cause her to feel uncomfortable that you elect not to talk to her at all. You decide that if you're just friendly to her for a couple of months, perhaps she will ask you about the drops.How horrific! Only the most UN-loving, self-centered, cringing, coward would elect to not speak because they were afraid of causing a little temporary discomfort!If you really care about that woman and her poor, suffering child, you will run up to her, tell her something is wrong with her baby, and then tell her what you hold in your hand.  And the same is true for evangelism.  Sin is the disease, and Christ's precious blood is the miraculous cure.  Sure, the person you talk to might feel initially uncomfortable... but if you really care about where they're going to spend eternity... if you really don't want to see them go to Hell... you will love that person enough to wade through that discomfort so that they get the cure.If this book has any popularity, it can only be with those who do not believe Hell exists, and with those who are looking for an excuse not to share their faith.  It is complete heresy... and utterly nonsensical.
$SUMMARY.: Heretical! Shore flat out tells you to disobey Christ's command to witness!

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying what a wonderful flow this book has. Four different authors have written four different stories and yet it could have been very well written by the same author. You know how when you buy anthology  there are always stronger stories, then there are OK stories, and there are some that plain suck. I have never read anthology book before where I love all the stories. Little bird whispered into my ear that Nicole Kimberling was largely responsible for evening out the quality, so kudos for her.This is a fantasy book, taking place in a world where humans (without their own knowledge) share the planet with all kinds of mythical creatures. Goblins, fairies, demons, vampires, you name it. Irregulars is an agency that is supposed to keep humans from finding it out!I, as a rule, don't like it when too many creatures have been thrown into the book, but here it didn't bother me in the least.Nicole Kimberling, "Cherries worth getting" - 5 stars. Irregulars agents, former exes Keith and Gunther are hunting a killer. This is whodunnit murder mystery with plenty of red herrings. Let me give you a hint - it wasn't the butler!Josh Lanyon, "Green glass beads" - 5 stars. This is a cat and mouse game between Irregulars agent Rake, and  thief and occasional bad boy Archer. Archer is used to fooling agents who try to catch him in the act, but Rake may turn out to be more then he can handle.Astrid Amara, "No life but this" - 5 stars.  Irregulars are asking Deven's help in finding out how one of their own met his end. Getting close to the truth puts Deven's own life in danger.Ginn Hale, "Things unseen and deadly" - 5 stars. Jason has always thought himself to be mentally ill, for seeing things that are not possible. Or are they? One day his world comes crashing down when Irregulars agent Henry has to take him under his protection.It was really and excellent read and a day well spent!Two authors were new to me, and this book made me want to check them out. I was also impressed with the homework all four had done. I can only hope that there will be more books to come - all characters had plenty of potential and I would absolutely stand in line for Irregulars II. And III. And...

In comes Ryan Star, detective and man's man, and now you can see the kind of story Tara can bring! Poor JJ tries so hard to be an alpha male in hopes that Ryan will like him. Reading JJ's thoughts as he's stuck at a football game are insanely funny!And, of course, because its a Tara Lain book, the sex is HOT!You'll love reading about JJ and Ryan.

$review_text.: I enjoyed The Shaman's Temptation, a short but steamy romantic novella


The heroine, Madeleine Greenway, a bank analyst, visits an Apache reservation as part of her research to determine whether her bank should approve an investment


The people of the tribe are planning to open a casino, which they hope will improve their financial situation
Madeleine meets Tak, a sexy Apache who appears to have some paranormal abilities

They share dreams of one another, and their attraction is instant and powerful.Although Tak has sworn celibacy, it doesn't take long before his feelings for Madeleine tempt him to break his vow


They become involved in a relationship, but there are difficulties

Although Madeleine is drawn to Tak's love of nature and devotion to his people, her own lifestyle is very different from his
Besides, she may have bad news for his tribe when she learns more about their plans for financing the casino.The story is beautifully told, with lyrical passages and plenty of eroticism

I liked the touch of Native American mysticism, which fit into the story well, without being overpowering
I read The Shaman's Temptation in one sitting, turning the pages avidly, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hot, romantic novellas.

Her guilt and love for Jesse kept her trying to help him overcome his destructive behavior to the extent of forgoing her own true happiness. Jesse loved and needed Charlie but his damaged past and mental illness hampered him from giving Charlie what she needed. The snippets of Sam made me feel so sorry for him.

$review_text.: This is a police procedural set in New Mexico country. The characters are nicely drawn, the plot is pretty predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless. I got bored with the descriptions, often repeated, of land parcels, where they were located, whether they were valuable or not, particularly without a map. Good descriptions of settings, contrasting the realtors' house against the working ranch and town setting. Storyline was interesting, but not riveting. Certainly not a thriller, making a nice break from the torture and blood letting of other mysteries.Author clearly understands how we dog owners feel about our dogs; he says over and over that the ranch hand would never have left his dog behind, so the feeling that something is not right grows stronger and stronger. Meanwhile, the reader knows it from the get-go.If you're looking for a not-too-demanding way to pass a quiet weekend, this would be a good one to choose.

After reading the entirety of "Principles of Business Success" (by author Nouriel Yazdinian), I can safely say that I learned a ridiculous amount of helpful insight and guidance that I've never been taught anywhere else (even in my business and marketing class in college).The book goes into elaborate detail as to why you don't always need to focus on being smart or working 24/7 to be successful
That your mindset is your secret weapon that can make or break where your trail of success goes, and how rewarding your journey will be if you can just concentrate on having the right attitude


It seems simple enough, but as I kept reading I was able to see how it's not just that basic, as there are many different guidelines and objectives that go along with having the right perspective

Author Nouriel Yazdinian does a tremendous job of explaining what is vital to this method of success, and does not leave anything in the dark
It is a highly efficient and very detailed business strategy that everyone can benefit from if they're willing to learn the tools.Five stars from me for helping change my business outlook and performance.

$REVIEW.: A cop investigating shootings in and around Portland's homeless shelters trades jabs and heated looks with a hot doctor. Yes, cops need love too. We know attractive, single docs are going to get some play so I was happy to see that the protagonist and heroine is a strong, beautiful woman who just happens to carry a gun.  Rest assured this is no simpering, silly Sally just pretending to chase bad guys, Danny is the real deal. She has a tough exterior, but I liked that the author showed her sensitive side when her relationship with Jake reconnects her to her spiritual roots. I enjoyed the vet/PTSD angle brought to life by Dr Jake. He is a well rounded character that is brawny but has a vulnerability that is believable and relatable.  Believing Again is book 5 in the Second Chances series and while it is a stand alone there is some cross over. Her partner, Sam, is a hold over from Loving Again and the banter between the two provides believable back story.Believing Again does lose a bit of steam when it delves into the police investigation side. I found Jake's active involvement into Danny's work unbelievable. I know his work with the homeless vets was meant to provide cover into why he would be at an active crime scene, but cautioning your not quite girlfriend, who happens to be a police detective, into why she shouldn't be going places alone is a bit of a stretch. Despite being a plot point, I don't think anyone with any common sense (let alone a badge) would invite a witness into her home. Also not calling for back up is a big no no and unrealistic to boot. Because this is a romantic suspense novella I was expecting a to see the whodunit play out more rather than a sum up report at the end.  In spite of is formulaic nature I enjoyed Believing Again and will definitely check out more from this series.

$REVIEW.: I've enjoyed the little snippets of Hugh over the last couple of books in this series, how the author has been setting his personality change up for this book. The character of Hugh has always been referred to as the fast and loose risk taking sibling. Ms. Foster has shown us that he's been ready to change for a while with his little side conversations with various siblings in their stories. That made his treatment of Bree and his disgust with his blind date much easier for me to accept as a reader.Of course, Hugh is a Braden. So that means that, no matter his reputation, I expected him to be a gentleman. And was he ever. Without getting into spoilers here, there is a bit more suspension of disbelief in this story than in any of the others when it comes to the swiftness of the love. But that's okay, as usual I'm fine with that in a novel. As much as the insta-love was faster than ever, the sex took a bit longer in this one. And that's where Hugh's gentlemanly powers came into play.As for our heroine, Bree was as protective as I would expect a single mother to be. Maybe even a bit too much at times, but being a mom myself I could understand her reservations.All in all, this book was a fantastic end to the Braden part of this series and I cannot wait to dive further into the Remington branch of the tree.

$REVIEW.: The Guardians is the story of Gianna Boticelli, the daughter of a mafia crime boss
Gianna falls in love with a vampire named Caleb and joins him and his fellow vampires in a war against a murderous race of vampiric monsters called the dark angels.I really liked the plot of this book

The main character Gianna has a very interesting backstory, such as her coming from a mafia family and the origins of her mother's family
The mythology of this book is unique and interesting

Though I like the overall plot and structure of this book, I can only give it two stars because it feels too much like a rough draft


There are so many issues that make it hard to fully engage with the story

I think this story was way too rushed
I feel like this should have been a 250-300 page book instead of 134
There were so many things going on and it felt like I was being zoomed right through them without being given the chance to feel the emotional implications of these events.The rushed pacing of the book also made the characterization difficult to follow or believe

Sense the story is moving along so fast, the characters shift moods much too quickly

You never get to see any of the characters fully respond to the death of friends or family because the plot just rushes to the next major event


I thought that Gianna's reactions didn't feel natural
Depending on the situation, Gianna either comes off as too accepting of the situation or her reactions are too over the top
The characters needed more time for their personalities and motivations to be fleshed out in gradual and believable ways.

$review_text.: This book should be called a Collection of Kooks, with the author more often than not chief of the bunch!I was hornswaggled into reading this book due to the rave reviews it received. What a disappointment! This book is very short (174 text pp) and when you consider the large font, spacing, new headings for every page, etc., there is really only about 75 pages of material here, which was almost too much to take.The author is obviously a numbers freak as he spends 10 pages describing the "cipher 6" code that purportedly explains how names = numbers, yada, yada, yada. He then spends four pages quoting from the fictional "Forgotten Books of Eden" as if they were on par with the Bible.This work is full of assertive statements with few reliable sources other than the authors word. He attempts to come across as THE authority on all UFO/spiritual matters, but only succeeds in irritating the reader (at least this reader). The author also has a most annoying habit of ending every paragraph with a rhetorical statement or question like, "Is this the link between UFO's and the occult?"While I happen to agree with the author's connection of the UFO phenomena with the occult and demonology, this may be one of the worst books I've ever read; in fact, seeing something like this in print should give hope to anyone that they too can write a book, no matter their intellect, research skills, writing ability, or other qualifications.This book deserves about half of one star.

$review_text.: As believers today, we are both citizens of the world and of heaven. This duality creates a tension in our lives as we celebrate what God has already done but expectantly hopes for what He has promised. He captures that dichotomy well on page 175: "In this very Abba-confession, the rock of the `already' meets the hard place of the `not yet,' for it is due to the present awareness of our sonship that we can call God `Father,' but it is because this adoption has yet to be consummated that this bold affirmation comes in the form of a fervent cry." This book isn't a quick read, as it is dense with biblical passages and theological discussions, but it's a worthwhile one. He quotes liberally from Scripture and from those who have gone before him in church history, and there are definitely sections I'll be revisiting for a second (and third and...) read before I can fully digest them.In the first part, the author discusses how our worship should reflect an otherworldliness as we live as resident aliens in the new covenant church (chapters 2-3); how we live as underdogs because our victory is largely in the future (chapter 4); how we regard the Sabbath, particularly as American Christians (chapter 5); how our national citizenship now does (and doesn't) have redemptive significance (chapter 6); and how the church shapes her members (chapter 7). In the second, he discusses how we consider our lives through the macrocosm of God's divine drama (chapter 8); how our heavenly citizenship renders earth "unworthy of our ultimate affection" (chapter 9); how we are shaped by an innate longing for eternity (chapter 10); how we can enjoy earth's temporal blessings in their proper context (chapter 11); how the Holy Spirit draws the future into the present to help us today (chapter 12); how we grow by giving up our rights and entitlements (chapter 13); and how our dual citizenship "causes us to groan for glory, a groaning that is both soothed and intensified by the indwelling Spirit, who functions as an engagement ring assuring us of the future consummation of our union with our glorified Bridegroom (chapter 14)" (p. xv).There was only one part that I wasn't nodding my head with or being sharply convicted by: I'm not so sure about the author's division between part one (Christian Worship for the Dual Citizen) and part two (Christian Life for the Dual Citizen). I recently spent a lot of time meditating on Romans 12:1-2 as part of a unit we taught the 9th graders at our church, and it clearly lays out that making ourselves living sacrifices is our spiritual act of worship; in other words, it doesn't separate life from worship. Spellman expects this critique and begins building his case for the distinction in the preface, but I'm still a skeptic. I think he was really trying to have a section for how to live in the world (part two, what he called "Christian life") while not be of this world (part one, what he called "Christian worship"). His separation of worship and life and his explanation for doing so seemed to muddy the waters unnecessarily.That said, he solidly uses Scripture, tradition, and the writings of other godly folks to explain the importance of the church. His writing challenged my thinking about ministry and personal life (particularly, with respect to the personal, my lack of reverence for or even consideration of the fourth commandment, either in terms of a defined Sabbath day or just times of intentional rest). His writing speaks both to the community of believers as a whole and to the heart of a believer as an individual. For example, on page 18 he calls out the church for being more like "grits than salt--changing in response to her environment rather than having the boldness and courage to stand out and be different." His best one-liner by far comes as he critiques the consumerist approach to church that demands a program for every potential need: "And do you have anything for my green-eyed, left-handed pre-teen daughter who loves ferrets and plays the oboe?" (p. 5).Meanwhile, on an individual level, he challenges readers with this on pages 121-122: "Let us answer the question with a question: who is more likely to quit smoking during pregnancy, the mother who plans for an abortion or the one who plans to give birth? The answer should be obvious. Roads that actually lead somewhere are usually better maintained than dead-end ones, and likewise, when we see our earthly sojourn as just that--a sojourn on the way to our heavenly home--it is reasonable to assume that we will take this pilgrimage with great seriousness and care."I consider this a valuable work, and I intend to re-read it again in a few months because I feel like it needs a few readings before I can truly digest it. In lieu of reciting a laundry list of things that make this a book I respect and appreciate, I've made a list below of nuggets from the text. I have no reservations about saying that this is a meaningful book worth being in your library, but you can judge whether or not that's true as you read the author's words below:* "Stepping back from the trees and beholding the forest, or looking at our own lives as parts of God's story (rather than the other way around), enables us to gain a perspective on our trials and triumphs that is truly theo- rather than egocentric, God-centered instead of me-centered." (p. xiii)* "Donald Grey Barnhouse, former pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, once mused about what a city would look like if Satan took it over. His conclusion was much different than many might assume. He didn't envision rampant violence and deviant sexual perversion, with Christians being tortured or thrown into prison. Rather, Barnhouse surmised that if the Devil were in charge of a city, the bars and pool halls would close, the streets and neighborhoods would be cleaned up, children would say "Yes, sir" and "No, ma'am," and every Sunday men and women would flock to churches where Christ was not preached." (italics in the original text, p. 65)* "The real distinction that the Beatitudes illustrate, then, is not between the internal and the external or the physical and the spiritual, but between this age and the age to come, the `already' and the `not yet.' To employ the biblical typology, the Beatitudes set earth against heaven and the old Babylon against the New Jerusalem." (p. 69)* "But as long as we misdiagnose our Adamic disease as a mere case of the spiritual doldrums, we not only will misconstrue the gospel as therapy and Jesus as part Cheerleader and part Coach, we will never break the vicious cycle of looking within to solve the problem that looking within caused in the first place." (p. 77)* "...we simply cannot have Jesus without His church, we cannot have the personal without the corporate, and we cannot sever the Head from the body. After all, if physical decapitation is lethal, then it would follow that its spiritual equivalent is infinitely more deadly." (p. 83-84)* "Since the dawn of Puritanism (at least), we have heard that in order to prescribe a cure for man's spiritual ills, we must first diagnose his disease. `Rubbish,' says Catholic author G. K. Chesterton. In his little book What's Wrong with the World, Chesterton decries what he calls the `medical mistake': `The first great blunder of sociology . . . is stating the disease before we find the cure. But it is the whole definition and dignity of man that in social matters we must actually find the cure before we find the disease.' Chesterton's point is that man can be understood only from the vantage point of the future, after running on ahead, as it were, and then looking back." (p. 113-114)* "To strike the proper balance between the already of the kingdom's coming and the not yet of its visible fulfillment is to live our lives exactly where God wants them to be." (p. 149)* "It is not uncommon for pastors to hear from their people in the pews that they need more 'application' from the pulpit. 'Hearing about the cross and resurrection of Christ week in and week out is all well and good,' they say. 'But give us something we can use in the real world. Tell us how to live.' This request is often tantamount to a desire for law instead of gospel, a hunger to be told what we can do for God rather than resting in what He has done for us." (p. 160)(In keeping with the FTC, I must disclose that I wrote this review in exchange for a free book. However, Reformation Trust (an imprint of Ligonier Ministries) did not request a positive review, only a "serious, substantive, and fair" one. While I like free books, my opinion can't be bought.)

It was quite an accomplishment to seamlessly combine the two books and the major characters of each, keep them true to themselves, and have the beginnings and endings correspond (more or less) to the originals while completely mixing up the middles.For me, this book merits a 4 1/2 star rating.

I absolutely will be reading this again,which is something I seldom do....there is just something about the flavor of this book, maybe the flavor is in the story telling, perhaps the building of characters, whatever, it suits my taste to a &#34;T&#34;


I've never thought of myself as being an &#34;old fashioned woman&#34; but if this type of romance puts me in that category, then I am happy to be


I will admit, although ashamed to say, I have not read many of the old classics, but this book has given me good reason to rethink that, instead of boring, as we often thought when we were in school, they may actually be some very tasty desserts, compared to some things I have come upon in recent months.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book.  The other reviews can tell you what the book was about.  I liked the hero and felt he earned his bad rep.  So it is easy to see why the heroine was having problems trusting that he really cared for her.  The story was good and fitting for this age group (a little immature).  I really wish we could have some stories where everyone doesn't get falling down drunk to have a good time tho.  But, it was a cute story, sweet romance, and I enjoyed it.  I recommend it and think most will enjoy reading it.
$SUMMARY.: Really enjoyed the book.

$REVIEW.: "Delilah Devlin's "My Immortal Knight" series is an erotic stroll on the dark side where vampires and weres war with each other for supremacy and the occasional human mate.  Ms. Devlin's characters are the stereotypical alpha males with chiseled features, large bank accounts, and enormous...stamina that will keep the reader's blood pumping and palms sweating until the wee hours.  Ms. Devlin's storyline evolves from novel to novel with plenty of vampire stalks girl, vampire gets girl, and vampire and werewolf fighting sequences; however, Ms. Devlin mixes it up with original, uncanny, heartbreaking material that leaves the reader crying, kicking, and screaming for more.  I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Devlin's work on the "My Immortal Knight" series and can hardly wait for the next installment." by Amber Barr
$SUMMARY.: An action-packed erotic series

$REVIEW.: This is an ok story written about the late 60's and early 70's at Paramount Pictures.What annoyed me, and does so often with these sorts of books, is the author writing so much about himself when he's not at all famous, making the title only half true.The story is broad and gives you a general understanding of interesting and famous people in this era.

It's just a small peek into the beginnings of Chris and Sarah's relationship in the aftermath of Tenley leaving Hayden to head back home.

It helps the reader to understand the mystery of creation and our existence
It answers the timeless question: Where are we from? What are we doing here? And from here, where are we going?The journey to some of the holy places in Europe, the USA, Middle East, and especially India is an added bonus
It's a great read for anyone who is interested in spirituality, metaphysics, and yoga.

$REVIEW.: If you are wondering how it is possible to write a book - even one this short - all about feet, this book is proof that you cannot.  I would estimate (giving the benefit to the author) that all of 20% of the book is about feet.  The first chapter is devoted to evolution.  There were probably more words devoted to the evolution of the human chin to the foot.  There were anecdotes about the Ephesians, the apostles, DNA, other animals and even more than three pages devoted solely to different versions of the &#34;Cinderella&#34; story throughout different cultures.  This book is filled with information, which is why I give it two stars.  Unfortunately, most of the information had nothing to do with the foot.  The title of &#34;Leonardo's Foot&#34; is reference to DaVinci's Vitruvian Man who the author referred to about a dozen times throughout the book.  I'm not quite sure what I was expecting.  Perhaps a good part of me was rapt in the anticipation of how the author could get a book out our feet.  I've enjoyed such books on cod, salt, the screw, and the like.  Unfortunately, this book did not pass muster.

Instead, Simmons will teach you his method of success that brings you true riches and inner peace. True riches being defined as finding your hidden potential, making a positive impact on the world, and being happy with life. However, learning the secrets that lead you to true riches, will also manifest itself in business, financial, and personal success. You will see that when you take the focus off your own success, and care about the success of others, that positive things will happen in your life. You will find favor with others and doors of opportunity will open.You may not agree with his personal spiritual journey, or the advise he shares in his book, but the book has a way of halting the fast-paced world we live in, and it will help you to think, and focus on the things that matter the most. No matter what your religious affiliation, I think you will walk away with a need to adjust your priorities and goals. Money will become a tool to do good, and those that give will get more to do more for the world.

This book is an indespencable part of my reference library

The only book that comes close is the standard catalog of firearms


It has more firearm history than the blue book, but the pricing models are extremely close


The blue book is updated more often and has more hard to find guns listed than the standard catalog of firearms

I rate this as the number 1 book to have in your reference library
Then get The standard catalog of firearms and the standard catalog of military firearms

you will then have the best reference set avalible.

But from the beginning of this series, I just knew that this guy was going to be my one true love. Well, except, maybe for Shane. Okay, they're going to have to take turns mowing my lawn without shirts on.Anyway. I'm so impressed with how the author dealt with some majorly complicated issues...substance abuse, the suicide epidemic among our service members, and the difficulties of maneuvering through the chains of command and red tape just to get help that should be a no brainer.Heartbreaking.And in the middle of all of that horse hockey, two flawed, good people managed to find each other and decide to make it work. No stranger to recovery and co-dependency, I really appreciate the way Ms. Scott dealt with the issues--it's not pretty, and it's not simple, and it doesn't go away just because someone gets smacked in the head by love.Yay, Jessica!

$REVIEW.: In A Myth to the Night &#8211; Part 1, author Cora Choi cleverly crafted a fantasy world where mystery unfolds at every turn. It follows the story of Hugh Fogg, a young monk from the Order of the Crane who died in the 1615 massacre skillfully planned by the enemy known as the Order of the Shrike. Hugh comes back as as a phantom that roams the Stauros Island, which was now transformed into an elite University where students are promised a position of power upon graduation. Despite the massive changes in Stauros, Hugh vows to keep the prophetic myth of the Slayer of the Shadow fear alive. His eagerness has landed him in deep trouble when students he interacted with start to vanish without a trace.Let me just say that the young adult fantasy genre has had a resurgence, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, readers like me are given more of the same thing. So, it&#8217;s refreshing to have a unique story rich in imagery and intricately pieced together. The main character is engaging and well developed, and so are the supporting characters. There are  some dystopian concepts (tyranny, oppressive authority, etc.) that were injected into the fantasy world, which is quite clever, but perhaps a little complex for younger readers. The real feat is in combining all these without confusing the reader. Book 1 ends in a cliffhanger, but hints on a bigger and perhaps more dangerous adventure. The series has the potential to be a huge bestseller if the author breaks the mold further and does not fall too much in the trappings of its genre.

The relationship between Georgeanne and Marissa is very touching and seemed realistic, the banter between H/h was lively and the secondary characters were fun and supportive. This is a light, enjoyable read with a very typical storyline, but nonetheless well done. And I actually appreciate that there were no kidnappings, violence, illnesses, highwaymen, pirates or other overdone, stressful events to distract from the developing relationships.

I didn't suffer from not reading the other installments, this one stands alone

It is evenly paced, has a good premise and the story itself was quite romantic


I found myself emotionally involved in the character's happily ever after, and I was not disappointed.I would read more from Carolynn Carey.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

Didn't have a clue what this Jiggs is, what it means or anything like that.I read the first few pages...ok, it's a light comic book, with nice illustrations and short text. Pretty nice.  I kept reading, and the more I read, the more I liked it. I was so curious to find out Jigg's next little adventure that I was now determined to not let this book down until I finish reading it.I think I will get the other volumes now.

$REVIEW.: Not a big fan of crime noir, but figured I would give it a try.  It's always exciting reading about places I've never been, so reading about an American PI Vincent Calvino and his Thai friend Police Colonel Pratt, in Bangkok, on the trail of the 9 gold bullets and a seedy Russian business mad with ties to Russian mafia in Thailand and New York.The book, at times, was hard to follow and a spent more than a little time re-reading passages to get things straight in my mind.  It's not a 'smooth' read, but interesting enough to keep you turning the page.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my review.

$REVIEW.: This cookbook is riddled with typos and mistakes...like, omitting whole entire ingredients from the recipe. Publisher came out with a statement saying they are going to fix mistakes in future printings, but they should take the current version off amazon immediately. Not fair for consumers to spend money on something that is a total amateur publishing. As someone who works in publishing, this is really offensive. I know what it's like to proofread, and it's not brain surgery. I can understand one or two typos here and there, but i've only made 4 recipes so far and every single one had an error. And unfortunately, the ending results of everything i've made have been mediocre. Nothing really BAD or terrible, but nothing i'd make again or offer to guests. If this book can't win over a vegan like myself, it's certainly not going to win over any meat-eaters. Very disappointed. I was really excited and hopeful for a Forks Over Knives revolution, but it's not going to happen anytime soon with a cookbook like this. Sorry! (And who puts indian curry on pasta??? That is just wrong.)

$REVIEW.: I really liked Sharon Jaynes' new book, A Sudden Glory. The point of this book is to get your life to the point where you feel God's presence in everything you do, and on a daily basis. She talks a lot about intimacy with God and all the things that can get in the way of that relationship.Jaynes talks a lot about seeing God in the little moments. That's something I began adding into my daily devotion - what was my "sudden glory" of the day? A few days it was something simple like hearing my daughter tell me what shapes she saw in the clouds. Some days it was something bigger, like working with volunteers at church for a food ministry. One thing she said in the book is that sometimes, as Christians, we neglect our relationship with Jesus. "Relationship becomes religion, worship becomes work, and love becomes law."Jaynes also talks a lot about how our Christian walk can become broken due to shattered dreams or abuse, or financial ruin, or death, or a multitude of things. It sounds as though she really understands these feelings that Christians (especially women) can feel over a lifetime.There is a study guide included in this book which I think would be great to use in a small group or even individually. I do recommend this book for others to read.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

$review_text.: OK, so I realize that my bent is WWII--almost any subject, and espionage is certainly within the genre as well


So, I was taken in initially by the title ( I mean what could be interesting about that title?)
But, I stayed for the story.The Diaries is my third venture into this author

I first read Demon's Bluff

Liked it, so then I read The Doppelganger

By that time I was &#34;sold&#34; on this writer's style and story telling ability, so read The Diaries


Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed


And quite honestly, after reading several of the reviews am at a loss to understand why this author got some low marks (albeit very few).This book was different from the other two I have read, no less interesting mind you, and clearly written with great imagination!I don't re-tell story lines


You can read all the 4 and 5 star reviews if need be to learn more about that


What I will say is that I was captured early on by the story and simply had to read on to the end.I intend following this author by reading his other books
I expect them to be as fine a read as this one has been.

There are two problems with this though, Willow Delton a human, doesn't know she' his mate and has never heard of werewolves outside of movies and fictional books.  After agreeing to attend the local art show Jasper leaves never knowing he has lead a rival pack straight to Willlow's door, literally.  They followed his scent to the the bakery and smelled Jasper's scent on Willow, letting them know she is special to Jasper.  To lure Jasper to the Central Pack land to kill him they kidnap Willow where Corbin the heir to the Alpha and the Alpha beat her and let her know she will die as soon as they have Jasper.The Central Pack devalues all women, feels human have no other use than to be slaves and toys to be tortured for fun and killed.  The Alpha sacrifices his own daughter and niece in a sacrificial ceremony to call forth a demon to aide them in their war against the Redwood Pack, the strongest of all the werewolf packs in the world.  The desire of the Central Pack Alpha Hector and his only son Corbin is to decimate the Redwood Pack and either kill or enslave all humans.  With the demon on their side they begin their strategy with the kidnapping of Willow.My only fault with this book is also the most endearing.  As beta of the Redwood Pack Jasper should be more assertive in his actions in claiming his mate.  Yet he seems rather wishy washy at times, always second guessing himself.  On the flip side this same trait shows that love has him all a sea where he is usually so straight forward and directed.  Unfortunately Willow misunderstands Jasper when he carelessly says something putting Willow in danger.  Will the love they share survive?  Betrayal from an unexpected quarter brings danger and death to the Redwood Packs own land.  Who will pay the price for that betrayal?  Will the Redwood pack survive?  Read book two to find the answers?This book could be read as a stand alone but it is much better if read after book one.  Luckily for you Ms. Ryan has both books combines and offered as a single volume, but it doesn't stop there book three, Trinity bound is calling to you when you finish A Taste For A Mate. Be prepared to lay siege to this series and read it again and again.

$review_text.: For a reader who loves the combination of thrilling suspense and hot romance , the premise of this book was very promising indeed. How could a marriage of SEALS and a hijacked cruise ship not be a marvelous pairing? Well, I will tell you how, in my opinion, it all goes flat.The romance was unbelievable: the heroine is a flighty, not-too-bright gal who falls into beds and love without much thought; the hero, Mark, is a smart SEAL who seems to have poor judgement in his choice of women, and who, while grieving from the death of a woman he loved, falls irrevocably in love with a lady( the heroine Sophia) he has known for two nanoseconds.The suspenseful  plot does not gather steam until the last quarter of the book. Until that point, heavy hints are sprinkled liberally throughout the chapters, but the reader keeps waiting for some action, any action,, to begin. So much wasted potential.....The other SEALS and their wives are obviously from other books in this series, but for a series -unfamiliar reader such as myself, the relationships and their shared histories were rather vague.Perhaps worst of all was the poor grammatical construction throughout the entire novel. Seriously disappointing stuff from an acclaimed author. &#34;Cruisin' for a SEAL&#34; hit some rough seas for sure.

The fact that Maddox and Ashlyn find a refuge/solace in each other is the axis of the story.  While it does feel rushed due to the short length of the graphic novel, I found myself reading it through several times, and each time I found something new to see in it, so I didn't feel cheated at all.  I'd reread it again and again for fun.  I can say the same thing about part two and both parts of The Darkest Kiss.  All excellent!

$review_text.: One approach to teaching acrylic art techniques involves having students go through a carefully planned series of exercises to master technique 1 followed by the same steps to master steps 2, 3, 4, etc.  This method can work, but overly planned exercises actually prevent students from getting the exciting pulses of motivation that come from becoming their own professors, jumping into action and see results quickly through their own experiments.  The Reyner approach does the latter.  It uses a wonderful spiral binding that lays flat, great examples on high color rendition glossy paper and highly tractable examples that bring readers rather quickly to a point at which they can truly appreciate the tremendous versatility that acrylic paints and related supplies and equipment offer.

With ebooks and the blogosphere, along with emerging social media networks, publishing fiction is an income stream waiting for anyone to join in the fray

$REVIEW.: Well, there isn't a lot I could say about this book, basically because I believe that any kind of novella is far too short to create ambience that would allow me to judge a book. In any case, the prequel was well written and hot.Only point of criticism is following: if amazon states that this is "A novella prequel to the When the Mission Ends trilogy" I understand that this book should be read before one starts with the series. Little does it help to find out that it's supposed to be read between Book 2 and 3 of the series.  It would also be helpful to characterize books in a series with numbers (and of course titles). Why not make the readers' life easier?

I have purchased several cookbooks which turned out to be 50% lecture, persuasive argument or factoid. I am visually impaired, and have been frustrated by this inclination. This cookbook is just what a seasoned cook, looking to branch out, needs. Beginning cooks could also use this with ease.From the well written (brief) intro, I have been nothing but happy with this book! The recipes fit right into my kitchen, availability of ingredients and need to cook for non-vegetarian family members without making two separate meals.The emphasis on actually health recipes is refreshing as I don't eat sugar.This is undoubtedly be a great resource for beginner and seasoned vegetarian alike. Recipes are well written and have great range. Kudos to the author!

$REVIEW.: I'm glad this book was free because if I had actually paid for it I would have demanded a refund. The writing was jejune at best and the dialog was stilted. Nobody has spoken without using contractions since the early 1700's. Writing laundry 'shoot' instead of 'chute' could be overlooked once but the second time was unforgivable. The story-line was weak and the characters not at all developed. I would give this no stars at all if that was an option.

$review_text.: Gerri Hill's "The Scorpion" really captures the reader and takes them on an adventure as Marty and Kristen fight for their lives in the midst of crime, corruption and the awakening of feelings for each other. The balance maintained between the crime story and love story was riveting. Definitely give this one a chance, you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Formatting issues aside (which it did-- mostly with sentences being cut off and shifted down a line or two, which was jarring at times), it was an ok read. I liked the premise, and was hopeful about the sci-fi aspect, but after the initial reveal of Eden (think of Wildfire, in the 'Andromeda Strain'...), most of the anomalies that happen aren't explained at all, or even conjectured about. Which is a little frustrating, given the scientific background of the protagonist. The ending is a little forced, and not to give anything away, a little unsatisfying, too. It seems as if the ending were longer, but was cut for some reason. I hope the author does a rewrite on the ending of this book. It needs some more to complete it; there's actually a couple of sentences that were totally in the wrong place, with no other reference. It also needs more explanation for what happened.

$review_text.: Book exchanged for an honest review~Harper is a werewolf with no memory of who she is or how she ended up in the hospital

Harper doesn't know the handsome man named Axel but told that they're mated
Axel is frustrated with Harper's lack of memory and wonders what she knows


Harper is uneasy around Connor, Beta of Pack, but not sure why


Harper is unsure how to get her memory back

There have been mysterious murders surrounding the pack and not many clues to how they're done
Axel wants to solve this mystery and help Harper regain her memory
Harper's friend Gabby sets about to help Harper regain her memory
Will Harper regain her memory? Will Harper admit her feelings to Axel? Who is behind these murders? Your answers await you in Revocation.I thought the werewolf lore was great and totally unique

I also thought the story was clever and teasing at the same time

I look forward to the next installment.

$review_text.: While the recipes contained in this e-cookbook are wonderful I found the huge amount of information for each recipe to be overkill. The cookbook is laid out in a way that seems to be made for someone who has never cooked in their life and needs to be shown a picture of every step and then given a choice to check its dictionary meaning also. Although they say information is power, I think this is too much. If you can get past all the stuff the recipes are good.

$REVIEW.: I downloaded this book because it was free. I am familiar with faerie stories and was reluctant to spend money on another one.I have to say that this book was intriguing to me. I kept turning pages because I really wanted to know where the story was going and what would happen next.The story follows a young faerie who has been exiled from the faerie kingdom because she was born with the wrong type of magic. She has made her way to a city that is not too far from the kingdom borders, but far enough away that she is not hunted.She lives as a loner in a church for over a decade when there is a brutal murder on the street below her sanctuary. There she meets a police detective with the strange ability to sense her. Together, they search for the killer who is not quite human.I got hooked into the book within a few pages and was glued to it until the end.The climax was a little lackluster for me, not because of the way it ended but because of the way it was described. It was a little blase and boring for the violent, bloody climax that it was. I didn't expect detailed, graphic imagery of the violence, but I did look for a little more emotional and descriptive writing where the heroine's feelings were concerned. Everything seemed to happen in very little time and although I know the heroine is a faerie, I didn't get any sense of anguish from her. She felt bad, but I didn't see how she suffered emotionally the way I thought she would. It was almost matter of fact.Overall, I enjoyed the book and it was well edited and I did something I didn't think I'd do: I bought the second book! For $3.49!Usually if it's an author I've not heard of, I won't pay more than $1.99 until I see it wasn't just a good beginning. This author made me want to read the next book even if it wasn't what I wanted to pay. Good job, India! :)Here's to hoping the second book is just as good.

$REVIEW.: This book, hopefully the beginning of a long and wonderful series, was a fascinating look into crimesolving and crime stopping with a Christian perspective. I have rarely read a Christian fiction book that I enjoyed until this one, as usually Christian fiction consists of a weak story, weak characterizations, and with Bible verses on every other page. Not so with this book. You can sit down and enjoy it and see the grace of God also unfold.The characters in this book that could be considered Christian were not 'perfect', just forgiven. The main character, Ray, was a physically and emotionally broken man, that got to sleep at night only with the help of his friend "Jim Beam". As the book progressed, his need to solve a series of murders increases and he lets several people into his life. Not only do they help him with tracking down the killers, they touch his inner spirit and he begins to see the good in them.I very much enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it as it is a gripping story. Whether or not you are a fan of Christian fiction, you should appreciate this book and the story within. Let the Christian part speak to you or not, it is still a good read.

$REVIEW.: It creeps up slowly to surprise when it is least expected. It is a gardener's worst nightmare. No, it is not an invasive weed. It is old age. I am not certain when it happened to me but one day, while gardening, it became clear that I could no longer sustain this enjoyable activity for 6 hours without stopping! I wasn't twenty seven anymore. Gardening was slowly turning into an un-enjoyable chore. The energy level had dropped, the joints ached, and being winded was becoming the norm. Now I garden for fewer hours and that restriction is frustrating because there is so much that is left undone. Some of my peers have stopped altogether; they have sold their homes and moved into condominiums. For those of us that would like to maintain our gardens as long as possible, the author of this publication has some wise advice.Sydney Eddison came to the realization that her garden had become too great a responsibility with the death of her husband. Together with a wise coach, she created a list of steps that might lighten the burden of gardening into old age. Some of the suggestions include replacing needy plants with those that are lower maintenance, making and keeping lists of chores and then prioritizing them, learning to live with imperfect results, adapting a realistic attitude towards lawn care, and learning techniques that save time and energyThe author offers many pearls of wisdom on the subject of lightening the load; I have dog-eared about 16 pages of helpful advice that I plan to incorporate into my gardening routine. These suggestions will allow me to continue to garden while maintaining my pride, my skills and above all my dignity. Some of us no longer have careers that define us. Gardening as recreation replaced that years ago and it became the new source of accomplishment. Why should we have to stop now? With the help of the author and with some compromises, this reviewer will be able to continue to derive pleasure from a passionate hobby, even as the aging process evolves.Ms.Eddison is a nationally recognized gardener, speaker, and prolific writer whose own garden has been featured in magazine and television shows, including Martha Stewart Living and The Victory Garden. It is impressive that at a crossroad in her personal life that she should encounter head on the challenges of the aging gardener and write about it with grace and dignity. This is a terrifying topic for some of us and the author is to be commended for tackling it with both realism and optimism.November 28, 2010Since posting this review in May 2010, three prospective book purchasers contacted me to express their puzzlement. The high praise that I gave the book was out of sync with the 3 star ranking that I had originally given it and they wanted to know why.The reason is: - the topic upset me. No, it terrified me:- how the maturing gardener should adapt one's garden and one's gardening mindset, to the onset of old age. I am at a point in life where arthritis and reduced energy levels are compromising my abilities to garden without some assistance. It is making me very unhappy and frustrated. That one day I might not be able to garden at all, is a terrible thought. It was that fear of compromised gardening that influenced my original evaluation of the publication. Instead of giving the book a high ranking that the tone of my review suggested, I had given it only 3 stars.Is it not possible to acknowledge that a book is well written and still only moderately recommend it, because of the off-putting nature of the subject matter?Should the ranking of any book take into consideration how it might be received by any unintended reader?Perhaps I am being much too philosophical. Perhaps I should focus only on the target audience for whom this book is recommended. Clearly, three potential readers believe that my original ranking decision was wrong. Since I understand that a philosophical explanation for my action will never be as effective as the strength of their reasonable queries, I have raised the rank of the review from 3 stars to 4.Allan Becker also reviews books for Bookpleasures.com

$REVIEW.: Visit Into the Night Reviews at Web: [...] or Facebook: [...] for great book reviews, new release updates, giveaways and more!!Tragically Flawed is a story about damaged people falling in love
 Riviera Benson has had a brutal, horrific life up until the point in time that she meets Benjamin 'Shan' Shandon
 The extent of what she has endured is extreme and it is almost hard to believe that she has managed to survive
 Her ability to withdraw to a safe place in her mind is really all that has saved her.Escaping a violent and abusive ex, Riviera finds herself in Beaver Creek, Colorado and lands herself a job painting murals, trompe l'oeil and other artistic finishes on the walls in the homes of the wealthy

 Happy to get lost in her work and fearful of her past catching up with her she doesn't mix widely.Shan is the owner of the most successful construction company in the region and crosses paths with Riviera through his work

 Their first couple of encounters are less than positive (to say the least) and yet an attraction blossoms between the two that neither of them fully understand, nor know how to react to.For me the relationship between the two moved a little too quickly to be realistic, particularly in light of Riviera's back ground
 Shan had a fiery temper and Riviera saw this a number of times, which I would have expected to be just too traumatic for her

 There were some steamy sex scenes between the two, although I thought these were a little over done, again particularly given Riviera's history.I didn't fully understand Shan's 'trauma' - well that's not right, I did understand it, but I didn't really believe the impact it had on him - there was just something missing for me
 There are some excellent characters in the story


 I particularly liked Amie and her passionate support of abused women

 She was the perfect friend to Riviera and certainly helped her get the support she needed to heal


 Marsha Sue was one nasty piece of work


 I would have liked something more concrete in the history between her and Shan to make some of her actions more realistic though
 Unlike with other books, I didn't find myself quite as invested in the characters and will admit to finding some of Shan's dialogue just a little too cheesy for my liking.Tragically Flawed was a relatively quick read

 It provided enough entertainment to keep me turning pages and I was happy with the way it ended.

I guess I must have that gene which likes to jump in and explore the personal psyche....I don't do these quizzes in magazines but the book is interesting and many of the answers are quite profound in their simplicity. I generally fall between two different styles and I find it curious as to why....exploring that, in itself, is a little enlightening.I'm sure Freud and Jung might think this is pure silly-ness, but they were men and who cares what they think... I'm going to take it to knitting class and do a few tests with my friends....Sometimes it's just fun to sit around and chat. I'm sure these tests will bring up even more interesting topics and take us on all sorts of unusual tangents.

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogHaving come into this series right in the middle with book #3 I will say that this is my favorite of the series, but I'm not sure if that counts for much.  PLAYER AND THE PRUDE is about Matt and Brooks.  We (at least I) met them in book 3.  Matt is Gabe's roommate, Gabe went on a couple of dates with Brooks.So Brooks is the player because he's a bit of a manwh ore, what with his rugged good looks, always dressed in the latest fashion and coming from a rich family.  Matt is the complete opposite.  He's geeky, really tall, maybe without the fashion sense gene.  Brooks "best friend" challenges him to get with Matt and Brooks never backs down from a challenge.I think what I loved the most about the connection between these two was the fact that Brooks was able to put down that mask he had to wear with others around him.  He was just himself, enjoying what he enjoyed and not feeling bad about it.  It was a process of discovery for both and not the "oh I'm gay" variety.  Brooks realized that the life he was leading was probably not the one that would make him happy.  Matt learned that after the oppression mentality that was ingrained in him and how he grew up, he had to let things go and enjoy life for what it was.  Taking pleasure and also accepting the pain that goes along with it.  They both had a great attitude to the changes that had to be made.And of course I can't leave out that it was hot, right?  Matt is a virgin but he has what he considers bad thoughts about Brooks.  He wants to spank him, slap him, choke him, tie him down, rough him up.  And after his internal battles he manages to do all that.  The rough se  x scene after he throws Brooks against the wall......'nuff said.As usual, I guess my complain is the I love yous, and in this case the lets get married way too soon in a relationship.  Although at least this book did seem to span a longer period of time than the previous book so I guess the relationship building was behind the pages, but I would've liked to see more of it to make the ending fit with the story for me.*Review copy provided by author

$REVIEW.: The cover art for this book always intrigued me, so at last I decided to pick it up and read it. I was not disappointed. This is the story of the petty nobility of 12th century Burgundy. With the political system of the province in a state of flux thanks to the minority of the Duke, one family, the Sauval, amasses power and wealth by robbing travelers and raiding neighboring baronies. The Red Keep is the stronghold of one such barony. It is raided by the Sauval and the Baron is put to the sword--only his daughter, Anne, is rescued by the noble Baron Roger and his men, among them a young page named Conan. In the aftermath of the attack, the damaged keep is left abandoned--the bone of contention around which the story revolves.The main character, Conan, is immediately sympathetic. He is strong, brave, and chivalrous to a fault, but young man that he is, he makes occasional bone-headed decisions that nearly cost him his life. As the story progresses, Conan's youthful naivete transforms into savvy adulthood as he carefully plans a strategy to thwart the Sauval.The character of Anne is also appealing. Though she is presented in fighting trim throughout the book, she is not given unrealistic strength or the ability to strike down fighting men twice her size--a common but ludicrous feature of much modern literature. Anne's true strength lies in her courage, her determination to regain her father's fief and her willingness to step outside of the expected female role, even in the face of difficult odds, for the sake of justice. In this, I thought she resembled St. Joan of Arc.Overall, I loved this book. The main characters were good and solid, and the antagonists were suitably detestable. The story itself and the writing are also first rate. Add to this the great black & white illustrations by Andrew Wyeth throughout, and you've got a real winner of a book, perfectly suited for kids 10 and up, but easily read and enjoyed by adults as well.

$review_text.: After putting up with Will's cheating for years, Jo finally starts to accept her attraction to her best friend, Matt
 Matt currently has a gf, but has no problem ditching her to spend time with Jo

 On one drunken night, one thing leads to another, and their once innocent friendship has gotten complicated

 Will is jealous because he knew the attraction was there all along and refuses to let Jo slip away so easily

 I didn't like the way Will was physically rough with Jo, and the fact that she enjoyed it


 It seemed out of place in the book

 To enjoy sexual roughness is not the same as having your estranged husband put his hands on you in a controlling way


 I had a problem with that part of the book, and thank God, the scene did not turn into a rape

 Although Matt and Jo are great together, Matt has a shady background and this causes issues for everyone involved


 Are the two really soulmates and can they really find their happily ever after?

$REVIEW.: The author wrote this more than 100 years ago.  It is available is several Kindle versions, including a version that is free, but this version is certainly worth the very small price.Gardiner (as does Schiller, in his history of this period), glosses over the collection of battles we call the Thirty Years war.  Those battles, themselves, are interesting, but what was going on behind the scenes in Vienna and other capitals was far more interesting.  Gardiner brings out this detail, including France's role in the later years of the conflict.Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War is a more complete history of this period, but reading Gardiner and Schiller is nonetheless a good place to start with an overview before reading Peter H. Wilson's more detailed work.

$REVIEW.: I've read a few of Brian Keene's books, enough that I can start picking favorites.  One of those favorites of mine is his zombie novel Dead Sea. I thought it was a great read and he brought some unique ideas he brought to the zombie genre. And it was bleak, very bleak.  Not too long after I read Dead Sea Keene announced a sequel, Entombed. I was excited, it was said to be not so much a sequel as another book set in that world. That sounded like a winner to me, I was ready for it. It took awhile for me to get a hold of it. Originally it was released as a lettered edition hardcover and limited edition hardcover. As much as I wanted to read it I just can't afford limited editions. So I was thankful when Deadite re-released it last year.Set in a world where the disease Hamlin's Revenge has turned most of the population into zombies. Entombed tells the story of a small group of survivors that have locked themselves away in a former military bunker. It provides plenty of protection from the zombies, but as supplies start to run out and under the reign of one man's self imposed leadership things turn ugly.  There's very little zombie action in this one, mainly in flashbacks to what brought the survivors to the bunker, but there is plenty of violence.  Personally I thought this was one of Keene's gorier books.I've often said that what makes Brian Keene stand out as a writer to me is the characters he creates.  In Entombed we see main character Peter as he goes to a very dark place inside himself in able to do the things he feels he needs to in order to survive. We are privy to his internal struggles, such as is he doing what he does to survive, or has it become something else. This book shows us that sometimes the scary stuff has nothing to with monsters or zombies, but can come from the people around you. Or inside yourself.I started out saying that Dead Sea is one of my favorite Keene novels, and I think Entombed ranks pretty close to it. Though not as great as Dead Sea, it is still a very good read.  Being that this is one of his later books, it goes to show that Brian Keene isn't slowing down or getting soft, with Entombed it almost seems the opposite is in order.

$REVIEW.: Please, ignore the reviews of those who can't read.  This is a DD book - that means domestic discipline.But, much more than that, it is a story of the relationship between a man and a woman who become husband and wife.  H to W:  &#34;Next time you are imaging [bad things in] my silence, your repeat those five words [&#34;Are you upset with me'] to me before filling your heart with guilt and worry.&#34;  Almost the defining plot of romance literature and relationships in the real word is lack of communications and the misunderstandings that flow from words not spoken, questions not asked.  How better all our domestic relationships would be if we talked and listened to our partners.He asks for her obedience too.  Sometimes he is and she is firmly and lovingly punished.

$REVIEW.: A few months ago, I got the opportunity to read my first book by Jus Accardo, which was Ruined, and I absolutely fell in love with her writing style and her characters! I was really excited when I read the synopsis for Rules of Survival. It sounded different from the NA books that I have read. I was pleasantly surprised and loved every second of this book!Kayla is on the run. She is wanted for her mom's murder. When she decides to come back to the murder scene to clear her name, she comes face-to-face with a cocky bounty hunter that will make her feel things that she's never felt before. From the moment Shaun puts the handcuffs on her, her world will never be the same. Lies, betrayals, secrets ... Together, they embark on a journey where playing with the rules is the only way out ...This book was a great reading escape! From the first page to the last, I loved following Kayla and Shaun's journey. The plot kept me turning the pages and Kayla and Shaun had a great chemistry that was real, fun and sexy. What I loved the most about their story is that there was no insta-love. Their relationship grew slowly and it was actually interesting to see them fall for one another. Kayla and Shaun were lovable characters and they completed each other well. I loved how Kayla confided in Shaun. Next to him she felt safe and he knew more about her than anybody else did. After running and hiding from the world, Kayla finally found someone she could trust.Shaun ... Shaun ... Shaun ... Eeeeeep! What a cocky, smart-a**, sexy bounty hunter! He had me laughing and swooning! He really was an amazing character and I loved the way he took care of Kayla. He made her promises and he kept them until the very end. From the moment he embarked on this crazy journey with her, he never left her side. After all the craziness in her life, Kayla needed to find somebody like him.Overall, this story was packed with twists and turns, fascinating characters and exciting moments! This book kept me interested until the very and even if the ending felt a bit to rushed in my opinion, I still loved the way the story ended.I give, Rules of Survival, by Jus Accardo 4 exciting, action-packed, page-turning, suspenseful stars!

$review_text.: Phryne Fisher is not looking forward to Mr and Mrs Butler going away for a fortnight while she has her sister, Eliza and her partner Alice staying with her. Fearing that she will have a disorganised and noisy time of it she decides to accept a request from P&O; to go on a cruise to see if she can discover who is stealing passengers' jewellery.She takes her companion, Dot Williams with her, and looks forward to a quiet two weeks with a little light detecting on the side. When she arrives on board she is given a fabulous sapphire necklace to wear so that she can act as bait for the thief and she is seated at a table with a group of passengers who have been on previous cruises when robberies have taken place. Dot, meanwhile eats with the servants and crew so that she can find out whether there is anyone suspicious.This is a fascinating story with plenty of suspects and some intriguing relationships between passengers and crew. I loved the descriptions of life on board a cruise ship and the way the relationships between the characters are brought to life. The book is well written with sparkling dialogue and many humorous touches. Many of the characters will find their lives have changed - for better or worse - before the end of the story when the villains are unmasked.

$REVIEW.: This book is well written and worth reading. As it explores the Cluny monastery, it covers a number of other subjects including politics, life styles, art, and of course religion. The prose is creative and accessible, and I especially liked the focus on architecture and art. The book really shines when the author rhapsodizes about tympanums, columns and sculptures found in the medieval churches. This book is even more valuable because so little of Cluny remains today, making this an essential read if you're interested in understanding more about medieval life and religion. My only quibble is that there aren't more images of churches, art etc. There are a few pencil drawings, but not nearly enough. I made up for it by googling the images as I read, and surprisingly many of them can be found online. In any case, it's only a small problem. I'd have given this book 4 1/2 stars rather than 5 because of it if the rating system would have allowed it.

$review_text.: STONED is a story of being stuck, literally, having feelings for someone who is unaware and does not reciprocate.Best friends and chariot racers Marc and Tarquin are competitive on the race course and in the bedroom.  They often share in their posts, race conquests which works out fine for Marc who secretly craves any shared contact with Tarquin.  While they can share women, Marc is afraid he will lose his best friend if he tells Tarquin he would rather just have him in the bedroom.When Tarquin arranges for them to share a particular beautiful woman, he does not realize that the woman&#8217;s husband is a powerful sorcerer.  When the sorcerer catches his wife with the friends, he curses them and turns them into stone statues.  The two spend centuries as statues that can only communicate with one another and only get 24 hours each year to be free of their curse.  They spend their free time researching their curse and trying to figure out how to break it, but it appears hopeless.This story was sweet and definitely unique. The author did a great job putting a new spin on the classic &#8220;being in love with your best friend&#8221; story. I enjoyed the fact that while one character was fairly clear about his feelings, the other one had to take some time to figure out what he was feeling and what he wanted.  The friendship is expressed very genuinely as is the hurt experienced by Marc when he realizes he has to live his own life.I thought the progression of the relationship was well written, especially with so few pages to write it in.  This was a very fun story to read.Reviewed by Lynnfor TheRomanceReviews.com

$REVIEW.: I am a big fan of Andrew Wommack. He's one of the best Bible teachers alive today and his style is straight forward and to the point. This book is an excellent guide to help anyone who wants to experience the presence of the Lord all the time! Now that may sound like a lofty claim, but it's absolutely possible to know the presence of God at every moment of every day.To have this as our lifestyle, we need to develop habits and routines that will keep us in God's Word and knowing His truth. Andrew helps point out the ways we can keep God at the forefront, especially in our demanding and distracting culture.I highly recommend this book. I have the Kindle edition, which I really enjoy since I can take it with me when I travel.

I hated the way the author left you hanging with so many unanswered questions.  However, I would recommend this book because it truly was good just poorly finished I honestly hope there's a sequel to it because this novel has the potential of being a good read if the author can pick up where the book left off at.

$REVIEW.: The author offers critiques, but rarely offers a better idea or redesign
It's the same with his other book about home page usability
This is a severe shortcoming.A related problem is that some of his criticisms are just unfounded or - in my humble opinion - just plain wrong
And I'm coming to the conclusion that that's why he doesn't offer solutions - a web site is a tradeoff between competing goals
It's actually not that difficult to find "problems" with sites; it's much more difficult to fix those problems and find that sweet spot.

I still felt no connection to any of the characters because overall they were all grimey,sneaky and vindictive and none of them showed any kind of growth. At times the drama became a little too much and actually gave me a headache.Some things were very predictable and by the ending I was just glad it was all over.This series had one heck of a storyline but it was very draining.

$REVIEW.: The author does a great job in accumulating information. I thought the book had a neat appendix which might be very useful for any college student. The book highlights the events, which might have led to Ivan IV. becoming a cruel ruler but also makes it very clear that it was difficult to rule Russia in the 16th century and that it was typical for the times that rulers enforced their concepts with at least some cruelty. This even more so since Ivan not only became the first Czar of Russia but also conquered vast lands, thereby transforming Russia into a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional state.Author Charles River Editors does also a fine job in portraying the complicated balances of power, between Grand Prince of Moscow/Czar, the mighty boyars, and the Russian church. I truly appreciated the many pictures, which added liveliness to the topic but thought that the book could have been a bit longer.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger

Little notes on the side commenting on the things he has said and wrote and little stories about the events.  it is those marginal writings that are the real meat and potatoes of the book.It is an odd thing to read this book and to remember the times when one waited for disaster to overtake our team, knowing deep inside that it would come.If you want to get a real grasp of what it was like, then this book is for you.

$review_text.: This woman was just invited to host the EOTM Awards and given an award for "writing" an inspirational book. I guess they mean this piece of trash literature. At the awards show there were terrible technical issues regarding the reading of the various nominees names prior to announcing the winner in each of 50 categories. She had the audacity to state to the audience that the nominees' names for each award really weren't important, that what mattered was just the winners. If it were not for nominees, there would be no awards program. Naturally SHE was a recipient of one of the awards. But for what? Really? She was a terrible MC. Thankfully her co-MC stated to the audience, when urged to skip the nominee names, "No, I care about the nominees." He insisted on being given the names before moving on to announcing the winners.  Good for him.I found out later that she is famous for hiring a porn star to help her make a sex tape and there is an online picture of her doing a lap dance for a man at some place she was introducing. I am thoroughly disgusted by her behavior, but I'm equally disgusted by the fact that so many people would hold up such a person to be a role model or give her an award for anything or a five-star review, for crying out loud.Oh and she thought Trevon Martin was a woman she once met or heard of - really?Obviously I did NOT buy this book and would never recommend it to anyone ever!

$REVIEW.: Rusty and Sean have been best friends since childhood. They are both out gay males, and just past college in this story collection.Backstory: Sean's father, and Air Force officer never approved of his son's sexuality and had been verbally and physically abusing him throughout his childhood. Sean left home at age 16 when he came out officially and his father's beating put him in the hospital. Rusty's parents--who knew of Rusty's sexuality, and also knew Rusty and Sean were lovers, took Sean in.Actual story:Sean gets a job offer in Boston, far from New Orleans and Rusty's supportive family. There is tension regarding this move because it requires Rusty to give up his job and move, but Sean wants this because he needs to feel as if he has made a success of himself. He suffers cripling shyness and insecurity as a result of his father's abuse,. Also, Sean longs to be seen as a professional, and a man, and feels guilty that Rusty's parents have supported him so long.Sean returns to New Orleans from a two-month probation/training period. The plan was for Rusty to move to Boston when Sean earned the full-time position, which he has. Now they are supposed to drive their belonings north, and both men are unsure. Rusty is afraid that Sean--who never went out without him before--has made a bunch of new friends. And, perhaps new lovers? Two months is a long time--could Sean have been unfaithful? Sean misunderstands Rusty's new desire to use protection--has Rusty been unfaithful? They really agonize for a bit. Then the get on with their lives together.With money tight, Rusty makes a snap decision to spend too much entering them into a drag queen competition on Halloween. The prizes were too good to pass up, and he knows Sean--with his delicate features and lithe build--will be a natural for the contest. Sean has to put aside his fears and go with it. Rusty has been so lonely and getting ready for the contest Sean notices Rusty's finally smiling with real joy for the first time since leaving New Orleans.Visiting home for Christmas, Rusty and Sean finally see the difference between themselves. They are guests--and this is unsettling as well as empowering. Their new life in Boston feels like the real deal, and they are weathering the storm very well, together.Sean gets nervous that he's going to be fired on the eve of his wedding to Rusty. With family stress, on top of the job stress, Sean is fit to burst, as is Rusty--but Rusty realizes that he's in a great life with Sean. Sure, he's had trouble finding steady work, but--having been on his own with Sean for half a year now--his father looks at him as a man, not a son, for the first time. They muddle through with even better success then they had considered.My Impressions:As a whole these stories recount a happy, fairly-well-adjusted gay couple first starting out on their own. They are serious, and they are supportive and they struggle with doubts and they cling to each other. They are open and caring--insofar as they can be. Sean struggles more with the openness, but he works hard to be there (and more) for Rusty. These two are truly fun to take a fictional stroll with.I was never in doubt that I'd enjoy this story collection. I have a few gripes about typos, but they didn't bother too much. My biggest criticism is that I'd like to see these stories a bit more fleshed out--particularly the first one. Days go by with lots of important conversations and yet we only get the final decision.Still, it's got a ton of heart and Sean and Rusty are compelling characters with a lovely story.I received a review copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for my honest opinion.

$REVIEW.: This book essentially a pamphlet outlining the principles according to  which the author developed his successful fitness training system called Turbulence Training.  Actually he emphasizes "fat burning" in particular, but I consider this a fitness system. The Turbulence Training workouts are sold separately on the web.The concept can be summarized as: "train harder AND smarter, but for shorter time."  The system as outlined in this book combines: (1) non-competing supersets with minimal equipment emphasizing multi-joint exercises, and (2) brief interval training sessions.Using these two rapid-fire strength and short-burst interval endurance methods, and introducing constant variety, the author says his disciples get dramatic results while spending far less time than people typically spend running and lifting weights.  The "research proven" aspect from the subtitle of the book appears to be that the author emphasizes aspects of training that have been found successful in experiments, rather than that the author has done controlled experimental research on his own system. But this is never made entirely clear.I have no reason to doubt the claims of efficiency and effectiveness.  I've purchased the turbulence training system downloaded from the web and used it for several months and found it to be as close as anything I've ever found to a gold standard for fitness training.  It uses minumum equipment, it is relatively fun to do, it has a uniquely intelligent and manageable progression and variation scheme built in, it is very easy to follow, and it gets great results.  It develops strength, muscle endurance, anaerobic endurance, and even some degree of aerobic endurance, and it cuts body fat.  It is not an optimal bodybuilding system, strength building system, or endurance training system, but it is about as close as I think you can get to a system optimally balanced to provide all of these qualities at once and take someone from fat to fit.The problem is that this book doesn't contain the system.  Nor does this book even cite the research it claims to support its methods.  There are few real details about how varying the parameters of the routines influence the training effects.There are constant claims of "research says ..." and "a study showed ..." but none of the research is cited and none of the researchers ever given credit.  So it fails as a book about how to do Turbulence Training in any detail, and it fails as a supported rationale or textbook of even the most emaciated kind for the principles.This is a shame, because I have no doubt that the author does follow the research and does honestly try to incorporate experimental data to improve his programs, which I admire.  But when he writes about it, the reader is left to rely entirely on his interpretations, he becomes a guru rather than someone describing research.This makes for a lot more work for readers who might want to read the sources for themselves, it leaves the reader to rely entirely on the author's own interpretations of data.  Worse, I think it also tempts the author to selectively cite only research that supports his program because there is less chance that readers will find for themselves the equivocations and debates that are usually found in the research program itself.  Differences of opinion in the literature that might seem like quibbles to the author might be important to some subset of his readers, such as endurance athletes who are considering adding Turbulence Training to their regimen for some reason.For me this book, about "research proven Turbulence Training," would have been far stronger if it actually cited the research it was based on, and took a little time to describe its context.  Either that, or included an actual Turbulence Training workout, or perhaps both.  Some of the space taken up by testimonials should have been used for substance of either sort.  That's what I expect in a book that I pay for, not testimonials.  I expect either more substance or better organized material than I can find on the web.So if you are looking for some reason for a checklist of solid, effective fitness training principles, without the training program, or you are doing Turbulence Training and looking for a quick read to help motivate you, this book may suffice.  But for substantive information about the system, support for the principles, or details of the program, you will have to look elsewhere and this book will disappoint.

$review_text.: Books featuring hotties dabbling in the MMA arena are becoming all the rage and with Against the Cage Ms. Halston has joined in the fun.  With this debut release the action is fast-paced, the sexual encounters steamy, and the characters are at times likable and at other times annoying.  On a whole though I found this an enjoyable read with just a few quibbles that kept me from falling in love with it completely.Growing up Chrissy was a studious nerd who yearned for adventure.  She knew just where to find it by following her troublemaking brother and his best friend Jack as they went from one drunken sex party to another.  Unfortunately her fun always ended before it started as Jack saw it as his duty to protect her and always kept her out of harm's way which enforced her belief that he saw her as a child.  As she saw him as something much more she became bitter and disillusioned and ultimately moved on.  This led to a tragic event that saw her bruised inside and out, her father dead, and her brother full of anger at her.  For years she ran away from the pain of the past until her brother's trouble had her coming home and dealing with her past head-on.  Chrissy's no longer the doormat she once was but she hasn't grown up completely either as she occasionally pouted when she didn't get her way, jumped to conclusions, and still held grudges over things that happened when they were young.  She's definitely a woman when it comes to her sexual desires for Jack but her actions at times were childish.  She insisted she didn't need a keeper but Jack was always there as she repeatedly stumbled into danger.  Chrissy may have left me frustrated more often than not but she was memorable and left a lasting impression everywhere she went throughout the story.Jack has always cared for Chrissy and was caught off guard by his ever deepening feelings for her.  He missed her all the years she was gone and doesn't want to waste any more time dwelling on the past.  There's a big barrier to their burgeoning relationship though as she detests fighting and he loves his time in the cage when he's not on duty as a policeman.  Her past has her terrified of the violence and it takes a lot for him to convince her that what he does isn't who he is.  He's still the man who goes out of his way to keep her safe as he's very much an Alpha Male.  That doesn't mean he's afraid to show his softer more romantic side as he's the first to admit his feelings for her and his hopes for their future.  Combine this sweet and sexy side with his gritty demeanor in the cage and you have a very drool-worthy hero.  Throw in his dirty sex-talk and I was left practically panting!Along with Chrissy and Jack, a lot of time is spent on her brother Slade and the dangerous underground fighting he does that's leading to permanent physical damage.  Chrissy became hysterical over this issue often and I felt like it got swept under the table as the story progressed.  I would've liked to see it dealt with more as the possible outcomes had me on the edge of my seat.  Slade is a cocky character who's extremely protective of women since the issue of violence against women affected his family years ago.  This issue permeates the entire story in fact and is the catalyst for Chrissy's return to town and sets up a possible romance for Slade.  The issue is dealt with in a realistic and respectful way without being too heavy-handed but also felt rushed amongst the overall storyline.From start to finish I found this to be an engaging and energetic read with its vivid detailing of MMA fighting where blood copiously flows and you can almost hear bones snap.  The dangers are apparent and the strain this puts on Chrissy and Jack's relationship is obvious and hangs over them until almost the end.  Along with the intensity of these fights there's super steamy sexual interludes and equally hot foreplay.  Once they're reunited these two have trouble keeping their hands off each other even when they're arguing.  The sexual tension is unrelenting and you anticipate them jumping each other every minute.  The overall story though needs a bit of polish as the flow felt jumpy, going from one event to another at the drop of a hat.  Too many characters were introduced throughout the story which was overwhelming at times.  The conclusion of the story was a bit rushed which led to the author telling us instead of showing us how Chrissy and Jack ended up after an out of the blue event put their HEA in jeopardy.  Barring those issues this is a good debut for Ms. Halston and has me wanting to read more of her in the future, particularly this group of friends and family as some of them captured my attention.  Readers who enjoy a steamy read with rapid-fire dialogue will definitely get all that and more with Against the Cage.

Some authors seem to have a specific genre they stick to, but Mr. White seems like he can write about anything. I'm not a huge fan of tales with vampires in them.. but overall this was a pretty good book. I'd recommend this book to those who are into science fiction/horror.

$review_text.: This book is different in it's approach than any other care book I've seen.  The author argues for, and shows how to do, quasi-natural to naturalist setups for many common serpents.The difference is that most books do not touch natural vivaria for snakes.  There has been some recognition of thier benefits with lizards and amphibians, but little to no discussion of thier role in snake husbandry.The book covers the basics of setting up different types of vivaria--i.e. desert and tropic, etc. and list some plants, and substrate mixes that are suitable.  He then goes into some particular snakes he feels are well suited for this sort of display.  This means the books focuses on small through midsized, diurnal snakes, as they are the best display animals in a natural set up.  This excludes many common species, but includes many species equally suited to a beginner--some of which are actually more suited than many more popular species, and hey, it opens up new ideas.These setups, in my experince (I've been doing them for several years) make keeping snakes much more rewarding.  I've tried the LAM method (sterile boxes, wood shavings, and a heat source) and it's not that much fun. It has it's place, but it should emphatically not be the approach employed by the average hobbyist.  Allowing snakes a fairly large cage, with structures and possibly plants, appropriate to it's size and behavior, greatly enhances thier captive behavior.  A boa constrictor can just sit in a 4X2X1 foot cage all day, with little to do, and live.  Or, you can put it in a 4X2X3 cage with thick branches, places to explore, ect. and have a much more interesting captive.SOme of the book is common sense, some of it is fairly detailed, but for a novice keeper, it is a must have--and frankly, it's a good idea for many more advanced keepers.The approach advocated does have limits; truly large snakes (big boas, burmese, etc.) are not suited for planted tanks, because they crush anything smaller than a tree.  Furthermore, I wish the book dealt with quasi-natural setups more--they're my preferred approach, and more flexible.  You simply use wood shavings, or a burrowable mix of sand and soil, and structure large branches and rocks in the cage.  No plants, true, so not as pretty, but provides much of the same stimulus and is easier by far. I also wish he dealt more with noctural displays; he mentions some ideas (i.e. use redlights) but he doesn't deal with ways to make truly amazing noctural displays--e.g. plants that flower at night, etc.But still, this book gives you info you will not get in any other avialable book for snakes.  It also advocates an approach that makes keeping snakes truly much more pleasent.  I heartily reccomend it for anyone, particularly new people, or people who use the LAM method and are burning out.  It opens new ideas, better ideas.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book that I have read by Ms. Terman, and I thoroughly enjoyed it right from the beginning. I will definitely be getting the first book in this series so I can find out how the first couple met. The exchanges that took place between the main characters were great, and many parts that had me laughing out loud. If you like steamy romances that are wrapped around sports, then you will enjoy this story.Chloe Nelson is finally making her dream of owning her own bakery come true, but news of a bakery chain that is well known is opening up a new store down the street from her bakery that may crush her dreams. She needs to find a way to bring in the clientele and keep them coming if she wants to keep the bakery afloat. When her sister comes up with the perfect plan she is determined to try anything.Griffin Lange is the Captain of a professional hockey team, and he just got himself caught up in some trouble. When the DA offers him a deal he decides to take it instead of possible jail time. But he never expected to do anything more than put in the hours working for Chloe, then walk away when the hours are completed. To keep the truth of the real reason why Griffin is working for Chloe from the media they agree to a fake relationship that will only last until hockey season is over. They can make it look good to the public for a few months and walk away with no regrets. It will be so easy to accomplish. Right?I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Stacey Coverstone's novel High Lonesome is a sweet romance set in the world of saddles and sagebrush


It is a well-written and pleasant story that tosses in a dash of suspense to enhance the conflict and create an underlying tension that will keep readers involved in the story all the way to the end
Not only do we wonder who Beth is and whether or not she already has a husband in her life, but we also need to know what happened to leave her stranded in the desert.I thought that the mystery around Beth's identity was quite well done
I wanted for her to regain her past, but at the same time, I didn't want anything to separate Scott and Beth, who are obviously meant for each other


It is not just Beth's lost memory that provides an obstacle between them, though; there is also "the other woman," who is, as in many romantic plots, cold and professional and somewhat unpleasant


She is not the villain, but she is certainly someone that the reader can dislike.The climax of the story was just a hair disappointing for me, but that is more due to my penchant for violence and mayhem than any weakness in the plot


If we had been given the chance to know the villain of the story a little bit better and to build up this threat beforehand, it may have been more satisfying; instead, he is more of an afterthought than a true miscreant.Overall, I found High Lonesome to be a sweet and diverting read


It is a formula romance with a twist - just enough suspense and danger to keep you hooked a

$review_text.: Summary: A young prince and his mother's handmaiden go on a short journey where they first get tangled up in their own emotions then become embroiled in the (evil) uncle's rebellion to take over the throne. Typical fantasy/sci-fi story. Not many twists but some very nice descriptions.Could be Better... (These might not actually bother anybody else.):- There are too many science fiction aspects to categorize this as purely fantasy and too many fantasy elements to categorize it as pure science fiction. The mix is reasonably well done, but still comes off as odd. If there are spaceships why are the palace guards riding around on flying mounts? Tradition? That only goes so far when it comes down to security.- The two romance threads are ... rushed. These people barely looked at each other, then they're getting it on? Did I miss something?- The grandmother sounding like yoda just irked me.Neutral:- Most of the book reads like a typical YA novel, but there's a surprising amount of blood and gore. &#34;Adult&#34; scenes are handled tastefully. Call me overly sensitive if you wish; I just have a pet peeve about reading about characters trying to hold their intestines in.- Descriptions are beautiful, but I feel like some are missing. After the whole book, I don't have a sense of what a Darracian actually looks like. They've got tails, they're broad, strong, etc.... and the lesser cast is red, short, delicate?, etc- If you've ever read Titus Andronicus by William Shakespeare, you basically have the ending. It was rather amusing, but I don't think that was the intent.Good:- Well-written, nearly error free.- The descriptions that are included are quite vivid.- The fight scenes are well done.- The reader generally does come to sympathize with the young prince and his plight.- It's good enough to make one want to read on.Conclusion: I was sent both Book 1 and Book 2, so after reading a few other books, I'll probably return and see what happens next.

$review_text.: I liked this book, and it gave me a lot to think about.This book is extremely ambitious in scope. It's trying to be both a handbook for working for people with Asperger's AND a handbook for employers of people with Asperger's. These are two drastically different demographics, and in my experience, usually books that try to bite off this much fail. Fortunately, this one doesn't.I think that the reason why this book works is that Rudy is a master in being able to translate Aspergian behavior into terms that can be understood by everyone, but that still ring true to people with Asperger's. She has obviously spend thousands of hours analyzing almost every aspect of autism and Asperger's, from many different perspectives, and we all benefit by having such a readable book.I read the Kindle edition, and it's very well formatted, especially for being an adaptation of a print book with a lot of specialized formatting.Pros:+Great job advice for anyone with autism+Good for employers to understand their autistic employees+Easy, quick read+Extremely informativeCons:-It is a short, quick read, so it doesn't cover everything in exhaustive detail-Has a lot of information that is in other books (but this one is more readable)

$REVIEW.: Come Fly With Me follows Allison, a beautiful 29-year-old art gallery owner, as she struggles with the sudden death of her father and the task of temporarily running his billion-dollar company

Unlike most women her age, Allison's love life is nonexistent, largely due to her strong-willed nature and reluctance to let a man get close to her

The last thing she expects is her attraction to Alex, a brilliant, cocky and sexy employee of her dad's company, who is also one of the candidates for the CEO position she must fill


Despite his charm and obvious affections for her, Allison keeps her guard up, partly due to her uncertainty of his motives, but mostly because she's simply not the type of gal to bend easily
Alex, however, is confident he can soften her up, and Allison soon finds that as far as stubbornness is concerned, she may have met her match.I enjoyed this book and found its characters colorful and intriguing


I loved the depth of the character development and appreciated the insightful flashbacks, as well as the witty dialogue (my favorite part of the book) and the pacing of the story

$review_text.: I read this book hoping to get a little clarity as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys in the first book of the series. It didn't work. And I'm still not sure whether the Atlanteans (the &#34;aliens&#34;) are trying to save the human race or destroy it. At two or three points in the story, Mr. Riddle tries to recap - via reflective conversations between the protagonists - what the Atlanteans were trying to do 70,000 years ago when they first arrived on Earth, what they're trying to do now, why some humans are trying to help them while others are trying to stop them ..... but things never become clear (to me, anyway). As I mentioned in my review of book 1, the underlying plot line seems to be a good one, but there's way too much complexity and interweaving in the various sub-plots, making it a difficult story to follow and understand.I'll say this for Mr. Riddle, however: he's got me interested in finding out how this convoluted story ends up. Which, of course, is supposed to happen in book 3 of the trilogy. Which, of course, he hopes I'll buy. And, though I've given each of the first two books only 3 stars, I probably will buy the third one. The price is right.

$REVIEW.: You need to put down what you&#8217;re reading, right now, and read Making Faces


I&#8217;m not sure how she does it but Amy Harmon is able to pull you into the world she&#8217;s created so well and you feel like you know the characters and you experience the same beautiful highs and horrible lows they do
It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re part of your family or your best friend
 You don&#8217;t try to figure out what&#8217;s going to happen by the end of the book, you just get pulled in to experience it with them

Ambrose and Fern are beautifully written and you root for them the entire time

You would count yourself lucky to know someone like Bailey and Rita is one of those rare gorgeous friends that you don&#8217;t hate and doesn&#8217;t have a mean bone in her body


So, put down the book you&#8217;re reading and give yourself a treat by getting to know Ambrose and Fern
You will not be disappointed and you'll start looking for more Amy Harmon books

 I guarantee it.

$REVIEW.: Many people suffering from depression or bipolar disorder find that depression remains a fact of life despite medication and psychotherapy. Is it depressing to find that you can't conquer your depression and make it go away? Well... yes! But... I found this book immensely helpful in a different way. It doesn't promise to help you find ways to get RID of your depression. But it has fifty practical, well-informed and creative tips how to keep functioning in the best possible way, depression and all. Which is something that many people need to do... to keep their life on track as best they can, even when things are tough.I learnt some very practical and helpful strategies, and felt encouraged in reading the author's experiences with depression and mood swings. She really knows what it's like - no false promises, no glib solutions, but down-to-earth advice on how to better live with depression.Warmly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Jim Hughes has written an excellent book on the complexities of married life.  Each chapter starts with a word starting with the letter C and encourages the reader to cultivate their marriage and keep their wedding vows strong.  It would be a great tool to use in a small group setting and is great to use as a couple.  The bullet points at the end of each chapter helps each couple think about their marriage andd ways they can make it stronger.

$review_text.: I really loved the Descent series, so of course, I was excited to get Sacrificed in Shadow.  However, while it's a really good book, something about it did not sit right with me.  I'm going to make a quick list of things that I liked and didn't like because my review will be too wordy otherwise.Things I liked:-Pace was fast-Plot was interesting, complex, and kept me intrigued-The series crossover was handled well without "trying too hard"-It was difficult to put down.  I read it in one night.-The writing was greatThings I didn't like:-The fact that James didn't show up until over halfway through the book-The characters were off:*  Elise was too emotional, not because she has Eve's empathy, but because she just didn't react to things with her usual toughness.  She also lost what should have been fairly easy fights for her and freaked out during some fights rather than thinking before she acted. She also (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) slept with an ex-football player/cop that honestly grossed me out.  He was creepy, in my opinion, and didn't seem like Elise's type. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS OVER)*  James, on the other hand, would say one thing, then do another.  I don't see why he insists that he will make her forgive him, then does stuff behind her back again.-Elise and James' relationship.  It's just bleak.  I guess they will get their happy ending together, but I wish the author would show some progress in their relationship.  It seems to be getting worse, instead.-Some inconsistency.  Elise is supposed to be able to tell what people are feeling because she can sense their bodies' reactions due to her demon powers. But there were times she could, and times she couldn't.  For instance, she could tell what James felt, to an extent, when he was in Hell tattooing her in a past book, but she couldn't read him at all when they finally saw each other again.  It was inconsistent.I guess my main problem was with the characters.  To me, they were off in this book, but the story was great, the action interesting, the plot well done, and so on.  It deserves four stars.

$review_text.: What a beautiful book. If you are a woman and struggling with who you are, or where you are going, you need to pick up this book and read it! They wove true stories of women from the bible who in their time suffered many trials, especially by being a woman. With Faith in Christ all things are made possible. No matter how far gone you think you are and don't feel like forgiveness will be yours, Look at the woman taken in adultery. As Christ put it in John 8:7 "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." We all have skeletons in our closets, but if we look to Christ, and hear his words "go, and sin no more" we can have the confidence to get up, brush ourselves off and move forward with Christ trusting us to do what is right. We may still have those days where forgiveness looks so far out of reach.......In this book it explains why it is not and how you can obtain the peace and comfort you need while being a woman in these Latter Days.Being out of work for so long and having some personal struggles right now in my life, this book has opened my eyes and gives me the strength to not give up and move on with my life, it could be worse. Personally I think bishops should have this book on hand to give women who come to them and are struggling. Please pick up this book and read it as often as you can! Learn about Christ's Gift to "YOU".

$REVIEW.: **First I will say I had difficulties at times** the Hero was HOT *of course*, even when ya wanted to beat the ever living shit out of him for some of his dominate, alpha, bossiness! Avery was very tolerant in ways I could never be...I am going to say in the same breath though, he is just as lovable...circumstances  being what they were, caused this...finding this out 3/4ths of the way through the book, would've been helpful to know that before hand LOL!!! ***I don't find that to be a spoiler, just a definite encouragement to continue on with the story*** since I did ALMOST!! discontinue reading it...I get in moods at times while reading...LOL!**NOW not to be a Grammar Nazi** normally speaking, I hate them...the average grammar nazi in my opinion from reading reviews & then the books the critique, is usually beyond harsh,Bitchy & down right unrealistic in there quest to read &#34;THE PERFECT BOOK&#34;...there is no one perfect, LOTS of work goes into writing these stories & whether its self published or not, I take that into account...unless it just reads like a drunk teenagers fantasy I support the authors regardless of grammar issues if I am caught up into the story...I applaud the authors for there much deserved 5 star ratings for great story telling...that being said...you`ll have to forgive me for saying the only reason this didn't get a 5 star rating, is because this book was riddled with errors..the spelling was hummmm bad :( ....I being the type to over look stuff like this, was at times so frustrated, again that being said I DID ENJOY THIS STORY!!!!!! It was worth the frustrations & I do look forward to book 2 if there is going to be one....as it does look like it to be the possible beginning to a new series?? hum lets hope..GREAT GREAT GREAT Characters!! the boys are all HOT! a long with the sweet gals *a.k.a possible future heroines?&#34;Would I recommend this book to friends?

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this series!!!!Ok so let me start with, you do not have to read the first two to understand and enjoy Sweet Forty- Two. However, there are characters a parts of the story line that come from the first two.It's no secret I fell in love with book #1 Ten Days of Perfect. This was Andrea Randall's first book. It was good&#8230; really good. Well, with each book Randall gives us a bit more of who she is as a writer. She shows a little more heart and a little more of what goes on up in that head of hers.So fast forward to me reading Sweet 42. There was no way i wouldn't like it. I just knew. What I wasn't prepared for is the direction Andrea Randall took this story. She pulled out all the stops and stripped herself bare as a writer. This sort of thing doesn't happen in serial books. I mean we are talking this is worth reading as a stand alone. It is that good. Randall carefully scratches at the exterior of your heart so as not to damage it but enough to make you feel the characters angst and their struggles.Georgia, the female m/c is quirky and animated-- to mask her deep rooted fear of becoming something unknown. I love her edge and carefully constructed persona. But the sweetness of her true generosity and selflessness subtly plays in your peripheral visual. Enough to grab you attention and make you want to find out more about her.Regan. Oh sweet Regan. He is casually and carefree sexy. You want to hold your hand out to him, to reassure him. He's strong and manly enough not to hide his vulnerability. But broken enough to be cautious and unsure of his actions.I have to mention Amanda, Georgia's mom, her part in the story while small in appearing in the actual plot of the story, she was monumental. Her clarity amongst the unknown (I don't want to spoil what that is) actually fuelled Georgia and Regan's relationship. She was an unexpected hero-- an amazing hero. Her confident resolve was proof that the stigmas and negativity surrounding mental health and mental wellness need to evolve and need more understanding.Throughout the story, i couldn't get it out of my head that although the mental illness that Amanda lived with wasn't the surrounding point of the story, it could to be denied its presence. It melded the story together. It also was a significant reminder that everyone has a bit of 'nonsense' in their life. We all face the unknown. We all face the possibility of not knowing who we will be tomorrow or how we will live tomorrow. The whisper of mental illness in Sweet 42 screamed endless possibilities, second chances, understanding and living life with your heart to keep your mind open.Sweet 42 is a must read for its beauty. Andrea Randall will make your heart sing, embrace nonsense and fall in love with life.

$REVIEW.: This collection of three novellas reminded me a lot of Heinlein's later work--but in a contemporary form with self-referential parody. These stories are just a whole lot of fun to read. Fields knows how to write humor, action, and even schmaltzy romance with a verve that's just enjoyable for the linguistic center of the brain. He knows geekdom, and presents it from the perspective of someone who lives in it and not a wannabe anthropologist talking about those &#34;weird people in costumes at that convention last month&#34;. This is whole-hearted and unapologetic geek/nerd revelry. My only complaint is that Fields occasionally can't seem to make up his mind as to whether he's writing humor or something that has more depth and those competing interests occasionally feel they're intruding upon one another instead of being woven into a single tapestry. I'm hoping we'll see more of these characters in a novel-length story where the author will be able to do that weaving.

$REVIEW.: This was my first work by Vivi Anna that I've read & honestly it wasn't quite as bad as the reviews make it out to be. Yes, I do agree with some things, but this work is better than some novellas out there & I have read a lot!First off, the characters were solid & story line as well as the plot were well executed. However, being a novella, the novella did move at a fast pace & I didn't really like the fact that the two protagonists just jumped right into bed. But how many romance novels doesn't do that?! I would have liked a bit more relationship development between Olivia & Garrick. Despite that, if you can get over the H/h having sex so suddenly, the story was quite enjoyable. Thrown in are suspense, action, lush & sensual sex scenes. However, the ending is a cliff hanger depending on how the reader interprets it. This novella is more of a introduction to Vivi Anna's novella, Hungry Like the Wolf. In Hungry Like the Wolf, the reader is thrown deeper into Olivia & Garrick's world.Overall, I give Bad to the Bone 4 solid stars. This was a good effort from the author. I enjoyed it & has downloaded Hungry Like the Wolf after finishing this novella. Therefore, give this novella a try. It's FREE & if you happen to not like it, delete it off your Kindle. Don't get discouraged by a couple bad reviews.**NOTE: Look at the 'Liked' button. Sometimes that speaks volumes over the reviews :)

$review_text.: My heart went out to Kylie right in the first paragraph I read

 Whispered promises to a gravesite...the only person you've ever been able to trust and depend on is gone...if you can related, Caisey will tear your heart out page one
 From that moment, I was invested in the success and failure of Kylie Ryans, and hoping for the former

"I'm going to Nashville like we talked about
 Even though no one else was around, she lowered her voice to a whisper,  I'm going to make you proud, I promise."She takes off to Nashville to try to pursue her dreams, and in doing so leaves behind the only friend she has left


 But, as Jason Alden will tell you in his music, in Nashville, "it's a crazy town full of neon dreams, everybody plays and everybody sings" - so you have to be that one-in-a-million and/or be in the right place at the right time, singing the right song.The country music fan in me loved this

 I just went to Nashville for the first time and I felt like I was back there
 Walking the area where you can hear live music coming out of every bar


 I loved the rolling soundtrack of my favorite songs that played in my head while I thought about these characters
 I don't know why, but right from the beginning I pictured Luke Bryan (must have been the tight jeans comment) and that's what I pictured Trace to sound like, except he was always singing Lee Brice's Hard to Love (which Trace does cover in this book!)
 I want to break out my boots and sing and dance along!I liked Kylie, she was willing to work hard, do whatever it took to support herself

 She also seemed like the type of character you would want to be friends with


 I, of course liked that she had a snarky side to her as well


 I also felt for her being shoved into the spot light without being prepared for it.Kylie and Trace's back and forth hate/tolerate relationship kept me entertained, and reading this whole book in one sitting


 Although, I can't say I'd hate being stuck on a tour bus with him for a little while! I loved Trace's road family and his sisters

 His sisters particularly, added another dimension into Trace that I was happy to get to know

 It was like he had two sides, and I wanted to slap one and hug the other.It's a little bad boy Tim McGraw meets Country Cutie Faith Hill (back in the day)[or Vince Gill and Amy Grant - take your pick], when everyone warns her to stay away...there is just something about him that draws her in


 "Kylie was standing in the path of something wild and dangerous and a hell of a lot more powerful than her."  But not every bad boy is good on the inside and Trace definitely has his fair share of problems (mostly of the alcoholic and female variety)...we'll have to wait through the series to see how this one goes!  Caisey, you have won yourself a new fan!

This book was a refreshing "new" paranormal book

The author is so skilled in her writing that you get fully engrossed in the book


I literally had to set timers when I read it so that I wouldn't spend HOURS at a time reading it and forget about obligations


The characters are so easy to relate to that I found myself laughing, crying and being outright mad during some of the scenes! RK Ryals weaves such an amazing tale that you can't help but want to read everything else she has out!! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good paranormal story :)

$REVIEW.: If you're here looking for an amazing romance novel that will simply blow you away, you've come to the right review.I fell in love with this book before I was even 20% in. There was no, I'm hesitant about how much I like this, or oh well I guess it'll pick up later on or I'll understand what the heck is going on later. Nope, none of that. It was pure beauty from the beginning to end, as though the goddess of words had born these words and channeled them onto the page through Heidi. If that's he case then blessed be to the word Goddess because she sure knows what she is doing. If this had nothing supernatural and otherworldly to do with it, then Heidi please be my writing mentor because there is no way I'll be able to compete with something like this when it's time for me to publish my first book. Ok, seriously, now to really review the book.The characters were amazing, funny, sweet, sassy, guarded. Alive. It was like I knew them in real life, as though they had become a part of me and I apart of them. I fell in love with the characters more and more as I followed them along, loving every moment and savoring every word and phrase until I turned the last page. The plot was great, throwing two of my favorite things together, romance and music. She didn't muddle them up, drowning one in in the other. No, she brought both of them center stage, allowing them to rock out together.I was on my toes for a lot of the book. I thought one thing was going to happen but it didn't, or something completely different happened and I freaked out (I literally freaking out ask my mom I was yelling and waving my hands around like it was no ones business). If there is one thing I love, love LOVE, is being on my toes reading a book. The excitement of discovering new things about our characters, the feelings that ran through me every turn of the page, it was indescribable.It isn't a typical music related romance either, throw in some snow, snowboards, the Olympics, the children of Satan (trust when I say you will understand far too well what I mean by that once you read this book), and so much more that I cannot even begin list, and you've picked up Learn To Fly.

$review_text.: Well written, witty and refreshing romance with genuine characters. The Bro-Magnet is written in the male Point of View and not by a typical romance hero. John also known as Johnny, can't figure out he isn't in a long term relationship, something he wants, he also can't figure out why the guys all want to hang out with him, but women aren't attracted to him (so he thinks). This isn't your typical hero, who knows that with a wink and a smile he can have any woman. John is the exact opposite, and we are privy to all his insecurities, self-doubt and internal thoughts that I would venture to guess, true to life bachelors probably go through. John is a nice guy, loves sports, he's witty, intelligent, loves his family, beer, his friends, and owns a small business that he works hard at. He's a nice looking man, helps take care of his father, and he is loyal to his friends. At the beginning we are shown how he behaves when a woman---a totally smashed woman, comes on to him. His actions will speak for themselves as to how he handles that situation. Right there, I liked him right away. A true hero and great role model for how a man treats a woman, even if she's three sheets to the wind and would willingly have sex. John connects to the reader, because in real life, we all know someone like John.John confides to a female friend about a love interest and wants to know how he could ensure she will want to go out with him for more than one date The planning and dating is hilarious, especially the role reversal on the dates. Even though women think they know what men should do to attract a woman the guy is really into, the advice given to John is way off base. John learns all on his own what it takes. I enjoyed the writing, as the story was well written and the dialogue witty and fun. I also really liked Sam (John's best friend), the two had great chemistry and Sam also came off as real and not stereotypical.There was good sexual tension and having the bedroom door closed didn't bother me at all, it actually went well with this book.My only complaint and it's a small one, I would have loved another chapter at the end to find out what happened, however, with a good imagination you pretty much know what happens next.I am editing my review as I just discovered there is a follow-up to John and Helen's story, so I purchased ISN'T IT BROMATIC, which follows the couple on their honeymoon and home. I look forward to this one.If you're looking for something entirely different in the romance genre, I recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: Ryan Tomasi is ready to move on.  After a bitter divorce a year ago he wants to find a special submissive who he can enjoy spending time with, one who enjoys his lifestyle and special needs.  So he is spending an evening celebrating Halloween with his friends, Jack and Callie at the BDSM club.He told Jack several months ago that he wanted to explore this lifestyle, believing he has always been a Dominate yet his ex-wife never wanted to investigate that part of their relationship.  So Jack and Callie have been teaching him the ways of their lifestyle and he finally feels like he has come home, it just feels right.Lisette is returning to the club after several months away.  She left a Dominate months ago who was so over the top controlling, it has taken her a while to come back.  She tried the dating scene with the vanilla boys however it never felt right.  She notices Ryan right away, she likes his look of confidence, knows he is a natural Dom, so she comes over to Ryan offering herself in hopes that her instincts are correct and he is a decent person.They start off slow; enjoying the craft while learning about each other, yet it blossoms quickly into something more meaningful.I enjoyed this story; it was an amazing journey for both Ryan and Lisette.  They both know what they want yet not sure how to get it.  Ryan is learning, yet it seems so natural for him, however still needs Lisette to help him through the learning curve, and yet she still is a submissive and needs him to tell her what to do.  They fumble through the relationship and it just seems to work.  I really liked both of their personalities and enjoyed watching them grow together.  Ryan has some jealously issues and Lisette needs to let go and trust a new Dom yet they work it out wonderfully.

$review_text.: How have I not read any of these anthologies yet? I absolutely loved this collection! As a busy mom, I've found my reading time severely limited in the last few years. That made this collection absolutely perfect for me to read! Each story is a bite-size dose of romance with a dash of suspense thrown in. I loved that I could read each story start to finish in an hour or less.Some of the stories were heavier on the romance, others heavier on the suspense. I was impressed with how each author was able to balance the two and weave a captivating and exciting tale in such a short amount of words. It's not easy to fit a sub-plot into a novella, I'm sure! I also loved how each story in the collection felt unique, but they all still seemed to fit together in this collection because of their cohesive theme.This collection is perfect for those cold nights when you just want to curl up in front of the fireplace with hot chocolate and a book. I am so glad there are three other collections out that I can hurry and go read!I received a free ecopy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

The sex scenes were smokin hot as well.It was very interesting of the author to have a character that is humanoid, but lacking in a feature that is common to us
The way she handled it was brilliant! It was great that there was his and her POV.You do see the return of this couple in the horney leprechaun 2.Fun read!

$REVIEW.: Part Anne of Green Gables, Part Laura Ingalls Wilder, this book was well-written, interesting and touching.  I especially appreciated how realistic the plot was - the main character is spunky and original, but she's still a product of her times and the author isn't pretentious about Jessie leading some pivotal change in gender roles.  I didn't know anything about this book when I started to read it, so I was pleasantly surprised.  The author is clearly a talented story-teller and I look forward to reading more books from her.

$REVIEW.: The Ritual  by Erica Dakin is a full-bodied, eventful adventure story featuring four interesting main characters - two male and two female twins. All four are forced to live on the fringes of their society because of racial discrimination.The story is easy to follow, and the style very readable.The romance between the narrator, Rin, and the handsome thief she joins in his adventures takes a long time to come to its logical conclusion, but burns all the hotter for that.I liked that the female main characters were no prudes, but women with openly acknowledged experience and desires. That the problems of the protagonists were placed in a political context and ultimately find a (more or less) political solution is also a plus in my eyes.I enjoyed reading this book, although at times I felt that there was a bit too much description of the slowly developing relationships and the narrator's own feelings. Maybe a few parts could be tightened and shortened in the middle.The focus on the four main characters, and particularly Rin and Zash, was so overwhelming that the other people in the story seemed at times less real in comparison.Mary Moya (The Kindle Book Review)The Kindle Book Review received this book in exchange for an independent, fair and honest review.

$review_text.: Even though the book is well written, except for some grammatical errors, the book didn't ring true to me

 I found Emily's reaction to Cooper's smoking pot somewhat exxagerated
 Her decision to leave him because he had broken a promise was spot on, but the decision to take up with Ben as a device to get over Cooper was idiotical and cruel to Cooper, who she &#34;professed&#34; to love so much


Cooper did ring true in his repentance and remorse over failing Emily and at one time I thought he was bending over too much, Emily was asking for a kick in the butt
The book left me feeling mad and dissapointed at the things some people do, with the excuse of dealing with their feelings.

$review_text.: This was my first foray into the Henty canon, and I'm looking forward to absorbing more of his adventures
"The Cat of Bubastes" is filled with memorable characters, interesting historical interludes, and vivid descriptions, all of which combine to create a complete sense of time and place - and this is not easy to do when telling a story set in an environment as foreign and far-removed as Ancient Egypt.As in many Henty novels, the young men who are the heroes of this story are strong and resourceful, and follow a moral compass


They treat women and girls with respect and honor; they are eager to expand their minds and gain useful experiences; and they are not afraid to face an evildoer with a weapon in their hands - and even put a stop to his villainy by ending his life if deemed necessary.Some readers have called the novel "boring" because of its detailed descriptions of Egyptian culture


Admittedly, Henty does have a tendency to alternate between thrilling action sequences and lectures about daily life

To me, though, this demonstrated the depth of his research and his commitment to fleshing out the ancient setting.So much of today's youth literature sacrifices good storytelling in an effort to hold a kid's attention through continual action, bathroom humor, or angst-filled characters
It was refreshing to me to read a book aimed at the young people of a century ago, and to find an author who wanted to instruct, entertain, and shape the character of his readers in a positive way.

$REVIEW.: * I received this book in exchange for an honest review*In the beginning of this book, Lily the main character finds out her long time boyfriend has been cheating on her and she is very surprised, and of course hurt. She goes to stay with her best friend Emma. Emma suggests that Lily use this time single to experiment for 1 year and write about it in a journal she provides. Because Lily is 24 and spent all of her adult life with Tom the ex, her sex life has been pretty dull. She decides to give it a try.She also gets offered a job with another friend to help set up parties for rich people. While at her first event she runs into the rich, hot Seb Harper. They have a mutual attraction and great chemistry from the start, but she hears things about him that make her want to keep her distance. He and his friends Ana and Grayson have orgy parties. Lily gets requested to help set up for one of these parties and gets way more than she bargained for.I don't want to give anything away, but I will say Lily ends up doing some hot experimentation. And, I mean hot, like melt your E-reader HOT! Now, this is where things get sticky, literally. She ends up having feelings for Seb, but he goes out of town and tells her to experiment while he is gone, to get it out of her system. While he is gone she sure does so, but there is also some drama with her ex, that will really make you angry!The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I really wanted to hear more about her and Seb. There was more about her, Ana and Grayson. Oh, and Cristoph! The positives are, that there will be another book! And, of course the sex scenes were really good. Also, the way this book ended left me saying, Huh? But, I am very interested to find out what happens in the next book. So, overall it was a great erotic read! Great writing as well!

$review_text.: In the grim and often bloody world of Sang, real pets are a rarity. Pet shop owner Frannie Pleasance is used to taking in strays, but famed musician Casper Sterling is a far different breed from her usual kittens and puppies. But taking Casper on as a lodger might be more trouble than Frannie anticipated. Upon his arrival strange and dangerous things start happening. When someone sets Frannie's room on fire, she's rescued by Scottish firefighter Thom Maccallan, a man whose kind heart and quiet strength draw Frannie out of her shell. Yet if Frannie hopes to have a future with Thom, the two of them must first discover who is trying to kill her and why. The answer may lie with Frannie's inconvenient houseguest...Despite danger lurking in the shadows, The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance is as warm and inviting as Frannie's shop. In Frannie and Thom, Delilah S. Dawson has created two loveable, hardworking protagonists who are impossible to resist. Frannie's been badly hurt in the past, but in The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance she begins to start truly living again, and she does so without losing her innate kindness. Thom too has suffered loss and it's the scars of his past which drive him to be protective of others. I love how patient and giving Thom is. He and Frannie are a truly wonderful pair and thus it's easy to be swept away by their romance.Casper Sterling -- everyone's favorite sexy musician from the first Blud book, Wicked as They Come -- is an important secondary character in The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance. Once again Casper is looking for love in the wrong place, and as much as I like him, I'm glad Ms. Dawson didn't add a love triangle to this story. The fact that the rather colorful Casper doesn't manage to upstage the quieter Frannie and Thom is a testament to Ms. Dawson's writing. That being said, I did finish The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance wanting to dive right into Casper's book, Wicked as She Wants, for reasons I won't spoil.The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance is a charming story I simply adored. If you haven't read Ms. Dawson's first Blud novel, Wicked as They Come, The Peculiar Pets of Miss Pleasance provides a taste of the world that is satisfying as a standalone but will have you craving more of the fantastic world that is Sang.KimberlyReview courtesy of Wit and Sin

$REVIEW.: While I had no problems reading this book to the end, I always felt there was something off about this story and its characters
 Or it seemed like this was a second book in a series; the first book being about Andy and Hank Rosenblum

Then, Anita's story just pops up in the middle of this book


 Odd


 Maybe I just wasn't connecting the dots like I should have been

 By the end of the book, however, I was happy to see that the author showed how one's solid beliefs in the meaning of life could change one day, even when one thinks those beliefs will never change


Also, I felt what she was saying is that ultimately it makes no difference what you believe about how the world was created


 What is truly important, what motivates you to go on living, what keeps you sane, is how much you love and care for others--not only those in your family, but those in your neighborhood, in your workplace, in your place of worship, in your memory, in your whole life.

She considers payback but decides against it, instead using him to help her fix her mother's house
She also leaves out the fact that she was the same &#34;Penny&#34; he used to tease about her weight after she notices he doesn't recognize her

Sparks fly between the two and this lie comes back to bite her after they have developed real feelings for one another
This all in the midst of her bounce back in creating new designs for her plus-size line that her ex-fiance had stolen.I really enjoyed this story

It was well paced and quite mature
I so wasn't expecting that accident, but I felt it made the end stronger

The sex scenes were also tasteful and I loved the inclusion of children throughout the story
People should read it.

$review_text.: If you have even a passing interest in Christianity, but struggle to know what to do with the often conflicting behaviors exhibited by many who claim to all be following the same basic belief system, then this book is an excellent look at what it could and should be.  How is it that the message of the Gospel is often acted out on a stage for the benefit of our own ego?Brennan Manning has an uncanny ability to sift through the surface, and dive straight into the places we often do not want to acknowledge exist within all of us.  In this book he tackles the "image conscious" Christian, more concerned with how they look, than what they are doing.  In it he exposes just how far off the message of love and peace we have often gone.  With all of our masks, pettiness, vanity and ego we consume ourselves with, where is our focus on our true cause; to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves?Of particular interest is how he manages to be blunt and direct in many very personal ways, yet all in his usual self effacing style which leaves one motivated not judged.  When reading Manning, one is left with the overwhelming sense that they are simply in a conversation with someone who is speaking on their level.  While I know a few too distracted with dogma and doctrine to understand his perspective, he writes about the very real struggle to let go of ego and image, and focus on what is really important.  His looks into the problems of racism, homophobia, and neglect of the poor among Christians are especially powerful considering they contrast so much with loving and reaching out to others as Jesus did.Although the editing and copy itself is at times a bit distracting with its multi-type fonts on every page, it does allow you to take bite sized bits of information and ponder the meaning behind it.  Rarely have I stopped so many times while reading to reflect on my own issues.  An excellent read and good insights!
$SUMMARY.: Manning focuses on what's real, and what's an act.

$review_text.: I am kinda on the fence with Pack of Lies (Red Ridge Pack).  On one hand, I really enjoyed the story, but on the other hand there were some discrepancies within the story.  (You know I don't like "Spoiler Alerts", but I can't really give you a good explanation without it this time.  Sorry.)***SPOILER ALERT***Example:Dylan is suppose to be a Bad-Ass villain, but wimps out with Ali and Kendall? WHAT?!Cade is Alpha but can't seem to stand on his own two feet.  HOWEVER, if you can look between the lines with the writing about his father along with Cade mentioning the "Elders", you would think there are some underline things not being explained.  (Which again is not a good way to write a story.  Not explaining more.)Ali has a reputation for being a "tough girl" from her last school but hardly stands up to Kendall?There are a couple of other things, but you get my point.BUT, I still think this story is good and can actually go somewhere with sequels.  I will be looking for the sequels in this series and I do recommend this story.  Just remember to try to overlook a couple of discrepancies and not enough explanations on a couple of things and you will enjoy this short read.

$review_text.: In a market where self-help books promise to help you be a better you, this book stands apart! In Soulprint, author Mark Batterson wonderfully articulates the truth that God must be at the center of who we are meant to be. He uses imagery from art to describe the process of becoming the unique "you" that God designed you to be as allowing God to chisel away the roughcut stone from our life and reveal our true selves. People can go through their whole lives deriving their identity from what they do, becoming like others, living up to expectations, self-improvement, or past history. God designed each human in His image but unique to themselves. We will never rest in our unique identity until we stop trying to become someone we are not, and allow God to reveal who we are. Batterson beautifully brings this truth to light through five scenes from David's life.This book was a delight to read. It brought to life the stories of King David and his writings in a way that made me closely identify with aspects of my own life. Many self-improvement books leave you with big "to-do" list of things that you soon run out of willpower to sustain. This book was a relief, describing many things we can let go of. Yes, there are practical suggestions of things to do on a self-discovery journey. These are helpful tools to help us treasure the memories of our past and redeem the circumstances of our life, past and present, to allow God to shape us into the masterpiece He has in mind. I found this book encouraging, uplifting, insightful, challenging, and releasing. I recommend it highly.I received a copy of this book for free for review from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group.

$REVIEW.: This is a simply written, easy to read book

 It's great when you need encouragement, and helps you step out of the &#34;what is&#34; of your life, when things aren't as you want, and give you good information on how to apply Science of Mind principles

It's very uplifting, giving hope when you aren't finding hope within your life.

$review_text.: I received a copy gifted from the author in exchange for my honest opinion.Alluring Seduction continues the Bayou Stix series and OMG it is so good! I thought I loved Jude and Lexi, but Blue and Jessie are so much fun!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I will always love Jude and Lexi, but something about Blue and her sassy mouth and Jessie&#8217;s heart are fantastic!  They are so wonderful together!Blue Delaney is a reporter for a rock and roll magazine we meet in Alluring Turmoil.  I am not gonna lie, I wasn&#8217;t sure how I was going to like her based on her cameo in AT.  However, she is such a vibrant, strong willed character, I fell in love with her almost immediately!  I love the banter and quick wit about her.  And I especially love that she is a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries and The Originals!  I mean, when you talk Ian Somerholder and Joseph Morgan, this girl is hooked.Jessie Adams is the biggest manwhore in the band, and while he thinks he hates Blue in reality he is just fighting his heart.  I love how honest and funny Jessie is!  Usually, when he makes a mistake, it is a big one, but he is smart enough to do whatever it takes to make it right.  He is so cute second guessing every move he makes and all the feelings he has never experienced before Blue.I love all the sight-seeing and history of NOLA and Baton Rouge.  I have never been to LA but these books make we want to hop on a plane and see everything up close for myself&#8230; the only problem is that since these are fictional characters I have no chance of running into them in person!Do yourself a favor and head on over to one click this book!  But be sure to begin with AT!  You don&#8217;t want to miss out on any members of this rock band!

$REVIEW.: Trisha Wolfe has done it again, pulling me into an original, intricate world that's imaginative and dark, fascinating and a little scary but also thrilling. Women rule and protect in one realm. Man conquer and hold another. But underground, neither gender seem to matter. There's very little known about the Otherworlders who live in the depths of the planet. They rarely surface -- or more precisely, are never seen -- and have been thought nearly extinct. When they invade the upper-crust kingdoms and sack them for slaves and mercury, their world's most precious resource, they're proven to be more mysterious, brutal, and a bit crazier than the stories have painted them.Gladiator meets caged UFC fighting, it's a battle to the death in the pits of darkness. All for someone whose name the Otherworlders are too scared to utter. And all while Kaliope, the new head of the Nactue Guard, tries to protect her people, sworn sisters, and princely charge, bring back the artifact that powers her empress and land, hide the fact that she pumps mercury in veins, and understand the goal of her enemy. Whew! Like I said, thrilling and a kick-ass heroine.But I adore how Kaliope has to grow into that role. She has the utmost faith in her goddesses and matriarch but little in her own purpose. Though has she earned her title to lead her empress's closest guard, she has doubts of living up to it, let alone exceeding it. And she must or her whole world will crumble. A part of me did crumble at the end of the book. Once again, Trisha Wolfe ripped my heart out while still giving me some hope. I fell in love with the characters and the relationships. I mourned the losses of both and smiled at the development of the new.Plot- and character-driven, with rich world-building and emotion,Of Silver and Beastsis a fantastic read. I'm anxious for the next installment of the series, scared yet excited for what it'll bring to the garden of silver goddesses and beasts.** eBook provided by the author in exchange for a review. **

$REVIEW.: Crista McHugh strikes again with another masterpiece! I enjoyed this book very much - it was sexy and intriguing!I loved that Izana was brave and courageous, even when there were times her life was put in danger. She was a very loyal slave to her mistress and she would do anything to do her duty regardless of the consequences.I also liked Modius's strong presence. He affected Izana by inspiring her to pursue him based simply on natural attraction. This time, Izana wasn't forced to keep him company. I also enjoyed reading the exchange between him and his father. The awkwardness in the beginning gave way to camaraderie, trust, and pride. Scenes between him and his father put tears in my eyes!Just as in the first book, Marcus was once again the comic relief of this book. I just could not wait for his own story! Alas, some things are worth the wait, and I also have no choice. Hopefully, his own story will create itself soon.I absolutely enjoyed the power the Rabbit's name possessed. Knowing that the Rabbit was a woman was even better. I just love badass women ;)Another thing I loved about this book was the real emotions it evoked. Being a slave did not produce happy memories. There were times when Izana would talk about herself and my heart would just break into pieces. I couldn't imagine how Modius must have felt. (Yes, I'm acting like they're real people!)I also enjoyed the medical knowledge that Modius possessed. The way he attacked the enemy and the way he saved a life were both so inspiring. He was incredibly smart and was not afraid to take a risk, if it meant saving a life.Finally, the honorableness of Azurha and Titus put tears in my eyes, too. They were such just leaders, they did what they thought was best for their people, without overstepping their bounds. I especially enjoyed the part when Azurha said she could not give her slave to Modius as compensation. I couldn't help myself; I choked. It was such a beautiful scene!

$review_text.: I had never read anything by Ruth Myers but this book peaked my interest because of the title of the book. I wanted to read the book primarily to see if it would be a good book to give to my parents of whom are both in their eighties and I wanted to give them something that would bring encouragement to their lives are they are facing many financial, emotional, physical, and spiritual challenges.Having performed over 100 funerals in my work as a pastor; and dealing with many issues related to the care of the elderly, the biggest surprise I had in reading this book was how enjoyable it was for me as a 45-year-old. The author addresses all the big issues that all Christians deal with in the face of our mortality - for example: dealing with aging; being faithful and finishing well; dealing with loneliness; trusting God's timing in everything; continuing to grow spiritually; facing physical decline; and the glorious destiny that awaits those in Christ.Not only will I be passing along this book to my own parents, I will be buying extra copies to give away to many people I know who are need of the practical encouragement that Myers provides in this very good daily devotional filled with Biblical and wise insights from a gifted writer.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 stars-a great new series!Kalin has lived in the mortal world for eighteen years, but the time has come to live with her Dad, King of the air court, and join her rightful place in the air court where the other elementals live. On the day she is supposed to go to Avalon to be with her father, she is attacked and rescued by Rowan, a rogue elemental. Rowan takes Kalin to the air court only to find that her father is missing. Since Kalin is only a halfling, she has never been taught how to control her powers. Rowan offers to teach her, but they only have a few days to be ready to save the air court and find out where her father is. With some definite romance brewing between Rowan and Kalin, will they be able to save the air court and find the King?Stacey O'Neale gives readers great characters in this new elemental world! With just enough romance, action, and plot twists, Mortal Enchantment had me begging for more!

$REVIEW.: I recently read the authors "Brandy Of The Damned", I knew a little about the band, and I've read damn near everything Robert Anton Wilson ever wrote, so take this as a RAW fan (musically, I'm more punk/industrial/Detroit techno) perspective.I found it to be quite amazing, a truly amazing story, solidly grounded in the history of the eras it took place in. I didn't read anything else until I was done.The only thing I have that is close to criticism is that I think the author may want to read "Debt: The First 5000 Years" (it is by an anthropologist who has been involved with the Occupy movement, the stories we tell ourselves about the history of money are not anything like the truth, read the book!), and then perhaps add a bit to some of the sections on money and the economy.Recommended, strongly to RAW fans and Discordians everywhere, I'd think everyone else would would like it too, but then why isn't RAW heralded as a great writer, and the Illuminatus trilogy as a great work?

$REVIEW.: First of all let me tell you that collecting cook books is one of my favorite things to do, so to impress me, a cook book better be pretty good.  Second, if you're like me, what can a cook book possibly tell you that you don't already know?But, let me tell you this, the All New Good Housekeeping Cook Book is impressive.  I have been testing the recipes from this book for a couple weeks now and not only are there some new ones that I haven't seen before, but they are easy and delicious.  Another plus of the recipes I've tried is I don't have to run out to the store or plan ahead because many of the recipes use items I already have on hand.Now, if that's not enough to convince you what a great book I think this is than I don't know what would be.The book's format is very nice.  It is easy to read with many full color pictures throughout.  There are 1500 triple tested recipes along with various "insider" tips from chefs, cook book authors and food experts.

$review_text.: Some of the reviewers complain that some of his arguments aren't very scholarly


 And, I can agree somewhat
 He touches on so many subjects, that he doesn't really delve deeply into any single one


 But, I don't think his goal was to try to do a scholarly defense of each of his claims
He was trying to give an overview of many of the arguments against theism, too much depth would probably loose a lot of his intended audience.Sometimes, I found myself surprised that he acts as if he doesn't know how a theist would answer some of his challenges
 Given the fact that he was a preacher for so long, this sometimes seemed strange
 But, overall, I'd have to say that the strengths far outweight the negatives


 So, 4 out of 5 stars is what I rate it.

$REVIEW.: First off, throw out the title.  A more apt one would be &quot;A Thorough Examination of 10 of Lasker's and 10 of Petrosian's Games&quot;.  Yes, the book does contain many tough defensive grinds, the sort not often seen in anthologies.  But there are some games (especially in Lasker's case) where the &quot;defense&quot; is in fact &quot;counterattack&quot;, and therefore the entire game turns into a tactical donnybrook.Crouch went over these games with care, and the effort shows.  The topic of defending may not be as popular as one of the 60,000 &quot;Attack the King&quot; books out there, which is all the more reason to read this book.  Salvaging a draw from a loss is a valuable thing to do in chess; you see many examples of it in this book.  Highly recommended.

Luke begins to worry, because he has his reasons for his rule.I really enjoyed More, even though I normally don't read a lot of m&eacute;nage stories

The main reason I love this m&eacute;nage is all three men are together from the very beginning


Luke, Matthew and Richard are stronger when they are together


When Luke's father tries to separate the men, will he get his way? When an associate of Luke's father joins in the threats, will this finally destroy the relationship?Ms

Parker has the reader cheering these three very different men on throughout the development of their relationship

We have Luke who has spent the last fifteen years of his life living a very solitary life filled with one-night stands, Richard the successful businessman, and Matthew, the adorable and vulnerable kid


Three great characters that work so well together, you can't imagine them any other way.I was very shocked to learn this is Ms
Parker's debut book

It is just such an amazing story


I've heard that Ms

Parker is planning to write additional stories; one in Matthew's POV and one in Richard's POV


I hope this is true


I would love to read Richard's POV
Richard has one of my favorite lines in the story


When Joseph, one of Richard's business associates, asked Richard if he gets jealous seeing Luke and Matthew together, Richard says "The attraction and affection you see between them--it isn't just about them


Wrapped up in that is me--their feelings for me." I had tears rolling down my face reading that and Luke and Matthew feel the same when they see the other two together.I have already told people about this book and will be telling everyone I can that they definitely want More.

$review_text.: In the tradition of such great books as AI and I,Robot this story by Vadim Babenko is that and so much more. It is a look at a genius so great that it borders on madness. Using his own background in physics and technology our writer takes us on a trip through a time that very well could be tomorrow.We become invested in the life of the cybernetics' genius Dr. Bogdan Bogdanov, through his memories. When we meet him he is locked away in an asylum. He spends his time ruminating on the various nurses and figuring out ways to successfully lure them into a liaison in his bed. He takes us back to the beginning when he first decided to create "Semmant" an artificial being.Semmant is a super computer that at time exhibits almost human traits and emotions. The inventor and his invention develop a bond almost as strong as that between a father and son. While Bogdan gets richer than he ever imagined he still has to contend with the fact that he strikes out with the fairer sex. This drives him nuts but it is his failed relationship with Lidia Alvares that haunts his soul. This is where the story gets even more interesting with Bogdan creating a character online to be the perfect female that needs that knight in shining armor that he longs to be.This is a very complicated book and is not the type of light sci-fi or fantasy that is widely accepted. If you like you science fiction a bit on the highbrow side then dive in your are in for a real treat.

$review_text.: Don't let the title mislead you--this book is far from limited to whatever you might define as `paranormal.' Only around 25% of the content is specific to paranormal topics, the rest easily applies to fantasy, horror, sf, and thrillers, and it's not much of a stretch to find bits relevant to romance and mystery.Subject matter aside, Harper's prose is immensely readable. I planned to skim it briefly before handing it over to my wife wife (currently working on a paranormal story) and found myself hooked into the witty, conversational style and read the whole thing. My wife (no newcomer to writing books) decorated the book lavishly in pink and yellow highlighter.If you're an experienced writer, you've probably heard a lot of this at some point, but I found some very useful bits that have been nibbling at the back of my brain and until now, were never articulated in a writing text. The discussion on names is so important and almost always overlooked by new and established writers. In the chapter "The Paradox of Cliches," you'll find some very familiar faces--maybe some you've created yourself. The development of villains/antagonists is all too often given short shrift in this genre and Harper gives you reasons and tips for fleshing them out. Beginners would do well to heed the chapter "Fight Scenes and Flashbacks."--ESPECIALLY flashbacks. The chapters on manuscript formatting is also useful for new writers. As a librarian, my wife was pleased to see that the section on research went well beyond Wikipedia.If you're teaching a writing class in genre fiction, this should be one of the required texts. Both experienced and beginning writers will find this is a very useful and readable guide for planning a `paranormal' or other genre writing project.

$REVIEW.: I saw the movie starring Steve McQueen years ago and decided to read the book.  I really didn't know the history of that time in China and the US participation in the river gunboats keeping peace with the warlords.  It was a slow start but a very interesting read. Once I got into the actual events and what the gunboats were doing there it was difficult to put down.  I will read it again in a few months because it has so much information that I'm sure I've missed some details.  For a new and different perspective on those years, this is a good beginning.

$REVIEW.: If you or someone you know is suffering from depression, you will benefit from this book. I love how the book starts by describing what depression is. There are a lot of misconceptions about the illness, and outlining the facts is essential before the illness can be understood. The book also outlines some of the risks for depression, as well as covering the many symptoms of depression. My favorites parts of the book are those that cover methods of coping with depression and what to do if you know someone with depression. The book is concisely written and cites many facts throughout the text. As someone who has a family member who suffers from depression, I thought I had a good understanding of depression, but this book revealed that I had lots to learn. I definitely recommend this book.

it's not pleasant but such is his goal if we're going to have any hope of TURNING away from this deadly course we are on before is too late!the REALITY of our condition must be faced or else, and THAT is the dilemma.about this , he writes: "The worse reality becomes, the less a beleaguered population wants to hear about it, and the more it distracts itself with squalid pseudo-events of celebrity breakdowns, gossip, and trivia
These are the debauched revels of a dying civilization
The most ominous cultural divide lies betweeen those who chase after these manufactured illusions, and those who are able to punctured the illusions and confront reality."needles to say, we desperately need more--many, many more--of the later; this book hopefully compels them to join those whose task has become illusion-busters.

$REVIEW.: I really loved the first book in this series, and I was very excited to read the second, but I have to admit I enjoyed it just a bit less

Things that were glossed over in the first book really stood out here and were harder to ignore.Specifically, the way the author rendered the sign language and lip reading

I like that Brander and his cousin invented a sign language together as children, that's a believable and realistic touch
But sign languages are not like spoken languages, especially newly invented ones


Instead of representing a realistic sign language, the dialog is exactly the same as if it were spoken


What exactly is the sign for "consequently"? or "missive"? Did they really invent different signs for "letter" and "missive"? Also lip reading is never easy or accurate, which was better represented in the first book, but here Brander always gets every word without difficulty, even in crowded or dark rooms.The other problem was that since Brander and Regin got together at the end of the first book, there had to be some new issue to drive them apart
Here it's that Brander doesn't want to be a father because he's deaf


I really liked how confident he was in the first book, so to have the whole conflict in the second book be about him feeling inadequate was annoying and felt out of character
I hope the next books don't also rely on the same kind of contrived conflict to drive the plot, because with the mystery element, it's not necessary.But overall I still enjoyed it
The setting is so original and well done, and we get an even more detailed view of 18th century Christiania (Oslo) here
The mystery is well-written
I also liked the addition of a new deaf character whom Brander teaches


And Brander and Regin are such great characters, it's always fun to read more about them
I am looking forward to the next volumes.

The story was entertaining the characters were well-built and it was different. I loved the plot; it was funny that both the protagonists thought each other were criminals but they were willing to go against those faults in order to be together. I felt thet the ending was abrupt and rushed so that the story to end quickly. I think the story had potential to be much longer, I didn't want it to end. There are so many gaps that I think could have been added to the story to lengthen it, but all in all it was a great short read.

$REVIEW.: Not saying this author is a bad writer, and she certainly is passionate about heritage preservation, which is cool.I got bored a few chapters in, and here's why
There was so much more tension between the hero and his father than between the hero and heroine
Dean left Sam after a magical summer, and she mentions crying over him and being comforted by friends
But instead of having a backbone and being the slightest bit wary of him, she's all over him, sweet and biddable.I prefer heroines who have a little spine, and romances that have some sexual tension to work thru
That's what makes a romance sizzle
This one doesn't even heat up.

$review_text.: Pride Revisited is an anthology of sixteen short stories which are based on the characters of Pride and Prejudice. Quoting from the author's introduction, "You will not find in these pages rewrites of Jane Austen's original chapters - there is no point; no one can improve upon them. What you will find is a number of what I consider `interludes.' My interludes are scenes that can be inserted into the larger plot of Pride and Prejudice at given moments without necessarily changing the original book events which preceded or follow." Besides these interludes there are some stories that imagine life after marriage for the Darcy's, another one that is a modern day scenario and one that is a fun fantasy. I truly enjoyed all of them but am only telling a bit about four in this review. The rest I leave to each reader's discovery.The first offering involves a game called Sardines, a variation of `hide and seek' that was popular during Regency times. In this story it was one of the entertainments enjoyed at Netherfield when Elizabeth was caring for Jane. The object of this game ended up giving Darcy and Elizabeth a bit of cozy time. This was a fun interlude and I could easily see it taking place within the pages of the original book.Georgiana, in trying to recover from her disastrous experience with Wickham and hoping to ease the worries of her guardians, attempts a harmless flirtation. Her role model leaves much to be desired and reflects another poor choice for dear Georgiana. In her defense, I must add that her choices were limited! The story is funny and provides a very entertaining read.Two of the stories take place on April Fool's Day! Colonel Fitzwilliam's prank in the first one filled me with some trepidation as I was awaiting the outcome of his `folly'. It kept me on edge then left me smiling as the tables were turned on him in such a delightful way. Ah, but the second one, "April Fool's: A Romance" left me breathless with the pure genius of it. The feelings it elicited, romance, confusion, understanding, romance again, laughter...love, utter and complete love...run the gamut, even to warm and fuzzy! (I enjoyed the little lark and Pinker immensely) I found much to my liking and hated for this `tale' to come to an end.Another one that I truly should mention is "Anniversary Song". The first anniversary for our `darling couple' becomes a game of clues. It kept me eagerly following Elizabeth to discover the next clue. When she finds the last one, it is so romantic. I can't resist... I must share a bit: Emotion welled in Elizabeth's eyes. She ran a finger lightly over Darcy's signature at the bottom of the page as a single tear escaped its bounds and slowly meandered down her cheek. Through blurred vision, she sensed rather than saw his approach from the shadows at the far end of the room, which had been sheltered in darkness. Even in the throes of deep emotion, Elizabeth must smile--Darcy had been there all along - in the room, and in her heart! As he had since the moment they had met.'  "Most swoon worthy!"There are times that I love a book of short stories if they are well written, especially if I do not have the time to start a novel. Tess Quinn's anthology is just such a book. Some of the stories are very short and others are a good bit longer but each one left me feeling satisfied and happy at its conclusion providing great reading pleasure.I delighted in the beauty of Tess Quinn's writing in Regency language. She wrote as if she had lived during that era and her words consistently flowed onto the pages. Lovely work, Ms. Quinn. I hope to see much more from you. (I recently read that you had a new novel in the works...I hope that is true!) I enjoyed your anthology immensely. I highly recommend this book to any lover of Pride and Prejudice. It is one I will revisit time and again.I was given a copy of this book by the author for a fair and honest review. mostagreeablyengaged.blogspot.com

$review_text.: Cosmic justice has many faces, and this time it has the face of plants...For egotistical, arrogant Bertram Luce, life couldn't get any better. He's a famous author. He's rich. He lives in a gorgeous mansion and drives luxurious, expensive cars. Oh yes, and he's also gotten away with murdering his kind, plant-loving wife. That is, until the world of vegetation decides to avenge her death and make him pay; and pay he will, in the most bizarre, unusual way possible...In the beginning, Luce believes the strange incidents to be coincidences, but it's not too much later when he realizes the 'accidents' he's been suffering have a lot more to do with premeditated acts than with mere chance. But is he going insane? For how can a tree branch or an orchid mean him any harm? Is there such a thing as a unified, vegetative consciousness? Or is this simply his own guilty conscience playing tricks on his psyche?Vegetation is an unusual, enjoyable read, one filled with bizarre and sometimes downright hilarious scenes. The writing is crisp and vivid and the pace flows well. In spite of the attacks of plantlife on the protagonist being a bit repetitive at times, the author keeps a strong sense of suspense and, to be fair, it takes ingenuity to create so many segments where Luce is attacked by the various plants and flowers. Since the protagonist is such an unsympathetic character, the reader will perversely enjoy all that befalls him until the very satisfying, surprising ending.LaFlamme continues to prove his talent and skill as a horror writer. His first novel, The Pink Room, which I also had the chance of reviewing, makes for compelling reading as well.---Mayra Calvani, The Dark Phantom Review

I mean that aspect of the relationship should have been explored more... also just a little to much talking and not enough action...a bit predictable but a good read if you have time to kill..

$REVIEW.: Done and Done outlines such a simple process, but it makes so much sense and I can see how it could be incredibly effective. The principles are simple yet sound. My favorite part is how nothing is ultra time-consuming; the focus is on accomplishing tasks and rewarding yourself accordingly. I already have an AC lined up, and we're going to try out the method and see if we can make it work for us. I can't wait!

$review_text.: Brock's Bunny was a fun quick read. I was dithering back and forth about buying it from Amazon, so when it became available for me to review for free in return for an honest review, I jumped on the opportunity. Short stories are always difficult to review, to price, etc. But, I would recommend taking a chance on Brock's Bunny- I'm glad I did.Hollie Dawson is a rabbit shifter, and is pleasantly surprised to find her mate, a carnivorous human male. I had to laugh at Brock, who was just a typical man, messing up things left, right, and center. Even his attempt to capture the white bunny from his yard, was bumbling and endearing. The man has a good heart.It is always fascinating to me to see how different authors approach the mythos of shifters- in this case, they know their mates on site, and are able to change their human partners into shifters during the mating. Trying to clue in the "norms" is always a fun experience, and Brock's response, though a bit over the top, was probably typical of an alpha male.I would recommend this book to all fans of shifter romance, and plan on purchasing the first two books in the series. I look forward to reading more of Wakely's work!4/5 flames for hotness.Please visit sslyblog.wordpress.com

$REVIEW.: I picked this up at the library, mistakenly being impressed that this picked up whereWhen the other review says "There is a prologue story in Crystal Dragon that has been known to convince people that they picked up the wrong book - but keep reading, it will make sense" -- they were really right.  I almost dropped the book back in the library return without finishing it.This is a prequel novel, a foundation novel that explains about as much as it obscures.  Once it gets moving the writing is tight, the characters make sense and you get a feel for how a universe could come up empty and how everything was before everything was.

$REVIEW.: In Eat vegan on $4 a Day, the author offers some very good and practical ways to eat vegan without having to "break the piggy bank" to do it. Each recipe tells you approximately how much it will cost you per the serving size. Who doesn't appreciate that in today's economic times?! I especially like the good sound advice that is given at the beginning of the book, which is worth the cost of the book in and of itself. One feels good about the information that the author gives which is thus backed at by her background in finance. Great book for the "newbie" vegan and for those who think they know it all vegan. Great read and tasty recipes to boot!

$review_text.: If you like anthologies check out The New Death and Others by James Hutchings
This is a book of flash fiction and poetry that deal with mythology, fairy tales and horror
Most of the stories that are here are less than 1,000 words

They make you think and laugh while looking at the dark side of fantasy

This collection has a little of everything, including monsters who are afraid that people are no longer scared of them, A man longing for the perfect woman and a funny tale of two demons in love.The first story in this collection is called The God of The Poor and deals with the gods deciding on which one of them will have dominion over the poor


In this story, I felt the gods were a metaphor for how most people think of the poor and it really set the stage for the rest of the book
In the next story called How The Isle of Cats Got Its Name, James Hutchings creates his own mythology
 It is set in the fictional city of Telelee and follows a powerful sorceress named Abi-simiti as she collects all the cats in the city to take to an unnamed island

Her plan is to torture cats as part of a musical instrument that is meant to impress a god
Abi-simiti makes a crucial mistake and the cats have the last laugh


Anyone who is a cat lover should enjoy this one along with another story in the collection called My Cat Is Not Like Other Cats.There are a few stories in The New Death And Others that I really enjoyed
One in particular was The Doom That Was Laid Upon Fame
In this story the goddess Fame is blamed and punished for giving people who are unworthy fame and fortune, but she finds a way to get out of trouble with help from the seldom heard about fifth member of the four horseman of the apocalypse


Another good one is Weary Love, that is a funny short poem that tells what happens when the god Commerce takes over for Love


Some other stories here that were very similar that I enjoyed was Fame's Beloved, The New Death and The New God


If you like short stories and poems that are  funny, dark and gives a satirical look at life, you will enjoy The New Death and Others


 There are a lot of good ideas in this book, in particular I enjoyed The stories involving the land of Telelee

I enjoy it when authors create their own mythology and I hope to hear more stories set in Telelee from James Hutchings in the future.

$REVIEW.: It&#8217;s been a while since I found a great horror story, and I was thrilled when I discovered Soul Cutter. It&#8217;s the kind of book I&#8217;ll be reading again, knowing each time I do, I&#8217;ll find something new to love.  It&#8217;s original, has romance, and the most frightful monster I&#8217;ve encountered.We kick off with Elan set on showing the world that psychics are scammers through her online site. But when she gets word of her mom vanishing while assisting with the filming of a ghost-hunter-style show in Egypt, Elan takes off to the land of pyramids to help with the search. Her mother&#8217;s disappearance is suspicious and the local police are no closer to any leads. The trail of dead bodies terrify Elan, and she is soon thrown into a real-life supernatural situation. It is only with help from Ramsay, a Lebanese boy who agrees to help her, that she starts to make some breakthroughs. But little does she know Ramsay has his own dark secrets, but its too late as she&#8217;s already fallen for him. In the end, Elan has to deal with her misconceptions of the supernatural to get out alive.Lexa Cain is a master at writing action scenes. I was flipping those pages so quickly to see if Elan got out alive. A terrific novel from a debut author I&#8217;ll be adding to my auto-buy list. Highly recommended!
$SUMMARY.: Horror lovers need to read Soul Cutter.

$REVIEW.: I am not concerned with a plot summary- and neither should you. This `genre' of storytelling is so over used its getting quite annoying.Problems:1.I am not sure if this `woman' is a woman at all. The author demonstrates how strong she is- single mother and all that- but she speaks as though she is very young. There are certain scenes that really threw me off as to who Marcy was- her dialogue is very juvenile.2.If I read one more time how much Mike looked like a `famous movie actor' I mentally threatened to stop reading. We get it- it is one of my biggest pet peeves when authors think their readers will forget. Yeah, he suffered...such is life.3.The length was a bit much... I skipped through certain pages that repeated what I had already read. Repeatitive information is a huge problem in this work. Apparently, this author writes short stories-I think that shows here. Some passages I read echoed almost exacally like a previous passage.4.The love story was easy, predictable and cliqued. While the author seemed to be attempting a triangle of love with Andre, it was pretty clear the direction once Mike and Marcy meet. It was annoying how Mike also magically knew what Marcy really needed (insert mini-Christian Grey here) and he convinced her that this what she was laking all her life.5.The openness of talking about sex and everything that physically comes with this type of relationship just did not make sense in this book; maybe I am old fashion but I do not think one would be so excited that you watched them learn to be submissive on video and then you in turn openly discuss your relationship with your employer. Yeah no.6.The karma-tic element of this story is way over the top and quite harsh.Overall I would not recommend this book.Side note: I would encourage writers to steer clear of the '50 Shades' bandwagon that seems to be so popular today. I fear authors are picking up bad habits...

$REVIEW.: This story blew me away

 It is hard to believe that this is actually Nacole Stayton's debut novel, it is that amazing
 The story of a girl going to college and falling for a the unattainable guy has been done, BUT...it has not been done like this.Haley Martin runs away from a past she would sooner forget, to start over
 Starting over didn't didn't include someone like Kyler King


 (Let me just rant about him for a moment...he is definitely up their on my list of book boyfriends, he wants to be hard, but that eventually changes and honestly, who hasn't dreamed of taming that bad boy)
This story deals with some very emotional issues that were handled so realistically that it made my heart break right along with them


 I became so engrossed in their lives that I didn't want the story to end.The supporting characters are wonderful as well


 Haley's roommate Lucy is that girl that we all want to be friends with, she lets Haley have room, without smothering her, but she is there for her when she needs her, again, who doesn't want a best friend like that?There really aren't enough good things I can say about this novel, except that everyone should experience it for themselves, and I am looking forward to more from Nacole Stayton.

$REVIEW.: This book is memoir by arguably the top ultra-runner of his generation. If your looking for time splits, tips on interval training, how to run hills then keep looking, this ain't that book.  This is about a person who approaches races as  &#34; journeys&#34; and  who basically is so talented he invents challenges for himself...like running around the rim of Lake Tahoe in one shot or if he can across a pryennes mountain range in 7 days.I think the big take away is that it's not what place you come in but the journey.  For example, There is an entire chapter devoted him breaking the fastest accent and decent of mt. Kilimanjaro  and the reader never finds what the old record was and by how much did he beat it by.The one thing the book does is give the reader an idea of the  amount of suffering takes place as he is accomplishing these feats. one assumes that people with genetic disposition to run don't suffer during a race or &#34; journey&#34; but you would wrong.  My opinion the best chapter is about how he overcome all his misery to win the 2012 western states in a sprint.the guy is about 24 or 25 and it kind of shows. I admire his outlook on running...creating art through exhurition. the book is not going to be a roadmap to how you can be a better runner but it does give you insight to what true passion for running is about.

$review_text.: Whisper of Jasmine backtracks with the main character of A Spear of Summer Grass, the brash socialite Delilah Drummond, and introduces the characters that will be at the center of the next book, City of Jasmine


The setting is London in 1914, and Delilah (still married to her first husband, Johnny) throws a New Years Eve party intending to do a little matchmaking

Evie longs for adventure, and her eccentric Aunt Dove dresses her to turn heads at Delilah's party


Adventurer Gabriel Stark takes notice of Evie and it appears to be love at first sight, despite the fact that Delilah had meant to match each of them with someone else!This fast-paced prequel to City of Jasmine really was over too quickly, and was a great introduction to some new characters.



$SUMMARY.: Delightful intro to new characters

$REVIEW.: This is a book all Christ followers MUST read.  I have never read a book like this!  I can't wait to read my Bible with the eyes of grace!  Every church should teach/preach this message.  Too bad more Christ followers (me included) aren't taught this from the beginning.  God didn't want me to learn about Him, He wants me to KNOW Him!!!!!.  Only thru grace are we His - wish I had learned this years ago, it certainly would have made my walk ALOT less painful.  Thank you Mr. McVey.  Can't wait to read more of your books!

$REVIEW.: A warning to future readers - don't read at night or you'll be forced to keep reading until it's done.  And then you'll be tired the next day.Merrin is a One, meaning she has a single super power, in a world where one is less than nothing.  If she's had no super powers at all, then she would have grown up a normal, resentful of supers, but at least belonging.  If she'd had two super powers then she'd have been a super, and been able to follow her passion for science.But instead Merrin has only one power - she can float.  Without the means to control wind, that's all she can do.  Float.  No flying.  Just floating.  And she is obsessed with being able to fly.  She is also obsessed with getting an internship at the Hub where she can work on a cure for Oneness.Elias is also a One, and when he and Merrin touch there's this buzz....  And then Merrin discovers that he can control the wind.  Together they can fly.No one has ever reported Ones being able to share powers.  But not only can Merrin and Elias fly, but two of their friends can throw fire around, so long as they're sharing powers.  Merrin wants to share her angst  discoveries with her parents, or at least with the teacher helping her get her internship, but Elias won't let her - he's scared of letting anyone know.Elias is right.  Letting the Hub know they can share powers is the most dangerous thing that could happen.I loved the characters. Merrin rings true - your typical teenager full of anger, lack of confidence, and desires.  Unlike a lot of YA, the book doesn't get stuck in teenage angst - it's there, but it doesn't consume the characters or the story.  Instead you get the story - great conspiracies, adventure, mysteries, a touch of love...  All told in a way as to suck you in.  And it does.

$REVIEW.: I was given a free copy of the book from the author for my honest opinion.All his life Charlie has been all but invisible to everyone around him and he has never known why. No one ever remembers his name even if they have seen him almost every day of his life. The girl who lives next door to him doesn't know who he is. Charlie likes her and tries to ask her out but she doesn't know him. So poor Charlie just walks away and lets it be. Having no one remembering who he is, is not his only problem his Dad is never at home he is always on the road so to speak. He may pop in on occasion like on Charlie's birthday if he is lucky that is.Charlie has been a loner all his life until he pops back in time and meets a girl, Yvaine. Yvaine becomes Charlie's best friend and then some. Yvaine takes Charlie under her wing and shows him the ropes or how to live and survive in her time. Charlie finds out that Yvaine can time-travel as well. While Charlie travels back in time which what they call downtime and Yvaine travels uptime which means she travels forward in time. Girls go forward and guys go backwards. Charlie and Yvaine get their selves in trouble and need to leave town in a hurry. Time travelers can and do travel together sometimes. Charlie can take Yvaine downtime with him and Yvaine can take Charlie uptime with her but they can only travel in pairs. They need to leave real quick you know like pop uptime or downtime but they have one little problem that is holding them back and that is Yvaine's baby Billy. She can't take Billy and Charlie both with her when she travels and Charlie can't take both of them with him. So what are they going to do? There is no way Yvaine is ever going to leave her baby.Charlie and Yvaine fall head over heels in love with each real quick like. Charlie and Yvaine are always getting their selves in a whole heap of trouble all the time. Untimed has so many twist and turns in it that your whole world is just spinning out of time. You never know where Charlie and Yvaine are going to take you next. You never know if you are going to be leaping forward or backwards. Have you read Untimed? If not then I recommend that you click that little button up there by the cover of the book you know the one that says Amazon and pick up a copy so you can read it. Trust me you will not regret it.

$review_text.: I enjoyed this book for a few reasons: 1) it is a concise (although not comprehensive) summary of the known facts of the assassination/investigation, 2) it is adept at weaving the events and moods of the day into the historical tapestry, 3) it is the first book I've encountered to look at Jim Garrison the man and his motivations in an objective manner.  I've followed most of the conspiracy theories and anti-conspiracy theories pretty closely, and find it rare to encounter a study like this one, that doesn't add confusion for every point it clarifies.While there is a lot of additional material worthy of reading and research, this book is a good objective overview of the assassination in in's historical context, and of the only prosecution of anyone anywhere for the crime of the century.

$REVIEW.: I had never heard of the Acumen Fund before I picked up this book, and within the first 30 pages I wanted to get more involved in helping small businesses around the world. I wouldn't call The Blue Sweater a memoir, because it's more than that. It's the story of someone who gave up a promising banking career in order to get involved and do something more with her life.When it comes to aid in Africa, for the most part, the Western world screws it up bigtime. From celebrities adopting token African babies to aid packages that never trickle down to citizens, very little tangible things get done and make a real impact. However, what Jacqueline Novogratz and the Acumen Fund provide a convincing groundwork of how the Western world can best help developing nations - responsible microloans to small businesses.I really like this book, and it was an eye-opener and can't say enough good things about this. But it's tough to tell what sort of audience would appreciate this book. At the very least, this should be required reading for anyone at the college level who is considering volunteer work in Africa as a reality check, to philanthropists who want to make the most effective use of their resources.

Just friggin Wow!! I am a HUGE J.A
Huss fan and this novella does not disappoint, it just makes you wish for the end of July RIGHT NOW! I hope the Bend anthology makes its way back for sale, because so far the novellas have been excellent.We get a sexy sneak peek into J.A.'s new series which sounds fan-freaking-tastic!! Harper is on the run, James is on the job looking for somebody and they happen find each other
The set up is brilliant, just a tiny look into the past of each character, placing them exactly where they are today.Harper craves connection, tired of being a nobody for the last eleven months and James fits the bill


He is on a bit of a sabbatical, but hasn't totally left the job behind
The novella is steamy, with James being just the right type of alpha to love

His explanation of the transfer of power was an absolute favorite line of mine, as it is so true.With a set up like this, I cannot wait to read the full novel and get more information on these characters
J.A

Huss's books always leave you wanting more, counting down the days for the next one to release.

Not a typical story, and this one caught me a bit off guard once a couple of twists were unraveled. I knew where it was headed, but getting there was such a treat. This is the second book I have read by Belle Aurora, and I have truly enjoyed both. I'd give it 4.5 if I could.

And I follow the story
It was annoying to need to buy all parts, when I could buy the book containing all 5 parts in one...I liked the characters, the plot, and I was frustrated that I still need to read another part to arrive to the end of the story.Erik and Keegan are hot Julianne is nice and in sort, innocent

Audrey's husband Geoff is the pastor of their local church until a self-important elder has him fired with false accusations. Because they always used bread baking to relax them, the couple opens a bakery in a building that formerly housed a drug store, home to Diane, a recently released ex-con. When Diane returns home to find an heirloom necklace, she meets Audrey, Geoff! and their son Ed. The elder is also a police detective who's wife is missing and presumed dead, a deed he suspects Audrey of. This is a great mystery and done I highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: This is my 8th America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Country cookbook, I couldn't wait to open it. The first thing I did, was to familiarize myself with the small cake pan sizes required. There's a really nice yellow layer cake recipe with chocolate frosting, and a chocolate layer cake you can frost with chocolate or vanilla frosting, they require a set of 2 - 6" cake pans. I bought two of the following pans on Amazon, they look good quality.Fat Daddio's Anodized Aluminum Round Cake Pan, 6-Inch x 2-InchI also bought a couple of small loaf pans to make the banana bread and the zucchini bread, which I made yesterday. They were very easy to make and tasted really delicious. I lined the bottoms, they stuck a bit at the sides, but soon cleaned up after a good soak.Fat Daddio's Anodized Aluminum Bread Pan, 5.5 Inch x 3.125 Inch x 2.375 InchI bought these quiche/tart pans, they are just the right size for a hungry adult. I made two 'Zucchini, Tomato and Ricotta Tarts'. The pastry (made with butter) was really delicious, they looked so colorful. I ate them both, because I just couldn't help myself! I had to diet the next day.Wilton Perfect Results 4.75 Inch Round Tart/Quiche Pan, Set of 6This book is larger and has more pages than my America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Country books, with the exception of the really huge 'Complete America's Test kitchen TV Show Cookbook. I'm a vegetarian, and occasionally like to eat fish and seafood, there are so many tempting recipes to choose from, that are sure to please vegetarians and non vegetarians. There's not a picture for every recipe, but the ones it has, are very good, I'll definitely be using this book a lot.Apart from the tasty looking recipes, it also has a lot of helpful information, I like the hint for how to cut acorn squash, I never buy it because it's too tough to cut, they use a mallet and a knife. There are also quite a few diagrams explaining how to prepare the food.The recipes look healthy. There are some nice recipes with lentils, I made Dal today and it came out good. There are also recipes using quinoa, which I'm interested in at the moment, I was amazed to find a recipe with soy crumbles. It's not often I see a recipe with meat substitute. I'm not fond of tofu though, it is so bland, but there are some really nice looking pictures of recipes with tofu, which I may try.It's packed with tempting recipes. The fruit tarts look delicious. This is the first recipe book for two I've ever bought. I'm really looking forward to not having so many leftovers, less ingredients is also good. I'm so glad I purchased this book.

$review_text.: Janny Scott worked as a journalist for The New York Times. And just before President Obama was elected President in 2008, she wrote a piece for the Times about Stanley Ann Dunham, the about-to-be-elected President's dead mother. I have read Mr. Obama's books and have learned some about his mother. But I noted that very little seems to have been written about this woman who must have had a profound influence upon her son. And now Janny Scott has provided me with so many researched pieces.This is what she did: she spent years interviewing people who knew the President's mother. And this book is filled with that information, presented in the chronology of Ms. Dunham's life.However, I would want potential readers to know this: this is not written in the style of a fluid novel because it isn't a novel. Instead Ms. Scott has presented details through the mouths of those she interviewed which include a few members of Mr. Obama's family (we must remember that he has few family members who are still alive) and then dozens of people who knew this remarkable woman as friends and colleagues.Several chapters are devoted to Ms. Dunham's professional life most of which was spent in Indonesia were she lived, for a while, with her second husband who was from that island-filled country. This is also where the President lived for a while and where his half-sister, Maya, was born and raised.Ann Dunham (she dropped the Stanley when she moved to Hawaii--her father's name) was a rather usual mother. She was only seventeen when she found herself pregnant with the future president, newly arrived in Hawaii, a student at the University. She married the senior Barack H. Obama, but soon he was off to Harvard. She apparently was unaware that he was already married and a father, his wife back in Kenya. With the assistance of her parents--Stanley Ann was an only child--who had also just moved to Hawaii, she was able to continue her studies and to begin raising her son.I won't go into any of the details. But I do want potential readers to know that if you are really interested in the life of his amazing woman, then by all means purchase this well written book. But beware that it is filled with details.

$REVIEW.: Times are changing for the nomadic tribes that move with the seasons between Pakistan and Afghanistan, leading sheep and camels to new grazing lands. Both nations now demand travel documents that tribal members with no birth certificates cannot obtain. The nomads consider themselves citizens of all countries, or none; they have no wish to be rooted. The conflict between ancient traditions of tribal life and the evolving demands of government is the most interesting theme developed in The Wandering Falcon. Another theme concerns the difficult lives endured by tribal women. Sadly, the novel's themes are stronger than the story it tells.At the age of five, a boy who comes to be known as Tor Baz watches his father shoot his mother in the back to save her from the fate that his father will soon endure. Baz then watches as members of the Siahpad tribe stone his father to death to avenge his parents' sinful insult to the Siahpad: his father, a camel herder, fell in love with his mother, the wife of his father's employer, and fled with her across the barren land, hiding at a military outpost for five years before being discovered. The Siahpad leave Baz to die in the harsh environment, where he is found by a traveling party of Baluchs, desert-dwelling rebels against a government that has usurped the power of their tribal chiefs. Tor Baz is the novel's recurring character, although he disappears from time to time as other characters emerge. More than once as the story progresses, Tor Baz begins his life anew.In the first two or three chapters, the elegant simplicity of Jamil Ahmad's writing style and the evocative landscape he creates reminded me of J.M. Coetzee. Unfortunately, that's where the comparison ends. While Coetzee's novels inspire the reader to draw larger truths from small, personal stories, Ahmad tells the reader too much. As is often true, the novel is at its best when it spotlights individual lives. When Ahmad attempts to broaden the story to encompass the plight of entire tribes, his narration becomes a bit heavy-handed. The novel shines when Ahmad uses individual characters to explore tribal customs and the political relationships between tribes and governments. When Ahmad pauses to comment upon the problems of nomadic groups around the world, the story loses its momentum and the novel suffers.Too often, the story loses its focus. A chapter describing a kidnapping of urban dwellers by tribesmen (Tor Baz plays a tangential role as an informant) illustrates the political dynamic between the tribes and the government but contributes little to plot development. In a middle chapter, point of view abruptly shifts from third person to first as a German man whose father was born into a tribe describes his visit to the land of his father's youth (Tor Baz is one of his guides). The abrupt change in point of view to that of a new character was jarring. The German serves as a vehicle for more stories about tribal politics, particularly about the tribes' shifting roles during the Second World War, but does nothing to advance the story. In the remaining chapters, point of view returns to third person. The next two chapters introduce new characters (women who are treated as property), setting up a final chapter that brings Tor Baz back to the forefront. The ever-changing storylines, only some of which tie together to form a coherent whole, give the novel a disjointed feel.In the end, I appreciated The Wandering Falcon for its educational value, but I formed no emotional attachment to it -- or rather, I lost the attachment I was beginning to form in the early chapters after the story lost sight of Tor Baz. We never get to know any character well, while Tor Baz, although positioned as the central character, remains an undeveloped enigma. This book might have worked better as a collection of short stories. Still, the strong writing and fascinating cultural issues make The Wandering Falcon well worth reading.

You would agree that we all have the same values that we believe and that we hold the same truth &#8211; we all aim to live with integrity, compassion, truth and honesty&#8230;Anyone would agree with this: Spirituality is not something we do; Spirituality is who we are.

$REVIEW.: I could spend an eternity gushing about Tiana Laveen's prowess and ability to command the attention of the reader, which borders on hypnosis, but I'll get right to my review of the 4th installment of "The Saint" series.I'll be the first to admit that I thought the series had ended with the birth of Isis, and was sure that there was nothing else that could possibly be added successfully
Boy! Was I wrong! Reading this latest installment was like glass shattering - revealing twists and turns and depth that I never thought could have ever been tapped into.Ms


Laveen has established this series as one that has a "paranormal/other-worldly" twist to it, but the story that she brings in this installment, slams to reality just who Dr
Saint Aknaten, his Queen and his seeds are


 The reality of the continuing saga is one where I COULD ACTUALLY VISUALIZE  each and every nail-biting and deliciously sensuous moment

 This time Ms


Laveen injects hard-core reality into this installment, both introducing new readers to the character, the enigma, that is Dr

Saint Aknaten, and yet reminding those hypnotized and dedicated followers, who this man really is.Saint this time is faced with problems and issues that one or all of us have either experienced or know of someone who can relate to such issues
 This is where one's attention is truly captured, because it almost seems like Saint, with all his supernatural powers, cannot deal with the harsh reality of HIS PAST SINS! This time, Ms

Laveen places Saint in the middle of a reality that the reader can imagine, and she throws down the gauntlet, and dares the reader to imagine a world where Dr


Saint Aknaten, Angel-Child, Empath, Head of The Rainbeau Knights, Sex-Therapist, Husband, Father and.....a MAN......no longer EXISTS!!!This installment is a nail-biter and one that brings the reader into the everyday lives of people that they can relate to
This book also delves into the psyche of Dr

Saint Aknaten, and reveals what makes him tick - which also happens to be his Kryptonite - His Family
Saint also, for the first time, realizes his own short-comings and is humbled by having to trust those closest to him to prevent his past sins and the sins of others from coming to haunt him.Ms
Laveen also brings to the forefront, the heartbeat of Saint - His Queen, Xenia
 This story tells of the consequences that she faces loving an Angel-Child, and also being fair-game and bulls-eye for picking and accepting the forbidden fruit that is her soul-mate - Saint.Ms


Laveen in true form touches the taboo topics and explores the religious theories of Dr


Aknaten, by boldly writing what many may criticize as "going too far" or "afraid to consider", let alone utter

Her bold catalyst for conversation regarding the subject of sexuality, the Bible and Jesus in particular shows the type of willingness to voice or at least start a dialogue on those topics that may be on the minds of many regarding sexuality and religion

Ms

Laveen expertly introduces a fire-starter on the topic of sex and pleasures and temptations of the flesh - a topic that she so expertly demonstrated in her critically-acclaimed, "Father Forgive me, For I have Loved".This installment of Saint "brings it all home" so to speak
Ms
Laveen's ability to create a character, bring that character to life, and simultaneously spin off and evolve and develop others is amazing and unmatched, to say the least


Where other authors exhaust themselves trying to keep the hero on life support after one-too-many sequels, Ms
Laveen has succeeded in reincarnating the epitome of the Alpha Male and making him the low-hanging fruit - tantalizing, tempting and forbidden - to the reader, just curious enough to venture into the naughty garden that is Saint Aknaten's Sacrament.

War is puffed as being great and that everything is fine with being in war, it's romantic and patriotic...and oh, here comes PTSD and other mental illness from men forced into killing and doing horrible acts in the name of honor.  Deserters are hardly shown in books because they are supposed to be the lowest of the low.  But here, the author shows three of the deserters in a sensitive light, showing how they did want to be honorable and fight, but saw as much honor leaving the war, to save themselves and others from the cost of it.

These book's in my opinion are really not about sex. The bigger picture are all the emotional issues. What Talker and Brian mean to each other and what they went through to survive.If you don't need your Kleenex while reading these books, there is seriously something wrong with you.

$REVIEW.: "Consciousness is All" is more a master-work than a book. A philosophical magnum opus, C is A is on a par with Heidegger's "Being and Time," Schopenhauer's "The World as Will and Representation," and Levinas' "Totality and Infinity." C is A takes the reader through nearly every philosophical argument known to nonduality. Don't panic -- C is A is intended for the non-specialist and Dziuban does a good job at making it a smooth and comprehensible read.Make no mistake: nondual philosophy IS philosophy, and transformational philosophy at that. Casually interested readers can read only so many books of nondual aphorisms before dedicating ourselves to a sincere study of the arguments of nonduality. Despite our best intentions, we will struggle with artificial dualities until we are convinced that they do not exist. Inspiring quotes and aphorisms, dialogues and poems can only take us so far. Unfortunately, if we haven't done at least some introspective work, our customary thinking will come right back as soon as we've finished our books of nondual poems and aphorisms. C is A gives us nondual fish, and teaches us how to fish. Here is a brief list of things C is A does, which other books in the field do not do or have not entirely achieved:1) C is A is an incredibly hard-working book which Dziuban and his editors obviously worked terribly hard to produce. It is completely free of spelling and grammatical errors, disconnected paragraphs, redundant text, opaque sections, straw-man arguments, cheap shots, and unanswered questions.2) It's a very relaxing read because each chapter is full of fresh new insights. Many books open with introductory chapters, climax in about the second or third paragraphs, and end with additional elaborations and filler. So the reader finds herself racing ahead at the beginning to get to the "point," and struggling to maintain interest at the end. Not so with C is A. Its pages are chock-full of exciting insights and high-quality, easy-to-follow arguments. Although the chapters certainly build upon each other, and each offers a fresh perspective, the reader doesn't feel hurried or bored. Insights are provided in the very first chapter so you don't feel you have to race to the part where you're going to get enlightened! And the final chapters are also full of exciting material, so there is no boring denouement.3) For all you "Gospel of Thomas," "I am That," and "A Course in Miracles" fans out there: C is A lends itself beautifully to discussion groups and morning meditations. I have been reading it for a year, and I plan to continue reading it for years to come. This book is more than worth the price. Treat yourself to a hard copy -- you'll be reading it a lot.J Jennifer Matthews, author of "Radically Condensed Instructions for Being Just as You Are."

As a born optimist, perhaps it is because I appreciated the way the characters have adapted to their circumstances and make the best out of a very difficult situation.

$REVIEW.: This is the story of Zach, the host of Xavier Paranormal Investigators, a show that investigates paranormal, visits haunted places and sets the trapped spirits free. Zach is very excited about his next mission. The Rosewood Asylum has been one of the most haunted places around Chicago and has been off limits to everyone. The only thing bad about the new mission is that he has to join forces with another investigating show, The Demon Hunters, and besides that his uncle, who has been possessing him since age three, can't seem to keep his thoughts for himself. Everything is about to go from bad to worse when the investigation begins and a lot of things seem out of place. In order to solve the mystery behind Rosewood and a series of fires, Zach has to first figure out who is on his side.I really loved this book. It was everything I hoped for and even more. I loved the team of investigators, so many different persons, although at the beginning I could tell which tech guy was which. Maybe to many tech-guys? Anyways, my favorite character, even if we don't get to see a lot of her was Shelly, a kind of CSI girl. I hope there will be more of her in the next book.The haunted asylum was... well, haunting. I love haunted places, castles, houses, whatever, give me a haunted place and a mystery to solve and I am happy! The mystery was well spread throughout the book, there were so many details add on from chapter to chapter and so many questions and possibilities of what will happen next. Maybe the book wasn't scary enough, since I expected a haunted asylum to be extremely creepy, but the mystery made up for it. I have to say the preview of the next book was damn scary!

$review_text.: As other reviewers have noted, this is an okay watercolor reference and how-to book. Most of the knowledge here is pretty basic, and some of the tutorials are kind of a yawn.Still, the pictures are very nice and, I think, a significant inspiration. I had already had the chance to look through this book elsewhere, and I wanted to buy it despite the lack of ground-breaking content or variety. Sometimes you just need a bit of  inspiration. For me, the painting style here presented wouldn't offer enough variety to keep me interested for long, but it does have great appeal and should prove useful when used as an element of a larger work, rather than always being made into the whole work.

$REVIEW.: At the risk of sounding like a broken record (particularly if one has read any of my other reviews of 40K novels), M. Abnett is easily the most talented writer in the Black Library stable of authors. His works often become canon in the game universe, and much of his writings have formative effects on the latter editions of Games Workshop's Warhammer 40K game, much in the same way that M. Watson's writings did for the earlier editions.Ravenor, is an excellent action-adventure that utilizes many of the characters introduced in the Eisenhorn Trilogy: Inquisitor Ravenor, Kara Swole, and Harlon Nayl to name a few. M. Abnett also adds a wealth of entirely new cast-members for our entertainment. Ravenor himself is a fascinating character, essentially limited to the realm of his psychic abilities by his physical restrictions. This book clearly delves more into the background of psykers, their abilities, and the interesting physical consequences thereof than any other penned so far.One of M. Abnett's chief talents lies in creating a vivid, believable setting. The locations sing with the gothic feel of the universe, but from the vibrant view of the privileged and powerful, rather than the teeming, hopeless masses. His characters are bigger than life, but he ensures that there are equally capable antagonists who can match them blow for blow. This contrast provides dynamic tension throughout the work. Unlike some, his villains act intelligently and have believable motivations of their own. Unlike some less capable 40K authors, he makes very little use of dues ex machina and creates resolutions that don't destroy suspension of disbelief.If M. Abnett has a weakness, it's his endings, during which his plot devices can become a little too abrupt and a little less believable, but this is a minor annoyance in an otherwise excellent whole. It is also clearly the first book in a series, and though it comes to a conclusion of sorts, it leaves most of the bigger questions unanswered, and the characters make plans for future operations in the "last" chapter."Fluff"-ologists will love the book, as it covers new ground for psykers and has an abundance of other background material. General science fiction readers will enjoy it on its own merits. There is a worthy sequel already out, Ravenor Returned (which I have also reviewed).In short: an excellent action thriller which promises to be the start of another trilogy for a fine writer.

$review_text.: Most of us will never ride in an endurance event but by reading this book we can get an idea of what it entails. It certainly causes the reader to respect those who are endurance riders! There are many practical tips that are helpful for the 300-500mile/day rider.  I sent a couple E Mails to the author and recieved a speedy response and an answer to my question as to why there were so few Harley's in these events (apparently BMWs are better suited for the 1000+ grueling miles and nature of these contests.) Any motorcycle rider would enjoy this book as would any non biker who enjoys reading about individuals meeting and overcoming challenges in life.

The main character Estela is just hilarious as she muddles her way through her family issues, friends issues , work issues and mostly her issues with men.As soon as I finished I jumped on the internet to download the next instalments as I could not wait to see what she got up to and how she fared in all of the above areas
I loved the mix of romance mystery and humour it was a perfect balance and I have since recommended the entire series to all my friends.Once of the best series I have read in a long while.

$review_text.: Something about Sandy Deluca's writing gets to me. I am not sure exactly what it is, but IT exists. This is a story of a young woman that takes place during a huge blizzard in the city of New York.I like the way Ms. Deluca writes women. They are deeply flawed creatures, riddled with guilt and they carry the burdens of tough lives. Yet they are stronger than they appear. Stronger than they think they are. They are fascinating. I've read two books now where these females are the protagonists and I loved them both.The atmosphere of this book is dark and spooky. Old churches in Harlem; old apartment buildings where whole floors are blocked off. Snow is burying the city outside. Can you picture it?The scene is set.Throw in an old spirit, psychedelic drugs, visions and nightmares, ancient books and the distortion between reality and ...not reality. The end result is something that will stick with you for a while.This story is almost surreal at times. If you don't like that type of style, then this one may not be for you. But this story weaved a web around me and it refused to release me until I was done. Loved it!Disclosure: I received this book free as a prize, from a Meet the Author event hosted by Darkfuse.

$review_text.: I am not a mathematician by any means.  I have failed college algebra twice and statistics once.  I needed this so bad and I wish that I had read it before I attempted, and failed miserably, statistics the first time.  I am a college graduate, but I was a high school drop out.  I needed something that would give me the basics in an easy to understand, step-by-step process.  As my husband says I needed it broken down "Barney style."  For the people that complain about typos I say "it's not an English lit book!"  This is intended to help you get through the nightmare that is statistics.  It claims to simplify statistics so that anyone can get it and it delivers on that promise.  It covers a variety of statistics topics like binomial distribution, which is my personal boogieman, hypothesis testing, and linear regression.  Do I think I will ever use statistics in my every day life?  No.  Unfortunately though for a lot of degree plans statistics is a necessary evil and if you're not a math genius you're going to need some help.  This book is that help.

$REVIEW.: I don't usually go into stores that sell comix and games, so it was purest luck that I even found The Tale of One Bad Rat.  Originally I bought the four comic-book format issues one by one as they arrived.  I purchased the first issue initially because of the amazing colored pen and ink illustrations (I do pen and ink drawing myself), and once I had read the first issue of the story, I eagerly awaited the other three issues.  I'm sorry to say the four issues got lost during a move, so when I saw The Tale of One Bad Rat in book form, I snapped it up.Helen Potter wanders into the school laboratory and saves the rat's life (and also turns all the other lab rats loose after seeing what happens to them).  In turn, the rat saves Helen's life several times; she doesn't follow through with the several imagined suicides she visualizes in her mind was because she has "...responsibilities."  She had "a rat to support."  I have to admit that when Helen returned at one point and found that her pet rat had been killed by a housemate's cat, it brought me to tears (and I'm a cat lover!).The illustrations are consistently wonderfully done, and the intercutting of her negative memories of abuse and her positive admiration of the example of Beatrix Potter's stories and artwork into the story is masterful.  Her declaration that she will not be a victim any more and her confrontation of her weak, manipulative father are heroic.  And the illustrations of her life in the British countryside following that confrontation are all joy.Another reviewer thought "the abuse wasn't brought in subtly enough."  Respectfully I respond that while abuse may be insidious, nothing about abuse is subtle, not in the acts themselves, not in the lasting damage on many levels which abuse causes, and not in the confusion and powerlessness and self-loathing suffered for years after the fact(s) by the victim.

$REVIEW.: Indulge: 100 Perfect Desserts, by Claire Clark, is an inspiring collection of unique recipes that range in difficulty from moderate to complex
As an experienced home baker & cook I appreciated how this book challenged me to up the proverbial ante


Though recipes for things like apple and cinnamon charlotte, carrot cake and shortbread don't require too much kitchen know-how, other recipes will force you to flex your culinary muscles


A recipe for Feuilles D'Automne (which consists of layers of hazelnut meringue sandwiched with a hazelnut chocolate mousse and covered in crisp chocolate leaves) requires you to know how to make meringue, mousse, and how to temper chocolate, for instance
Clark has helpfully included a "Secrets of Success" section at the beginning of each chapter, which is filled with tips that teach you how to master many of the skills utilized in the book

She also includes a useful index of UK to US conversions (which lets you know that what she calls "cornflour" is called "cornstarch" stateside), as well as notes with most recipes, where she guides you through especially difficult steps and shares tricks she has used in her own kitchen
Under her instruction ordinary gingerbread becomes a veritable feast for the senses, with individual gingerbreads covered with crystallized rose petals, syrup and butter cream


I was especially delighted with her recipe for "dumph noodle," which is a kind of bread smothered with homemade cr&egrave;me anglaise


It was a tremendous hit with everyone who tried it and has been added to my list of favorite recipes.Because the recipes in this book have such a wide range of difficulty, "Indulge" would best be enjoyed by someone with a solid foundation of culinary knowledge and a desire to greatly improve their skill
Anyone who can bake, cook and meringue their way through the entirety of this book will find themselves in possession of a wealth of invaluable know-how

The only caveat I would offer is this: unless you are already an accomplished baker/cook, many of the recipes will be daunting
I have yet to master Clark's recipe for Turkish Delight, which though I've followed it to the letter three times, has ended in complete disaster on every occasion

When this happens I find myself thinking about those "Star Trek" moments when Bones would turn to Jim and say something like "I'm a doctor Jim, not a pilot!" Well, in my case I'm a baker not a candy maker, and I'm completely fine working through the learning curve

One of these days I will master the magic of Turkish delight! In the meantime I have my dumph noodle, honey madeleines, and many other scrumptious treats to keep me company.Chapters include: Biscuits and Cookies; Cakes; Pastry; Meringues; Custards and Creams; Desserts, Mousses and Jellies; Puddings; Ices and Petits Fours
A "Suppliers" index is also included at the back of the book.

This book tells you not only how tough it is (with good tips to make it a bit easier) but also how isolating it (again with great tips to combat that). No grim stories. Just the honest truth that one days you will love being at home with your kiddos and other days you will ready to work a job any job just to escape them. Kinda like any job.But this book will help you navigate these feelings a bit better. It also will help you not to feel resentful to your husband for working outside the home. (Because let's face it every SAHM has felt a little resentful of kid free lunches in restaurants, business trips and expense accounts. We forget about the deadlines, stress and annoying co-workers.) One tip: this book is written for anyone staying at home but is written by a women and pretty much assumes that the reader is a mom as well.

$review_text.: I got this book because I had read and enjoyed Michael Sullivan's Riyria Revelations book, and I was curious how he would write a different genre and different world. I was not disappointed.Hollow World is a time travel story, but in a very classical way, similar to The Time Machine, in that the story isn't ABOUT time travel itself; instead, time travel is the vehicle by which the main character reaches a new world and a fundamental different society. After that, it is much more like a first contact story.The book reads quickly and the pacing is good, it was fun to read and hard to put down.Some of the interpersonal conflicts and emotions were revealed sort of abruptly, but all were believable.

 It's appropriate for boys and girls, especially as there is a boy bunny and a girl bunny as main characters in the story

 It would be great to read to a child or for those just starting to read for themselves


 It has a few questions at the end for the child to apply the story to themselves and some butterfly facts, too


 A really cool feature is an audio copy you can download from the publisher for free


This is the third book in the series, but it stands alone

This part of the story is the biggest and most unwelcome shock. It's a bold and daring move that works brilliantly. The added thrills make this a mystery/thriller/romance. My heart is pounding just remembering all his stunts.Whitney wrote a realistic account of what couples endure. There are plenty of things that could, and often do, go wrong in any relationship. The couples that are truly in love have the patience to work it out, no matter what. At Last gives us Jonathan and Claire. Do they have the love to last?Incredible. I love it.

$review_text.: Many alternative histories suffer either from the author's axe to grind, or simply an excess of determinism:  X country lost due to lack of whatever.  If they had "only" done something else, the outcome would certainly have been different.Most descriptions of war-losing mistakes by the Luftwaffe revolve around two, maybe three precepts:  no development to production of a four-engine strategic bomber; lack of long range drop tanks for the Bf-109 lost the Battle of Britain (and by extension the war due to two fronts), and Hitler missed a golden opportunity by not accelerating production of the Me-262.  These ideas are based either on what is known in the intelligence community as "mirror-imaging"; the tendency to see yourself in the actions or intentions of the enemy, or else on one book.  Lack of a strategic bomber must have doomed the Luftwaffe's war effort as it could not strike at enemy warmaking because the Allies did so-and they won.  Ergo, a strategic bomber was a must-even though strategic bombing did not do anywhere near the economic disruption claimed at the time, or postwar for that matter.  Adolf Galland's bio "The First and the Last" was enormously influential in many historians' views of the Luftwaffe and its strategy.  One of his claims was that if only his crew's had drop tanks they could have stayed with the bombers for a tactically significant time and inflicted unacceptable losses on the RAF.  The second was that Hitler's bungling prevented the effective employment of the Me-262 which would otherwise have ended bombing raids over Germany.  None of these theses take into account the old military adage that the enemy always has a vote, and the allies would have responded to each threat."Luftwaffe Victorious" takes a less deterministic view based on research of the last 10 -15 years.  In this story, nothing is truly decisive in and of itself.  Four engine bombers are put in production, but due to actual economic conditions only a few hundred are constructed.  They play key roles in the Battles of Britain and the Atlantic, plus the airwar in the East, but the Allies find countermeasures.  Drop tanks are employed, but the actual problems with them, leakage and the tendency to hang instead of drop, are enough to keep single engined fighters from overcoming a flawed strategy.  As far as the Me-262 is concerned it is immediately put into production, but is more effective as a low-level bomber over the invasion beaches than as a fighter.  In essence, Hitler was actually correct!  Such a revolutionary aircraft demanded changes to air combat tactics.  Tactics take time to develop and teach, time the Germans just do not have due to overwhelming Allied numbers and increasing technological sophistication.  The Allied response is to accelerate B-29 production and deploy their jet prototypes.This book is a pretty decent summation of the current views on the German Luftwaffe, and actually an interesting alternative history.  Recommended.

$REVIEW.: How Did You Get This Number (apparently, no question mark in that title) is a collection of nine essays, ranging in topic. In the opening essay, Crosley takes an impromptu, off-season jaunt to Portugal for no apparent reason, and meets a troupe of clown college students; later, she discusses the relative merits and demerits of Alaska, when she attends a friend's wedding in "Light Pollution;" and later still she discusses getting thrown out of Paris ("I do not think you should come to this place again"), and having a dealer of furniture who will get you things "Off the Back of a Truck."These essays are always witty and sometimes funny. There's no real connection between any of them, but Crosley has a way with words that is often poignant and rings true. Sometimes her ramblings don't make total sense, but I found myself laughing out loud numerous times while reading these essays. Crosley always manages to remain pragmatic about her experiences, even as she dates a guy who turns out to be no good, or accidentally breaks into a stranger's courtyard in Paris, or shopping for roommates on Craigslist (been there, done that!). Embarrassing experiences like these are prime fodder for Crosley's self-deprecating style, and she can even be philosophical about childhood games like Girl Talk (a game from my own adolescence I remember very well...). What I like about Crosley's essays is that her experiences are so relatable.There are some weak essays in the book (the two subjects of the last one in particular don't seem to go together, and I didn't quite "get" the one about taxis. In all, however, this is a very strong collection of essays, and a great follow-up to I Was Told There'd Be Cake. Definitely worth reading if you're looking for a humorous memoir where the author doesn't take herself too seriously.

$REVIEW.: A Hearts On Fire ReviewFOUR & A HALF STARS--This was such a delightful, comforting, funny, angsty, sad, yummy, quirky, sexy and simple read. Alex Kidwell's "After the End" is a tale of finding love after losing the love of your life. It's a story that hope can still reign supreme. I enjoyed all of the characters and the ease of this story. I even loved Winston Churchill the cat.Quinn O'Malley lost the love of his life two years ago to cancer and has been living a kind of half life. And after being set up by his best friend on a blind date, you kind of wonder what life would have in store the grieving man.Well, life decided to gift him Mr. Brady Banner. Tall and blonde with the right words to say on the tip of his tongue (how I like 'em). These two couldn't be more different at first glance, Quinn's so reserved while Brady is not. You'd have thought disaster was imminent. But thankfully it wasn't. These two got along together like pie filling and pie crust. (read the story to get the meaning)I enjoyed this story so much. I loved the patience of Brady and his understanding and guidance on helping Quinn grieve. Quinn was not annoying and though he missed his deceased partner, it did not saturate the entire story or detract from these two falling for one another. Their road to love was a bit bumpy but worth it.My one little teeny, tiny, issue was the start of Quinn and Brady's love affair. At their first date, I felt like I was in Quinn's shoes and Brady was a little too close for comfort. He already started touching and kissing him and this was Quinn's first gallop back into the dating world. But after delving into the men's background and seeing how they were, it was almost forgotten. But it still niggled in the back of my mind. And they kind of fell into love kind of quick but if I had a hot boy like Brady, maybe I wouldn't mind so much.So all in all a lovely read and happy ending that left me with a huge smile on my face.Don't you just love stories like that? I do.Hope you will as well. ;)

$review_text.: Wendell Berry's fictional town of Port William, Kentucky has proven to be fertile ground for a legacy of graceful, lovely stories about the place and its citizens. Berry has a knack for honing in on the key moments in his protagonists' lives when they reach very personal revelations about themselves and those around them. Add to this a gentleness of style, whether the stories are funny, tragic and/or all points inbetween, and you have narratives that stay with you after you've finished reading them.This collection of stories about Port William spans the late 19th century to the tail-end of the 20th century. Most of the stories have been anthologized in other collections, but taken together here in chronological order, this anthology makes for a novel-like whole about people, their town and their ways of life that are either gone or gradually disappearing. Rather than sadness, though, the overall sense I get from Berry's tales is one of gratitude that such lives and such times came to pass and that they could be chronicled.Idealized and parochial visions? Perhaps, but in a USA that these days seems so broadly fragmented across social, political and geographic lines, and where so much time and energy is spent detailing the worst aspects of an American dream gone wrong, it's heartening to read fiction by someone who remembers the good if flawed humanity that we all possess. This anthology and Berry's other fiction about Port William are storytelling at it's best. Recommended.
$SUMMARY.: First-rate.

$REVIEW.: I can't say that I loved it as much as most other readers, but I enjoyed it 10 times more than I did A Hidden Fire, the first book in Hunter's Elemental mysteries. The Scribe is a bit slow for me. Not much happens in this story until the end...and then there's a doozy. So why am I rating it 4.5 stars? The slow build is suspenseful. It was NOT a book I couldn't put down, but it was one I HAD to keep picking back up. It's all in the way she writes. Hunter puts the story together beautifully. Though I gravitate towards more hardcore stories, I can stop and appreciate the way this story unfolds. It's a sweet, simple romance with a little paranormal thrown in. This is the sort of thing mainstream audiences love, so I think YOU will too.FYI, I had the pleasure of meeting Elizabeth Hunter when she came to Houston a few months ago. LOVED chatting with her. Hats off to her on all her success. *bowing down*
$SUMMARY.: Great suspense.

$review_text.: I absolutely loved this book! Elden Auker pitched in the major leagues from 1933 through 1942. He was a good pitcher, though never a great one. In this book, this good, humble man looks back on his career and the many personalities he came to know. Auker began his career by coming in out of the bullpen and striking out Babe Ruth. Some of his best tales are about the Babe. For instance, the Yankees had trouble finding a roomate for him because Ruth would often come in late and loud, and wake up his roomy. But Auker tells us the real reason no one wanted to room with Ruth was because he farted almost constantly throughout the night, and in a highly fragrant way. So the Yanks would stick the latest rookie with Ruth, and the rookie would invariably complain. Auker tells other tales about such greats as Ted Williams, Hank Greenberg, Charlie Gehringer, Lou Gehrig, Goose Goslin, Mickey Cochrane and Leo Durocher. This book is great entertainment and is recommended for anyone with an interest in baseball history.

$REVIEW.: Beautifully written, insightful novel that captures the atmosphere and personal experience of life during the period between the world wars in Germany.  It is often challenging, always engrossing.  There is a true depth of understanding in this author's work and the writing rises to the level of some of the finest literature produced concerning the national character of the German people.  The individual characters are well defined, real, and involving.  It is a book that makes the reader think and successfully evokes an empathy for the characters, avoiding stereotypes and creating memorable dialog and feelings. It is much more than a simple look at the rise of Nazism and more about the challenges to the human soul in a world where one's beloved home has gone mad and you have become a stranger.  I hope to read more from this author in the near future and recommend this novel without reserve.
$SUMMARY.: Memorable, Beautiful Novel
