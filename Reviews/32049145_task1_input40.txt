$REVIEW.: The book grabbed me from the beginning and was painful to put down!  An easy read, the characters were likable, and the story was gripping.  Though the infinite Pearl Jam references and multiple grammatical errors in the Kindle edition were a little distracting, I liked this so much, I still gave it five stars and will download the author's other books immediately!

$REVIEW.: I read an excerpt from this book in the 2014 Campbellian Anthology. It really set a compelling, creepy mood right from the get-go, and I wanted to read more so I purchased it for my Kindle.I don't want to spoil the story. I would say that the first half was really tight and I was really interested in what was going to happen, but the second half was a bit of a let-down. The book is well-written, make no mistake, but at the parts where I should have been getting goosebumps and sitting on the edge of my chair, I found myself thinking &#34;been there, done that.&#34;While it is next to impossible to come up with a truly original horror story, it's important to bring something fresh to the table. Sadly, this doesn't. If you are a real horror fan, I can recommend it without reservation because it *is* a solid bit of workmanship, but if you're looking for something new and different, you would best look elsewhere.
$review_summary.: Nice creepy feel but doesn't break any new ground.

$REVIEW.: As far as celebrity literary agents go, Donald Maass is number one. His agency is one of the most in-demand groups in the business. He's a highly sought-after speaker, teacher, and authority in the industry. His writing craft book, Writing the Breakout Novel, is on almost every required reading list for authors I have ever seen. Basically, this guy has some credentials. So when Writer's Digest contacted me to review his latest book, The Breakout Novelist, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, the final verdict for me was more mixed than I would have liked.The Good: Maass knows what he's talking about. He's guided best-selling careers for decades, and that's the subject matter of this book (as opposed to simply writing a great novel, he's discussing having a great novel-writing career). The last two sections of the book, titled "Achieving Breakout Greatness" and "Building a Breakout Career," are great. The practical tools after parts one and two are worth the price of admission alone. While these tools are available for free download (and Maass tweets them weekly on Twitter), you really need to read the rest of the book to know how to best use them. There is a wealth of valuable information contained here.The Bad: I barely made it to the good stuff because of the first third of the book. I almost gave up. That is not to say there's not some good information in the first part of the book. I can't completely put my finger on the reason for this. Had I read it all before? Perhaps. Additionally,  the examples are stale, though not quite old enough to be considered classics. Great fiction is great fiction, regardless of era, but when you're talking about being a novelist NOW in today's publishing world, I don't find it very helpful to use an example from 1946. That could just be me. The examples do pick up in the latter part of the book. Additionally, I found myself lost several times while reading. We'd have a catchy chapter title, a great intro, then we'd deviate into a subheading that seemed to have very little to do with the chapter. After several pages, I'd stop and frown. What were we talking about again? Not great for a reference book, as this is supposed to be.I liked Maass' humorous, conversational style, but he seems to have a reluctance to use contractions, which didn't fit his overall voice. And this book has the f-bomb in it. I know, I know, I'm probably part of a tiny minority of people that this bothers, but whatever. If I hardly find it necessary in fiction, you can guess how I feel about it in a writing craft book. But since this has nothing to do with how helpful this book is or isn't, it wouldn't cause me to subtract stars from my review.The Ugly: I hate to say what I'm about to say. I really do. I have been very pleased with several Writer's Digest books I've read in the past, including Plot Versus Character by Jeff Gerke and Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell, and I'm currently loving Writing the Paranormal Novel by Steven Harper and Story Engineering by Larry Brooks, but I can't write an honest review without going here. The editing in this book is bad. While it's not uncommon to find a few typos in published work, this book is riddled with them. It's ironic to read Maass' comments on editing when there are so many errors in his own work. They're not only in the main sections of text, but also in excerpts from example novels. Perhaps worst of all is the fact that the chapter title at the bottom of the page throughout the whole chapter "Making the Impossible Real" is mislabeled as "A Singular Voice," which is the title of the previous chapter. These errors are just too egregious to be overlooked, in my opinion. I'm sure this book will sell well, and I hope the publisher will correct these flubs in future editions. They were quite distracting.Bottom Line: Would I recommend this book to authors? Yes, but with some qualifiers. To get anything out of it, you have to be willing to overlook its faults (and a little swearing). You have to push through that first section to get to some better content. I know I will be referencing this book again in the future, if nothing else then simply to use the exercises for manuscript improvement. If you're thinking of clicking that "Add to Cart" button, then proceed. With caution.Note: Writer's Digest provided me with a copy of The Breakout Novelist for reviewing purposes.

$review_text.: I have been a huge fan of author Frank Nappi since I read his debut novel, the award-winningEchoes from the Infantry: A Novelin 2005. My faith in his great potential was rewarded; since then he has writtenThe Legend of Mickey Tussler: A Novelwhich was released as a film last September and is now a DVD. Movie title is "A Mile in His Shoes," starring Dean Cain and Luke Schroder.And now Nappi has pennedSophomore Campaign: A Mickey Tussler Novel, the exciting sequel which is also slated for film.Sophomore Campaign picks up where "Mickey Tussler" left off, with Mickey, the autistic young baseball player, and Arthur Murphy, the coach who discovers him, entering another season of minor league baseball for the beloved Milwaukee Brewers.Mickey's mother Molly finally leaves his abusive father and they move in with Murph who is very good to them, nurturing them in all ways.  He becomes a surrogate father to Mickey, while Molly and Murph develop feelings for each other, but agree to keep it platonic.After last season's violent conclusion, Molly is reluctant for Mickey to play again this year; she fears their main rival team might get violent again, damaging her son's spirit beyond repair.With a wicked pitching arm, Mickey has become the team's most valuable asset and is idolized by baseball fans all over. When in the game, he overcomes his social awkwardness and mental fragility, and due to Murph's tender, loving care, he certainly learns all about baseball.The trouble starts this season with the opposing pitcher holding a huge grudge against Mickey for gaining such popularity. With the approval of his unethical coach, he plans to undermine Mickey at every opportunity, even to cruelty, if need be. But the real trouble commences with Murph hiring an African American ballplayer with raw talent and great potential.Remember, this is set in the 40s when prejudice was still pretty rampant... It's enough to say that the entire team is subjected to racial threats and violent episodes, one of which Mickey witnesses firsthand. His struggles to understand such ugliness and hatred affect his game... That's all I can say without giving spoilers.Why does Molly Tussler finally consent for her son to play again? What happens when fans quit attending games because of their outdated prejudices, and how do the fans treat the new player Sledge? How does this effect Mickey? What happens between the club owner and Coach Murph? And how does the Klu Klux Klan become involved?But for romantics, the main question is what finally happens between Murphy and Molly? :-)I thoroughly enjoyed reading the answers to those questions, and I'm certain you will, also. Frank Nappi is a gifted writer who understands human nature and has a clear, concise way of presenting his stories. He makes his characters, the games and the scenery come alive before your eyes. I really care what happens to each and every one of them; even while rooting for the bad guys to get their comeuppance...Despite representing the 40s accurately (with all its prejudice), this is a very wholesome, inspiring book. You will end up admiring this author as much as you love the spirit of Mickey Tussler, a role model for autistic children everywhere.Since "The Legend of Mickey Tussler" was a homerun, Sophomore Campaign is a grand slam!Very highly recommended...Reviewed by Betty Dravis, April 25, 2012Author of award-winning "1106 Grand Boulevard"
$SUMMARY.: Nappi Surpasses the Homerun! This one's a Grand Slam!

$review_text.: Leigh Brackett was an extremely influential American author who wrote and won major awards in a number of genres, including western and noir.  She is best remembered, however, for her TOWERING contribution to fantastic fiction (a term I prefer to use because it's often very difficult to draw a hard line between sci-fi and fantasy), particularly during the 1940s and '50s.  Most of her fan-fi can be classified as planetary romance: a sub-genre pioneered in the early 20th century by Edgar Rice Burroughs and which characteristically involves travel to, and adventure on, fanciful planets where savagery and sword-play carry the day rather than radium and ray guns.  Though countless planetary romances ranging from dreckish to dazzling have fluttered off the printing presses since Burroughs' classic Barsoom series, Brackett's are some of the absolute TOPS, and the milieu in which they take place is unforgettable:  Earthlings have long possessed the secret of interplanetary space travel and have been very, very busy lording it over the rest of the solar system, almost every planet of which is home to its own human race(s) (generally the dominant inhabitants prior to the advent of spacefaring Earth) and most planets of which have one or more unique "halfling" races:  half-animal or half-insect-seeming humanoids who are typically equal to homo sapiens in intelligence.  Whether directly concerned or looming in the background, colonial Earth's rocky (and often exploitive) relationship with its extra-terrestrial subjects almost always plays some part in these stories, which are typically fast, wild and tinged with a tingly touch of shady-alley noir.This slick and affordable edition, courtesy of Paizo Publishing's "Planet Stories" line, contains two wonderful Brackettales:  THE SECRET OF SINHARAT and THE PEOPLE OF THE TALISMAN.  They both take place on Mars: a dying world where savage tribes vie with sword and axe for what few resources remain, and in which a few relatively civilized settlements, fearful of the wild hordes, huddle behind either the colonial government or the chance protections of geography.  They both also star Eric John Stark the mercenary, Brackett's most famous hero.  Stark, raised by Mercurian halflings and colored black by the sun and atmosphere of that world, is sort of an amalgam of James Bond (the itchy, watchful, but occasionally careless Bond of the original Fleming novels, not the unflappably icy fellow in the boring movies) and Conan the Barbarian.  Though Stark's services are often purchased by the indigenous tribes of Mars (he would never fight for the colonial government), he often undertakes deadly missions simply to honor those to whom he is bound by friendship, and that is how both of these terrific stories -- one taking place on the floor of an aeons-dead sea and the other on Mars' snow and ice-choked northern cap -- begin.  Oh, but don't be expecting any Martian halflings; they're all dead by this time!  To see what Brackett's red planet was like in its hey-day, halflings and oceans and green fields and all, you'll have to read THE SWORD OF RHIANNON, another short novel that may be reprinted by Paizo in the future.Before I go, let me say that I really like these Paizo volumes; the covers are really nice and thick and are pre-creased next to the spine to prevent curling.  If this attractive little edition gets you hungry for more Brackett, you will be happy to hear that Paizo plans to print a lot more of her stuff in the future and also that Haffner Press already has two BIG and BEAUTIFUL hardcover collections of her short stories for sale:Martian Quest: The Early BrackettandLorelei of the Red Mist: Planetary Romances.  They are fiiiiine, baby, real fiiiiine!

$review_text.: I really enjoy the concept of the book, it is very different from what I normally read. When I first saw it on the blog tour, I knew I had to try it out.First let's begin with how I really liked how everything started rolling from the first chapter. A lot of the characters were introduced without sounding amateur. You know some books just straight out say "I am blah blah, age blah, gender blah, in love with blah, has superpower blah." This book didn't directly introduce the characters in a "list" format but it still maintained the fast pace. When the story just began it felt like I was at one of the concerts (sure I never been to a concert in my life but I guess that was what it felt like). It was really easy to be transported into the world Kailin created. It really felt like the words and music notes wrapped me up and dissolved me into the book; it was a thrilling ride.I immediately took a liking to Neve; she wasn't like any girl I had ever read. It was easy for Neve and the boys to joke and have fun. It really felt like they were buddies. She was a badass too. Can we take a moment and appreciate Neve? She basically managed with these dudes and held the band together. She was ambitious, and driven, but not in a stupid way. Some female characters are ambitious in a stupid way, you know what I mean? You don't? Well some female leads appear like they are some god who can just walk into a room full of gunmen and take everyone down. I don't care if you are Black Widow or Cat Woman or Wonder Woman, don't be stupid. Neve was smart. Sure she had feelings for some dudes but she kept it under control. She was smart and efficient. She was also the daughter of a rock star. If I was a daughter of a rock star I would be lying around all day going on the internet all day (not saying I am not already). She never took advantage of her dad' status.Steve was like your Neville of Never Say Never (at least the movie version where he is now GORGEOUS!). Geoff was your annoying douchebag of the bunch; he was the guy that thought he was all high and mighty (yes I wanted to punch him). Luc seemed like the super awesome dude that ladies love and wanted a little more with Neve. Kyle, soft, gentle and knowing type of dude. He was protective type especially toward Neve. He also had a tough childhood. I really liked that, it provided so much more character to him.And oh helllooooo Danny Blue. British accent, check. Jet black hair, check. Piercing blue eyes, check. Ladies, are you in love already? Oh and did I forget to mention that he was mysterious too? When he was first mentioned I was doubtful of him. I was thinking "oh no, not another gorgeous dude again." BUT! Oh Ashley *hits self*, why did I doubt him? Danny was the whole package. He was kind and mature, dark, and mysterious. Trust me, I wanted to know everything about him. I wanted to know his past, his present, and his future. Whoa, I am turning into a crazy stalker? (Yes I am.) But seriously guys, he was normal (and by normal I mean in a he-actually-sounded-like-a-real-person kind of way). Maybe this was my hopeless dreaming talking but he really felt realistic. Sure he was described as toned and gorgeous, but the actions he did made him sound like a human being. I probably don't make any sense right now. Blame my fangirl mind. Oh, did I forget to mention he is a TA? Hello university! (If you don't know, I am starting university in next week). If I had a TA like that...(I'll leave your imagination here).Furthermore, I just love the forbidden love thing. There was just something in the writing I loved. I don't know how to describe it. Maybe I had been watching quite a lot of anime with forbidden love recently or maybe it is something else but wow, I want more! The pace of the book was fast but to me I liked it. I never liked a draggy book. This book was able to provide enough details and thoughts but at the same time not introducing a lot of unnecessary fluff.This book is a must read! I never read anything like this. The story will trap you while it electrifies all your senses. PLEASE! I WANT THE SECOND BOOK RIGHT NOW, LIKE NOW! Have I just encountered my favourite read of 2012? Yes I have my friends.

$review_text.: If I have to choose one thing I admire about Zee Monodee's body of work, it would be - hands down - her compassionate, intuitive development of characters. This, added to the cultural flavor she imbues her stories with, offers poignant depth and dimension. Zee Monodee knows her characters, what makes them tick, what drives them to make hard decisions, and she knows the culture she grew up in. Reading her books is like sinking deep into the beauty and also the not-so-nice elements of Mauritian life and customs.I'm not going to provide a summary of this book, but I'll say it's worth reading especially because you'll care for the characters and your mind will travel to new shores - experience fresh perspectives of what things are like in a very different country far, far away. And then there's the intense chemistry between hero and heroine that I found simply explosive and emotional (ooooooh, nice!). Romance + culture + family drama + characters = a fun, amazing read. Very well written and edited to high standards.

$review_text.: Ok, first off I want to say that this book is by far for those over 18 that are not squeamish. This book is not a rainbows and unicorns love story&#8230;but a love story none the less. A story of how normality of a relationship is dependent upon those involved in the relationship. If you can't handle sexual abuse, BDSM, violence, and murder turn back now. That being said&#8230;I freaking loved this book!Dimitri is a Russian mobster&#8230;so good at what he does he is betrayed by his boss and mentor who he sees as a father figure. Surviving a brutal attack he goes into hiding plotting his revenge. After years of hiding and focusing only on the destruction of his former mentor he is slightly unbalanced, frustrated, and paranoid. He knows eventually they will find him, he just has to be ready.Columbia is mentally strong but is also a wreck through and through, while surviving in her own personal hell to keep her little sister safe from an abusive father and an absent mother. Involved in group that rally's changes in the community because it keeps her close to Stewart, the boy she has been crushing on since high school, she agrees to sneak into the home of the illusive business man developing her neighborhood when the group member who was supposed to do it backs out. Little did she know the implications that her attempt to impress Stewart would have on her life.Though Demitri thinks Columbia is in his home to kill him the chemistry between them can't be denied. When he chooses not to kill her but to keep her is when the fun really begins. Two broken people who have lead terrible lives come together to be whole...not fixed. You will not believe the turn their story takes in the end!!! The emotional roller coaster this book will take you on in a span of just a few days is astounding&#8230;the pain, the fear, the anger, the danger, and the love&#8230;.OMFG!!! In a twisted version of a HEA, with no cliff hanger, I can't wait to see what is in store for Dimi and Col in the future. All I can say is go and one-click this bitch&#8230;you will not be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: Book 1, "Fastball" -- I liked this story and the hero and heroine, Jake and Maddie. I also liked Martha as secondary.However, I found three problems with this book: 1) When Jake and Maddy were making out in the back of the cab and the driver didn't pay any attention. I have a friend who drives a cab and I can tell you for sure he would have said something, especially because he probably could have seen what they were doing in the rearview mirror -- that scene just didn't seem very realistic to me.2) The scenes with the Mafia were very stereotyped and when Maddie yelled "He's got a knife," I kept picturing Jake doing a "Crocodile Dundee" and saying "That's not a knife! This is a knife!"3) Through almost the whole book, I got the idea that Maddie was very close to her mother, and very upset because the facility she was in was in Massachusetts, not Philadelphia, so she couldn't see her as much as she wanted. I know her mom had Alzheimer's, and didn't recognize people, etc., but when Jake and Maddie get married (spoiler), she's not only not at the wedding, there's no mention of her at all. Maddie just mentions her new family, like she's forgotten all about her mom.Book 2, "Hardball"I really enjoyed this story. I loved Holly -- if I had a kid, I'd want her on the job. She was self-confident and classy. I loved Nate, too, and his interaction with the kids in the hospital. I loved the way he and Holly joked around but got to know one another. I liked the scene where she's getting into his fancy sportscar and they're trying to talk formal. I loved the way this book turned out.Book 3, "Bigger Than Beckham"I'm so glad Martha got her own book -- I loved her as secondary in the first two books. She's funny and nice and someone I'd love to have as a friend. I liked Tony a lot. The book started out slow for me, but the pace sped up later. I understand how close Martha was to her father, but I like the way the book ended. I loved the pop culture reference to "Mr. Peabody's Wayback Machine," and all of Martha's funny comments.

$review_text.: I read this right after I got my Kindle.  I don't care about the format or any of that, so no comments relating to that.  There were several words the kindle dictionary didn't recognize, a little disappointing.  I found the story somewhat entertaining, totally male of course, there isn't even a mention of females until near the end of the book when they are talking about Herbert bringing his wife back.  Any group of men stranded on an island would definitely have some sort of conversation about the lack of females!  Also the mindset described (regarding killing every animal in sight without a thought) is a good reminder of why our planet is in so much trouble.  I found that aspect pretty sad actually.  The deference that everyone showed to the "captain" was pretty silly.  Finally, it was so implausible that it got boring.

$REVIEW.: Bound by Fire is the second installment in the Cauld Ane series
I got the first book in this series free (Bound by Blood) and did not read it for months
Boy was I sorry I waited so long

I enjoyed the first book so much that when I finished it I immediately bought this book
I enjoyed Bound by Fire just as much
From the characters to the setting this author's imagination is incredible
A fresh take on the paranormal romance with some Christianity thrown in make this series a great read.

$REVIEW.: Ideas for stories blossomed over and over in my mind when I read this book. It also showed me, most importantly, how I could tell my own story, which I've been struggling to do the last couple years. Grisanti takes the reader gently by the hand and leads us through that process with ease and inspiration. One of the many inspiring quotes I read in her book was: "If you detach from your ego, separate from your shame, and connect with your spirit, you will find your voice." That's powerful insight. This book is filled with them.

$review_text.: This is a marvelous read, clearly the best of the series (although I have loved them all). In this one Maxie (human) and Jazz (human and Maxie's assistant at the SNAP business) are visiting with their two love interests. Jazz is dazzled by Nik (vamp) and gets closer and closer with him. However, all the danger associated with being around the Kandesky Vampire Clan freaks Jazz out! Maxie and her vampire lover Jean-Louie do their best to help Jazz work out the internal conflict she feels. Conflicted feelings aren't reserved just for Jazz as Maxie hasn't fully accepted all the &#34;baggage&#34; that goes with loving even such an urban stud as Jean-Louie. For those who have read any or all of the first six novels the following thoughts and the single spoken word by Maxie as part of the ending for White Nights will be meaningful: &#34;And suddenly I know. All the questions, all the fears dropped away. I looked at the man I loved, the man I wanted to spend eternity with, and said, &#34;Yes.&#34; Reading that, and realizing what it meant, my heart almost jumped out of my chest...that is why I say five stars is not enough!

$review_text.: Even though Federal Husband is not Mr Wilsons best book, it is another great book truly seeking to what the BIBLE says about a man's role.  Mr Wilson urges his readers to love their wives as themselves and helps the reader understand what a biblical home will look like.  Mr. Wilson always works from scripture and attempts to expound upon all the impacts that will have on our lives.  However, at some times he says that one must know that Paul calls all things permissable for believers but not all things are benficial.  He attempts to explain what things are profitable.  Mr Wilson is extremely conservative and fully relies on the innerancy of the scriptures.  I would recomend this book only after having read some of Mr. Wilson's other books.  Infedility is his best book, in my honest opinion.

$REVIEW.: How do we break free from the embrace of pride? According to the anonymous author of Embracing Obscurity, we must first realize that we cannot do it alone; we must first submit ourselves to God. Second, we must follow the commands we find in Scripture (listed in Chapter Two).While those two suggestions might seem obvious, this book's strength is in the author's call to intentional humility. Most of us allow pride's subtle tendrils to entwine our lives, never even recognizing their existence. This author forces the reader to take a realistic look at their life: "We are told, 'Make your own attitude that of Christ Jesus' (Phil. 2:5). Yet interestingly enough, our current M.O. appears alarmingly similar to another disposition of which we learn in Scripture: Lucifer's."That section, contrasting Christ's disposition in giving up heaven to enter our world with that of Satan in rebelling against God, was the strongest of the entire book. I read each contrasting pair with eyes wide open, recognizing far too much pride in my own life. Where Jesus did not count equality with God something to be grasped, I too often presume upon His grace. Where Jesus willingly humbled Himself, I too often seek out accolades. This book speaks right into that pride, reminding me that God calls most of us to live lives of humble service.I recommend you pick up a copy of this book, primarily because it will challenge you to confront your own sin. You will be spurred to confess your pride to God and to commit yourself to a life of greater humility. While I thought the book was short on practical suggestions and became slow in the latter half, those two criticisms are far less weighty than the book's strengths, which are many.

$REVIEW.: I'm not even sure how to start this review. Some books are just so far out of my comfort zone, that I'm not sure what to say about them. Extracted by Sherry D. Ficklin and Tyler H. Jolley is one of those books. It's not a bad book, it's just different from what I normally read.Looking at the cover, I thought this was a science fiction or steampunk novel. There is definitely a story there, and an air of mystery.The Tesla Institute trains a special group of young adults called Rifters. They're trained in the art of time travel. They protect the time stream. I seriously wanted to write that they're protecting &#34;the space time continuum.&#34; While I was reading this, I couldn't help but think about the movie series Back to the Future. Where was Marty with the DeLorean? As you can see, I don't read too many books about time travel. In this book, traveling back and forth to different time periods is the norm. Some students have fantasies of altering some moments (ex: the sinking of the Titanic) in history, but they are warned against it. Changing history could put the entire universe in jeopardy. Plus, you don't want to run into a younger version of yourself in the time stream like Marty McFly. See why I kept thinking of Back to the Future!!! The Hollows, a rival faction of time travelers, are doing just that. Members of the Hollows don't care if they are messing with time. All they want is to find Tesla and take control of the time stream.Lex, a member of the Hollows, and Ember, a Rifter, are tied together, but they don't know how. Ember is constantly haunted by nightmares. Could they be nightmares from her past? Are they a glimpse into her future? She's strong when she needs to be, but the nightmares can be crippling. Lex is forced into enemy territory when his girlfriend, Stein, dies during a mission. To get her back, Lex has to steal the Dox, which can allow time travelers to re-enter their own timeline.I'll be honest, I had to re-read some parts. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. I'm so used to contemporary stories; it just takes me some time to understand  more complex plots. What wasn't complex is the character interaction, which was great. Ember is surrounded by a great group of friends. Ethan is overly confident, but Ember isn't afraid to banter back and forth with him. Her friend Kara can be a little maddening, but she is a true friend to Ember. Lex has the same level of camaraderie with Stein and Nobel, so it makes sense he is willing to into enemy territory for his girlfriend. Overall, this is a fun and engaging read. It's also good that I stepped outside of my comfort zone, otherwise I would be cutting myself off from some very worthy books!!Rating: Give it a tryNote: I received a copy of the book at BookExpo America as part of a blog tour with the publisher (Spencer Hill Press)

$review_text.: Raine Bowe, daughter of hippie parents, has been on her own since their death a few months prior.  She finds herself on the run from unknown assailants while trying to figure out what has happened to her in the last week.  Ryder Storm is alpha of his pack and known as a man who will do jobs for hire.  When he meets Raine, she initially wants to hire him to kill her because she doesn't understand what is happening to her.From the first page Taiden grabbed my attention with a fast paced chase scene where Raine seems to be running for her life.  We don't get a lot of information about where she is running from and why she's out in the middle of the night in a hospital gown but you want to learn more.  I liked how the story unfolded for us as it did Raine.  She isn't familiar with shifters and their politics but learns as she goes.Ryder is a sexy alpha male that sees Raine and knows immediately that he wants her.  As he spends time with her he realizes that she is his mate but he doesn't want to scare her off so he goes slow and lets her lead their relationship.  I liked how he was the dominate but he would allow her to have enough control so that she didn't get scared.  When they get together they are extremely hot and light up the pages.There are several secondary characters that are interesting too.  There are a lot of ways this story could grow into a series that would be fun to read.  I was a little disappointed that it was so short.  The first half of the book seemed to be focused on sex, hot steamy sex awesome sex, while they characters basically ignored the fact that Raine was the product of an experiment and don't make hardly any effort to find her captures.  I would have liked there to be more page time focused on that rather than how Raine and Ryder can't keep their hands off each other.  I would have thought the shifters would be concerned that someone was out there making more shifters for kicks and giggles but they don't seem all that worried.  The story then shifts to mainly wondering what happened to Ryder's missing cousin.Overall I did enjoy the story and I would like to see if this becomes a series.  As I mentioned there are a lot of interesting characters to draw from but I would like to see more story development as well as hot sex.book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest reviewreviewed by Megan

$REVIEW.: Here&#8217;s a book that will keep you up all night, wondering what happens next! I&#8217;ve been reading romance for decades and back in the 70s and 80s, cut my teeth on works by early romance novelists such as Laura London, Rosemary Rogers, and Beatrice Small. These were writers whose stories were rich, sweeping, memorable tales that really took a reader to a time and place which is long-gone and forever romanticized. Today, with publishers being reluctant to publish anything in settings other than the &#8220;tried and true,&#8221; about the only place one can &#8220;escape&#8221; to in historical romance is Regency England, Scotland, or maybe the Wild West, so one can imagine how excited I was when I learned that Regan Walker had penned my favorite kind of story: a sea romance!WIND RAVEN, sporting Ms. Walker&#8217;s meticulous research and keen attention to detail, is set in the early 19th century between English sea captain Nick Powell and tomboyish American Tara McConnell. Tara, who needs to return to Baltimore to see to her sick father after visiting her aunt in London, has no intention of marrying an Englishman, and certainly not the maddeningly domineering, authoritative, and irritating one who commands the schooner on which she&#8217;s about to set sail. Likewise, Nick is not in the market for a wife; he&#8217;s got orders from the Prince Regent to set sail for the West Indies to spy on and gather intelligence about (real life) pirate Roberto Cofresi.  The last thing he wants is a woman on board, and the last thing he needs is that woman showing seafaring skills equal to any in his crew . . . and causing his reluctant admiration for her to eventually grow to love.I greatly enjoyed this book. There are not many seafaring romances published anymore, and the ones that are are dreadfully lacking in authenticity, with the ship and mariner&#8217;s world a mere stage on which to base the story. As a sailboat owner and historic ship aficionado, I must say that Ms. Walker&#8217;s thoughtful, careful attention to detail and research made this one of the few seafaring romances I've ever read that felt authentic to me, and it was a real delight to read this and not get thrown of the story by poor research and unlikely events. I&#8217;ve read several of Ms. Walker&#8217;s works, and this one is by far my favorite; I hope she continues to set books on the sea, and look forward to reading them!

$REVIEW.: I have enjoyed all of Mr. Tolbert's books. His first two in the Coil Series and now this book. There is never any bad language (which I am beginning to find in other "Christian" books) and the story lines are exciting and page-turning. I am looking forward to reading more books by this author. Recommend it highly along with the Coil Series books.

Very clever and remarkably witty

I found myself wondering too, if this book was part biographical, part memoir - because the dialogue and underlying thoughts were so real
A wonderful exploration into the literary world, part history and part cultural, "The 92 year old lady who made me steal a dead man's car" is intriguing, well-written and fresh writing.

Stranger on the Shore has all of the elements we have come to expect from Lanyon's oeuvres: wit, romance, handsome heroes finding their way into one another's arms, mystery, and stylish writing. A young reporter searches for a child kidnapped two decades ago, and finds himself and love. Lanyon provides a cast of interesting characters, a deft, gripping plot, and, of course, romance.

$REVIEW.: I've been following all of the series and know the characters and background.  I'm happy the works keep coming, but I continue to feel that the author would really benefit from a professional editor who would catch the occasional inconsistencies in the story line and who would be critical of unnecessary digressions.  I realize that the author gets feedback from putting up the chapters on an internet site for comments, proofreading, etc., but that is not the same as hardnosed editing.  Finally, I seem to be of a very similar political persuasion and am also an expat living in Asia.  Therefore, I particularly enjoy the afterwords.  They remind me of the glory days of Astounding editorials.

$review_text.: Blurry is full of mystery, intrigue, secrets, lies and deceit. I love that combination. People are not always what they appear to be and Sherri definitely nailed her characters, plot and story development. Sherri's characters are so full of life, and come off a real people. Rachel was my favorite character. I can relate to her nerdy band life and see understand why she fell for Danny, our resident bad boy, once upon a time ago. I love her honesty, her integrity. She is so loyal, and I believe a lot of women can relate to a character like that. The plot was unbelievable. I like to solve mysteries ahead of time and feel like a regular Sherlock Holmes, but I was stumped with Blurry. There were too many people, too many secrets, and how lives are connected and effected kept me on the edge of my seat. This story is very much a roller coaster ride as everything you think you have figured out changes, and changes again. I was glued to the pages and couldn't flip them fast enough. Blurry is definitely a five star novel and I would recommend it for every mystery lover out there!

$review_text.: About the best I can say for this is that it wasn't the worst thing I ever read.  And it was only 99 cents.  But "First Time - The Legend of Garison Fitch"  was mostly lame on several levels.  There was no science in the fiction.  There was a half-hearted attempt at some, but it quickly became abundantly clear that the author knew very little about physics, current (or older) theories about time travel or anything scientific, or even cared.  There is an interesting subplot about parallel dimensions and an alternate history, but again that is damaged by the author's obvious lack of due diligence in his historical research.  The writing itself is also flawed.  There is a multitude of spelling, typographical and grammatical errors, including improper use of "were" in place of "was" that the author actually has Garison comment about, while using it incorrectly in dialogue.  Finally, there is gratuitous Christian proselytizing scattered throughout.The plot had potential, hence the two stars, but the author did not do his homework, and really needs to get his hands on a copy of Strunk and White and a decent editor-proofreader.JMT

$review_text.: Mystery writer Marilyn Meredith has a unique writing style that makes all her tales not only wonderful stories but also so easy to read. It is pure enjoyment every time I read one of her books. I have now read so many of them that I am beginning to feel like a real "fan". Her latest book in the "Temple Crabtree Mystery Series" is titled "Calling The Dead". This is her best work to date. She actually appears to be getting better with each of her books.Her Native American heroine is Deputy Temple Crabtree who uses her own intuitions as much as investigative tools to solve crimes. This time her little community of Bear Creek has two events that leave two people dead; one looks or appears to be from natural causes and the other could be a murder. On closer look and on her and her husband's feelings, it becomes much more complicated. Was the murder actually a suicide or an accident? And who were those two young people who reported finding the body and why did they give false names and addresses and leave so quickly? Was the other death really from natural causes? Or do we have something more going on with our new widow?The plot of this book is gently unfolded and laid out so that as Deputy Crabtree finds clues and sorts things the reader feels a real satisfaction and can almost feel like they are working the case themselves.  I enjoyed putting the pieces of the puzzle together and it made the book kind of an inter-active reading adventure for me.This book is given FIVE STARS by The American Authors Association.  It also receives my personal endorsement. It is enjoyable and entertaining and makes for a nice weekend reading adventure.

It might be money, it might be friends, it might be possessions, it might be freedom, it might be family
Whatever it is once you can pinpoint what REALLY makes you happy your life can focus on that let everything else fall where it will.This is a great personal story about how Jim overcame an anxiety attack and realized that happiness is important
He was able to find some happiness with a rod, reel, and a stream


Maybe for you it is a walk in the park with your spouse or kids


Maybe it is a day out on the golf course


Maybe it is refinishing an antique
Whatever it is don't negelect it!Great job Jim.

$REVIEW.: As you may know, I rarely read the synopsis of a book before reading it. It&#8217;s usually the cover of a book or referral from another reader, if not by an author that I&#8217;m already obsessed with, that gets me to add books to my overwhelming TBR pile. Occasionally I&#8217;ll read the first line or two, but that&#8217;s usually the extent of it. I don&#8217;t want my reading experience ruined by learning too much from the blurb. As soon as I saw the cover for Of Stardust I added it to my &#8220;to read&#8221; list on Goodreads. There&#8217;s something about that shade of blue that gets me every time. When the email came around for the blog tour I felt an overwhelming urge to sign up. So here I am!Now is probably the time I should openly admit that I&#8217;ve never been the biggest fan of traditional fairy tales. It&#8217;s probably not normal, but that&#8217;s who I am. I do love fantasy and all things magical, and I enjoy watching certain movies with my daughters, but I&#8217;ve never really gotten into reading fairy tale type stories in my bookish adventures. When it came up in my queue as the next book in line for review, I decided to skim the synopsis a bit before cracking it open. When the words Fairy Godmother jumped off the page at me, I felt a rush of disappointment wash over me. Really? Fairy Godmothers? That&#8217;s just not my thing. No, I don&#8217;t like Cinderella &#8212; call me crazy if you must. My view on the subject changed very quickly after starting the book, though. I was only about four pages in when Till&#8217;s story grabbed hold of me and the next thing I knew I was done reading the book&#8230; and I WAS PLEASED!Of Stardust is a tale filled with engaging characters and magical moments that made me forget I was reading a book. The main character, Till, is concerned about where her life is going. She&#8217;s twenty-six years old, working at her parents bookstore and still living in their house. She feels like her life is passing her by&#8230; until her Great Aunt Tilda summons her to help sort out some things at her home. Till is a bit reluctant since she&#8217;s only met her aunt once in her life, but what else does she have to do over her Christmas holiday? When Till arrives at the home of her Great Aunt Tilda, she has no idea her life is about to change forever. Her life hasn&#8217;t passed her by at all. In fact it&#8217;s just about to get started&#8230;I recommend Of Stardust to fans of all things magical and romantic. This story will sweep you off your feet when you least expect it!
$review_summary.: Engaging and magical.

$review_text.: Spoiler alert!Oh.My.Goodness. Where do I begin? First, I have to say- hello, cliffhanger! Maybe I wasn't well aware, but I totally thought Tension was going to be the end of Stella's sstory. I was definitely wrong. While I hate knowing that I'll have to wait what will feel like forever, I am thrilled for the continuation of this story. There are so many things I loved about this book. In the first book, By A Thread, I think I fell in love more with Patrick than George, up until the very end. I felt the betrayal Stella felt from the lies Patrick told her and I could feel her anger towards him throughout Tension as well. While I could understand her anger, it also broke my heart! Patrick was Stella's person and she was his, so I want them to get back to being that friend that every person needs. I love that started to let Patrick in a little, if only to help her, during Tension. I really loved how George stepped up and wouldn't let Stella go. He could see through her when no one else could and he stayed by her side, even when he knew she was holding something back. I also loved how strong willed Stella was when Jamie came back around. She was so done with him and stood up to him, instead of cowering back after  he'd lied to her, shot her, etc. Stella is a strong female character and I love reading her story. I love the writing style of this book, I love the character development, and I hate/love the suspense of waiting on book 3!

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review...When I started Selling Scarlett I wasn't sure what to expect.  I haven't read any other books by Ella James but the cover and synopsis intrigued me and honestly once I was approved I couldn't wait to dig in!The book started a little slow for me, part of me contemplated putting it down but the other part of me (the part that won out) was intrigued by the mystery surrounding Hunter West.  I had a couple of theories in mind and in the end I wanted to see if I they were right.  The more I read, the more intrigued and attached to the characters I became.Hunter and Elizabeth (aka Scarlett) were interesting characters with flaws and have been damaged by their pasts.  Hunter realizes it but Elizabeth is blissfully ignorant.  The story is told from both Elizabeth's and Hunter's perspectives.  Both are dealing with their own drama, so its like you are getting two different stories, but as their paths keep crossing they find themselves drawn to one another.  It's also interesting hearing the story told this way because you are getting different information from both perspectives that pertain to the mystery surrounding the blackmail being held over Hunter.  Will Hunter allow Elizabeth to get close enough to see who he really is?  Will Elizabeth ever be able to move on from her long-standing crush on Hunter.  While there isn't a lot of sex (Elizabeth, is auctioning off her virginity) in this book, when the two of them do get together sparks definitely fly.In the end I enjoyed the book, however, it's probably not one that I will read over and over again.  I appreciate the ending was wrapped up nicely with the characters getting their HEA and that no questions were left unanswered.  There is a second book in the series, Taming Cross, about Elizabeth's friend, which I plan to also read.

$review_text.: If you or a loved one is suffering from IBS you will want to take advantage of this comprehensive guide to controlling and healing IBS. Far too many treatments do not focus on the mental aspect of health, and medical science is well aware of the fact that thoughts play a vital role in healing.I particularly enjoyed the way this excellent book probes deep into the important link between between IBS and the belief system stored in your unconscious mind. If you aren't sure what the unconscious mind is, you will be crystal clear when you learn the difference between your creative mind and your negative mind.In the book, Dr. Harry gives you the tools you need to harness your unconscious mind, control your IBS symptoms, and to help insure your success. Each step is explained simply and clearly, so the material is easy to understand and implement. I really appreciate that self hypnosis audios are available for download to reinforce the information in the book. By the way, there is no additional charge for the additional audio files, so I was happy that there was nothing extra to buy.I have a definite preference for alternative therapies and do not hesitate to recommend this book. This information has applications well beyond IBS.

$REVIEW.: I'm not really sure what to say about this book. It was quite an accessible read written by someone who has obvious stakes in both game and book sales. I can respect the effort it took to write this book, but a little in-text citation might be nice.Overall, this book strikes me as an opinion piece. Having Gee write the preface and including quotes from him throughout the text is a nice idea, but simply doing that does not lend truth to the book. While I respect Gee as a theoretical linguist, being well-established in one field does not automatically lend authority and truth to everything that person says. Both Prensky and Gee do a fantastic job of writing convincing words. The words are almost pretty. The inclusion of solid research to back up their claims, however, is quite ugly.My point here is: Reader beware. Convincing arguments don't make truth. This text appears to lack any type of research and, as such, should be taken at face value (which apparently is worth just shy of $14.00). For a very good critique of both Prensky and Gee, read "Beyond Technology" by Buckingham. In fact, you only have to read Chapter 6 in Buckingham's text to understand just how rhetorical and almost far-fetched some of the claims made by both Prensky and Gee are."Don't Bother Me Mom -- I'm learning!" is, simply put, an easy, entertaining read. Do not expect to come out with any new knowledge or secret pedagogy for connecting with and teaching children and young adults. It's not in the text.  So, for the words and pretty writing, I give the book an overall "4". For the gross lack of research, and for making claims about the blanket effectiveness of games in relation to learning despite a lack of empirical support, I give the book at "-2". Overall, this book gets a "2".

$REVIEW.: THE JOY OF STRATEGY provides readers with the necessary tools to think strategically about how best to create an enjoyable life. Allison Rimm's practical words of advice provide clarity, insight, and inspiration at just the right moments. This book is the perfect gift for the person who has everything--yet feels a sense something is still missing, or that there's just not enough time for what really matters.As someone who's led corporate workshops on planning and decision-making, I recognize THE JOY OF STRATEGY as an essential toolbox anyone can use to recreate their life from the top down, starting with what truly matters most. One of the most common mistakes most people make is to get caught up in reactionary mode, fighting each little fire as it comes up, without feeling an overall sense of living true to one's highest ideals or providing service to the world in ways that only you can ever do. Allison Rimm's book brilliantly provides the most important factors to keep in mind, one at a time, enabling readers to benefit from learning to think as strategically as the most productive companies, all the while keeping an emphasis on rediscovering true joy and happiness in life.Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC of Tragic from the author.At the start of the book, I was honestly a little worried I wouldn't like it. I'd loved the blurb, but the first few pages had me a bit hesitant. It felt like it was trying too hard to be popular and cool. We all know the setup - A girl with a broken past falls in love with a hot guy.This story is everywhere right now in NA, and I think the reason why is because so many people can relate to it. I don't think my issue was as much with the trope, as it was the early delivery. It seemed only on the surface.So why 4 stars? Because by a chapter or two in, I was completely hooked and had lost all reservations. The book pulled me in and I devoured the rest of it like a last meal that I probably should have savored. It was fun, and an easy read. It remained a light, surface read and the characters never really became "real" to me, but it was so enjoyable I didn't care.Put simply, this book is sexy as hell. The plot is sexy, the hero is sexy, and the situations are sexy. (And mildly disturbing.)Rook is both resilient and resourceful. Her voice is very clear throughout the book, and she isn't whiny or irritating. She is strong, and it is because of her strength that she's homeless. She was in an abusive relationship, and instead of succumbing, she fought back and she ran. She's no one's victim.Ronin is hotter than Mcdonalds coffee, and as smooth as they come. He is very genuine, and protective, and not your typical bad-boy alpha male. He's trying very hard to be good, and doesn't hold back his heart.I would have liked a bit more resolution at the end, but it is a series, so I can be patient. I didn't give it five stars because of the shaky beginning, but it is definitely worth 4.5. Surprisingly, I found myself not even minding the bit of a cliffhanger/open ending, because it wasn't the hope that Rook and Ronin would find a way to be together that pulled me through the story. I read because they are fun to be around.

On a recent trip to London, this book guided me towards two venues I hadn't otherwise read about (Corinthia Hotel and Dean Street Townhouse), both of which had really lovely teas, and also reminded me that the National Portrait Gallery restaurant, which I'd been thinking about having lunch at anyway, also featured afternoon tea. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who's serious about trying tea in London.

$REVIEW.: There's nothing scarier than a monster that has no limits on where it can go, no discrimination with what it eats, and no easy way to kill it.  Hands down, Dinosaur Lake is probably one of my favorite monster horror books that I've read thus far.  The situation started out grim with hints of what the monster could do and when the monster finally made its appearance, it didn't disappoint.  Probably my favorite monster with its combination of intellect and methods of killing people.The situations and character reactions are somewhat predictable.  If you imagine a cross between Jaws and Jurassic Park, then you pretty much have the entire book.  However, Dinosaur Lake is written so well and the suspense is consistently building, that knowing what will probably happen only intensifies the dread and anxiety you feel for the characters in this book.  Henry is an average park ranger who feels like a genuinely real person.  He feels like one of my neighbors rather than some Hollywood hotshot.  I like how solid of a relationship he has with his wife, even if their motives aren't always the same.  They put their marriage and love above everything else and that kind of relationship is sorely lacking in most of the novels I read.The setting and circumstances behind the monster appearing seem dangerously plausible.  I don't think that I want to live anywhere near Crater Lake after reading this book.  Overall, a great read.  I recommend this book to anyone that loves books dealing with natural disasters, monsters that just don't care about anything but their next meal, or a book that forces you to keep turning the pages. (A-)(I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for my honest review.)

$review_text.: This book is fascinating as well as entertaining.  The author presents a great deal of research and personal accounts of those who have encountered the Kushtaka- and lived to tell.  Each story is different, but each account shares the same theme- that their lives will never be the same as before the encounter.The author does a fantastic job sharing the culture of the Tlingit Indians, which is an integral part of understanding the Kushtaka.  The author presents research and accounts of the Bigfoot phenomena as a worldwide issue, and not just limited to North America.  We are encouraged to challenge our belief systems and keep an open mind.The stories shared are eerie and suspenseful.  Is the Kushtaka for real?  We may never know, but I certainly now have a healthy respect for the &#8220;what if&#8221; in this powerful creature.  I am looking forward to seeing the documentary when published this fall.  Well-written, researched, and entertaining.

I bought this for my daughter who is an artist in high school and has aspirations of working for Dreamworks someday. She absolutely loves the book. There is also written material about the making of the movie animation. This book will not disappoint.

$review_text.: Claire is a college dropout spending her time meditating to try to forget her past


She meets Adam at a coffee shop & they have an instant connection
Adam is sexy & hard to resist, Claire can't help dropping her guard even though she still holds secrets

Adam bets her that she'll give up her secrets & then Claire will need to return to college


We know that Claire's mother died while Claire was locked up alone in the house with her for two days


But that isn't her tragic secret & when it is revealed I guess I was a little shocked! I guess the bigger shock is the man who is involved in her secret, a man who will continue to be involved in her future
This story would have only received three stars but I have a feeling the second book will be much better
I appreciated that the author could have easily created a love triangle but instead Claire gives Adam her whole heart & makes sure he knows she is with him all the way.

$SUMMARY.: Claire & Adam

$REVIEW.: Ignore this book's title. Surely Derek Gatehouse knows that there is no such entity as a "perfect sales force" but indeed there is much of great value to be learned from what the book's subtitle suggests: "the best practices of the world's best sales teams." However, questions immediately arise:  Which are they? Who selected them? According to which criteria? How recent was the information when the selections were made? (Note: Most of the companies that Peters and Waterman praise in In Search of Excellence no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected and several of them have since been acquired by another company.) Gatehouse shares the results of the Gallup organization's 30-year study of top performance, which includes more than 3,000,000 people thus far. He asserts that people rather than processes process sell, and, that those who are "natural born" sales people will "sell circles around all the rest."How to develop such a sales force? "The only feasible growth system for a sales force, and the only way to build a sales force of top performers, is to learn the language of selling talents. This will let you cast the exact right talents into each stage of your particular sales type, and then gain an understanding of what specific conditions generate autonomous top performance from these gifted sellers." That in the proverbial "nutshell" is what Gatehouse's  book is all about: explaining "the formula for a top-producing sales force, one that is made up primarily of those salespeople that sell four times more than all others." This formula takes into full account three separate but interdependent components: "natural-born" sales aptitude, performance enhancement training, and the environment (i.e. "external  conditions")in which people sell.With regard to how Gatehouse organizes his material, he introduces the six best practices of "the perfect salesforce" in Chapter 2 and then devotes a separate chapter to each. For example, #1 consists of ten "selling talents" that Gatehouse examines with rigor and eloquence and #6 consists of best practices in results-based management. In the final chapter, he explains the need for a Perfect SalesForce committee  that has only one purpose: to ensure that initiatives "stay on track" as the six best practices are adopted during what amounts to a two-phase process: determination of the changes that need to be made and then the on-going, daily operations. "This latter phase is where companies go off track; everyone is too close to the daily grind to step back and see things objectively. It is here that your committee best serves." Gatehouse then offers a detailed case history of an actual company, Dilan Ink, with which he was closely associated. He explains a four-stage process that begins with an assessment of the current situation and concludes with training.For whom will this book be most valuable? Certainly anyone who serves on a "Perfect SalesForce committee" whose membership should include a C-level executive, someone from HR, the sales manager, at least one top sales performer (preferably more), and the company owner(s), if appropriate. Others who should read this book are those who are sales administrators or aspire to become one. My own rather extensive experience in sales and sales management suggests that most "natural born" sales people, those who "sell circles around all the rest," would rather be selling than reading about others who do...one man's opinion. However, I think CEOs should be among those who read this book because Gatehouse offers some valuable perspectives on how those in the salesforce, out on the proverbial "front line," in active and frequent contact with current and prospective customers, can provide invaluable competitive intelligence, especially about market trends.Gatehouse encourages those who purchase his book to check out a wealth of resources at [...] that include articles, training videos, tools, his daily blog, and a members' forum.

There have been so many different self-help books that don't seem to really drive that point home. When I had heard about this book, Body & Soul: Reclaiming The Heidelberg Catechism,  was very skeptical to hear about his book. I definitely took a glimpse into it, and I was mostly impressed with the book. It really brought out a deep passage of life, especially when we seem to not haven't found our way. This book is definitely one of those reads that you really have to sink your teeth into. I definitely liked it a lot, and if you need to find yourself tooth and nail, this book will be for you.Price: BContext: B-Overall: B 1/2-

$review_text.: Lainie Lovett teach fourth grade in the very rich and very historic Massachusetts town of Rockford and plays soccer in a women&#8217;s soccer league.  When she finds out her teammate&#8217;s husband, a home construction tycoon,  had been killed at one of his job sites she just couldn&#8217;t believe it. She drives by the site on the way home and sees the crime scene tape all around the home. She also is questioned by the police about her reasons for being there.  Who knew checking out where someone was killed would land you at the top of the suspect list?So, who pulled the trigger of the nail gun that killed construction tycoon Arthur Cavanagh? His widow, who&#8217;d sworn to kill him if he ever cheated on her? His hostile teenage son, who felt neglected by his father? His foreman, who&#8217;d regularly fought with his boss? The angry environmentalists, protesting his latest development? Or the blond mystery woman who&#8217;d been seen with him the night of his death? Lainie has to find out to get her life back. Her students and her team need her!!Dollycas&#8217;s ThoughtsWhat a wonderful start to a new cozy series.Lainie is a terrific main character. She is easy to like and care about. We know she is a dedicated teacher that really cares about her students and will go the extra mile to help them strive. I am a bit jealous of her athletic ability but her regimen really impressed me. She also has a way of getting to the bottom of things and following clues even if it means putting herself in danger. She also has a vulnerable side as she takes steps reentering the dating game after her husband passing away a couple of years ago.There are also several supporting characters like Lainie&#8217;s daughter, Karen, who has moved home after college and is having some dating issues herself.  Peter, one her husband&#8217;s law partners, who comes to Lainie&#8217;s rescue when the cops start to really believe she was in on the murder. Bill Stavic, who dropped into Lainie&#8217;s life just in time to bring her a lot of grief and a bit of pleasure. Plus there are Lainie&#8217;s soccer teammates who know the gossip and the truth and most of them are her friends.  There is so much room for all of them to grown in future installments.Arnold also crafted a great whodunit that kept me guessing to the very end.  I really enjoyed this story and am looking forward to see what kind of trouble Lainie gets herself into next.I do caution there is strong, adult language in this book so it may not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea.
$SUMMARY.: New Series!

 I really liked that the author/illustrator took the time to not only illustrate the words he wrote on each page &#8211; but did additional pictures on the facing pages


 These additional pictures build on each other, and give children the opportunity to find what new things have been added to the pictures

$review_text.: The concept of an older woman and younger man was okay but Anna kept repeating the same dialog of her dilemma being forty and Kyran being only thirty all through the storyline was a bit much.  To me once would have sufficed.  Okay I got it.  Thanks. Overcome and move on in the relationship.  The best lines in the story come in at 93 percent of Kindle version where Kyran compares his catheter to Anna's tossing her cookies or should I say &#34;oatmeal&#34; when he is asking her to marry him.  His friend Alexander's response cracked me up.  The rest of the story was a little bit of a mystery/suspense and a whole lot of sex.

$REVIEW.: The world that Frank Miller creates here is truly original.This is a "stand-alone" story about Marv, about his violent trials and tribulations.  "The Hard Goodbye" is a very good book, but if ultra-violence isn't your bag, you could skip this one and move on to the other books.  If you can stomach the gore, by all means pick this one up.  The artwork is stunning.  The ending is genius, not your typical Hollywood ending.I enjoyed "A Dame to Kill For" and "That Yellow Bastard" much more than this book.  "Dame" and "Bastard" are more involved stories, with more character development.  You care about what happens to the characters.  These books are told in a classic "noir" style, with Frank Miller's modern twist .  There's nothing else like this series in the world of graphic novels.There are a bunch of Sin City books out there that are collections of short stories.  I prefer the longer stories, so they feel more like a book than a comic.  If you feel the same way, order the titles I mentioned above, and also get "The Big Fat Kill."In the movie, Marv is played by Mickey Rourke.  His story is covered in the first third of the film.  Rourke does a great job, but the makeup job makes him look like a villain from Dick Tracy.  Still a great movie.Happy reading!

$REVIEW.: A great addition to the MC genre.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I feel that this is such a hard genre to be recognised in and there are so many MC books coming out recently and with it being so competitive with so many great books out there like the undeniable series, it can be hard for new books to gain the recognition they deserve.I don't think that will be a problem with this book however. It really kept my attention the all way through and I loved that the female lead was so independent, strong, sexy and sassy.Harlow was the ultimate female lead, and a rare one I feel in the biker world. A lot of books focusing on the MC world have females who although are strong in a way, do sometimes seem weak when it comes to them being a part of the club they are involved with. That wasn't at all the case with Harlow, although knowing she could never be a member she has such a strong presence among the club and it's members and it was refreshing to read.Cruz is an ultimate bad boy biker, rude, sexy, dirty, confident and dominant. Everything I need to make him one of my BBF. Loved his little boy Cooper as well, he was the cutest kid.The story line was fast paced and heart pounding. There was always something happening, whether that be fights, drive by shootings, sex or just good old relationship drama, I was never bored and I kept on turning the page wondering what was going to happen next.The epilogue was explosive and wasn't what I was expecting, but it definitely ensures that you will be wanting to read the next one.The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that for me it isn't quite up there with the best like the Undeniable series. I'm not 100% sure why I feel this way but I do think the sex scenes were better in books like the Undeniable series and even though this book had a lot going on, it all focused around one problem, whereas other books have more plot development.But overall this book really is a great contender for MC books, one that kept me hooked and wanting more.Reviewed by Bethany

$review_text.: This is a great graphic novel. I am a fan of the genre, and also of young adult fiction. This is a perfect choice for someone who like fiction such as Spiderwick, or Harry Potter (which is nearly everyone, right?), as well as fans of graphic novels such as Amulet and Mouseguard.  This story is compelling and well written, and the illustrations are delightful. Definitely worth reading over and over to appreciate fully. I will refrain from describing the plot, as others have done so quite obsessively.  Pick it up for yourself, or a youngster in your life. Get it at the library (if your library is so enlightened), or buy here or from your local small book/comic store. Pass it on. It is a gorgeous hardcover with small gold-tone lock on the side. Mine will be taking a place of honor on my bookshelf. I'll let me son read it, but my friends will have to buy their  own.

$REVIEW.: This is by far my most favorite book on prayer, and I have referred to it over and over again since I first read it in 1988. Forsyth provides endless revelations about the dynamics of prayer, not so much for the answers prayer brings, but for the profoundly satisfying experience of a prayerful life. Forsyth states that prayer is the atmosphere of revelation and then goes on to demonstrate that fact in every sentence of the book, each one the potential object of prolonged meditation. He also reveals the prophetic nature of prayer in that we are merely returning to God what he placed in our hearts to begin with, and Forsyth unpacks the mysteries of this process in a variety of ways. If this book does not whet your appetite to pray, no other book will. I can't recommend this book enough for those who want to grow deep with the Creator of the universe.

If you haven't followed the series which includes 3 books prior then it would seem a bit rushed and confusing. This novella is a good read but not strong enough to stand on it's own. I think that's why so many reviewers are disappointed with the read.Jena's best friends in past books have all met and married their true mate. At one of their weddings she happens to meet Ian. Though they briefly spoke and shared a dance, she is unable to stop thinking about Ian who is a vampire. Ian has been watching Jena for months. He is known as the enforcer, although Jena is aware that her friends married vampires Ian is sent to keep an eye on Jena watching to see if she would tell of their existence.On Valentines day everything has come full circle for both Ian and Jena as they both discover they are each others true mate. They also discovery something important about Jena's blood.

I thought finding them for the Kindle to share with my nieces and nephews was fantastic!The first three books in the set were fine; however, Mystery Ranch has several issues: When the girls first arrive in town where Maggie is picking them up, a few lines are missing as it goes straight from &#34;Yes, I'm Maggie. I'm very glad to see you.&#34; to &#34;I don't know,&#34; said Maggie. &#34;Who was he?&#34; Two paragraphs (30 words) are missing. Then in chapter 7 (The Boys Come), it skips from Jessie asking Aunt Jane if the boys can come to, within the same sentence in the Kindle version, the boys and Watch have arrived. Three paragraphs (81 words) are missing.Disappointed in the accuracy of the Kindle version, and hope it will be updated and corrected. Will update review further if more issues are found.

$REVIEW.: A very down-to-earth and very practical handbook for any strategical formulation endeavours. Better than those metaphorical ones, like "blue ocean strategy". Would get five stars if it did not mistakenly treat "People's Republic of China" as "Republic of China" in the case on p. 129. There is only one province of ROC, i.e. Taiwan.

$REVIEW.: I was gifted a copy from the author for an honest review.I think I have found a new series to stalk. This is Tony and Jillian's story. While Max and Anna are enjoying their new family, Tony has decided that he needs more training and opts to go back to his Uncle Nicu. He's hoping to find answers about himself as well. There's a darkness that is looming over the world and Tony is the only one that can figure out how to win the battle that is brewing. Jillian has this pull to her that Tony can't seem to ignore. What is it this witch has that makes Tony want to protect her so much? Someone wants what Tony has and will go thru all measures to take it from him even if it means taking his life. But with the help of his Uncle and Max, along with those that work for Nicu, it won't be an easy feat to win. Lives will be lost and new friendships will be formed in this ongoing series of Soul Mates. One thing I must say is that it takes a talented author to be able to have one character doing an Irish accent while the other does American English. Well done. Thank you Ms. Lance for another wonderful story and I look forward to the next one.

$REVIEW.: I liked the price (99 cents at the time) and thought I'd give this novella a try. I love wolf-shifter romances, and what I really enjoyed about this one is that the hero is an Alpha but is also sweet and kind. I do like them macho, where they have a lot of growl and bite to them, but this guy is capable without being arrogant, tough without being cocky. He's easy-going, which can be odd for an alpha, but when he's protecting what's his, people soon back down. Jackson Wilder is just the right combination of sexy, sweet and manly.Also, I liked this heroine, Alice. The story is told in first-person from her POV, and she comes across as a little snarky, a bit unsure, and tired from some blows life has recently dealt her. She has doubts that Jackson can take on the problems facing her young, small pack of wolves. She's the Alpha female, and Jackson is just the soft but firm touch she needs in her life now. The secondary characters are great, too, really adding to the story, such as Dan and Holly, and adorable baby Eddie cracked me up! There were a few cute/funny moments in the story, as well as some tension/danger concerning the pack, and a bit of sweet smexing for good measure. It's a shorter PNR read, but nicely rounded out and very enjoyable to read. Part of a series but can be read on its own, which I did.(1760 kindle locations)

$review_text.: Vampire Miami by Phil Tucker is a little different, no matter what the title would lead readers to believe. Yes, it's a novel with vampires, and those are fairly common, but it doesn't take the standard `vampires live among us, but in secret' trope and stake it to something. Instead, in this world, vampires and humans have clashed, and the government decided that the best way to come out ahead was to give them a city of their own. The unlucky winner was, as the title suggests, Miami.Readers should be aware that this isn't a self-contained story, and that there will be further installments in the series, so there may be some outcry when they get to the end, but only the good kind.Tucker's premise gives the audience a Miami, and indeed a world that is fundamentally changed, and even broken by what's happened. Anybody who wants to side with the vampires can live `the good life,' but if you want to stay human, survival is no easy feat.The book's protagonist is Selah, who sets off to find her father after he goes missing, and really has no idea what she's getting into. As far as plans go, she doesn't have one, and so readers can enjoy her impulsive nature, the way that she has her world turned completely upside down, and the fact that sometimes doing something without thinking it through is exactly what's needed to shake things up.These aren't vampires that woo girls by rescuing them, or give interviews. They're vicious, tangled in power struggles, and no less petty than the humans they feed on. If the vampires of popular culture have been tamed, then Tucker's undead are a reminder that it takes intelligence, and sometimes sheer dumb luck to come out ahead of the bloodsuckers.Selah finds friends, some more loyal than others, and a few have agendas that will surprise her. Not only that, but she finds herself involved in the underground resistance movement. But despite how tough things are, the conclusion readers can draw is that vampires may have Miami, but humans haven't stopped fighting the war, and the next book in the series promises more bloodthirsty adventures, and a whole new city to do battle in.(Reviewed for A Book Obsession..)

$REVIEW.: I received this book free to review and after selecting it, wondered what the heck I was thinking. I mean what else do you make on a panini press but sandwiches, and how many variations could you possibly do; especially since I'm a fussy eater that doesn't like many veggies? Color me surprised.The recipes and suggestions in this book refer to any grilling machine that grills both the top and bottom at the same time, such as a George Foreman Grill or Cuisinart 5-in-1. The first 13 pages are devoted to information. If you are new to using this type of machine, you get the different features to look for when deciding what to buy, basic instructions for cleaning and what tools you should use, as well as food usage suggestions broken down by food group.I'm not very creative in the kitchen when throwing things together on my own, other than the basics, but I can effectively follow a recipe. My idea of a sandwich was pretty limited to a sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, maybe pickle and either a condiment or sauce on bread. I hadn't realized how limited I was.Out of the 205 recipes in this book, I found plenty that interested me and it's not limited to just sandwiches. It's anything that can be cooked on a grill. The first one I tried was Sweet and Smoky Grilled Pork Tenderloin Medallions which is not a sandwich. It was a hit.  I have tried a number sandwich recipes since then.  You'll also find recipes for breakfast items as well as desserts.Expect to find a lot of recipes using plenty from your spice rack as well as recipes for sauces. Some items I've never heard of. A variety of types of bread, veggies, meat, fish, fruit and cheeses are all used in this book. In some cases you're cooking on the stove with just a small portion of the recipe made on the grill. And yes, you will find a few recipes that most have thought of on their own. But I think you'd be surprised at the variety offered in this book.Read for review from an ARC.

Though God says that no one will be able to tell when the end comes, he will give us signs to know when the end is near.  This book does a terrific job of breaking down Revelations and explaining the signs and warnings that will bring us to the end times.  This book has me wanting to know more, more than just what happens in the end, but more about both the love and the wrath of God.

$review_text.: This book offers excellent advice and how-to's for someone considering online dating. While online dating may seem scary and foreign to some, it really isn't much different than what they did in the olden days with mail order brides and letters to men in the service during WWI and WWII only the medium primarily used was the postal system.My husband and I met online many moons ago. We "dated" long distance for nearly a year before marrying. This avenue may not be best for some as there are many pitfalls to long distance dating. For instance, it can be very expensive in terms of transportation and long distance phone calls. Fortunately, in this modern day one can call across the US virtually free and this makes staying in touch much easier. I have heard many horror stories about online dating and just as many positive stories. For me it is the best thing that has ever happened in my life, though, it was completely unexpected as I was not seeking a relationship. Just be smart about it. Listen to your head and not your heart and definitely use the sage advice in this book. Much kudos to King and Black for writing a very responsible and much needed book on internet dating.

$REVIEW.: I was giving a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.Just when I thought this series couldn&#8217;t get much hotter, BAM!!!! We get A Wolf&#8217;s Savage Embrace. It is most defiantly a book for a reader 18 yrs and older. A Wolf&#8217;s Savage Embrace is the second book in a paranormal series, called Supernatural Desire. Each book in the series follows a different couple, I love that about this series, it&#8217;s not often you get a look into all the characters life&#8217;s. A Wolf&#8217;s Savage Embrace is about Katrina a stubborn witch and Luke a very very hot werewolf. I love these two characters they are funny and so full of passion, I really enjoyed watching their story unfold. Darlene Kuncytes does such a great job making Kat and Luke&#8217;s story come to life and I love how book 1 and book 2 tie together. A Wolf&#8217;s Savage Embrace is a story full of surprises, laughs and tears, it&#8217;s quite the roller costar ride of emotions. I really have falling in love with this series and can&#8217;t wait for book 3. I know there are more surprises just waiting to be discovered. I would recommend you read book one, A Vampire&#8217;s Saving Embrace, first because it makes the big reveal in A Wolf&#8217;s Savage Embrace that much better. If your looking for a hot steamy read, I would pick up your copies of book 1 and 2 today and fall in love. Happy Reading.

$REVIEW.: Mistworld is a rebel planet protected from the Empire by a psionic shield. There isn't much to protect since Mistworld is essentially a medieval village in which security guards carry pikes. Of course they do, they used to be gladiators. They fight with swords and shields because energy guns and force fields take time to recharge. Riiiight.Meanwhile, the Empire has just wiped out the planet Tannin and a refugee ship has made its way to Mistworld but the espers who scanned the ship detected a mysterious presence. Fortunately, Investigator Topaz, the strongest esper in the universe and a legendary Siren who once wiped out 500 minds at once, is there to protect Mistworld. To show what a badass she is, Topaz says things like "blood and terror to our enemies" (forgetting to preface this with "forsooth"). Sergeant Michael Gunn was married to Topaz, but Gunn is dead now, giving Topaz a chance to feel sad while lusting for revenge, having sworn "an oath of vengeance." Riiiight.Meanwhile, a burglar in Mistport named Cat steals a memory crystal for a fence named Cyder who wants to sell it to Jamie Royal who is retrieving it for Dr. Leon Vertue who owns Mistworld's body bank. Does everyone in this novel have a ridiculous name? Pretty much. There's a mercenary named Blackjack, Port Director Gideon Steel, Captain Starlight, Councillor Eileen Darkstrom, Count Stefan Bloodhawk, Suzanne du Wolfe, a dude named Gaunt, a giant named Stargrave, and the list goes on. Most of the creative effort in this novel went into creating silly names for the characters.The memory crystal plays an important role toward the end of the novel, but (and I need to be vague here to avoid spoilers) I was left wondering how its intended recipient managed to get along without it, given the apparently critical need for the crystal to be in place at all times. That's one of a few head-scratchers that are glossed over in an effort to deliver a plot that is heavy on action but light on thought.Simon Green strives for literary eloquence, but his prose is too often forced and stilted. He should see an editor for his adverb addiction. At other times he depends on clich&eacute;d phrases ("paragon of virtue") to make his point. Dialog -- "Damn you, Blackjack, you've ruined everything" -- is lifted from every bad "direct to DVD" movie you've ever seen.The plot is generally coherent and at times entertaining despite bordering on the ridiculous. Too often, however, the story is based on familiar fantasy themes with some Star Wars buzzwords added to disguise it as science fiction. Fight scenes are mundane and characters lack development beyond the standard personalities with which stock characters come equipped.I know this novel (first published in 1992) and the series that followed it has a following. I can understand why fans of fantasy who don't mind excessive adverbs or the substitution of espers for magicians would enjoy it. I can understand why those who view it as a parody might think Green achieved something with Mistworld, but I like parodies that make me laugh and, other than laughing at the characters' names, I found little here to amuse. Mistworld isn't an awful book but there is not enough here that is fresh or interesting to earn a recommendation for sf fans.

$REVIEW.: Ryne Lanark and Shannon KeyesLt. Ryne Lanark had reached the bottom of the barrel as far as assignments go. But that doesn't mean he isn't still giving his best to try to find not only a serial killer but the killers of his family. The problem is, he just can't keep it together. Now the powers-that-be, in their infinite wisdom have given him a new partner. One they hope he won't get killed, maimed or run in fear for their life.Shannon Keyes is on the fast track. Well liked and given promotions a little faster than the average, there is something about her that Ryne is not quite sure of. Unable to manipulate his way out of being partnered with her, he decides to make the best of a bad situation and try to keep her alive. Since he seems to have a reputation for being hard on partners this may be a major effort in itself.This is a very good detective novel/police procedural that has a tightly woven plot, lots of action and well developed characters. The dialog reads as realistic, the protagonists have enough back story to round them out and the plotline keeps the reader guessing.A good one I would easily recommend.Karen Bryant Doering,Parents' Little Black BookMistBlueEeyore@gmail.com

But than she meets William who seems to be perfect at everything. Even though he seems to be ideal submissive, there is something strange about him. And when lines between Domme and sub start to blur, things get very interesting...Topic in this book was refreshing, original and different from my usual reads. I loved that. Role-plays and talking, everything was sensual and extremely sexy. I really enjoyed reading this book. Plot was well-balanced with steamy parts and together it created very entertaining read. Congratulations to Mina Vaughn to this amazing debut novel!Cerise is one independant and sexy woman. She knows what she wants and she wouldn't be satisfied with anything less. She is smart, likes challenges but there is this baggage from her past that unables her to be truly happy.William was fascinating character. Tantalizing, artistic, charismatic and smooth talker. He would have done anything to please Cerise and to get into her good graces. Ideal man, right? Or is he not?This was my first Domme book and I was really impressed with this debut novel. It was smartly written, never boring and I devoured it in one sitting. The only thing that bothered me was how easily Cerise accepted all those William's secrets. But it never ruined my reading experience. Definitely keep an eye on this book!

$REVIEW.: Oh holy rodeo hot pants! Freed was everything I was expecting plus a whole hell of a lot more. Lynetta Halat did not disappoint with this sequel. That woman has a way with words and emotions that make you feel it deep in your core and will have you clenching your ereader wondering what will happen next. If you have not read the first in the series, Used....STOP here! I do not want to spoil it for you.Freed picked up right where Used stopped. Oh my word I felt every emotion throughout this beautiful masterpiece. Every tingle &#34;down there,&#34; every emotion, every laugh, and every heartache. We learn so much more about our badass bull riding, boxing superstar John Ethan Ransom. The characters were so developed and so in tune with each other. The story flowed like a fast paced river with twists and turns that you won't see coming. It was breathtakingly beautiful. The entire story and plot was wrapped up like a magnificent Christmas present. It was seriously that good! Not only is Ransom unbelievably HOT in this book but he is downright swoonworthy. His need for dominance and the way it played out was absolutely perfect for Denver. She needed it because of her past issues and he needed her. Their sexual chemistry was off the charts. The scenes with them together were on fire. It gave me the sensation of hot molten lava rushing through my system. A dominant and a natural submissive, need I say anymore? It was pure.....genius! They grow so much throughout the book not only as individuals but also as a couple. Honorable Mention: Austin...I love his adorable smart-mouth self! I definitely want him to have his own book! Pretty please?I have to say I did not want this book to end. I am having a major book hangover. This is one series that will grip you and pull you under all the while leaving you gasping for more. If you're looking for a smokin' hot alpha male who is a dominate bull riding/boxing machine than this is the book for YOU! This is one rodeo you definitely want to jump on! I can tell you with 100% certainty I want to ride on Ransom's bull ;) Happy Reading! xoxoFreed Receives 5+ STARS! &#60;--------One of my top 10 reads of this year!

$REVIEW.: Nine volumes into "the Boys" and what seemed like a series destined to become one of the truly greats of comics is limping toward the finish line with a barely coherent plot and nothing new to offer about the characters. Long and meandering, "The Big Ride" would probably be more accurate if it had been titled, "The Big Crawl." With pages and pages of repetitive exposition, hardly anything happens in this volume that substantiallly advances the overarching plot. In two separate episodes, the titular "Boys" and the "Seven" have a literal standoff, in which nothing actually happens. The characters talk, of course, but by the end of both meetings, nothing has changed. The meetings are therefore a kind of metaphor for where the series is as a whole - in a holding pattern, with plenty of posturing on all sides but nothing significant taking place.It's an unfortunate creative rut for what started out as a promising book. The creative team seems to have decided when they started that there was an arbitrary point at which the series should end, but they didn't have enough story to take up all the issues between launch and conclusion. And lets face it, it hardly ever happens that the writer who draws a story out unnecessarily ever finishes strong. We're probably looking to an ending more like a whimper than a bang. Which is unfortunate. The artists on the book are consistently wonderful and are pitch perfect for the series. But they're given so little to do it must be a real labor of love for them to get through the pages. Too bad it's just mostly labor for us...

$REVIEW.: I could not put down this book even if I had tried


That good


Silent No More is a masterpiece of a start for a series, and with the ginormous cliffhanger at the end, I can't wait for the next book to come out.Silent No More deals very realistically with the rape issue, in my opinion
Shannon just deals with it by forgetting about it and trying to pretend it never happened, with barely any big effects in her adult life in terms of behavior
Nicholas had a rough childhood with his dad


Their relationship develops very quickly , but the pace the author set for the book makes it work wonderfully


There are a lot of intensely sexy scenes
Yeah..


Nick is ..

Wow.The plot twists are very well written and just when you think you have an idea of what's happening..


Nope, something completely different comes up.And then just when you think you'll get answers and everything will fall into place...


the book ends.

$review_text.: There are few more arrogant statements out there than the one I've seen on a few bumper stickers:  "In case of Rapture, this car will be empty."  Even assuming you are an ardent Christian who believes in an upcoming End Time, it is the height of pride to assume that you know exactly what God is thinking when he passes judgment.  And, as Robert Price argues in The Paperback Apocalypse, chances are if you believe that the Bible (in particular, Revelation) promises a soon-to-come end of the world, you're going to be disappointed.The motivation for Price's book are the popular Left Behind books by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, which Price demonstrates have more than a few problems from a Biblical interpretation standpoint.  First, however, he provides a history of the Apocalypse and shows how Biblical chapters and verses have been misread (often intentionally) to promote the idea that the End is Coming.  Hence, history is filled with people promising a Judgment Day at a certain time, only to have that day pass without even minimal fireworks.Price deals with related concepts (such as the Second Coming) and shows the flaws in literal readings about them.  He then discusses various apocalyptic novels:  first, early ones which are generally more interested in preaching than storytelling, then later ones written by more adept authors.  He also discusses mainstream novels such as Stephen King's The Stand that use apocalyptic ideas.Finally, he gets to the where The Paperback Apocalypse is really leading:  a dissection of the Left Behind books.  Actually, it's more of a tearing apart.  La Haye (the idea man for the books) is particularly criticized, and justifiably so.  La Haye's version of Christianity is particularly hateful and not all that well reasoned; Price shows just how flawed (and vicious) La Haye's thought process really is.  Jenkins (the writer) gets off relatively lightly, although he comes off as something of a sell-out for compromising his art to explain La Haye's vision.  Price is not at his best when he speaks of Jenkins; on the one hand, he tries to portray Jenkins as a decent writer, but on the other, Price is constantly harping on bad plot devices and unbelievable characters.Price describes himself as a former born-again Christian who seemingly grew out of that phase of his life yet still appears to be "reasonably" Christian.  He admits an affection for these apocalyptic novels, but it comes off as the affection many people have for particularly bad movies.  And though I have not read (nor have any desire to read) the Left Behind books, my brief looks at the books and the reviews I've picked up from others lead me to believe that they are the Plan 9 From Outer Space of apocalyptic novels.Much as I agree with a lot of what Price says, he is really preaching to the choir.  Few who enjoy the Left Behind (and similar) books and believe the themes they preach will pick up this book or accept the ideas inside.  Indeed, La Haye and Jenkins seem to believe that critical thought is evil (so if they are appealing to "true" Christians, they are basically saying ignorance and blind faith are good...what a contemptible way to think of your audience!).Price's writing is often interesting (and humorous) but also often ponderous (and not always logically consistent, such as his opinion of Jenkins), so under normal circumstances, I would only rate this three stars.  On the other hand, I think his message is important enough that it is worth a bonus star.  This is far from a perfect book, but it is an illuminating one.

$REVIEW.: Jennifer is twenty years old and is living with four other people while going to college


 She has always had bad luck when it comes to losing her v-card and Jenn has decided that she will change all that before she turns 21
 As she sets out to find the &#8220;one&#8221; she helps out one of her roomies by posing as his girlfriend, while at the family party they attend she meets Dain whom she is instantly attracted too and she finally thinks she finds a man she may actually love

 Over the course of time her roommates are always there for her and while things happen, true love ends up showing up when she least expects it (and from the last person she would expect :) ).I absolutely loved this book!  Right from the beginning I loved each one of the roommates and their unique characteristics/attitudes that all fit so well together


 The interaction between the five of them was just perfect and I couldn&#8217;t help myself by falling in love with each and every one of them


 I enjoyed the ride with Jennifer as she looks to lose her v-card as well as being there with her ups and downs throughout the rollercoaster ride of the 60 days prior to her birthday.If you are looking for a good book that will make you laugh at times, hold your interest so much you cant put the book down, then this is the one for you!!

$REVIEW.: Wow


This is an incredible book! Like many readers of popular modern science, I constantly underestimate the inventiveness and technology of ancient man


This book really highlights that
Also, it's an amazing inventory of creativity and inventiveness that the current China seems to be regaining


Imagine very modern inventions like glow-in-the-dark paint and natural gas mining being invented before the First Century AD!I read this as a way to get familiar with the technology of one of the most inventive people and times in history so that I could use it in conworld creation
I was NOT disappointed! The idea that they had movable type and spill-proof lanterns were revelations to me
Not to mention the quality of their ceramics and lacquer.However, you've really got to want this information to read this book

I found the author's style to be quite dry and academic
In some cases, it even seemed rather biased in favor of the Chinese, but, as my wife pointed out, that's to be expected considering the subject matter.All in all, though, the author's writing skills are not enough to keep me from heartily recommending this book to anyone interested in the technology of the ancient world.

$REVIEW.: This book was recommended by Angie of the the Smut Book Club.  On her Heat Rating scale she describes this book as "Nuclear".  Damn she wasn't kidding!!Looking for something steamy I decided to give Try a try.  Not having read many M/m books, this was a very eye-opening experience for me.  Like Tate I felt like I was learning things right along with him.  The sex scenes burn pages and pages and pages (sweet Jesus, thank you)!!!While their relationship does move at a quick pace I think it follows a very realistic time line.  Together only a few weeks but they aren't professing their undying love for each other and picking out wedding patterns.  While there are disagreements and small bouts of jealousy from both of them, they come across as mature.  This seems to be missing in other books today.This is a book about discovery.  One man discovering what a relationship is like instead of screwing anything with two legs and the other discovering that a relationship doesn't necessarily have to come with a vagina!!This is one book that I'm so glad there is a sequel to.  However, waiting until summer is going to make this a long, cold winter!!

$review_text.: In the interest of full disclosure, I received a copy of this book from Net Galley for the purpose of providing an review.I would rate this short book 4.5 out of 5 stars. It was a perfectly sweet romance with realistic characters. Although the book was short, approximately 150 pages or so, each of the characters were well defined and the story had sufficient depth.Holly MacDonald is coming to the town she grew up in to attend her best friend's wedding. She stops at Ivey farms on her way into town and reconnects with her childhood friend Luke Ivey. Luke and Holly have instant chemistry which they did not share during their preteen years.Holly is the maid of honor in her best friend's wedding. One problem, Holly saw the groom in a compromising position just days earlier. The groom, Alan, is Luke's best friend and this causes some friction between several of the characters. Alan's character was written perfectly and I found myself wishing I could reach into the book and slap him myself at times.This book is very tame in comparison to most romance books today and I must say that was a pleasant surprise. Instead of relying on graphic sex scenes, this book focused on the magic that happens when two people are falling for each other.I enjoyed this short book and will look for other works by this author in the future.

I know there is way too much description; trees, grass, bushes, buildings, etc., but I thought the characters were well defined, the plot was good and the ending tied everything together
 I'm not sure if I will ever read it again, but I am happy that I read it once.I didn't quite understand why so many reviewers were so emotional about the book
They were outraged about the characters, the love of Kirith Kirin and Jessex for each other

If they felt this strongly, why read more of the book?

Roxy is struggling with her past, her present and her future that all collide in Greece.Easy to read for teenagers of any age.whilst coming to terms with a missed period she embarks on a trip to the Greek isle of Corfu to uncover the story of family

What she discovers is how what happened a long time ago can keep cycling through a family as she finds herself in similar circumstances.On the downside some of the accents are a little contrived for the Scottish, Greek and Indian

$review_text.: This being not the longest story in the world, I wasn't expecting all that much in the way of character development, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fleshed out (no pun intended) the three main characters were.Kaycee being a model who is bored with the business sounds like a cringe-worthy foundation for a character, but happily, she's not at all vapid


 Aside from a couple of less-than-bright decisions and complaining about how bored she is, she's smart, self-aware, and brave
 The terror she experiences at the hands of the serial killer is palpable, but she doesn't allow that to defeat her: she's courageous and fights back.Tyler and Sam are interesting in that both are traditional alpha males, with Tyler being the one full of charm, while Sam is bursting at the seams with intensity

 Their psychic connection is actually explored well enough that it seems believable, which is important given that their shared emotions necessitate finding one woman who will want to be with both of them forever.After Kaycee's first encounter with the aforementioned serial killer, the brothers spirit her away to their Texas home for protection


 The events that follow are not all unpredictable, but they aren't the least bit boring
 The glimpses we're given into the serial killer's mind are chilling and make the threat he presents immediate and horrifying


 True, he's able to take actions throughout the piece with a little more ease than is realistic, but again, that takes a backseat to how menacing he is and how quickly the story moves along.As for the crux of the matter, the passion between Kaycee and the twins is incendiary and it becomes front and center immediately
 There are numerous love scenes between Kaycee and one brother at a time, and there are also some featuring all three characters


 Each and every one of those scenes is brimming with chemistry and heat


 This is not one of those menage stories wherein two of the players seem more involved with/interested in each other while the third is essentially odd-man out: the brothers' desire for her is intense, and she is equally drawn to both men


 Their non-sexual interactions are full of teasing and getting to know one another - there could have been more of the latter, but there was ultimately enough that the emotional connections that are developed are believable
 This isn't an insta-love situation, at least on Kaycee's part, which I appreciate, as it allows her to use her head, explore her options, and figure out what she really wants in her life.All in all, this is a fast read that is eminently full of passion, heat, emotions, tension, and fear


 (Plus, it includes the playful interactions of a cat and dog that are truly adorable and funny, which is always a bonus.)  This was a well-written story - one that I enjoyed very much and that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality example of a story in this genre.

$REVIEW.: Ever since I got to know Willa and Hart on the pages ofSeducing Charlotte (Entangled Scandalous)I've wanted to read their story, and I'm thrilled that it was worth the wait

This book is everything I've come to expect from Diana Quincy: well-researched and detail rich plot, three-dimensional characters, and sparkling dialogue.During the Regency period, marriage was the most important milestone in a woman's life


Unmarried women had fewer liberties than their married counterparts, and yet, often in Regency romance women are portrayed determined not to marry


Willa is one of those women
However, for once, I could accept her motivation: with her reputation ruined, her marrying a fortune hunting scoundrel were high and with her cousin backing her independence both financially and socially, she could afford to forgo marriage

The only reason for her to marry would be to find a better situation than her cousin was able to provide her, and marriage to Hart would give her that.Hart is truly a swoon-worthy hero: not only is he a duke of self-made fortune, but also quite the forward-thinking gentleman and knight-errant all in one


He proves that he's willing to support the heroine's desire for financial independence and scandalous pursuits - noble cause aside, a daughter of a marquess at the time could not engage in trade


And he steps in to shield her from physical harm and from damage to her reputation all through the novel

He's honest to a fault when he'd be better off to keep his mouth shut, honorable at times when breaking a promise would be to his advantage, yet ruthless when it comes to protecting the woman he loves.So my only quibble is with the aftermath of their disastrous wedding night
To quote Willa "..


I've wasted &lt;time> brooding when we could have been doing this." She was, at the very least, just as culpable for the misunderstanding with her new husband, but failed to see that and spent too much time sulking
Thankfully, she got to her senses before wrecking her marriage completely


And the ending was simply wonderful.

$review_text.: As a BIG fan of the Horus Heresy, and one who was up until now enjoying all the books put forth, I must sadly confess that Decsent of Angels was quite a let down.As a stand-alone book, it was Okay, a bit boring, and with a few too many typos for my taste.  But, for a book that is supossed to be part of the Horus Heresy, this book does not measure up at all.If you are a fan of the Dark Angels, this book might interest you as a source book, or a compliment to the Codex, but as part of such a grand undertaking as the chroniciling of the Horus Heresy, I have to say - it stinks.

$review_text.: I was at the doctor's office.&#34;Well, Doc

It's like this

I have a headache the size of Baltimore, My nose runs like the winner of Kentucky Derby, My body is aching for the fjords and I have an irresistible desire to discuss Existentialism with Nietzsche's horse&#34;&#34;What have you been reading lately, Marvin?&#34;Oh, the usual The Great Gatsby, Ulysses, The Exesis of Philip K

Dick at one word a day, and unsolicited excerpts from Journey to Virginland&#34;.My doctor shook his head
He pulled out the rectal thermometer, looked at it and shook his head again
&#34;It's quite obvious


You are having a bad case of taking yourself too seriously&#34;


He handed me a copy of Bradley Sand's Please Do Not Shoot Me in the Face.&#34;Read these three stories
One for each night then report to me on Thursday


Do not try to read more than one a night as it could have devastating consequences.&#34;I left fifteen minutes later, of which ten minutes of it was spent begging the doctor to put the rectal thermometer back in

When I got home I looked at the relatively thin book and thought, &#34;Posh! (the Spice Girls were staying the night)


I'm the only man who ever read Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous in one night and survive.&#34; So I began reading

Wait! This is actually three novellas


It's a novel

No, now the author says it isn't


I was getting confused

I soared through the first novella, a cute little Bizarro comedy called &#34;Frankie Nougat and the Case of the Missing Heart&#34;

I found myself forgetting about Nietzsche's horse, probably just in time since the horse was changing into something more comfortable

Frankie is sad and funny and his dog is cute and makes a fair gun
Then I turned to &#34;Cheesequake Smash-up&#34; in which all the fast food franchises are involved in a destruction derby with floating buildings


Wait a minute
Is my house moving? I can no longer feel my toes

So I took a break and asked Posh Spice to feel my toes for me.Then I read &#34;Apocalypse Ninja&#34;


OK already 
The first two were funny but this was a blast
The world's worst ninja takes on the world's worst pirates

Bradley Sand writes like a maniac with a chainsaw and I'm liking it
But my body started to revolt
I was being pummeled by my own intestine totally unaware that I ripped off that line from a sci-fi novel written by the 2nd president of the United States

I've totally forgotten about Nietzsche's horse but the fantasy was replaced by visions of ninjas, floating McDonalds, and talking animals
I began to realize that writing like a Bizarro author is not as easy as it looks and should be left to the maniacs with a chainsaw.So I rushed back to the doctor and he told me to lay off Bizarro for a day ot two

Read something trashy like 50 Shades of Grey or Atlas Shrugged before tackling another Bradley Sands Bizarro fest.&#34;By the way Doc, is it one novel or three novellas?&#34;&#34;When you win the lotto do you ask if the bills are in 10s or 20s?&#34;&#34;Good point&#34; Actually it wasn't but he's the doc.&#34;One more thing, Doc


Why it is there a cauliflower growing out of my nose and whistling the Ode to Joy/&#34;Doc shrugged his shoulders

&#34;It's Bizarro.&#34;

Typos and things such as calling Dean's wife Susan "Shelby" in the next sentence after writing about Nyla's friend Shelby and saying she should have won a grammy for her acting job were a little distracting but over all when she writes again if she has a few friends to read it over and then herself she may find the mistakes.I will buy her next book.

$REVIEW.: The book, Rumors Of God, by Darren Whitehead and Jon Tyson was a great read. This book shows us through detailed and encouraging stories how we as humans have deluded God's message in scripture and have forgotten his promises. But we are awaken when these authors confirm that the 'rumors' we have heard about God and his grace and promises are true! The authors do a great job to confront postmodernism beliefs, but are times are a bit tolerant. The book is an easy read that can be at times redundant or disorganized. I was surprised on the authors scriptural perspective on sin, and their call to realize our sin, as some of the mega churches out there shy away from this issue to keep their numbers up (tell the people what they want to hear). It was a great read and I would recommend this awakening read. My favorite part was the story about God's grace.The publisher has provided you with a complimentary copy of this book or advanced reading copy through BookSneeze.

$review_text.: 4.5 stars! Wow! This was some book!"Why are you looking at me?""Because I like your face."This book grabbed me from the start and I had to force myself to put it down in order to sleep. This was an emotional book, and impressive for a debut for an author. It's very hard for me to write a review of this book based on the fact that there are so many secrets that are revealed slowly (although you see them coming, but not initially, so they are still shocking), and I would not want to spoil any of those surprises with a spoilery review.There were so many parts of this book that I loved. From the glimpses of Evie and Leo in the past, when they were just kids, learning to lean on each other, and love each other, until their love turned romantic:"And when I say he kissed me, I mean it was like a vow, that kiss. I've heard people say they lose themselves in a kiss, but it was like we found ourselves the second our lips met. It was like he took me apart and put me back together with that kiss."-a romantic love cut short when Leo is adopted and moves across the country. And then the storytelling switches to Evie's life as an adult, when she meets Jake under strange circumstances, and inexplicably feels intense feelings for him, right off the bat."I reach my hand out to shake his and when he grips mine back, it's like tiny sparks pass between our skin, and suddenly all I am in my hand. All the other parts of my body, not being touched by Jake Madsen, have ceased to exist. It's the strangest thing, and I wonder if he feels it too."The intensity of the relationship between Evie and Jake was apparent pretty quickly, and it was clear that Jake was holding secrets back from Evie. I felt badly for Evie at times, and angry for her, knowing that Jake was hiding something. But, although a quick read, this book took over me and had me feeling so many different emotions for both Evie and Jake, and little Evie and little Leo.The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars was based purely on the fact that the sex scenes were so frequent that they bordered on gratuitous. And, although Sheridan knows how to write a sex scene, with that slow build-up that the reader is feeling, almost as much as the narrator - Evie in this case - the story was the real focus of this book. I would have loved to read more about Evie and Jake's struggles in life, and a little less sexy time. Funny that I think I am probably a minority in this, as Sheridan really does have a gift for writing steamy sex scenes.And there was an epilogue! Yes! I love epilogues, although recently I have read several epilogues that could have (and should have) been novellas - they were either too long, or spanned too long a period of time. This epilogue was, in a word, perfect. And, so I will leave it at that.

$REVIEW.: The story of widow Samantha Sawyers Rodriguez and her move to Montana to raise her 9-year-old son and miniature horses springs to life with engrossing characters and powerful storytelling. Holland (Wild Montana Sky) creates a rewarding, old-fashioned love story that lingers in the memory.Set in 1894, the tale begins in Argentina when Samantha, chafing beneath the thumb of her harsh father-in-law, learns that she's inherited a ranch from her uncle. Soon she's butting heads with a neighbor, widower Wyatt Thompson, who wants to buy the ranch for himself and disapproves of her plan to take in a troublesome pair of orphaned twin boys. But Wyatt can be an ally as well as an irritant, especially when much of the town turns against the rambunctious children. I found this book hard to put down and delightful to read.Lady in Disguise

$review_text.: Knowing this would focus on Charming and Frankie (who were nothing less than explosive in their interactions in Recalled), I was excited to read this. It took me less time to read than the first book, I just didn't want to put it down. The only reason I did is my Kindle was falling and hitting me in the face because my body just couldn't stay awake.The chemistry and word wars continue between Charming and Frankie, with each realizing about the same time their feelings for the other person. That was a nice change - there was no one-sidedness to the feelings. They were there and unacknowledged, yes. But it wasn't ever one was ahead of the other emotionally. They were on the same journey.Piper is still around, of course (being Frankie's best friend and practical sister). Storm also comes around again. Piper's acceptance of the whole Death world and how it works seems a little eerie, and with her reaction (or rather, non reaction) to something very specific, I can't help but wonder if Hebert is going to add more mythology to the story. Because let's face it, the Grim Reaper is mythology.I think the colour pink is just right to describe this couple. Sometimes a neon pink, but other times a soft, pastel-like pink really captures them. That pink that you see in the most beautiful sunsets reflecting over the ocean. Yeah, that sounds about right.

$REVIEW.: The writing was crisp, but the authors youth was apparent

My Wife, (who loves this genre) and I both read this novel, but she stopped shortly into it, saying &#34;the plot took much to long to unwind and the build was tedious&#34;

I continued on, but did note repetitive thoughts or discussion points.There are some brilliant scenes and flares of writing that tell me the author has serious talent
I could relate to the characters at different times, but I detected a lack of writing plan in the outlay of the novel, as it wandered forward

Don't get me wrong, the book always moved forward, just not in a concise manner


I never felt involved deeply with the characters

The &#34;Notes&#34; at the beginning of some chapters were interesting, but seemed a distracted side to the main dish, rather than a spice they could have been.The contents page (with links) at the end of the kindle edition seemed like a formatting error, and should have been in the front with chapter references.To be fair to the Author, This was my attempt at reading this genre and it remains outside those I favor, so please bear that in mind, which is why I kept my review more technical.

Isn't one catastrophe enough?  I guess not.So, for fiction for end of the world, I would give it a 4 star.  But I reduced it to 3 because it is so overdone.  Ah, the perfect storm of catastrophes!

$REVIEW.: I'll have to admit that Persuasion Is my favorite right after Pride and Prejudice. I love Anne Eliot, she is so mature, selfless, level headed... I admire her. She  is like Elinor Dashwood traped in a crazy nonsensical family.In this book Ms Archer did another masterful job turning the story that we all already know into something new! She was brilliant! And now I am a fan.I am not going to comment much on the plotline because we all know how it goes: guy likes girl, girl likes guy, for some reason (in this case, some error in Annas judgement) they get separated. They find each other years later, she is sorry for what she did, he is bitter towards her and makes a series of mistakes of his own. In this book Anne Eliot is Anna Eliot, same personality, she teaches Russian Literature in the University, in Bath. BTW I loved the references to Anna Karenina and The Idiot, both great books! Ana is not weak, in this book we get to underestand why she made the choice that she made and we ask ourselves if in her place we would have done the same. (How much would you give up for love?)This is well worth the read.

She has endured more in her short life than many would in 10 lifetimes, but is still positive and hopeful that her future can overcome her past. Until the one person who is supposed to love her above all else does the unthinkable and she begins to question everything. She meets a stranger, he is handsome and a kindred spirit. Can she find real, everlasting love? Inky is a great story, so gripping and intense that I couldn't stop reading because I had to know what would happen. WARNING - ULTIMATE CLIFFHANGER, if you can't handle that I suggest waiting until the series is finished before you start this book!

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like this book.  It has an interesting premise, beautiful writing, and a few spots that made me laugh out loud (I particularly loved when Renee, the "lowly concierge", is aghast at the poor grammar of her wealthy tenants).  However, I never really cared enough about any of the characters to make me want to continue to read.  Although technically brilliant, I plodded through chapter after chapter, never understanding why such intelligent characters would want to expend so much energy to look stupid. I kept waiting for a "eureka!" moment that would make the book click for me, one that would make me want to stay up all night to see what was going to happen next.  Sadly, that moment never came.  I am glad so many other people got so much enjoyment from "The Elegance of the Hedgehog", but it just wasn't for me.

Something about the way she writes keeps me intrigued  to want to read more . I don't want to go into details because some people complain about spoilers. But if you have read her books before and you loved those you will love this one. If you have never read a book of hers before , this is an edge of you seat romance. Very thrilling.

$REVIEW.: I've been a long time fan of Crossfit, but also somewhat of a skeptic. On one hand, I love the idea of Crossfit making fitness fun, functional, and involving aspects of sttrongman and olympic lifts. But on the other hand, I've watched Crossfit begin to almost take claim to inventing fitness. I get annoyed every time I open a magazine and see that burpees, sand bag carries, barbell complexes, etc. are "Crossfit workouts" instead of things that have been around for ages. But Murphy's book showed me how I was only seeing part of the story of Crossfit. Crossfit is community, support, diet. And against some criticism, no more a cult than any other club. The book made me wish I could only afford to join!Anyhow, great book and I could really relate to Murphy, being a banged-up runner myself and looking for a new challenge.

$REVIEW.: Nathan Lowell's magic is his ability to make everyday life into a story
 In this short book, everyday life runs into a rather big snag - and some handle it better than others.Space opera fans will enjoy an hour or two of reading voyage, and the filling in of a nice piece of the Deep Dark


 Those of us who only read space opera because that's where Dr
Lowell insists on dropping his characters will enjoy the all-too-human reactions to "oh, crap, we're probably gonna die".And some of us will be particularly tickled by the ending


 You'll know who you are :).Sit and read for an hour or two, and go back to your everyday life a little lighter


 I did.

$review_text.: While reading this no nonsense report about why democracies fail, I recognized how fascist our little experiment has become


The concept GSE is denotatively fascist, but we accept it as reasonable


Thus, Fannie and Freddie still exist, even after the debacle they significantly caused

Employing HUD and the CRA, Clinton and Bush manipulated the credit markets for mortgages beyond anything previously imagined by American Exceptionalists
With a de facto "reparations" program called sub prime loans, they greased the slide to the great recession, which is now, in popular myth, only a result of Wall Street (whatever that means) greed.This book gives you a fresh reason to hate and mistrust the popular press
If it won't tell us the full story about this scandal, about what is it spinning today? Implied government guarantees, in a housing bubble "without end", of loans which the originator could easily pass off to the greater fool, deserve more scrutiny


There has always been greed, what changed to facilitate this "crash"?Sperry documents thoroughly each of his suppositions

It is a sad story, yet without an end
The Chicago Acorn is doing it to us in continuum


The next move is "socially responsible" small business loans, and then college loans

There are vague but expanding quotas that in the words of Robert Higgs, a great economist, create "regime uncertainty"; a term used to explain the dearth of confidence and investment in our present economic state

Sub prime mortgages are the microcosmic government intervention which gives support to his thesis
If banks (and now others, eg., insurance companies) are told to whom to lend by political bosses for constituent reasons, there are no rules, just uncertainties

Is every type of "property" now part of the commons at the whim of the next delusional utopian?

$review_text.: First of all, everyone stop and take a good look at that cover! It's simply gorgeous and it totally portrays the incredible story!Collared for a Night starts out with a female shifter going to a special club to help her in her 'time of need' but it ends up to be so much more when her boss is the one to help 'tame' her desires... and let me just say that ladies you will need to bring an extra pair of panties because this story sure brings the heat! Your e readers will surely catch fire.The author did a fantastic job with details in this long story but don't let the length fool you. This isn't just fillers and fluffyness this is a brilliant story that was put together. I feel I know so much more about leopards then I ever thought possible. The settings and characters are super well developed and make this story so much more interesting!The conflict that arrives I totally didn't see coming and shocked me... but the way the main character handles it is based on the training from her boss and she deals with it perfectly!The only problem I had with this story is that it did move a little too fast for my taste but then again we are dealing with leopards ;) This is my first story by the author but it certainly won't be the last! Highly enjoyed this story and would recommend it to anyone who loves shifters and minor BDSM play :D

$review_text.: Title: Capitol Limited: A Story About John Kennedy and Richard NixonAuthor: David R. StokesPublisher: David R. StokesISBN: 978-1-494964054&#8220;You know, Jack, in a few hours, both us will be regretting how we spent the night, choosing a bull-session over sleep,&#8221; Nixon tells Kennedy while taking a train in David R. Stokes novella, &#34;Capitol Limited: A Story About John Kennedy and Richard Nixon.&#34;This one hundred and forty-seven page tome centers around several hours John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon spent together while traveling from Pennsylvania to Washington D.C. in 1947. As historical fiction, the conversation between the two men includes profanity so may be acceptable for mature adults. The bold and italicized quotes throughout the book with no footnote references may be distracting to some readers.While Kennedy and Nixon were young U.S. House of Representative freshmen, they were asked to attend a debate regarding labor unions in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. After the event, the two politicos boarded the Capitol Limited, B & O&#8217;s &#8220;Deluxe Pullman Dieseliner &#8211; Luxurious Train of Distinction&#8221; to head back home.After a coin flip for the best berth, the men settled in, starting a conversation that would last hours into the early morning. Being from opposite ends in their political beliefs, financial status, and upbringing at opposing American coasts, they had little in common except for their Navy experience.As the train rumbled through each station stop, topics ranged from Churchill, Truman, Roosevelt, and Hoover to the Logan Act, Korea, Poland&#8217;s &#8220;Forest People,&#8221; and Palestine. Bantering about Kennedy&#8217;s worn, torn passport and gossiping about anyone involved in politics, they both focused on foreign affairs as they shared future goals and dreams.With each dialogue and name dropping, the author includes a paragraph or two of background information for the reader to recall. Although there is no written material regarding what the two future presidents discussed, liberty is taken based on resources available.Although the book is mainly about the train trip, the beginning reflects where Nixon was when he heard of Kennedy&#8217;s death and how he responded. A postscript, author&#8217;s note, and sources complete the book.Having written five other books, the author/ordained minister imagines what these two men from diverse experiences talked about so long ago, not knowing how their lives would turn out later. A quick read, some readers may enjoy the biographies blended within its pages.Thanks to the author for furnishing this book in exchange for the reader&#8217;s honest review.

$REVIEW.: I am a great admirer of Zinn's brand of radical politics as well as his revisionist history. Here he collects a series of his anti-War essays into one slim but excellent volume. Never have I seen the case for pacifism made so well, recommended to readers of all political stripes, even if you disagree with Zinn's notions you'll find the book insightful and easy to read. I especially enjoyed the WW 2 parts, since this is typically viewed as a 'good war'.Zinn is despised by traditional historians, especially conservative ones, mostly for daring to hold unorthodox views, as a rule such talk seems ill founded. However he is also criticized for the sloppiness of his scholarship, and I was disturbed to find an example of that here, Zinn says:"Bombing Ethiopia in 1935, Mussolini's son-in-law Count Ciano described the explosions as an aesthetic thrill, having the beauty of a flower unfolding."The quote that Zinn refers to is from Vittorio Mussolini, Mussolini's SON (who wrote a book called Flying Over Ethiopian Mountain Ranges) and not Ciano, here is the actual quote:"one group of horsemen gave me the impression of a budding rose unfolding as the bomb fell in their midst and blew up. It was exceptionally good fun"In a sense, this does not detract from Zinn analysis, since he was commenting on something that was actually said, and making a point about how fascist regimes glorify war. The point is still valid, even if Zinn has attributed the quote to the wrong Mussolini relative. It is disturbing in that it displays certain sloppiness with the facts and a relative unfamiliarity with prominent figures of the period.
$SUMMARY.: A Superb Pacifist Pamphlet.

$REVIEW.: The blurb for STEALING THE GROOM sounded like a fun, lighthearted read and I was hoping it would be just what I was looking for. It was. It was a funny, wonderfully romantic friends to lovers adventure with some opposites attracting thrown in to spice things up. There was plenty of emotion and passion between Chad and Amelia, but no actual &#34;love&#34; scenes. Didn't matter. Actually, it's part of the humor and building tension as they struggle to keep their relationship at that friendship level that makes the story work so well. I love a steamy sex scene as much as most, but what really makes me fall in love with a book and it's characters is (1) believing the emotion behind their actions, (2) witty, playful banter and (3) a connection level that makes it clear the lovers are meant to be. Sonya Weiss gives us all of this artfully and with flawless style. I recommend you pick up a copy while it's still only $.99, because this is a 5 star read.

$review_text.: I'm still not sure what to make of this book

 It wasn't the most heartwarming or uplifting of stories, but that never bothers me
 It's hard for me to put my finger on it, but I think what it comes down to is that I didn't really care for any of the characters - not that they were poorly written - but there wasn't really anyone in the book I actually LIKED therefore I was not truly invested in what happened to them and came away at the end of the book thinking - OK, so what?The main characters are mostly selfish and self-involved and many others who had potential were left undeveloped or with story lines that didn't really go anywhere

 I think the only exception are Nikki and her father - I enjoyed reading about them


 But I couldn't really care much about Cotton, Livie or Delia - and poor Joe was just a plot point!I'm sure that folks who have dealt with alcoholism personally might find a deeper connection to the characters and the story, but I just couldn't get into it

 It wasn't a bad book, but I came away unfulfilled.

$REVIEW.: Author John Heidenry has done a commendable job in providing his readers with an often neglected team in baseball's history.  We are given a fairly detailed analysis of the 1934 Cardinals and its roster of colorful characters with an emphasis on Dizzy Dean.  Heidenry provides us with the various explanations as to the origin of Dean's various names from Jay Hanna to Jerome Herman.  In addition we are provided with a number of various origins of the term Gashouse Gang.  It is generally believed to have come from a tough neighborhood in southern Manhattan and first used by writers (Frank Graham)? or players (Durocher)? who would have been familiar with the term as it was used prior to the 1934 Cardinals.  Oddly enough the term Gashouse Gang wasn't used until 1935 when the Cardinals lost out in the National League pennant race to the Chicago Cubs.  I did find two annoying mistakes in the book.  On page 59 the author says "the Cardinals...triumphed over the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series."  The correction should read the Philadelphia Athletics who were in the American League.  Also, on the last page (291) the author states "The St. Louis Cardinals were the last Major League team to become fully integrated."  Tom Alston was the first African American to play with the Cardinals in 1954 while Elijah "Pumpsie" Green became the first African American to integrate the Boston Red Sox in 1959.  The Red Sox and not the Cardinals were the last team to integrate.  I can understand accidentally substituting Phillies for Athletics on page 59, but not the error on integration on page 291.  I also found a poor choice of words on page 234 with "Gehringer dribbled a shot toward first."  This certainly sounds contradictory.  Finally, in the preface (x) the author states "The story of their achievement has never been fully chronicled until now."  However, the much respected St. Louis reporter J. Roy Stockton wrote "The Gashouse Gang and a Couple of Other Guys" in 1945, a book the author uses in his bibliography.  I realize I sound awfully critical, but I did enjoy the book and did find it worth my time.

$review_text.: This isn't a normal Tawny Weber book, and I loved it!  Instead of a story about Seals, this is an emotional and entertaining story about Miki Lansing, a witch who's powers have gone haywire because she puts a curse on her soon to be ex-husband.  To get away, she decides to move to her ex-husband's rental house in another state, which is now her's.  Once there, she finds the house is dilapitated and needs major repairs.  The small town was blessed by a witch many years before, saying that faith, peace, and love will be found in this town.  The only problem is that the town is plagued with problems and the townspeople are not nice to her except for one person.  That person is Gideon Ross, who is a geat-grandson, grandson, and son of Rossville's former town mayors.  Gideon is also a contractor who is divorced and attracted to Miki...Please go with Miki on her journey to regain her powers, peace of mind, self confidence, and find love. You definitely won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: As a first novel, this kicked butt. Unlike most there was no  parts that felt stilted or "off". As a lover of a man with some attitude, and take no prisoners when his loved ones are involved mentality I could not help but love this story. You are very talented K. C. Lynn and I am anxious to read more by you. Many authors try to write a "bad boy" story and many have no idea how to bring across that kind of mentality  and they just can't pull it off. Their are very few of them that can and I'm glad to invite another into that group. (Hurry with book #2, I'm anxiously waiting

$review_text.: I was surprised to see this marketed as an 'adult' novel. Basically, it's a young adult novel with a lot of sex in it. It would have been better to tone down the sex and obscenities and keep it as a YA novel, as that's clearly the target audience. The concept is an interesting one, but the pacing of the book is uneven. Towards the end, we get a bunch of new characters introduced, and from that point on, I kept going 'HUH?' because I couldn't keep it straight if they were good guys, bad guys, or both. There were some good explanations about time travel paradoxes early on, but the premise of the book, two groups of time travelers at odds with each other, was never fully fleshed out. I never really understood why the two groups were at odds, and why they weren't working together. The author tells us that the guys from the future aren't visible to most people in the present, but their girlfriends in the present are described over and over as talking to them, sitting in a restaurant with them, etc. They have solid bodies, the girls find (I'll leave that to your imagination), but despite being invisible, no one ever sits on them on a crowded bus, or casually bumps into them, even though they can make physical contact when called upon to do so. There's a fair bit of Mary Sue about the male lead's abilities- in a crisis, boom, we discover that he can do X, Y and Z, which we never knew before. Obsessive love is held up as the ideal- the main characters, if separated by fate, will never be able to love again, because this love is just so great. But it's a little vague about what attracted them to each other, aside from physical looks. But then, luckily, time travelers never age, so they don't have to worry about falling out of love if their smoking hot partner loses their looks! (See what I mean about X,Y, and Z?)Most of the time, I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the novel, but there were some things just so improbable I had to go 'waitaminit'. In addition to plot events like that, there was the increasing vulgarity of language, and the increasing prevalence of typos. Nothing rips you out of a love scene like the hero caressing the heroine's bear arms. Or from a serious scene when someone drops an S from 'assess'. Is it really so hard to use spell check- or so important to publish the book on a particular day that the author can't take 72 hours to proofread and correct these silly errors?

$review_text.: Sibella Giorello is a new author for me. As I've been reading quite a bit of romance these days, I was excited to see a mystery come across my path. (Several, actually, so be looking for those reviews soon!) Raleigh Harmon is an FBI agent attempts to take a much-needed cruise vacation with her family. Her vacation comes to an abrupt halt when the wife of a famous actor on board is found dead. Murder, theft, and much craziness break out on the ship. With only five days left of the cruise, will Raleigh be able to find the culprit?The Mountains Bow Down reads a lot like James Patterson's The Women's Murder Club series, which I have enjoyed for years. The pace is pretty quick, the characters are likable and well-developed, and there were plenty of twists in the plot to keep me intrigued. This is the third book about Raleigh Harmon, and I was able to read without many questions that would have been answered in past books.However, the book started off pretty slow. It took me several chapters to really get intrigued, and it wasn't until FBI agent Jack Stephanson showed up that things really got interesting. I was also disappointed that this book was listed as Christian fiction, but there wasn't much mention of Christ or any biblical themes. The book was clean and had no offensive content, but I didn't think it really pointed people to Christ.I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson in exchange for my fair and honest review.

$review_text.: Ok so where do I start?! As much as I loved Tag Chaser I think I loved this book more! Song Chaser is about Tanner and his struggles to get over his best friend who he's been in love with for as long as he can remember


He's looking for that perfect girl who fits into all of his favorite songs

Kellee is a college student who loves music

all of the lyrics to his favorite songs
Tanner is so freaking swoony! I loved his witty banter with Kellee

Kellee was amazing! She was sexy and sassy and so hilarious! The relationship/friendship between them was epic! She meets Tanner and what happens next..well I'm not going to spoil it for you! Tanner shows his emotional growth and how life experiences change you outlook on the world


Kandi put her heart and soul into this book and it shows
She has shown how much she has grown as a writer
You can just tell by the sheer emotion that you can feel when you read what her characters are going through

You feel like you are experiencing it with them


Every twist and turn is an amazing roller coaster ride


Thank you for taking me on this ride! It was an incredible book! And for those of you who haven't read Tag Chaser book 1 this book can be read as a standalone so either you can read them in order or not either way you should read them both!

$REVIEW.: I guess the best way to explain the way I feel is to just say, "I am confused."  This book was really written well and I like the detail.  I enjoyed the characters and quickly fell into their world.  I wanted more of the story...BUT...this book should not be advertised as a CHRISTIAN book.  Yes, it has the redemption scenes and yes, it is about God, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; the story is filled with foul language.  I understand in the REAL WORLD language is used in this manner.  I know that it is more realistic if this type of language is used, but at some point a CHRISTIAN author must ask themselves an important question.  Can my story stand on its own without the foul language?  If it can, you have achieved quite a feat.  If it can't, you need to ask yourself if you need to be writing Christian fiction.  Just write and advertise in the secular world...but don't sell you wares to an audience expecting a Christian Novel.

$REVIEW.: 3.5 stars. This is the type of book I have trouble reviewing because I have some mixed feelings about it. I liked the story. Ethan Frost is the not your typical billionaire alpha character that we found in other books. The description of the book compared it to Fifty Shades and Bared to You, but Ethan was nothing like those alpha character; Ethan had a sense of humor and was kindhearted.Chloe is overcoming a difficult time in her life and trying hard to put her past behind her. She is determined to be her own person and stand up for herself. Determined to make her own decisions is what puts her in an embarrassing situation with Ethan which starts the beginning of cute banter between the two characters.This story is the broken boy meets broken girl and they can't resist each other. I liked the twists that this story had and he has a doozie of a cliffhanger so be prepared to need to read the next story. The problem I did have with this story was that is was very wordy and I felt it lacked dialogue between Chloe and Ethan. We were in Chloe's head a lot and there was a lot of repetition on her thoughts. I wish some of the dialogue that was summarized in her head we actually got to hear between the characters. That being said I am still going to have to see what happens next and read the next book in the series.**NetGalley provided a courtesy copy in exchange for an honest review.**

Every two trades could be a full season.  You'd already have 4 Seasons of materials to work withI started reading the Walking Dead comic when it was already up to issue #20, so I started buying the Trades to read the stories easier.

Not only does it have tried and true favorites like vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and shows you different approaches to making them (e.g. Philadelphia style which is with no eggs, and custard based, which is with eggs) but it also has some of the most fun, unusual flavors that ice cream aficionados will be clamoring to try.With flavors like:saffronblack pepperpear pecorinoparsleygoat cheesericeavocadolavender honeyroquefort honeyolive oilyou've gotta give Lebovitz 5 stars for creativity.But once you get past the novelty of the creativity, you're still left with a mouth-watering, delicious batch of ice cream. Lebovitz is not just making these unusual ice cream flavors for the shock value of it. He truly cares about making a good product, and would never steer the home cook wrong. Every flavor of ice cream I've made with this book has turned out delicious.So far I've made:olive oilAztec "hot" chocolatebasilgingerricegreen teaand they have all been outstanding. If you are even the least bit interested in making your own ice cream at home, this book will convince you to be full-fledged, gung-ho about making your own ice cream.

$review_text.: Historian Ruth Doumlele presents The Randolph Women & Their Men, an exceptional, expertly researched portrait of the upper class elite of the post-Revolution American South


Though particular focus is given to the Randolphs, the elite, influential leaders with whom they interacted - including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and James Madison - are also observed here, with strict attention paid to historical records

The Randolph Women & Their Men offers a uniquely up-close and personal glimpse into the daily lives of America's wealthy aristocracy of the past - including their scandals of incest, betrayal, and love that was not returned
Organized chronologically by year and broken into brief segments that peer into events surrounding the cast of real-life Americans, The Randolph Women & Their Men is further supplemented by end notes, a bibliography, and an index for ease of use

An enjoyable read for pleasure as well as for study into how America's upper crust used to live their daily lives, The Randolph Women & Their Men is highly recommended.

$review_text.: This is the first Matsumoto Seicho book I have read, and the third in the Soho Crime series that brings classics of Japanese crime fiction to a Western audience

 I have been deeply impressed by the series, and consider it a hallmark for great writing and quality translations, and I know I can pick up any book in the series and be able to settle down for a good read."Inspector Imanishi Investigates" (original title "Suna no Utsuwa" or "Castles of Sand") is one of the most famous of Matsumoto's works, having been adapted twice, once as a feature film and once as a TV mini-series

 First published in 1961, it was one of his "social mysteries" that deal with social issues in Japan at the time as opposed to simple murder puzzles

 In this book we have the gender gap that followed the Japanese defeat in WWII, the loss of older ways and the rise of a new generation with new methods of committing crimes


 Will the old-fashioned ways of solving them still work?The story begins with a basic crime scene; a dead body is discovered, and clues are scant


 Inspector Imanishi and his younger partner Yoshimura follow what lose trails they have, which is limited to an accent from a certain part of Japan and a single word "kameda"
 The hunt leads them through a long path, taking months as they sort through regional accents, dusty family records, movie posters and any other thin straws they can desperately grasp to


 Somehow interlinked is a group of avant-garde young Japanese intellectuals who call themselves the Nouveau, and seek to subvert the social order into something new and unique, using art, writing, music and theater

 They are the black suit and beret set, completely at odds with Imanishi's old-fashioned and simple life.Imanishi is a fascinating character, although much different than most fictional detectives

 He is no brilliant Holmes or Poirot

 He is just a simple old hound dog who latches onto a trail and follows it where it goes


 A lover of bonsai trees and haiku, yakiniku and hot sake, Imanishi is a simple middle aged man, not exceptional, not a rebel or rule breaker, but with a dogged sense of pursuit and the inability to give up once an idea has twitched itself in his mind

 One feels bad for the old guy, tired and somewhat out of his depth, but just too stubborn to let it go


 He is a very realistic character.As far as the mystery goes, it is the perfect kind of crime for Imanishi


 There are no breadcrumbs to follow, no near misses of suspects and dynamic shootouts in dark alleys, but rather hunting patiently through old records and slowly stitching together a big picture

 There are a few too many coincidences, and a few too many lucky breaks fall into the inspector's lap, but I can forgive that for all the foot work he put in


 He deserves a few easy clues


The way the mystery plays out is fantastic, and I was gripped at every minute

 When the "ah-ha" moment came of figuring it all out before the book revealed the end, it was very satisfying in the way that only a really good mystery can provide.

$REVIEW.: First off, this book and its predecessor were rec'd via a friend who I swap books with. I don't think I would have purchased either. Like HELLRAISERS, this book supposedly takes on legendary Hollywood bad boys known as much for their lifestyles as their movie work. Part of the premise is that these fellas are notorious rascals who wallow in general bad living. No doubt about it, none of them are/were angels. However, I'm not sure they are worthy of a book that is dedicated largely to their slimey behavior. Like the first book, there is biographical information coupled with anecdotes supporting the book's basic premise. While interesting, the sameness of the stories actually got boring after a while. Objectively, I probably should not have read both books in rapid succession becausde my general enthusiasm was waning after the first book. Taking this into account, this is an interesting book and worth a look if you like these fly-on-the-wall escapades. However, if you are interested in Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Dennis Hopper, or Warren Beatty, you'd probably be better off reading individual biographies which might be more enlightening. This book o.k., but it got boring fast.

$review_text.: The book wasn't really about Al Capone as I had hoped, but it was an enjoyable read. The story shifts back and forth between the year 1930 and present time.In the past we have the story of Meg and the violent goings-on in the small town where she lived. The story centers around the turbulent times of the depression and of when the KKK did as they pleased while most turned a blind eye to it. We also have the love story of Meg and her fianc&eacute;, the Deputy, who both strive to keep Meg's little brother and his colored friend safe from harm.In present time is the story of Liz, a history professor with an obsession for Al Capone. The story centers on her quest for love and companionship. By chance she stumbles on an article about Al Capone staying at a hotel in the small town where Meg lived. Wanting to know more about why he was there, she begins to research the happenings of the town from that year, and eventually attempts to solve the mysteries that surrounded all the violence that took place there. All the while, she is on a journey of self-discovery, as she figures out the reasons for her attraction to 'bad boys' such as Al Capone, as well as her personal choices in the men she dates.I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed all the stories that took place throughout. The cast of characters were well-developed and believable. When it comes right down to it, this is a story about love and relationships, about tragedy and the strength to carry on.

$REVIEW.: Regis Faller's "Polo" picture books are absolutely brilliant and magical..


These fab French imports feature Polo, a cheerful, indomitable cartoon dog with a flair for improvisation, bravery and boundless curiosity..


The wordless, multi-panel graphic novels recall the fantastic, breathless wonder of the old "Tin-Tin" books, only without any real sense of danger, just pure adventure, fantasy, and fun


Polo climbs a ladder to the sky, is scooped up birds, falls inside an iceberg and climbs up to the moon, where little green men welcome him into their mushroom-strewn underground kingdom...Polo is a marvelous reading experience, and it expects as much from its readers as it gives back

Adults can guide children through the story, commenting on each panel, or summarizing entire pages, creating the narrative as they go along
Children can also spend hours alone, pouring over the panels and making up stories of their own..


and they will!Highly recommended

One of our favorite books

$REVIEW.: First, as other reviewers have noted, calling John Price the "literary love child" of David Sedaris and Annie Dillard seems a strange comparison. Yes, there is light, mostly self-deprecating, humor and yes, there are some lyrical passages describing the Loess Hills area where Price lives. However, Price's writing is his own and not really at all like either of these writers. Instead he is able to bring out the beauty of this often under-appreciated part of the US even as he ponders significant changes in his own life. A decade or two ago, this time would be quickly labeled as a mid-life crisis, but Price shows us that some of his concerns and observations are the result of far more than just some pop psychology stage of life.The events chronicled in this book cover just one summer, but Price uses this time in his life to draw out decades of memories and introduce us to generations of family members. In those few months, Price faces the possibility of significant heart problems for both himself and his wife as well as the pending death of his elderly grandmother. When Grandma K announces that she is no longer going to take the medicines she needs to continue life, Price is forced to face a lot of things he might rather have ignored or just pushed out to some nebulous "later." Complicating the issue for him is his concern about his own parenting of two lively little boys who dearly love their great-grandmother and are vehemently opposed to death for even the smallest of the menagerie living in their house, yard, and all the world around them.It is the conversations that Price has with himself about sharing Grandma's decision with the boys that brings a valuable but unexpected value to this book. In our culture's growing support of allowing people to choose their own death, we don't always hear of the impact these decisions may have on the people closest to the dying patient. Price's narrative about his own feelings as well as how the boys learn of the decision and then react to it could be a great start to one more discussion of this subject.While the family anecdotes and history were interesting, there were times when Price's writing was more than a little confusing in keeping straight who was part of which generation. In addition, I'll admit that I struggled with the way that it seemed the boys seemed to rule over the parents in many family decisions, but this approach--allowing the boys to make a lot of decisions about not killing even a brown recluse found in the house--enhances Price's overall theme and adds to some of the entertainment value.Overall, this is a book that is engaging, well-written, and worth your time. A good summer read and maybe even a way to start yet another end of life conversation.

$REVIEW.: When I saw that this book was about a Mormon librarian with Tourette's Syndrome, I knew I had to read it because I am a huge fan of anything weird or incongruous
 Josh, the author, is a gentle giant and bibiliophile with a rather large cross to bear -- an unrelenting case of Tourette's Syndrome that causes him to punch himself in the face and scream himself hoarse, often at inopportune times

 Josh is also a weight lifter, a lifelong lover of books and a librarian
 Although Josh waxes eloquent about Mormonism, his relationship with a seemingly awesome set of parents and his weightlifting, this book is really and truly about Josh's lifelong love for, and fascination of, books and reading, a love that I share
 5.5 out of 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy
And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was

However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless

Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities


This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: "A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts

In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column

Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram."And how does that help me? one would ask


Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words
Visualization is the key word here


Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird

Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story


"One idea is interconnected with many other ideas," we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes

It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process


The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways."...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become

A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw

Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map


This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind." Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works

I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try


Well, all that has changed


I now find this subject as intriguing as they come

As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals
I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right


And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose
Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that

To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need.

$review_text.: Just FYI, this review will be LOADED WITH SPOILERS! I can't help myself when I love a book as much as this one.So, first of all, it's all boy POV, and hello, that's my favorite kind. Not the flip floppy boy/girl one, but the all boy, I'm a total dork and never know how to react around a girl I like pov. West is the cutest and funniest boy POV I've ever read. I was laughing my butt off from page one, and seriously pulled an all nighter with this one because West has that voice you don't want to stop reading, even when you want to reach into the Kindle and swat him upside the head for not kissing this incredible hilarious girl he's been friends with his whole life.Okay, so West is obsessed with this internet girl, who turns out to be his best friend, Cat in disguise. That part was predictable, I mean the second Cat was "on screen" I knew she was Harper, his internet girl. So I keep anxiously waiting for it to go dun dun dun, it's me West! And I love you! And that happened just at the right time, but West goes, oh crap... I can't love my best friend because it will ruin things. West kind of has a background for this reaction, so I expected it, and it made total sense for him to jump away, but what I didn't expect was Cat's reaction to everything.Cat is a heroine I want to hug for being who she is. Once she let it all out on the table, she never gave up, but she also gave West what he wanted, even if that's not what she wanted. And it's because she loved him 100%. Some may think that she's weak, or she's obsessive, or she just won't get a clue. I don't. I find her STRONG. Willing to follow her heart even though the guy she loves won't take it.Oh! And the part by West's mom's grave... hello chills. Amazing and I've read that part a million times.Okay, no more spoilers from here out. The writing was UNREAL! My type of style... easy to follow, not describing every freaking detail of life around them, and full of hilarious voice. Even though West was asking for a bruising from me, I loved him. His dorky and humorous and full-on teenage boy voice kept me flipping pages till there were no more to flip. So I went back and flipped again. I don't think I'll ever stop gushing about this one, and I can't wait to read more from this author.

$review_text.: The first thing to know is what you're getting.  It's a short story, not a long novel.  It reads like a pilot episode for television series.  I hope that the author makes it a serial.  I could read a serial with more-or-less self-contained chapters.  I don't normally read fiction (which is funny, because I write fiction all the time as "warm up writing"), but I know that I should.Evil Under Our Feet was recommended to me by a friend.  Because I don't normally read fiction (I read a LOT of non-fiction), starting with something short was a good idea.  McClellan does a good job wrapping up this particular story.  It leaves it dangling open just enough to make me wonder what happens next (which is what makes me think that this might be the start of a serial).Personally I like the short story format.  I also accepted the challenge to read a much longer book, but I really do prefer shorter reads like this one!  My favorite Ray Bradbury story was a short one, Sound of Thunder.  I like this format.  One of the things I love about this digital age is that publishers and authors can publish short stories like this and sell them to us inexpensively (just like bands can sell us singles in this MP3 age).If the author comes out with more stories in what I hope will be a serial, I'll probably get those, too.

$REVIEW.: The reviews I read would have you believe this was a sweet and romantic Regency romp

 Be forewarned:  The is an extremely graphic and adult themed story (the title should be clue enough)
 There is nothing romantic about a young innocent woman feeling so desperate for her own and her 14 year old brother's safety that she has to result to selling her virginity to the highest bidder

 Although the man who purchases her treats her with care, he still bought her and takes her innocence and that part of the story is described in graphic detail
 Although Melissa only intended to be used that one night and then escape London and their dire circumstances, James wants to set her up as his mistress and thinks she should be oh so grateful for the life of a whore he is planning for her


 He can't believe she's not bursting with joy when he makes his offer and is relentless in his pursuit of her threatening to ruin the safety she has found in the country

 While the writing and plot kept reading to the end, I would have to say this is definitely not a light and romantic read


 It is dark and at times depressing and while in the end it could be termed a love story it is for sure not for those that are offended by the graphic nature of the subject matter.

As tempted as we are to objectify and vilify others, we always have the option to take that deep breath and find our compassion. Jampolsky gives several examples of how acting with kindness has literally transformed catastrophic scenarios into positive encounters where new opportunities were realized and friendships formed. If such good can come of a single compassionate encounter, imagine what a lifetime of cultivating loving responses can achieve!I have read this book several times, and I am uplifted every time I read it.

 An excellent, practical book filled with everything from how to avoid over vaccination to adopting a vegetarian (or vegan) diet for your dog
Using this book, we successfully transitioned our adopted dog (4 years old) to a plant based diet (for a lot of reasons) and found after about 1 month she had a shinier coat, more energy, and gained up to her normal weight


 More than your average vet will ever know about alternative dog care

$REVIEW.: We all read books and know when we finish, there are going to be some that stick with us. When it Rains is one of those books, for me. I've ugly cried before and I'll think about a book for a while after I have finished it. Well never and I mean NEVER have I had this kind of reaction. Scrolling through Facebook the other day, I come across a teaser pic and immediately my mind went to that scene in the story and my eyes got teary.When it Rains was beautiful and 100% gut-wrenching. I am finding it very hard to put my thoughts down, in fear of spoiling the story but also it's as though I'm tongue tied. But, I'm going to try and do it justice.At 17, Kate lost her innocence. Actually it was taken but with that she lost the ability to live. She became a shell of herself, just going through the motions. She lost her friends. All but one. Beau was never far away. He knew something was wrong but since she refused to speak of what happened to her, there was nothing he could do. Now it's time for Beau to leave for college and he can't leave without telling Kate how he feels and how long he's felt this way. Kate does what she's done to everyone else. She pushes him away and from that point on their relationship is awkward and strained.This part alone broke my heart. He wanted so badly to be there for her. He didn't know what was wrong but he wanted to fix it. With promises of coming home every weekend, he had no choice but to leave for school.Kate has put off college with the excuse of needing to work to be able to attend school. It's safer this way. She's barely comfortable with herself, much less with a bunch of strangers. Working at the diner, she sees the same people almost every day. Again, it's safer this way.Then Asher walks into the diner. It takes some time but he convinces her to start living again. Take risks, challenge yourself. I swear, as I'm typing this I'm reaching for the tissues! Kate and Asher grow closer and soon she shares what happened to her two years ago. He comforts her and helps her move on in the most amazing way. But Asher has a secret he's holding onto as well. And, when Kate finds out, her world is tilted on its axis. Mine was too actually and this is where I lost it. Sometimes I will add quotes to a review but right now I can't even bring myself to open the story. That is how affected I am! I read this weeks ago and it has stayed with me.Everyone I talk to, I tell them to read this book. But I'll advise that about halfway through, take a couple ibuprofen and maybe have some re-wetting drops for your eyes. You'll need it! I am rating this book 5 out of 5 grab your tissues and be ready stars.

$REVIEW.: This book has a daily language review for each school day. There are so many grammar concepts included I cannot name them all. I am pleased with how children are able to engage in the use of different concepts together verses the focus on once concept at a time. My son has been able to see how capitalizing the first word in a sentence is just as important as the use of proper punctuation.There are no pictures however the book includes a section at the end of each week for the child to keep track of how many they get correct for each day of the week. This has been encouragement for my child and he seems to feel as though he is helping me  keep track of his progress.

$REVIEW.: This book is painful to read. It is particularly painful for those who wish to support Israel, "come what may", as many do. As we see from the criticisms of the book they seem to be reduced to blanket denials and ad hominem attacks on Pappe. The reason is that Pappe's revelations about the early Zionists' deliberate, brutal, and carefully planned "ethnic cleansing" [a term that blandly covers the murder and rape of thousands and which resulted in the refugee status of hundreds of thousands denied return to their homes in defiance of UN resolutions] and the theft of Palestinian property is based on his careful research into Israeli records, principally the dairies of David Ben-Gurion, a man who is revealed as a monstrous war criminal by every international standard. This is hard to take for those brought up to see Israel as "a light unto the nations" and has been omitted from the history taught to young Israelis. How could it be included?Perhaps more surprising for readers who are not familiar with the period of Israel's creation is the shameful part played by Britain and Jordan in watching the Palestinians be brutally driven from their homes and sometimes murdered. The Jordanians wanted their piece of Palestine and went along to a certain extent and the British just wanted out. Most surprising is the recognition that the Zionists, far from being at the mercy of invading Arab forces as is often claimed, always had superior military power, supplied by East European communist nations, and better quality forces which they understood very well while telling the rest of the world how they were in dire straits! The honeyed words of Abba Eben, described by Pappe as "rhetorical obfuscations" were of great value to Israel for many years in fooling the west diplomatically about Israel's real actions. The ethnic cleansing continued all the time, and as Pappe says, it is still going on by more clever means.This book will likely be ignored by the mainstream media in the United States because of the devastating picture it paints of the reality of the Zionist state and the strong factual evidence it presents but it should be read by anyone who want to know the truth about the foundation of Israel.

$review_text.: Let's just start by saying that I am not gluten intolerant, perhaps if I were, it would alter my opinion.My beef with this book - yes, Paleo Pun intended - is this:  Many of these recipes are Southern-based.  Fried okra, anyone?  Those ingredients aren't available to me, and/or if they were, they would have been shipped from a distance.  Not so local.  Also, many of the other recipes are easily found on the web for free, like Mock Mashed Potatoes.All that being said, if I lived in the South, I would probably enjoy this book more.

$REVIEW.: I brought this book because it looked like my kind of read and I wasn't disappointed. The book is based on two young teenagers which I like being young myself and it made me feel quite attached to them and their story. It's set in 2053 which leaves your imagination open, it has a lot of imagery which leaves strong images in your head and it's really effective. The book is about destruction and poverty, maybe not something you immediately think of when it comes to futuristic story's but it works really well! It's also not like any other science fictional book I've read in the way of the ending, it's much less typical and I prefer it. I highly recommend this book if you love sci fi or are just looking for a good read, I really enjoyed this book.

$review_text.: This is an excellent guide to making jams, jellies, and preserves. Actually, it's a guide to making a lot more, including fruit leather, fruit sauces, and fruit beverages. If you have a surplus of a particular kind of fruit, you will not be at a loss for things to do with it. And even if you don't have access to lots of seasonal fruit, there are numerous clear, well-constructed recipes for things made with readily available citrus, apples, even carrots. I've been putting up jams and jellies for years, and this book will go right up there with my tattered copies of the "Ball Blue Book" and "Putting Food By." In particular, I liked the author's emphasis on doing away with the use of commercial pectin, which requires the use of much too much sugar.  She also has a straightforward commentary on why honey isn't entirely successful as a sweetener for jams. The book contains a really amazing number of suggestions for preserving all kinds of fruit, handy if you have a surplus of something.The layout of the book, always important, is appealing and easy to follow when you're stirring a steaming pot,  and the instructions are excellent. For me, the clincher was the excellent recipes using blueberries and raspberries. Her basic recipe for raspberry jam is exactly right, and she also includes a recipe for something called "Christina's Raw Raspberry Jam" that is worth the price of the book. It's very similar to something Edna Lewis, in "The Gift of Southern Cooking," called "Sugared Raspberries." Mmmmm---put it on biscuits. As for the blueberries, she's right; they are best fresh. But we do have lots of blueberries in Maine, so I plan to try her ideas for enhancing the flavor of the jam, which can sometimes be disappointing. Her recipe for jam from prune plums was also good. As for what she does with quinces, well, I'm here in Zone 3, borderline for quince bushes. But next spring, I'm going to plant one.Update, June 2010. The rhubarb/rose petal jam is wonderful.M.

 I picked it up because I know a student whose first language is Arabic and is having a terrible time with transposing the letters in English words

 I wanted to get a feel for myself what her language is like

 This book more than helped me with that, the examples of culture and other words really helped me get a sense of what she's going through


 Even doing the exercise of writing my name and other words, I had to coach myself repeatedly to start on the right


 :)  I borrowed it from the library but I'm going to get my own copy; I know it will be useful to help other students contemplate how different alphabet systems work and how what you learn first can help and can interfere, when you are learning a new language.

$REVIEW.: This is a story of not only a longtime love but of forgiveness even she. You don't believe you deserve it.  Bailey and Jess were the best of friends until one night when everything changed.  One night of mistakes which led to 5 years in prison for Bailey.  Bailey was in love with Jess' brother Darren for as long as she could remember and the same for him.  But when she came out of prison, he wasn't the Darren she used to know.  He was bitter and absolutely,hated her for that nigh.  He lost his sister and also lost Bailey.  After Bailey came out and he sees her all his old feelings come back with vengeance along with the feelings of hatred.  These emotions are al over the board and Bailey still feels the same about him as she did before it all happened.  When they come together Darren fights his feelings, wanting to hurt her in the worst way possible, bailey continues to take the punishment until she can't any longer when she finally leaves Savoy for Memphis. Darren does everything he can to over come his feelings of hatred until finally love overcomes and he finally learns to forgive.

I have read comic books for more then 40 years and I feel a  little cheated when a comic that was originally in color is reprinted in  black &amp; white. How cute of DC to put a color cover and have no  information on the cover for the buyer to know the inside is black &amp;  white. False advertising on DC's part. I do not blame Amazon.

$REVIEW.: Brian is realizing life doesn't always turn out as you planned and the people you care for most in the world aren't always looking out for your best interest. He's traveled all the way from Canada to New York with his boyfriend and their other band mate in hopes of making it big. Once there, Brian comes to find out some hard truths where his boyfriend of the past five years is concerned. Left feeling betrayed and all alone, Brian turns to the father he feels abandoned him five years ago. While dealing with his daddy issues, he turns to the one person he has come to respect and enjoy being around.Chase is a fellow musician that has become smitten with Brian, but Brian hasn't a clue. Chase has a past of his own he would rather forget. After helping Brian collect his belongings from his old apartment, they share a kiss. From there sparks fly and a relationships starts to grow. Brian's life seems to be perfect, he's getting along with his father and his father's partner, and he's falling in love.The bottom falls out of Brian's happy life when he discovers Chase has secrets he's been keeping from him. After being lied and cheated on by his ex, now Brian doesn't know if he can trust Chase with his heart.Brian is a very likeable character that most people can relate to. He's still harboring resentment towards his father and his father's partner, for leaving him and his mother. Plus he's dealing with his mother's current marriage falling apart. Brian's been through a lot in his young life and all he wants is his own little piece of happiness. Chase is also seeking that same happiness but he's so ashamed of his past he fears Brian will leave him if he knows the truth. My heart went out to Chase because he has dealt with things that no one should have to suffer through.Brian and Chase are a couple you want to be together. They have both suffered hardships in the past but together they can heal those wounds if they can accept that their only human and as humans we make mistakes. With love and forgiveness anything is possible.A Fool for You is the third book in this series. After reading this story I will definitely be reading the two previous (and I didn't have a problem reading this as a standalone). This a sweet love story that will touch you heart. I highly recommend giving it a read.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews.

So much so, that the the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (just google HHMI), a mammoth contributor to scientific understanding, Asked her to join two well-respected scientists in presenting the 2012 annual Holiday Lectures to gifted high-school students last December. I have followed these lectures for many years and find them to be consistently excellent presentations of cutting-edge research presented to really bright young people. 2012 was the first time I have seen a non-scientist present among the presenters, Dr. Oreskes has a PhD in Library Science, specializing in the History of Science. During her introduction, I learned about this book. It is well written, well documented, and suitable for any intelligent reader.

$REVIEW.: Formerly Joy Humbolt, a normal woman with a brother and a normal life, Sydney Rye was reborn from the blood of her murdered brother. And as with people who are changed by trauma and tragedy, Sydney became harder with a more masculine side-motorcycle riding, leather jacket wearing, whiskey-drinking, commitment-phobic, and totally badass. Luckily for reporter, Anita, and the hundreds of children molested and abused by Indian billionaire, Kalpesh Shah, Sydney enjoys a good fightA strong protagonist with visible and invisible scars and a deep love for her faithful dog, Blue, Sydney is a tragic heroine who seems to be headed for a life alone. She is not an empathetic character because, really, who lives a crazy life like that? What she is though is a broken character. Someone who will always put her neck on the line for the betterment of others. That's why readers will cheer her on and continue reading the series. Like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Sydney takes a beating but keeps getting up bloodied because of her strong sense of justice. The book also reads quickly with great dialogues and quick but brutal action. I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the whole series very soon!

$review_text.: God has truly gifted Joshua Harris with an ability to speak His truth in a way that connects with our generation. He doesn't speak in heavy theological tones, yet he doesn't water down the Word either.Boy Meets Girls is another classic in the mold of I Kissed Dating Goodbye. Joshua clearly defines his dating theology, now looking from the other side. Since publication of &quot;Kissed&quot; he has pursued and married a fine Christian woman. Now, he speaks on the godly way to find a godly woman.I found Boy Meets Girl refreshing. It gives the proper biblical outlook on controlling our lustful passions, finding Christlike intimacy with our future mates, and focusing our energies on God's Will.This is a good read for those struggling to find a mate, those recently stung by a broken relationship, and those who are in between. It resonates with young believers and senior saints. In his clear, lucid style, Joshua Harris clearly speaks for a generation of men and women who desire to serve God with their heart. Boy Meets Girl is a quality work and I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I would rate this book at 2 stars due to the fact that nowhere was i warned how sick this book was. The book was filled with multiple cases of sexual rape/torture/killing of both young girls and boys, to the point where it became gratuitous. Men raping and killing young boys for sexual pleasure was not what I thought I was going to be reading. The storyline however did intrigue me so I just started skimming whenever a rape/death scene began. Be warned this is a graphic, graphic novel full of rape,death and torture. I would most definitely not recommend for anyone under 18. I realize i repeated myself throughout the review, I just wanted to emphasize the whole rape/death/torture thing:)

$REVIEW.: Andres motorcycle adventure is something that every hardcore traveler with wander lust wishes he could take.  It's a good read however there are some observations.-Andres relationship with his riding partners seem dubious.  He seems to be that irresponsible roommate that you had in college and it is highly interesting that he doesn't tell you Robert's last name or where he is from like he does with Peter.  If Robert is his real name, why after spending months with Andres would he not want to be identified?-He claims to have little money and a poor college student but has 10's of thousands of dollars worth of gear, equipment and resources and he worries little about rent, hotels until the very end. Did his trust fund run out?-He parties like he is on spring break from one end of the continent to the other.-He is constantly perturbed by the locals.  Why travel to a foreign country only to be frustrated by the natives.All and all, it is an adventure worth reading although the writer is not entirely likable.  I recommend &quot;10 years on 2 Wheels&quot; for a truely amazing rider and adventurer, Helge Pedersen.To qualify some previous comments.  I observed numerous spelling/grammatical mistakes in this book.  The publisher should consider hiring better editors.

My  favorite book of 1998...wonderful lord yahweh, 3 persons in one, worship  god as he is, not as man wants to understand him with his finite mind.

$REVIEW.: Toddie Downs is an interesting new author and her first novel, Summer Melody, is an enjoyable and promising start to what will hopefully be a long, successful career.  Downs weaves her story with skill, taking the plot to diverse places, but, at the same time, tying things together neatly.Jane (14 years), her cousin Meg (18 years) and Bonnie (Jane's mother) all live in, or near, the small Connecticut town of Daedalus Falls.  In one long summer all three women will face challenges to their previously predictable lives:  Jane will tackle the problems of a first job, Meg will confront the possibility of a permanent relationship with a man, and Bonnie will be forced to confront unresolved, past difficulties with her family.  How will the sometimes traumatic events of this summer end?Summer Melody is very much about women and almost all the characters in it are of that sex.  Downs depicts women of the past four generations.  We meet Elizabeth, Bonnie's mother, who is a woman of the traditional, patriarchal 1950's, now very old.  Vivian, Meg's mother, is a child of the 60's counterculture.  Bonnie is of the retro-conservative Generation X.  Jane and Meg are born in the period of Generation Y, with its emphasis on personal freedoms and achievements.  These generational descriptions can help us to understand Summer Melody, however, Downs has very much tried to create people and her characters are thus complex, ambiguous and sometimes contrary to the observe trends of their period.  Elizabeth, for example, very much bucks the heavy social constraints of her time, yet she has somehow come to be the typical American matriarch, so prominent in 1950's culture, who dominates the family arena (as opposed to the male work arena).  As the novel progresses we learn more and more of her history and the complexity of her personality and her circumstances.  This is a very likable book and the characters in it are immediately pleasant and agreeable to the reader, if not perfectly so.  We care about these characters and are willing to stick with them through their trials and despite their imperfections. Once again taking Elizabeth as an example we see that we admire her feistiness and honesty, although she is often gruff.  In a similar way Jane is petulant, but deep thinking, Meg lacks commitment but is very friendly and Bonnie is overly conventional but caring.  In `real' life nobody is perfect and we like our friends, but also see their faults.Summer Melody is very much a social realism novel, though it has moments of humour to lighten the mood.  Much of this humour comes as snappy character descriptions and mood references to book, TV and movie titles.  For example in the beginning of Chapter 3 we read:"Meg wandered around the display, assisting the mannequins in tying the aprons around their waists.  The store was beginning to resemble a scene from The Stepford Wives."Of course this friendly little shop is far from the shady world of that satirical thriller.  As a point of criticism, however, it should be noted that in Chapter 17 the snappy comments are misplaced.  At a point of crisis we read:"She just wanted to fall under a sleeping spell and let tiny dwarves care for her until this was over."The lightness of the "tiny dwarves" clashes with the very serious mood.The novel is written in alternating chapters: first from Jane's point of view, them Bonnie's, then Meg's.  This adds considerable variety and depth to the text as we see events from different people's perspective: we are not limited to one version of the truth.  This postmodern departure from the traditional main character, or omniscient narrator, is very welcome.  As a result different readers may come to different conclusions about the `truth' of this novel.  Once again this complexity and ambiguity makes the novel more `real'.In fairly standard plot structure, though, the book slowly rises to crisis at mid-point, lulls, then peaks again, ending in resolution with all the plotlines coming to closure.  There are some very real `Oh-my-God' moments in this book, and a few cliff-hanger chapter endings.  This of course keeps the reader's interest.As the title of the novel suggests, music is an important symbol in the text.  As different characters encounter melody they find it soothing and uplifting.  We are given an idea of the rhythm of life, of joining with the flow.  The town of Daedalus Falls is very "twee," a cut-out-town from a painting depicting past life on another continent.  We are given an image of traditional convention and past rules.  Nature imagery occasionally appears as a calm alternative to our hectic lives, however, even there trouble can lurk.Downs has taken the main theme of personal isolation verses relationship.  At the very beginning of the book Janes meets an autistic boy, Charley, who passively sits, playing with his toys, while bullies throw stones at him.  A little later Jane musses:"She wondered if Sam sat alone in the cafeteria in his Pittsburgh school.  Maybe Charley didn't have it so bad after all.  Maybe the key to being different was not knowing or caring you were different."In our over-stimulated, numbed 21st century life maybe we are all a bit like Charley, but is this really how we should live?  Surely part of happiness involves reaching out?  This is, indeed, exactly what positive psychology teaches us.  (Martin E.P. Seligman.  Authentic Happiness: Random House Australia, 2002, p. 42-43, 56)  In the novel Jane is a loner, Meg is constantly breaking up with her boyfriends, Bonnie is divorced, Vivian, Meg's mother, is divorced plus estranged from Elizabeth plus partially estranged from Meg, and finally Brady, Meg's current boyfriend, has partially broken with his mother.  The characters sometimes admit that they have no feelings towards those who could be close.  Both Jane and Meg, for example, don't really connect at all with Elizabeth.  This is denial in order to avoid being hurt.Religion is a further sub-theme of the book.  In religion we think of ethics (how to act correctly in relationship with others) and compassion (right attitude towards others).  If we are to choose to come out of isolation how should things really be, and, more importantly, how should we make them?  At points of crisis in the novel people pray (even though they are not Christian).  There is an important, symbolic Madonna and child scene.  Vivian is very much a Christian, though we do not always agree with her pat responses to life.  The question of mercy also is important in the book.  What is it to truly be merciful?  Bonnie, at one point admits to having a kind of free "Unitarian" philosophy.  She is `spiritual' rather than `religious' and, indeed, this sums up a great deal of the book.  To Downs' credit these questions about life are recognised as complex and difficult, with no easy answers.  The idea that relationship is central to Christianity, the U.S.'s dominant religion, was popularized by Bruce Larson's book No Longer Strangers: An Introduction To Relational Theology (Word Books, 1973).  This book came out of the Jesus People and the Jesus Revolution of the late 1960's/early 1970's.  Interestingly this is when Vivian discovered her faith and is the point which she seems, at least partly, to lack.  To sum up, Downs hints that religion, or at least spirituality, is a source of interpersonal unity.  This is certainly positive psychology's notion.  (Martin E.P. Seligman.  Authentic Happiness: Random House Australia, 2002, p. 59-60)As we have noted this is very much a book about women and Feminists will find Summer Melody quite an interesting read.  In many ways this book documents "Second Wave Feminism" (Cathia Jenainati.  Introducing Feminism: Icon Books, 2010, p. 85-86), although it is certainly not a history book, so to speak.  Elizabeth came to maturity in the era which Betty Friedan later called "the feminine mystique" (Jenainati , p. 76, 90-94), in which the traditional view of femininity (cooking, children, frilly dresses and empty headedness) were very much in style.  Headstrong and determined, she is a pioneer feminist in a pre-feminist world.  In such a world what does it take to do what a woman really wants, and what are the costs of trying?  In her younger days, Vivian, disobedient to her mother and absolutely determined to be the complete person she is, was the typical 1960's Woman's  Liberationist. (Jenainati, p. 87-89)  We wonder how and why she became the conservative, praying for the lost, `born again' Christian that she is?  Bonnie is a single mother working successfully in a doctor's office, but at the same time is a caring mother equally centered in the family.  She is the type of person Betty Friedan proposed a woman should be.  (Jenainati, p. 92-94)  Friedan's ideas were popularized and followed generally in the 70s and 80s.  Bonnie, however, is in many ways too conventional.  She wants to do the `right thing', but this often leads her to do what society says rather than what is necessarily the `best' option.  Should she really be running around looking after her mother if she really doesn't like her, and especially when it is running her ragged?  Meg is a young woman intrigued by the idea of romance but unable to find a man who, at least in her mind, does not take her for granted.  She is the type of woman Tania Modleski identified in her book Loving With A Vengeance (1982).  Leaving her imperfect boyfriends may be an act of rebellion, but is Meg's judgements of the men she knows really accurate?  Jane, though certainly not yet a completely grown woman, is determined to be the kind of female she is.  At 14 as a hang-over Tom Boy she rejects `girly' dresses, buying boys shirts and pants.  The post-modernist (deconstructive feminist) theorist Judith Butler argued that cross-dressing is "an activity which challenges the neat distinction of sex and gender which heterosexual discourse has initiated."  She says that, "Cross-dressing provides the individual with a wider concept of gender identity which does not normalize male/female dualism."  (Jenainati, p. 163)  But does following her very individual course mean that Jane necessarily has to be the social isolate that she is?  As we can see Summer Melody has things to say that has much to do with later feminism, however, nothing is taken unassessed and unquestioned.  We all take a philosophic stance towards life, whether or not we see ourselves as philosophers, but taking a line, whatever it may be, always has both its pros and cons, its extremes and its difficulties.  Despite all that I have just written I certainly want to stress that this is not a `heavy' book in any way.  Downs manages the difficult feat of being very entertaining while at the same time giving information and insight.  We in no way feel we have been lectured.By contrast to the Feminist perspective, except for Jane, who is not really transvestite as far as we know, LGBTI characters are completely absent from the novel.  This is a noted oversight as lesbianism has been both the accusation of patriarchal traditionalism against Feminism, and indeed any woman who does not fit in, and the vaunted, pet theory of radical, left Feminism.  In today's world we know quite well that is virtually impossible to live life without knowing LGBTI people, though they may be closeted.  Where are these people in Down's novel we ask?  She is in other respects so realistic.People of African descent do get a mention, though they are minor characters.  Carla, Meg's employer, is African/Jamaican/American.  She is the successful owner and manager of "Yesteryear's Vintage Clothes," and is likable, supportive, understanding and a true friend.  No negative images there, but we could wonder if Downs has erred in making Carla too perfect.  Rodney, the "colored" old people's home attendant, endures Elizabeth's bigotry.  He is understanding and rises above other's abuse, but is not above a touch of ironic humour.  Like Feminism, the issue of the African/American minority is handled in a questioning, balanced way.  Because of his naively liberal beliefs, Brady, Meg's boyfriend, very much suffers at the hands of a gang of lower-classed, "colored" youths.  Brady then wants to move to the very white Daedalus Falls because it is "safe."Other cultural minorities are absent, which once again is a bit of an oversight as for long periods the U.S. has had a positive immigration program.  We also ask what of the indigenous U.S. nations?The old, as an oppressed minority, is briefly touched upon.  As Rodney and Bonnie talk about her in her presence Elizabeth comments, "I'm right here."This leads us to consider the novel from the broader perspective of society in general.  The notion that money is power very much occurs in the lives of Elizabeth and Mona.  Equally the issue of conformity is strong in the lives of Bonnie and Vivian.  This conformity enshrines upper and middle class power, but also holds real people in a narrow cell.  All this of course is just what the Marxist critique proposes about the U.S.  Marxist Feminism proposes that economic equality of the sexes and freedom for women is necessary for females to truly develop their own potential and power.  (Jenainati, p. 98-99)  Summer Melody is a Middle class and Upper class novel: Lower class women are completely absent.  Marxist Feminists criticised the Woman's Liberation Movement because it only pursued goals relevant to those classes (Jenainati, p., 100, 114-16) and they would possibly frown at Downs for her oversight.  In her defence, however, it certainly should be noted that this book is specifically about people connected to Daedalus Falls, a decidedly white, moneyed traditional place.  People from there would certainly tend not to mix with the Lower class, or even notice them.  Interestingly the place where Bonnie and Vivian grew up, "MacArthur Country", on the Ohio/Kentucky border, is conventional, slow and inefficient, but on the other hand very friendly.  Once again things have their pros and cons, though they are especially relevant to the issue of isolation verses relationship.From the perspective of psychology Summer Melody is a quite successful book.  By far the most important insight which the novel gives is that relationships are complex.  As children we tend to divide the world into `friends' and `enemies' and unfortunately for a lot of us this inclination can hang on into adulthood, although not so simplistically.  We all do and say things we regret.  Even our `best friend' will at times disappoint us.  The real question is how do we respond to these difficulties and what will be the impact on other people.  The plot line about Brady is psychologically correct and insightful.  Although it is never explicitly stated he clearly suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Downs certainly seems to have done her research here.  Beyond that special case the issue of general stress is handled well.  We see that people tend to deny stress and that this can have quite bad results as time goes on.  Most importantly on this point we all need to talk about our difficulties in a positive nurturing friendship (Judith Orloff.  Positive Energy: 10 Extraordinary Perceptions For Transforming Fatigue, Stress, and Fear Into Vibrance, Strength, And Love: Three Rives Press, Ch. 8) and that is exactly what these women do: support one another.  Also physical touch, as simple as a hand on the shoulder, or a more adventurous hug, gives us real support in times of stress.  (Orloff, p. 7-8 & Ch. 5)  Of course problems develop when we don't talk, in order to resolve our issues, directly with those people we have difficulties with.  Once again Downs is well researched and psychologically correct on these points.  Of course this is not a textbook on stress.  It is an entertaining story about people.Summer Melody is an enjoyable, insightful and balance novel about women.  Readers are left with the feeling that they have come across something close to life.  If you are a man with an open mind this book can, in a pleasurable way, help you to better understand what it is to be a woman.  If you are a woman you will immediately feel kinship to these characters and you will also be gently guided to think deeper about your experience as a female.  Despite all I have said about Feminism, Marxism and social history this book is first and foremost pure pleasurable reading.  This is not a musty, scholarly tome in any way.  It is well worth a 5 out of 5 star rating.

$review_text.: I enjoyed the reading as a causal storybook, as there is no in depth exploration or explanation  of the "impossible" other than "collective unconsciousness". At least Mr Grof did not talk TOO MUCH about perinatal and the various stages of birthing. As I was reading,I can't help but feel the author is taking too much LSD himself! and it could be dangerous to  naive or unknowing subjects, who wish to have a short cut to their problems.Still,there are some interesting stories which make us think about "the other side". I am a buddhist , we are responsible for what we do,or even for what we think. This life is the result of previous  lives and our future lives depend on this life. Many of his patient stories reflect this point. So, be kind and compassionate to your fellow humans.

This book has it all, incredible facts about animals from their habits, to their diet, and how they live!Ask about your child's favorite animal and then flip through the book to see if it is there (It most likely will be unless your child is already advanced in animal knowledge) and you can tell them  facts that will make their eyes open wider in disbelief! I read this to my younger nieces and they giggled and say"No way!"But Of course I'd respond with "Yes way."The kids even use the book as a reference and love the pictures. The book is on an easily understandable level for adults to read to kids and for the kids to read it themselves. Pictures are brisque and well drawn or captured.Excellent for the kids who love animals and for the adult who loves them as well. The book is free and readable through Kindle.

$REVIEW.: I remember when I first laid eyes on Grace Lee Whitney

It was an airing of the Star Trek episode "The Man Trap"

At the time the only woman I know who's on the show was Uhura, so I thought she was one of those girls-of-the-week guest stars


I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was a recurring character in the show's early episodes..in fact, one of the main characters
I never understood why her character disappeared and it was a shame, as Yeoman Rand character certainly added a lot to the show, especially in episodes like Miri, Charlie X and The Enemy Within.Grace Lee Whitney's autobiography is easily one of the more overlooked of the Trek bios as even though she was a major character in the show, and it is also one of the more disturbing and eye-opening.Grace Lee Whitney was adopted by the Whitney family while still an infant
I have to said that her adoptive mother was a real "B", as she revealed to Grace while she was in her early teens that she was not her "real" mother
This seem to marked a turning point for Grace as she embarked what became a life-long quest to fill that sense of emptiness and belonging

Being born with an addictive personality, booze, drugs and sex naturally and coveniently filled that emptiness.Grace had a career that any actor would kill for
While not famous, she was a prolific actress and worked constantly

When she was casted as Yeoman Rand in Star Trek, it seems she has finally find a surrogate home she can called her own


That came to a crashing end when Yeoman Rand was written out of the show
Sure, actors loses jobs and get written out of shows all the time, for the most part, they moved on


But not for Grace Lee Whitney

Star Trek became her lifeline and for years afterward, Whitney tried to numb her anger and sorrow with more booze, drugs and sex

The rest of the book chronicled her continual descent and eventual recovery and her road to sobriety.After reading the bio, I have to say that Grace Lee Whitney doesn't give herself enough credit for her recovery


Her story could have easily been a "poor me a victim of 400 years of oppression" story, but instead, she blamed no one but herself for what she went through (yes, even when she was sexually assualted by an un-named TV exec, she realizes that she should have known better than to place herself in such a vulnerable situation)


Her story could also easily have ended like that of Heath Ledger, River Phoenix, Judy Garland, James Dean and even Elvis Presley


We easily could have been reading her obituary, but instead luckily, we are reading that she is alive and well and probably more happy than she has ever been.In any case, her bio reminds us that in the end, where we eventually ended up is the result of the choices we make

Life is not fair and some people are dealt with a better hand of cards than others..in the end, we still have the freedom to choose where we're going.

This causes Cavin to pause and he makes Bens first experience special


 The love scene was erotic and sweet and touching all at once.It is a lovely romance


 The characters are endearing and well developed
 Ben is an aristocrat but he is kind, thoughtful, generous and caring
 Cavin is troubled, has had a hard life and feels he is not worthy of the kindness and affection Ben is willing to give.I really enjoyed that the story focused on the relationship of the two main characters
 There are other important characters in the story but they just help develop how we see Ben and Cavin

 I kept waiting for obstacles or bad guys to ruin or complicate things but it did not happen.It is one of the nicest feel good romances I have read recently


 The love scenes are explicit but feel right for the story.The story is a short, 40,000 word, quick read


 I was surprised at how well developed the characters were and how quickly I was able to become invested in their HEA.As I am not typically a historical romance reader I was unfamiliar with some terms used in the beginning of the book, i.e., hell for the gambling establishment, nabob for describing the person Cavin was targeting


 It did give the story the flavor of the time period.Thief is the first in the Brooke Street Trilogy


 The next two books in the series are titled Fortune Hunter, another 44,000 word novella and Rouges, a 28,000 word short story


 There is also a prequel , My True Love Gave to Me, Brooke Street 0.5, 28,000 words.I am looking forward to reading the next book in the trilogy and reading more of Ms March's books.

$REVIEW.: Sad to see this is the last book in the edge series. This was a nice read and very entertaining because we get to look at the healing magic that is so rare in the weird. Sadly the book does not get 5 stars because the ending felt rushed and a bit weird not much closure on the over-arc with the Louisiana spies, but we get to see the more prominent mar family members find their love and revenger, i would recommend reading this book for sure!

$REVIEW.: I thought the story was very interesting. The characters; Karen, Will, Michael, Pam, Cait, and even Bear were easy to visualize and their personalities were unique. The only complaint I had about the book is the transition from one characters dialog to another, it was hard sometimes to distinguish between Karen's and Will's dialog. But it wasn't a horribly read, by far. It was really intriguing. The twist towards the end was WOW! I don't want to give anything away, so you need to read it for yourself.

$REVIEW.: I'll start off by commending Gospel Assurance and Warnings to pastors, church leaders, and to anyone who wants to effectively communicate the gospel to others
As a matter of fact, I am going to seek permission from the publishers to share copies of Chapter 15 &#34;Gospel Reductionism&#34; with leaders at my church because it challenges us to ask the right questions of potential converts to see if they are really responding to the gospel and not to gimmicks or empty promises.I will caveat my recommendation, however


Washer is responding to a culture of &#34;easy-believism&#34; and smiling preachers who are all too happy to pronounce someone saved and eternally secure because they prayed to &#34;accept&#34; Jesus
He paints with a broad brush and describes modern evangelicals very negatively: &#34;Far too many evangelicals seem content to be ignorant of Scripture&#8217;s teaching, free from its reproof, untouched by its correction, and unshaped by its training.&#34; To some extent he's right, but he risks alienating readers who agree with him by lumping them into this category
It sometimes feels as though he's talking down to his reader, although I am fairly certain that is not his intention.Despite the tone, I stand by my words that this book is a good resource for pastors and church leaders


Its treatment of Bible passages giving assurances and warnings is superb, and the gospel issues at stake are that important


I would only caution church leaders to be diligent in showing compassion because this book is not gentle
As a matter of fact, I would go so far as to say that the author's urgency trumps his compassion, and I would not share it with someone who I honestly believed showed signs of true faith but was struggling with assurance, lest he become discouraged

Yet, for those who are secure in their faith and who have a biblical assurance, this book is extremely helpful by highlighting assurances and warnings we should be communicating with our churches.I received this book from the publisher for the purpose of review.

$review_text.: I was offered the chance to review this book and took up the chance as it has good reviews on various sites and it's fantasy/adventure genre is not too unlike what I normally read.The book follow a mid-level clerk called Carl, who lives in a city of clerks which is protected by the unicorn riders, but through a twist of events ends up with a small unicorn that was meant for his father
This simple beast ends up taking him on adventures over seas and deserts to protect the city he called home


Whilst this sounds like a fairly straight forward story it is set in a varied world with plenty of eclectic characters around every turn which keeps things interesting through the story.Whilst I enjoyed the book and it's characters throughout, the book does tend to jump around a bit which can make things a little confusing, but the main thing that annoyed me was the ending

I've read plenty of book which bad or even sudden endings, but this one just left way too many unanswered questions for my liking.So overall, I did enjoy the book and read it at a good speed thanks to the good pace of events and colourful characters, and despite the ending slightly ruining that, it is well worth the read.The novel was received in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I picked up this Kindle version as a free download
GREAT read! This is my first "western." I really enjoyed the colorful vernacular and descriptions
The inner dialog kept pace with the adventure


The ending had lots of twists and lots of room for more in a continued storyline.ONE thing kept me from giving this book a 5-star rating: grammar


The author (or perhaps his editors) need to learn the difference between "it's" and "its." After a few chapters, I started highlighting all the incorrect uses and other missed corrections
At last count, I have over 100 tallied
I might have expected that from a new, or even self-published author, but Mr

Martin has over 30 books to his name

If all his books have this many errors, I would be hesitant to add more of his books to my bookshelf.

$review_text.: The Dragon Bone Flute is the story of a peasant girl named Elzibeth who loves to play the flute


When her flute is broken by a group of bullies, she painstakingly carves a new one from the bone of a dragon's toe

Soon, she discovers that there is wondrous magic in her music when she plays the flute


Does the magic come from the dragon's bone itself, or from the love and courage Elzibeth pours into making her music? Perhaps both.Overall, this is a charming novella about how the simple magics of music and love can help us overcome our hatreds, fears, and pains

The words of the story resonate with a magic of their own as the ghostly strains of Elzibeth's music spring audibly to life in the reader's mind

The ending is a bit weak, but the story as a whole is well worth the 99-cent price tag.

$review_text.: ** this reviewer owns the audio version of this book **I like books that rework fairy tales into novels. So that was a big factor in my purchasing of this book.  Several years ago I read the bookEastwhich was well written, but had a decent amount of sex, so I wasn't really into reading it again (What can I say I'm old fashioned).  So I was excited to see how Jessica Day George handled the story.Overall it was pretty good. Though I will need to read it again someday in book form because the reader for the audio version was just so monotone I can't decide if that is was made me less than impressed with the story. If you are curious go for it!  Just, don't get the audio version.Violence: none really, you are told about violence, but its in the ... they killed someone sort of way.  No details.Language: noneSex: None really, a man comes and sleeps in her bed at night, but that is all. No sex.  Later in the book there is kissing, but that's it.

$REVIEW.: Stories that come from the grass roots have an appeal for the insights they give into the whole story or  big picture of a place or event in history.  Susan Richards book combines a review of the bigger picture with real stories of people she met and lived with during visits over the years.  Following these people and their travels and ups and downs is a fascinating way to understand what happened when communism collapsed and the free market descended upon the largest country on earth.  I especially appreciated the stories about the religious enclaves that formed of people seeking refuge from the gangsters and politicians who ravaged the country during those years. The spiritual dimension of the change from Soviet to post Soviet life tells a very interesting story and one which ideologues of the world only obscure with their preconceived ideas of how we should all live.  Utopian societies have always provided a way of understanding an era and a place, including the mainstreams from which the utopians fled. The image of people leaving cities to go to the countryside in search of food is a terrifying one and one that may be in all our futures, free market or not.  Thanks to Susan Richards for a fine read. (And we are not related, in spite of the name.)Paul Richards

$REVIEW.: This is just as good as the Care and Keeping of You for younger girls. It goes into a bit more detail and is written at a slightly higher reading level. Some of the information is identical to the other, but it's necessary information so I can see why it was left that way--if a girl didn't have the first book you'd want that info in there. And there's not so much that there's no reason to buy this one if you have the first one.My daughter has both and loves both of them. I love that they are well-written, well thought-out, and age appropriate. The only thing that made me scratch my head was the instructions on how to check for breast cancer. How often do teens need to worry about this? I guess better safe than sorry, but make sure you explain to your daughter that this is very, very rare for young girls.Overall, I definitely recommend this series.

$REVIEW.: This book is fantastic almost all the way until the last act.The story follows the journey of Vladimir from his immigrant childhood to adulthood, forever living under the shadow of his intelligent, demanding and resourceful mother.  He makes his way to a fairy tale, Prague-like city where he eventually falls into the hands of the local gangster Godfather.I felt the natural journey of Vlad would have him becoming more entrenched in gangsterism and thereby losing himself.  The mother also seemed to be a lost thread and suspiciously was admired by all the gangsters in the novel.  What was her secret?The readers will never know.  Instead of letting Vlad fall to the bottom of the barrel, we get an 11th hour, Deus ex Machina save by a Mary Sue girlfriend with a secret.  It struck me that Shteyngart dug himself into a plot that he didn't want to  finish logically, therefore the complete overhaul with the atmosphere sucking love interest.Oh well, up until her miraculous save, the novel is hilarious, witty and highly observant about immigrant culture.

$review_text.: Bug Out: What to Do When It's Time to Get Out of Dodge by M. T. Anderson provides a good overview of consideration to take into account should the time come that you have to leave your primary residence. This is a relatively short book so each topic is briefly covered although, for the most part, the author does a fairly decent job of providing relevant information. This book is geared towards those who are new to creating a bug out bag and planning to bug out. Those who are experienced may still benefit from some of the information on operational risk management (ORM) and operational security (OpSec.) Many books fail to cover these topics. Much of the information covers "what" you need but not necessarily "how" to use the items or to work your plan. Essentially, this book will get you started but you will have further research to conduct.Provides a good overview of:+ Operational Risk Management+ Operational Security+ Situational Awareness+ Comprehensive list of his bug out bag items+ The need to periodically update your bag to replace certain items+ Includes information on pet bug out bags+ Everyday carry items+ Stresses the importance of practicing your bug out plan+ Considerations for bug out locations+ What to do if you find yourself in a combat situationThe section on first aid was a bit thin and lacking.Overall Assessment:Bug Out: What to Do When It's Time to Get Out of Dodge by M. T. Anderson is a well-organized book that covers a variety of essential topics. There is not a lot of depth to each topic because the book is short but it does provide a good starting point. Not a bad book for someone who is new to this topic.

$REVIEW.: This book has so much protenial. If it was a full length novel I think it would would have been so much better. It's one thing when a story is fast-paced, it's a totally different thing when a book is too fast-paced. Everything just went too fast and didn't really give that much of of a back story. Let's take Keylee's past for instance. It mentions her past a few times, but it doesn't really go that much into details.So if A.J. Wiliams slowed the novel down and maybe made it a longer, this book would be worthy of 5 stars.

$review_text.: The first thing that struck me when I started with Fae was that it&#8217;s going to appeal to your Twilight fans. The premise is simple: an ordinary girl gradually discovers that there&#8217;s far more to her past than meets the eye. Enter the new boy and their decidedly tsundere situation. Of course the new boy isn&#8217;t quite human, and there are greater forces at play &#8230; you get my drift.Caroline is likable from the get-go. She&#8217;s that ordinary girl next door. Thank goodness for that. She isn&#8217;t the class reject either. The school&#8217;s new quarterback, however, Devilyn Reilly, falls squarely into Edward Cullen territory. He&#8217;s tall, dark and just so goddamned perfect. And he&#8217;s a Dark Fae who&#8217;s doing his level best not to turn out like his evil father.The attraction between the two is instant, since they&#8217;re puppets to a prophecy that Caroline is heir to the Light and, once wed to Devilyn, they&#8217;ll unify light and dark and end ages of enmity. Of course this has been foretold to tragic consequences, and Devilyn&#8217;s determined to prevent this from taking place while still looking out for his destined mate.Meddling in all of this is Odin, of the Norse pantheon, which left me curious by the end of the story as to what the old guy was doing getting mixed up in Fae affairs. And where were the others, like Freya or Loki. Just curiosity on my part. The authors do a solid bit of world-building and pacing is generally strong.So that&#8217;s pretty much the plot. We&#8217;ve got Light vs. Dark (check); destined mates instaluv (check) and a whole lot of high school hijinks ensue. If this is your thing, you will probably love Fae and overlook its rough edges.But this has to be said. There *are* rough edges, and I&#8217;d be amiss if I didn&#8217;t point them out. Apart from the obvious fondness for the word &#8220;suddenly&#8221; (sorry, this is one of my pet hates), there were some *very* strange things going on with the dialogue&#8217;s punctuation. Once or twice I might&#8217;ve overlooked, but there were consistently bizarre quirks I&#8217;d expect from newish writers. I don&#8217;t know if this was just the version of the novel I was given to review, but nowhere did I see any notification that this was an ARC e-copy. So&#8230; A note to the publisher, if this was the final, and it can be fixed, please do.This being said, this is a fun story, filled with magic, fair folk and hints of a greater mystery, and the series is off to a promising start.

$review_text.: I consider myself an avid vegetable gardener, but I've only had a garden two years so I'm definitely still in the beginner camp. I've been reading a lot about it, but I've learned the most just from talking to other gardeners. My boss has had a huge, successful garden for most of 30 years, and he's taught me the post, and he was teaching me about companion planting before I had ever heard of the term or knew what it meant.This book is really rather basic, doesn't present anything that hasn't been mentioned before, and the drawings/illustrations are so tiny as to be useless (I looked on kindle keyboard & on my kindle nook app, which is in color). If you try to enlarge the screen (which I did) the drawings end up blurry.The only &#34;good&#34; thing about this book is its length - and the reason why I gave this 3 stars. The book is very short, but it makes it very easy for you to find the information you are looking for. If you are about to plant peas, for example, and you can't remember what to plant with it or what not to plant with it, it's easy enough to find that section in the book.The other good thing is the author does talk about what flowering plants are good for your garden - something I attempted to do last year, but all my flowers died, defeating the purpose.

$review_text.: This is the first book in the Masters & Renegades series by Chantal Boudreau.  I was excited to read this, as I love fantasy books - especially when there is magic involved.  I can thank J.K. Rowling for that!  LOL!  The author has a great talent for description.  I loved the detail she put into the different environments and the magic that was used in the book.  Her imagination has no limit.  I also love the idea of the story:  it all takes place in one day, and centers around nine contestants who want to become apprentices at the Magic University.  There are only three seats available; the trials they must go through in the competition are difficult and dangerous.Boudreau did a fantastic job in choosing her characters.  They are all very different in backgrounds, appearances, and beliefs.  However, throughout the competition, they learn that differences do not matter and none of them are perfect.  It is a classic story of how people can change and prejudices can be stripped away if we give each other a chance.My one problem with this story is that I couldn't really connect with the characters.  By the end of the book, I did not have any strong feelings or ties to any of them.  I think the author should have spent more time developing the characters and maybe giving more background on them.  I'm not saying that the characters weren't creative; I think they just needed more substance.  However, this is the first book in the series, so we may learn more about them in later books.All in all, this isn't a bad book.  I liked it, but I wish that the author could have put more into the characters.  It would have been nice to have one or two that I could have rooted for to win the competition.  I do plan on reading in the next in the series.  :)

I think that pretty much reflects real life.  The cops know who, but have no evidence, and they walk free.For those looking for a story that plods along to a conclusion, and I know there are those that do, you can't go wrong with this book.

$REVIEW.: I've been a fan of paranormal (i.e. vampire, werewolf, fae, etc) books for awhile now and this book takes a new and refreshing twist on the more "traditional" themes. The author gives the characters so much depth that you really do sympathize with them and become enthralled in their story. The story line is excellent and well developed, if there had been slightly more development of the various environments it would have made it seem like a movie playing in your head. As it was, it was very easy for my imagination to insert the little details. The feminist in me also loves that the female characters in this book are strong, smart, competent women, not needing a man to bring them their salvation.  Great read! Stayed up all night and immediately got on the web to look up the sequel. Hope it's coming soon!

$review_text.: Quintessentially Q is book 2 in Pepper Winters&#8217; Monsters in the Dark Series. I recommend reading book 1, Tears of Tess since this book is not a stand alone. Tess and Q have been reunited and share an unconventional relationship that not everyone would understand. This read was just as dark as the first one and was dripping with emotion. There was edge, sex and a plot that held you captive to each page. Ms. Winters has a great writing style that allows you to get so lost in the story, it&#8217;s like you are really there with the characters. I really enjoyed reading both books in this series and look forward to reading more from this author.***Author provided ARC in exchange for an honest review***

$REVIEW.: "When do we start?"Give me a minute to change from vanilla guy to kinky guy."Songs of Submission is the whirlwind saga of aspiring singer Monica Faulkner and hotelier and real estate magnate Jonathan Drazen.

Whereas Jonathan is open for no-strings-attached sex, Monica is more looking to focus on her career...In Tease, book 2 Jonathan and Monica have hooked up for some off-the-charts sex and have come to an agreement that since neither is open for a relationship they will just enjoy each other casually...Submit, book 3 is very much a journey for both Jonathan and Monica! Their relationship is evolving and sex is not enough...In Control, book 4, told from alternating POV's both Jonathan and Monica have had some clarity in their relationship and feelings. They continue to explore each other sexually with some mind-blowing sex, but complications ensue...Burn, book 5 has Jonathan and Monica at a roadblock...Jonathan is ready to take their relationship to the next level.  But Monica is holding back, which brings everything to a standstill with Jonathan holding out determined to have all of her.

But before reading I recommend part 5.5, Rachel, a short novella that delves into secrets in Jonathan's past.  Spellbinding storytelling!  Compelling characters!  Scorching sex scenes!

$REVIEW.: If I had to recommend one author that everyone should try, it would be Karina Halle.  Shooting Scars cemented that for me. I was already a huge fan of her writing but Shooting Scars took it to a new level.Shooting Scars doesn't miss a beat from where we left off in Sins & Needles.  Javier has tracked Ellie down and convinced her it is in everyone's best interest for her to go with him.  Leaving Camden alone with an ex-wife and a son who doesn't know him.Ellie falls right back into the life she lead before meeting Camden.  Not that she goes ahead without feelings of guilt or doubt, she does. Quite honestly, maybe for the first time ever.  She struggles to come to grips with the choices she's being forced to make as well as the choices her heart makes.  I really felt for Ellie, more so than I did in Sins & Needles where she came off more cold and hard.  She's evolving as a woman and learning that the consequences of her actions won't only weigh on her alone.  That is a new concept for Ellie, I think, and maybe an important thought to keep in mind through this read. Because she may not always do what you expect or want.  She's walking the border between good and bad, bad is a lot easier to do.Camden also grows exponentially in Shooting Scars.  He's a self proclaimed chump at the beginning but I wouldn't call him the same by the end.  He toughens up.  He has to, as he's really put through the meat grinder. More than once.  He finds a stronger backbone, he realizes it will take more than a 'nice guy' to help Ellie, he finds his own inner psycho.  I kind of really liked it.  But I'm a little sick that way, which brings us to...Javier.  Javier surprisingly, did not surprise me. Almost everything he did was exactly what I would expect from him.  Maybe this means he is the only character to not have grown.  He's changed, yes.  Grown?  Hmm, I don't think so. But maybe that is only because he's already determined who and what he is, he's accepted himself.  Faults and all, and he has plenty of those. Even without growth,  I'm no less a fan and had a few swoon worthy moments with my favorite psycho-murdering-drug-lord.  Yes, I swooned.  At some probably very creepy and inappropriate things. Like I said, I'm a little sick that way.I had no idea what Halle had in store for us going in to Shooting Scars, other than more amazingly well developed characters in crazy situations.  Which she wholeheartedly delivered.  Yet, it far outreached anything I could have imagined.  Shooting scars is dark and disturbing, passionate and provocative, riveting and romantic.  And the end...wow.  Really, just wow.  I could not have imagined a better way for this to end, my anticipation level for Bold Tricks, due in the fall, is very high.*copy provided by publisher for honest review*

I really liked the way it flowed


Very fast paced and tons of action
Lots of good romance and a good steamy flavor to it too.Mason actually surprised me

Just when I thought I had him figured out, Braeburn did some twists and turns that left me guessing! He seemed kinda soft at first but then WOW was he ever protective.I think this book has reawakened my appetite for some suspense
My only complaint is that it could've been a little longer

But I guess we'll see more down the road because this is a series.Bravo, well done, and hope to read more from your world!

She lives in Tuscon AZ with her mother
She plays a game called War Quest and there are some interesting players, one in particular named Arion


Arion and Angel become very close and they talk every day

Arion knows EVERYTHING about her, but she knows he will always be a fantasy.Tess works at Thanks A Latte Cafe and has many friends there


One night while she is working she notices a guy named Nick
Sooner than later, Nick asks her out and she says yes because, she wants something real
They date, get close, and after a while, they move in together
Nick becomes a super jealous, abusive boyfriend out of no where

In one day Tess gains freedom but loses everything and runs because she is scared for her life!! How can one small move change everything so fast?Arion is better known as Axel and is a very successful business owner in Philly

He's also a big gamer and fell for a character named Angel
They spoke everyday and all of a sudden she has disappeared
Just like his mother when he was five

It's been forever since she's been online and he's been a mess over it


Until one day she shows up on his door step out of no where
Drenched and a complete mess he takes her in and tries to help her get her life back
What is she running from? Can he save her like she needs him too? Will her fantasies of him come true?I loved this book because Angel is a hopeful romantic that falls for a real person that hurts her terribly and one that is a fantasy in a game that knows all of her
It's a story that every lonely gamer hopes for, but it's not ALL about gaming

I'm not a gamer and I loved this book

There's mystery, suspense, love, sadness, happiness, and anger


I love when a book can make me feel all these emotions


I fell in love with Arion and his love for Angel because he stops at nothing to keep her safe


This really is a great, quick read!! I could not put it down
FIVE STARS!!!!

$REVIEW.: The title describes this book well. It is a great beginner book for people considering fermenting food or drink for health or hobby. Several benefits of fermenting are discussed showing many ways this process increases a person&#8217;s overall health. The book also discusses the traditional side of fermenting from a survival stand point many years ago to how this process has been developed and is still used currently. A detailed but easy to understand overview is given about the entire fermentation process, how to maneuver through the process and products that can be used for the process. Instructions and tools needed are provided on how to start your own home lab for fermenting and after all of that great information a cookbook is included with several recipes for you to start trying out on your own!

$REVIEW.: Helene Berr - an assimilated French Jew - started writing a journal during the German occupation in April 1942 when she was 21 years old. Her family was well-to-do and she studied at the Sorbonne. She was intelligent, cultured, and sensitive, had many friends, and loved life.For a time her life under the Germans remained fairly normal. She continued to visit friends and the family's summer place in the country, read English literature, and played violin at small recitals. She fell in love with a young man and wrote of her passion for nature and poetry.Things started to change for her when Jews were ordered to wear the yellow star. She began to feel different from other people and thought about fleeing to the south of France where it was supposedly safer for Jews. However, she couldn't bring herself to act in what she considered a "cowardly" way and decided to remain in Paris.She wrote about the roundups of Jews and their transfer to transit camps like Gurs and Drancy - and from there, somewhere to the east. Many of her friends were snatched off the streets and deported with no notice whatsoever. At this point she helped out at a Jewish aid organization, taking orphaned children for nature walks and working at the group's headquarters - until the Germans closed it and the children were deported.Her last entry in February 1944 reads: "Horror. Horror. Horror." She was deported and sent to Auschwitz and later to Bergen-Belsen. By chance, Anne Frank, the famous diary writer, was there at the same time. Helene contracted typhus (also like Anne) and died after a beating a few days before the camp was liberated.Helene Berr's journal is unique and moving and deserves to be widely read. Her voice sounds almost contemporary and in the first part of the book she writes often and intensely of her ideals, loves, and hopes for the future. Later, after the raids begin, her entries are about helping the children and watching her friends disappear. Her journal shows what it was like for French Jews under the Nazis - something less written about than the killing fields in Poland - from the gradual erosion of civil rights to street arrests and final deportation to an unknown, tragic destination.

After all, I was supposed to be unlearning, which I took to mean throwing away what I had learned. What I got were re-interpretations, alternative perspectives, and suggestions for bending the "rules" instead of fixating on them.WHO IS IT FOR?---------------------Although beginners will surely find a great deal of value and interest in here, it is geared more towards those who have tried meditation techniques and, for one reason or another, found them difficult to continue, or unrewarding. I suppose that pretty much includes everyone who has ever tried meditating :) The writing is generally pretty clear, though there are sections that will be a little easier to grasp quickly if you have read other books on meditation, such asZen Mind, Beginner's Mind (Shambhala Library)(one of my favorites). My feeling is that in some places the author was writing with books like this in mind.WHAT'S THE MESSAGE?---------------------Don't be a slave to the system. It's OK if you don't get much out of following your breath (or whatever practice you are having trouble with). You are not failing at it. He stresses that the meditation practices are there for you, and if they don't suit you, don't keep trying harder and harder to follow the "rules" and get it "right." Try another approach. What I took away from this book is the message that I should trust myself to adapt the practices to suit me.SUMMARY---------------------I highly recommend this to those who want to re-invigorate their practice, and dare I say, his advice is applicable to the "rules" and "instructions" we encounter anywhere in our lives.

$REVIEW.: Although this is not an authoritative tract on the impact of popular culture on the intelligence of the people of today, it is well-written.First, let me admit that I walked in expecting to find this drivel


The fact that I can give it more than 2 stars argues that it was well done.Second, let me say that his pulling of examples was interesting, to say the least
I don't think that it is necessarily accurate to call Seinfeld one of the wittiest comedies on TV and to call Frasier stupid

In my mind they are not that different.However, he convincingly makes the point that children and adults today navigate a much denser stream of media than they did fifty years ago


Whether this actually means that they are smarter is, I think, still up for debate


The fact is that we are exposed to more than they were
His mentioning of the Feynmann Effect does tend to support his theory.There are problems with the book, though
First, he assumes that the ability to navigate complex streams of information are indicative of greater intelligence, which may or may not be true, and is certainly never argued for
The fact that he assumes it such is rather damaging to his thesis.Second, the fact remains that regardless of whether IQ is going up, the amount of information in the world is going up so much faster

He addresses the content of pop culture, but I think that he bases his expectations far, far too low
Instead of merely asking whether it is more complex than it had been, the question ought to be whether it is teaching as much as it can


he mentions CSI and ER in this novel, but never mentions the fact that people who watch the show assume that they then know something about medicine and criminology.The fact is that this book argues convincingly that people are interested in learning
I think that it does itself a disservice by not pointing out that this is likely due to the instinctive human drive to know more than others, as this is as useful today as being stronger was eight thousand years ago, and it leads to a powerful force in humans.Nevertheless, he gives media too much credit
The question ought not be: Is it good or bad? When we have to ask that question, we have already lost
The question ought to be: Is it as good as it could be? If the answer to THAT question is no, then we need to find out why.Is our current programming teaching us as much as it could be? Why not?In short, it is definitely worth reading
I bought it and read it in an evening, so it clearly isn't that long

It is worthwhile, and it is worth lending, so it is probably worth owning if you are a person to whom others look for book recommendations


Otherwise, Library it.Harkius

$REVIEW.: Occasionally I read a book and I find myself having to take a time out after I finish it because I just can&#8217;t get my head around everything I&#8217;ve just read and images and thoughts won&#8217;t stop spinning through my head

&#8216;Strain&#8217; is one of those books


Although there was some time between finishing the story and going to bed last night, I found myself dreaming about this book; the characters and the world they inhabit were the first thing on my mind the one or two times I woke up

And one question wouldn&#8217;t and still hasn&#8217;t left my mind; how far would I be willing to go to save my own life, or to try saving someone else&#8217;s.I should probably begin this book with a warning

This is not an easy or light read, quite the opposite in fact

This is also a book that could easily offend and/or shock a lot of readers
Ultimately though this is a very powerful and memorable story; one I&#8217;m very glad to have read and one that will probably continue to play in my mind for a few more nights at least.The world &#8216;Strain&#8217; is set in is a horrible place

A lethal and very contagious virus has killed most humans and is still being spread by &#8216;Revenants&#8217;; infected humans who have turned into monsters driven to kill the remaining uninfected population
Contact with a Revenant is a death sentence; if they don&#8217;t kill you on the spot they will infect you and seal your fate.When 19 year old Rhys Cooper sacrifices himself in the hope of protecting others he survives his encounter with the Revenants only because a troupe of &#8216;super-human&#8217; soldiers arrives in time to kill them
Survival isn&#8217;t necessarily a blessing though; those Rhys was trying to protect have died anyway, his arch-enemy and bane of his young life, Jacob, is the only other survivor and both of them have almost certainly been infected with the virus that will turn them into Revenants before killing them.The soldiers offer both Rhys and Jacob a slim hope of survival
It is possible that the virus can be counteracted if they manage to get infected with another strain; a strain the soldiers carry


The only sure way to get infected though is through frequent sexual contact with as many of the soldiers as possible.Darius Murrell is the 43 old leader of the squadron of soldiers who rescued the two men and is determined to save them

He&#8217;s spent his life fighting and killing to protect the remaining uninfected humans and would do anything to ensure he won&#8217;t have to put a bullet in Rhys&#8217; head once the plague sets in.It is difficult for Rhys though


While he doesn&#8217;t want to die and is interested in men, he has huge issues dealing with the multiple partners he needs to have in order to optimise his chances of immunity


Sex with Darius is something he, reluctantly, enjoys


With anybody else he can barely make himself endure it, putting Darius in a position where he has to force the young man to have sex if he wants to save him.&#8220;Look, far as I&#8217;m concerned, only thing evil about sex is rape

Now, that puts us in a real gray area but I&#8217;m trying to avoid it.&#8221; - DariusDarius and Rhys may be discovering feelings for each other; it is an impossible situation for both
Darius can&#8217;t afford that get attached to a man he may have to kill and Rhys is at best a reluctant participant in his own rescue.I have to admit this was, at times, a very difficult read for me


Reading about Rhys, his insecurities, fears and shame at having to be intimate with all these men who, as far as he can tell, are only with him out of a sense of duty, was heartbreaking


In fact, the only thing that prevented this book from turning into a very dark story about institutionalised rape was the fact that the soldiers volunteering their services to Rhys grow ever more reluctant to do so as his distaste for the act becomes more obvious.&#8220;I fought it for a long time because I didn&#8217;t want the only sex I ever had before I died to not mean anything, especially when it was already something I didn&#8217;t have a choice in

Then it didn&#8217;t feel meaningless anymore, and it was okay

Better than okay.&#8221; &#8211; RhysDespite appearances earlier on in this story, this isn&#8217;t &#8216;just&#8217; a book about sex
Nor is the story-line an excuse to introduce as many sex-scenes as possible


Ultimately this is a story about love, finding it under the most unlikely of circumstances and the things we are willing to do and endure for those we love

It is also a book about what it means to be human and how to hang on to that humanity even when the world around you doesn&#8217;t appear to have room for &#8216;luxuries&#8217; like that.&#8220;Knowing people like you exist, people who won&#8217;t lie or kill or whore themselves out for another day of pointless breathing, people who actually believe in something &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just yourself and what you know is right &#8211; it makes it worth it, boy.&#8221;This story broke my heart, forced me to look away in horror but ultimately made me rejoice because of the sheer beauty of it


It was a joy to watch Rhys as he tried to hang on the things he valued

I lost myself in his journey from scared boy to sensible young man

And I may just have fallen in love with Darius, the tough soldier who turns out to have very deep feelings despite his job and the things it forces him to do.I have to applaud the author for releasing a book with a story-line that was likely to find as many detractors as fans
I&#8217;m in awe that Amelia C
Gormley managed to put this much beauty in what was for all intents and purposes a horrific story, and find myself deeply grateful for having found a tale that will linger for a long time to come.&#8220;None of us have much worth holding on to, which makes us hold on even tighter to what we can.&#8221;

$review_text.: I Exalt You, O God by Jerry Bridges is a one month devotional book.  It was wonderful!  Whether you are new to Christianity and learning about worship or have been a Christian for many years, you will learn more about how/why to worship God not only in a group setting (like church) but also when you are by yourself (and why you should be doing both).  There were a mix of thoughts, Bible verses, and paraphrases of Bible verses.  One caveat is that a few days were longer than others so don't expect each day to be exactly the same length.I received a Kindle copy free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group. I would recommend having a hardback copy at home to refer to and a Kindle copy for occasional travel.  I was not required to write a positive review.  The opinions I have expressed are my own.

It definitely made me pause before I ate a couple of slices of pepperoni pizza


To be honest, the fact that I still found myself pausing about my eating actions is a definite plus in my book
This book is highly informative albeit bias because of its obvious extensive research on the benefits of a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle but lack of the potential cautions of becoming a vegetarian while the book contained extensive reviews and quotes of why red meat and meat in general is the devil.In essence, if you are truly becoming a vegan or a vegetarian, then you have made the right choice in picking up this book

This book is truly informative for vegetarians, and even if you are an advanced vegan, you will still come across new recipes and new facts that may have eluded you before you found this text
Easy and drawing reading and definitely a book that will hold your attention and make you reconsider your position as an omnivore or in my case, a carnivore.

$review_text.: Radical a decent read if you can overlook (or maybe just understand) the constant references to the American Dream and to American Christianity

I'm sure it will cause some questions to rattle around in your head.I appreciated the tone of the book


 While one may expect an author on such a subject to come across as condescending and acting like "I'm doing it right, you're not", I found Platt's wording to be very honest
 From what he writes he seems to wrestle too with how to live this out on a daily basis as an individual, and with his own church.While the challenge at the end of the book to take up a year long "experiment" seems a little gimmicky, you can't argue the fact that if you committed the next year to praying for the world, reading the Bible, sacrificing your finances, spending time in other parts of the world, and committing yourself to a multiplying church community, your life would likely take some significant directional changes for years to come.I just wonder how many are actually willing to embark on such a journey.

Cole delivered.I did not read the first Jake Crosby book but plan on ordering it soon as I was a little bit lost at first reading Moon Underfoot
 It referred back a lot to the first book and almost stopped reading it because I felt I needed to know the history of Jake Crosby and Moon Pie


 But I kept on reading and I am glad I did as the small gaps were filled in along the storyline of the book

 By the time I got to the end, I knew what had happened in the first book.But the storyline is really, really good, with lots of action, suspense and thrills and keeps you reading

 The reason for the 4 stars is the referencing of the first book in Moon Underfoot


 Not a big deal as you find out eventually the happenings of the other book, but it would help to read it first and I just wish I had known about the first book before reading this one.Would I refer this book to others to read?  Absolutely!! It's a great read.

$REVIEW.: I have to say, I am so glad I found this author. Her books are sexy, stimulating, and take the reader on an incredible journey. In this follow up to Rebel yells, we are taken on a journey the likes of which I don't find very often in a book. This book grabbed me from the beginning, and I could not rest until I got to the end.Lonnie has been heart broken because the man he was infatuated with had fallen in love with someone else. Lonnie is a slender, beautiful native american who has had a very challenging life. Nothing has come easily for Lonnie. His mother was dead and his father and Uncle Channing were drowning in the same alcohol that had nearly gotten Lonnie killed. He was still struggling with his addiction and he did not know what to do.Travis has finally accepted that he is gay. He longs to find someone who can love him despite his wealth, and he feels the pull to the BDSM world as a Dom. He has struggled with accepting his new place in the world, and he finds himself drawn to Lonnie, but unsure as how his new found dominance can work in a relationship with Lonnie. After getting thrown out of the BDSM club for a failing attitude, Master Lin urges him to find someone he cares about to explore whether or not he can be trusted in the club. When he comes to care so much about Lonnie, Master Lin begins his training.Not everyone is accepting of the lifestyle lived by the Sheriff and the Deputy. Roark wants to be the Sheriff, and Travis's father wants to be Councilman so they can railroad through a resort that will destroy the towns atmosphere. How far either one of them will go to reach their goals is anyone's guess, but when push comes to shove, will love be able to conquer the hatred of those things not understood? How hard can these men fight to feel the freedom to live their lives? Can Travis and the town rally against the threats facing them? How far will the bad guys go to achieve their desires? We know Roark is not one of the good guys, but how much evil is lurking under the surface? Where will Lack and Rebel's love take them now that they are moving on with their lives? Can Travis stand up to his powerful dad? All the excitement of Rebel Yells is raised to new heights in this book. Just when I thought I had seen all this story had to offer, a whole new twist was thrown in. Grab your Kleenex again, because this book will take your emotions for a roller coaster ride and back again. I couldn't help but fall in love with these characters. This is a fabulous book and I cannot wait to see what happens next!

$review_text.: The author relies a lot on secondary sources, but he interweaves the account with his memory of the Convention when he was a boy of 13, and this adds a neat twist to the story.  One learns things which were never mentioned in those 1940 days, such as that Senator Vandenberg, who was a laid-back candidate for the Republican nomination in 1940, had as his mistress Mitzi Sims, the wife of the British military attache.  And that Willkie's mistress had to be out of his life during the campaign and instead for Willkie's wife to ride the campaign train with him--causing said wife to remark:  "Politics makes strange bedfellows."  The author's thesis, set out as the subtitle of the book, seems to be true.  It is amazing that the Convention nominated Willkie, even though he was a Democrat till 1939 and had attended the Democratic Conventions in 1924 and 1932.  But it is fascinating to read this popular account of the good old days when a national political convention had meaning and excitement.

$review_text.: I have been following this author ever since I came across her book Twenty Weeks. Though I haven't had the chance to read any of her books before, the blurbs always indicate that the premise of the books to be something different. So when she approached me to read and review Finding Forever, I jumped up at the chance.When Morgan Masters jumps off a cliff, she is caught somewhere in between. When she meets Ben, her `life' takes a turn towards something that she has always craved for. But the thing is - she cannot stay in Ben's arm forever as she is brought back to her real life with the douchebag James. With a past that rather remain forgotten, Morgan now can barely settle back into her life. With her heart stuck on Ben - someone know one around her seems to know - her life can never be the same. Will she ever find Ben again? Will she ever feel whole and happy again?Okay, so I just reread the above portion and that hardly makes sense - just like the blurb of the story. Melissa M. Hamling has managed to create such a different premise that it is impossible to give you a clear picture without giving out a spoiler. Let's just accept that you have to take my word for it when I say that this book has a Different, yes - with a capital D, kind of a setting on the whole. Though meant to be more of a Romance than a Mystery novel, this book will keep you theorizing about everything and being proved wrong every single time.As for the characters, Morgan is a protagonist who is meant to stand out. She is a strong one. Throughout the book, you'll find out more about her struggles and will not be able to help but admire her fighting spirits. Even though there are moments when you feel that `what the hell was she thinking?', overall she comes out as a winner. James is a character you will love to hate from the moment he makes his first appearance and opens his mouth! And what do I say about Ben and Danny - they are characters that really make a girl's heart melt.Bringing together the characters and the plot together is Melissa's very simple yet sweet style of writing that will keep you glued to the pages. I loved it!

$review_text.: I wasn't sure of this book when I got it, but once I started reading it, it was a fun, interesting read.  Written very well. I think this is the third book in the Pampered Pets Mysteries series.  I have not read the others but I intend to do so.  In this book, our main character is Caro Lamont, a pet therapist. She is at odds with her cousin Melinda Langston who owns the Bow Wow Boutique over a brooch that her grandmother left to her favorite granddaughter, okay, which one is it, Caro or Melinda? As they steal it back and forth from each other, Caro's neighbor is in a car accident, Murder!  She owns two cats who paint and have their own art show!  Cats that paint?  Who knew.  Now with Kitty dead, her sister shows up and wont ever be able to meet her estranged sister.  She has now moved into Kittys home, next door to Caro, and things start happening.  Kittys sister proceeds to buy a big old cadillac from the mob, unbeknownst to her, and luckily for them, its armor plated! When the bullets fly, they are protected.  Now they will have to work together to find Kittys killer, and when the two cats are kidnapped, it gets worse!

$review_text.: This is a different take on a post-apocalypse novel.  This one begins many years (maybe centuries - it's never revealed) after most of humanity is wiped from the earth.  Humans have lost everything and are again becoming hunter-gatherers in tribes but always facing a threat from those who only want to take what others have collected.  I loved the names the people are given, a clue that there's been a long lore trail left from the time of the mass destruction.Along comes the main character, and I'll leave it up to you, the reader, to find out why she has survived for so long.  She is found and becomes part of a tribe and leads them to a place she has always dreamed of where we begin to see....well, you'll just have to read the book to find out what happens.I loved the characters and although I think it slowed in some areas, the story kept my interest enough to finish it and find out what happens.  I did find a number of misused words that passed a spell-check but didn't fit the sentence or were misspelled but still matched another word.  Detailed editing would have helped here and there were clusters where these popped up.Overall, I found it an interesting and satisfying read.

$REVIEW.: Pastor Cares did an admirable job of not only outlining the Mormon faith, but also giving practical strategies for witnessing to them

&quot;Speaking the Truth in Love to Mormons&quot; is written in a very Gospel-orientated  tone (something that is many times lacking in Christian books on the LDS  church).If you have a Mormon friend or neighbor, and are in need of a  starting point to talk to them about Christianity, this very affordable  book will not disappoint you.

$REVIEW.: Ms

Bliss takes the reader on an entertaining adventure with Michael and Mia


You fall in love with the characters and at the same time laugh at their antics
Michael is one of the hottest characters because not only is he sexy as hell but has a heart of gold
Especially when it comes to Mia.The two best characters, other than Michael, would have to be Mrs

Gallo and Tammy
Mrs
Gallo because of her straight forward way of talking to her children

Plus she has grandbabies on the brain all the time
Tammy, well you would expect to hate her because she is the supposed &#34;villain&#34;


But Tammy is coo coo crazy in a funny way and you end up laughing at most of the things she does.My overall thoughts of this book are that it lives up to it's predecessor
The Men of Inked is an awesome series and I look forward to reading more books


I highly recommend this one but only to readers that are 18+ due to HOT and STEAMY scenes
;)I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: I won't go into detail or put any spoilers in my review. I bought all three of the Dragonfury Series at once and quickly read through all three, then went to find more books by Coreen Callahan.  These books are great for a fun fast paced read when you want to escape reality and enter a world of hot men and women who are not just damsels in distress but women of substance who are interesting on their own.  In fact I think I found some of the female characters more interesting than some of the men.  You do have to suspend some of your belief when it comes to some of the  because it is fantasy and in fantasy land Dragons can destroy a major city in a way that would never happen in real life.  I do have one minor gripe, I happen to have grown up where the stories take place (Greater Seattle/The Puget Sound) and every once in a while I will find something that isn't exactly accurate, regardless I don't read to ensure that every detail in a book is perfect, I read to enjoy and I found these books quite enjoyable.

$review_text.: This is the fourteenth Dick Hardesty mystery. I've eagerly and anxiously awaited each. Reviewing these stories gives me a dilemma however. On the one hand I feel a duty to read the book quickly so I can return my review, on the other I want to savour each chapter, maybe reread passages so I can be sure I don't miss anything. And on the third hand (yeah, I know) I want to read it all from cover to cover as quickly as possible so I can see whodunit.Victor Koseva, a neat-freak of an investigative journalist who had the misfortune to be born into a particularly unpleasant family, and also to have ruffled feathers in his investigating of a labour union and a boxing promoter, falls to his death from a hill path. Most people think that's all it was, a fall, but his sister-in-law thinks otherwise and asks Dick Hardesty to investigate.I love the occasional slight breaking of the fourth wall that Grey occasionally indulges in. At one point Dick is exasperated at the case and thinks, "It's the same kind of frustration I get when the author of a mystery novel drops a hint, all but puts up a flashing arrow saying "Clue!" and then never mentions it again." Grey doesn't do that to his readers.I love the fact that these stories are set some time in the `80s. The mentioning of products such as Sony's Walkman brings back wonderful memories. How quaint we think of the items now, but at the time they were state of the art.  I'm sure Dick's work would be made much easier by the use of cell phones, but, alas, no, he'll have to wait a few years before that technology comes along.We're told that Max, one of the minor characters, has got a job in the World Trade Center. I wonder if this will figure in a later story when 9/11 comes around?"Sitting together on the couch, watching the movie with Joshua, who was holding a large bowl of popcorn and wedged between Jonathan and me, I had a mental image of us as the kind of painting a gay Norman Rockwell might have done for a Saturday Evening Post cover." I couldn't agree more. I love these stories, the mystery elements are enticing and keep me turning the pages, but it's the scenes of settled domesticity that warm my heart and make me smile.One thing I've noticed about the unnamed city where Dick lives is the seemingly endless number of bars and eating establishments. Each story seems to bring up a whole new crop of them.  I'm left wondering if the residents are all overweight as a result.I sort of guessed who the bad guy was this time, however, I had no firm basis for my thoughts, and was kinda surprised when he was revealed. As usual, once this happened, the clues--that were there all along--fell into place, leaving me thinking, "of course!"So Dorien Grey can put another volume of published work on his bookshelf. Here's hoping he has lots more books to write and plenty of shelves on which to put them.

$REVIEW.: I loved this book. It was an Amazon recommends and on a whim I gave it a go. I read one review that said it was too much like Dashiell Hammett, as if this was a bad thing. Obviously, if you don't want a hard boiled crime noir this may not be the book for you.I am an archaeologist, studied Latin and ancient history as well, also an amateur Roman Britain buff. The historical details contained in this book are really the icing on the historical crime noir cake. The feel of Roman Britain Londinium was well built up. I especially liked the social aspects, slavery, interaction of celts and romans, and the whole roman world generally.I also came from the Falco series wanting some more Roman crime goodness, eight books in and a little worn out. This was a lovely break and I can't wait to read the next in the series.

$REVIEW.: Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Simply Jesus, no one else. Strip away church rules, self-centered prayers, fatalism, religious fanaticism, and rediscover Jesus Christ and the love for Him. Joseph M. Stowell shows how believers' lives will be changes if they'd be in His presence, more than the presidential vist Stowell once paid. Experience the power and perspective when you're put on a fencepost by God. Gain Christ, just as Paul prayed for his fellow Christians. Surrender yourself and know God will be there too when you suffer or are seduced or  wrestle with difficult questions. It takes some attitude shifts: rejoice in the Lord and value Jesus above everything.Though packed with quotes from the Bible, the book reads easily. Stowell definitely knows how to package a simple, but powerful message in a booklet.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience a personal and close relationship with Jesus Christ.

$REVIEW.: REVIEW:CHAOS THEORIES is a suspense thriller filled with non-stop suspense.  This novel is hard to put down.CHAOS THEORIES deals with how the smallest action can impact systems in time. A major character, Allen Williams has a anger problem; although he tries to keep it in check and out of sight. He is a computer genius with an advanced degree. He marries a woman with mind gifts.  They have a daughter and she has the most potential of anyone ever born.  His behavior and his life are completely changed when he drinks a glass of water that has been polluted by chemicals..  He now is on a path of human destruction., The author, Mr. Banks is an incredible writer and storyteller..  He keeps the reader guessing about how the actions of the characters will affect the ending of the story. If you are offended by bad language, violence and cruel sex scenes, you may not want to read this.I enjoyed this book which I feel the author put in so much of his knowledge so it was interesting by many. You get a guy who meets a girl and falls in love. Then there is a lesson in philosophy,and  a science fiction story,The author is very  knowledgable about a lot of different issues, time travel, the minds of criminals, law enforcement and much more.  The only fault I found was a few editing errors.  This is a good book, well written with a knowledgable base and give you lots to think about.  In your next book buying trip, pick it up and enjoy.I would give this book a 4 STARS.I received a complimentary copy of CHAOS THEORIES from the author Stephen H.

Dundee brings a fresh dose of humanity to Western pulp

This hardboiled tale of justice gone wrong takes what could easily be a black and white revenge story and puts you smack in the middle of a living frontier town where the characters are as big and detailed as the Toadstool badlands where much of the action is set


Lone McGantry is a laconic and admirable hero, with as much character as his worn Colt
Even the baddest of characters we run into has their reasons, and when their desires cross, tempers flare and guns are drawn
Don't let the opener fool you- this is no courtdroom drama, and Dundee leads us on a rousing chase for the truth as Lone gets tangled in a web of small town deceit.

$review_text.: Netherworld by award-winning novelist Lisa Morton is the first book in the Chronicles of Diana Furnaval series
Diana and her husband William are locked in the classic battle of good vs

evil throughout this novel


The story begins in England October 31, 1879
Diana is an extraordinary woman, risking her life to save mankind from demons, evil spirits and specters that are entering the world through gateways from the Netherworld.It was the Furnavals' mission in life to close all of the gateways in the world
Using incantations from &#8220;The Book of Gateways, Conjurations and Banishments&#8221;, as well as various herbs, knives, and human blood, she and William fought evil without regard for themselves

William traveled to Transylvania to close a gateway, but returned to England in a coffin

Distraught, Diana searches for answers but finds herself questioning William&#8217;s apparent death.She travels, in an era where women did not venture out alone, to dangerous parts of the world


Her husband&#8217;s fortune and her steely determination take her to Europe, China, the United States and back to England, closing gateways
All the while, she is looking for her husband


If William is indeed caught in an evil place between earth and the Netherworld she is willing to do anything to save him.Morton is a masterful storyteller

Customs and traditions accompany the page-turning, heart-stopping terror Diana finds herself facing at every turn

The story is rich in culture and creatures, a mix that works well to keep you reading well into the night.The second book in the Chronicles of Diana Furnaval is scheduled for release in 2015, the third in 2017 per her website [...]

Definitely needs to be read by anyone who read the other three books.I also love the new characters that she brought into the fold, and the glimpse of new Calhills and McCormick babies

Hope to read more of this fantastic series soon. Cameo Renae has a imagination straight out of the movies. My favorite kind of writer. Her details of Alaskan settings are inspiring, and her vision of the Underworld is fun and exciting.Spread the word on this fantastic series.

I hate mornings, I am not productive in the morning, and I hate the idea of waking up before the sun. This is a great read to learn what your morning COULD be, with a little self-discipline, or in my case - a brass band wake-up call at 5a.m.

$review_text.: London, 1817It's time for another meeting of the BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)

$REVIEW.: Bizarro Comics presents a mixed bag of stories featuring DC's most famous characters, as portrayed by a stellar array of alternative comic's best Writers &amp; Artists. Unfortunately, most of the stories aren't up to snuff.The good first: Artist Stephan DeStephano's Bizarro is soooo freakin' weird, I just couldn't stop chuckling every time he appeared. And he appeared a LOT, but more on that later. Writer Chris Duffy gives Bizarro such a freaky speech pattern that the laugh quotient is high, at least in the framing story....As for the shorter stories, Wonder Girl Vs. Wonder Tot was adorable, The Silence of the Fishes and The Man Who Cried Fish (Both starring Aquaman) were hilarious, the Batcave story was touching, and the Sidekicks trying to start their own Super-Team was weird and wild. The coloring and production values in all of the stories were GREAT, and DC really serves up a georgeous package at a reasonable price. There's a lotta bang for your buck...Now the bad: Some of the stories were just plain stupid (The Wonder Woman goes shopping story), and others were amateurish (Hawkman saving a kidnapped egg...), and the framing story, while funny and enjoyable, is WAAAYYYY TOOO LOOOONGGG!!! It's over 80 pages by itself. Why?? And why is Matt Groening taking credit for the cover that was clearly drawn by Bill Morrison?Overall, it's a beautiful book, with a few very good stories, and I'll recommend it for those reasons.

I was so lost in the love story that I didn't see the plot unfolding before my eyes until 3/4 of the way into the book. After thinking on it the clues were all there but I was too in love wit Naz and Karissa to process it. Naz is the perfect bad boy that you can't help but love. I can't wait for Torture in her Soul to come out.

$REVIEW.: At 142 pages, this was a fast reading book and a pleasure to read.  It definitely reminds us what the real reason for the season is and how one particular Santa perceives and receives his guests those precious and ever busy days prior to Christmas.  It was definitely  a reminder of many philosophies, like don't force your babies to sit on Santa's lap if they are frightened and not rewarding bad behavior with treats in exchange for behaving well, or smiling for the camera.  I have a whole new perspective now about Santa and his duties and how I may be perceived as a Grandmother taking my little darlings to see him.  It's a two way street there and my worries about Christmas and the holiday frenzy would be best buried for a visit to the man in red!....A Charming read.

$REVIEW.: A very unique way of presenting baseball stats and trivia


The graphs are visually attractive, stimulating and thought provoking

A+ for creative data presentation, and a must have for baseball fanatics

However, adult language in the essays sadly renders this not suitable for young kids (but your family standards might vary), which is a shame as there are many kids who are crazy about baseball and would love the statistical trivia presented


A good effort and unique book though.

I see it's typo'd on the tag lines too though...hmmmm. Well, in spite of that annoying factor and a few other typos that irritated, the story itself is quite interesting, got a bit gruesome, and has a really interesting bit of Fairy world ideas. The ending felt rushed, but over all I enjoyed this crazy world that Sophia (not Sofa) lives in.Addendum: I see they fixed the name typo on Amazon, but it's not fixed on other sites, FYI.

I read an article somewhere that mentioned smoothies being more healthy than juicing, because you are using the whole fruit and/or vegetable. It makes sense, so I did more research on the subject. I was presently surprised. So, I got this book and decided to give it a try. I'm trying to lose a few pounds, so I've been making smoothies in the morning for a healthy breakfast, and I've been adding protein powder and greens powder. Wow, I have never felt better!

$review_text.: This was a fantastic read!!! Bottom line the author gave me a great read and I loved it


The plot is believable
Jack and Victoria have great chemistry and I'm looking forward to reading book two.The book ended on a cliffhanger, but that made it that much better

There aren't that many books that I've read lately that were concluded or wrapped up in one story except those distributed via mass market distribution such as those written under Harlequin

 True readers know how to adapt to different writing styles,  genres, and storylines


Branch out people and stop being so critical of writers

I see no logical reason to say how much you loved the story and then give it a 1 or 2 star review because it was a cliffhanger


Reviews are opinions and everyone is entitled to them, but think before you write
So glad I don't base my purchases off others!!Great job Phoenix Daniels and I am anxiously waiting book 2 and I'll spread the word about your book

 5 stars & highly recommended!!!Tasha ~Divas of the Serengeti Book Club~

$REVIEW.: This book was excellent! It touched on issues that can affect families such as lies, suicide, molestation, guilt, and adultery. While some of the characters are religious, others have a strong relationship with Jesus Christ. Because of Jesus Christ, the family is able to deal with their issues and the overcome the obstacles that threaten to destroy many families.

$REVIEW.: Most short story collections include more than three stories, giving a much broader spectrum of an author's abilities, but Groat manages to show a wide range of writing voices and tones within three very succinct and well crafted stories. "A Most Contemptible Whisper" displays the emotional depth of loss and personal pain that a person can go through, and while the reader is expecting the story to continue in a predictable manner, but the twist at the end is both unexpected and shocking - the perfect way for a short story to end, leaving us questioning everything that we'd read to that point. Unpredictable narrators are difficult to write, but fascinating to read. In a completely different style, "The Cover Carver" is much more nostalgic and reflective of a strange and potentially misspent life. Finally, we meet another Blaylock brother in the pool hall, which has yet another completely different tone than the other stories, grittier and more real, more accessible somehow, but perhaps that one just appealed to my personality.To wrap one family into three such different stories allows the reader to begin identifying with the various elements of the family, but also recognizing the individuality of each member. I've never read anything else by this author, but I hope that he continues creating short stories that engage and intrigue. Whether this is reflective of his own family life or not is unknown, but the sort of depth and insight that he gives to the nature of their complicated relationships kept me interested from start to finish. I'm a short story lover, and this short collection nailed it. Moving and thought-provoking prose about the complexities of family that all of us can identify with in some way.

$REVIEW.: This may be considered 'spoilerish', so read at your own risk. I just have to say that I am disappointed. I don't like to read horror stories involving kids. I did read the book description, but I had no idea how much the kids were involved. I don't like to read about kids getting hurt, and I can't imagine anyone who would enjoy it either. I wanted to yell at the parents. If you think your kid is acting wierd, you might want to keep an eye on her. The author is a decent writer, but this story sucked.

$REVIEW.: I truly enjoy the Midnight Hunters books - they're more like a serial than a series, though, and that makes it hard to wait for each new installment.Once a year isn't enough!!This newest volume introduces a new character into an already sweeping cast, but this addition - a Were cat Alpha - is a welcome participant.That being said - you really have to have read each one of the Midnight Hunters books in order to pick up and understand this one. The community of Praeterns, the politics and a very involved story-line are complex and build book to book. A reader cannot simply "drop into" the series - a read from book 1 forward is required. As a matter of fact, I would suggest a complete re-read of the first three books, and then picking up this one to add to the story. You'll get the most out of the plot, cast of characters and alliances with a fresh recollection. It will be worth it, though, because Rad is building a great and intriguing story.I do have one issue with the book ( and somewhat with the series in general ) - it definitely lacks a time and place for tenderness between the characters. There's a lot of sex, and lots of grabbing and taking and thralling and thrashing and ripping off of clothes - but there's not a heck of a lot of tenderness between the couples and I miss that. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the Were cat Alpha has cubs - and for me, the most genuine and sweet moments are the few when the characters interact with them. As odd as it might sound, it makes the characters seem all the more relatable and real.Four stars from me for a great addition to a wonderful series. I'm waiting eagerly for the next book!

$review_text.: If you were really into the games you will like this item as it has most if not all of hte characters of every megaman game named just like that (it doesn't have the megaman x characters or other megaman versions)I liked the size of the book but didn't like much the order in which games are presented (by date of realease) since I was only familiar with a couple of game systems and this book has around 8 different platforms in which megaman existed, but is not a big deal either. Most of the illustrations are pretty well done but they tried to keep the original style in which they were done, therefore megaman 1 illustrations are not as good as megaman 6 for instance but still aceptable. The book is a bit expensive at $27 so you really have to like megaman to make it worth. Some illustrations about the scenarios of each boss or snapshots would've been good but it only has a few if any. I rated four stars because it has lot of material at the end that is not very good but when you have that many pages you can expect that..

$REVIEW.: Mark Mynheir ought to know what he's writing about. He was a SWAT team member, undercover narcotics agent, and detective in central Florida. So who better than he to write about a retired police officer turned private detective, in the self-same central Florida location?But knowledge of the field doesn't mean the ability to write well, to tell a story, to craft a plot, or to create engaging characters. Mr. Mynheir, however, can do all of this and more, and he can do it virtually to perfection. It's a combination that can't be beat, and it shows in his latest Ray Quinn mystery.Ray is a former cop who left the force after being shot. He survived the incident, but his police partner and lover did not. Now a private detective with a bad leg and a cane, he maintains his contact with the police department while solving difficult cases. He's aided by his partner, a slow-witted but loyal helper, and a back-office assistant, for whom he once solved a case, a woman with a religious bent who hopes to dry Ray out. Ray has a close relationship with Jim Beam, and it's taking a toll.Of course there is a murder, this time of an ex-narcotics cop who went bad; there's a shady business mogul and his obnoxious security agent, an ex-con and his wife, and a few other minor players. The author develops just about all of the characters appropriately; we can easily sympathize with Ray, dislike the bad actors, and so on.The writing is first-person and very immediate. While this restricts the plotting to linear flow, we never mind. Things move at a rapid pace and the tone of the narrative really projects the ex-cop feeling sorry for himself and drowning his sorrows, while still remaining a sharp investigator.  There is plenty of action and even more suspense, and the ending may really surprise you--- on several levels--- but I won't spoil it for you here.And there is zero profanity. In a book of this type, that is rare. You may not care either way, but I found it remarkable. There are religious overtones that range from subtle to somewhat more overt, and these build a little--- not too much, but a little--- during the course of the story.This is one of the best detective mysteries I've read in some months. I definitely recommend that you give it a try. For my part, I'm going to look for Mr. Mynheir's other books. If they're anything like as good as this one, it will be more than worth the effort.

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed Haunted.  After reading the first book, Caged, I was happy to see that Haunted was just as good if not better.  The author kept my attention the entire time and at moments I found myself in that wonderful reading haze when you have zoned out everything but what you are reading.  The author found a great balance between resolving the main situation by the end of the book while still leaving enough questions unanswered so that you can't wait to read the next book in the series.  I also enjoyed the new characters brought in to Ruby's world and the way that the relationships between the existing characters continued to develop.  Bring on number three!

$review_text.: Ruthie Pincus 9  year old citizen of Brooklyn. She is growing up during a turbulent period and her family has ties to revolution and persecution. The book is written in a style that gives the reader a "day in the life" type of view of Ruthie's world. Each chapter is like capsule of a time or place or event. Pittman writes from the child's perspective, this makes some of the engrossing adult situations understandable for young readers.Politics, mental illness and death are captured in vivid detail from a child's point of view. Pittman infuses the story with emotion and humor so that even the heavy content is palatable. This is a great coming of age story that will whet your appetite for more.

But I won&#8217;t be ashamed! Anxiety is a real thing and sometimes it&#8217;s crippling! Hence, I totally get Scarlett!This is such a great story of two people, enabling each other to be themselves. Tucker hides behind a bad boy image.&#8220;Never in a million years would I want to be like Tucker Price. Unfocused. Irresponsible. Dangerous.&#8221;Scarlett ends up having to tutor him, but the Tucker who she gets to know isn&#8217;t the Tucker that the rest of the world sees.&#8220;There&#8217;s so much more to Tucker than he shows the world. A vulnerable, injured boy that created the man in front of me. Maybe he feels as trapped in his skin as I do.&#8221;Scarlett allows Tucker to be himself and Tucker helps Scarlett work through her anxiety. He starts to &#8220;tutor&#8221; her on running, but really he just helps her step out of the shell she had built up around her life.&#8220;He&#8217;s always seen through me. Seen who I am and what I need. It&#8217;s one of many reasons I&#8217;m drawn to him. This man has the capability to help me heal.&#8221;I really wish that Tucker and Scarlett could have their own book 2, but the author, Denise, did tell me on twitter that there is more of these two in Redesigned (which comes out today!) and that we will love Tucker even more!! Is that possible?!?See more of my reviews at www.girlbooklove.wordpress.com

$REVIEW.: Author Selena Dale presents her selections for 21 strange animals that inhabit the deserts of the world. The illustrated book describes each animal with a &#34;factoid&#34; that tells why it was chosen for the book. Selected animals include mammals, birds, insects, and snakes and lizards. Before listing the 21 animals, the book describes the four categories of deserts: subtropical deserts, cool coastal deserts, cold winter deserts, and polar deserts. Most of the animals in the book inhabit the subtropical and coastal deserts.One of the strangest animals is the dung beetle, which eats... well, you guessed it. Another bizarre animal is the honeypot ant, which bloats up with food and regurgitates it into other ants' mouths. The tiny mole-like shrew's heart beats at up to 800 times a minute, and it can be frightened to death by a sudden noise. And everyone's favorite, the meerkat, has its own page in addition to the cover photograph.It's a nice short read for kids and grown-ups alike, and a good introduction to desert fauna.

I think I might have whiplash, I'm really not sure which way is up or down. But I do know this... I am sad. Sad that the journey is over. Relieved... Relieved that fate has finally tied up the loose ends and brought Olivia and Caleb's ridiculously frustrating love story together. And finally, indifferent. Yeah that's the word... This book is real, proof that life can be real crude that can really screw you over and also at times can we sweet. Bittersweet. I have a cool indifference towards life, taking the good in with the bad. It's not fair, but we make it work. It's a change of pace to read something real, unfortunate things that really happen. Despite the bad... Good is always lurking around the corner.

$REVIEW.: Although the cover of the book says &quot;volume I&quot; I really wouldn't wanna call it that. I think it could be better seen as a &quot;issue #0&quot; or a &quot;get-to-know-the-characters-special&quot; because basically that's what this is. Reading the book is fun, pretty good fun actually. You get to know the characters a little and see a teensy bit of how they are. Volume II though (which is called &quot;I dream of You&quot;) is REALLY volume I because there is where it all really starts. The story goes from there to where it is now. In THIS book &quot;The Collected&quot; you get to know who are gonna be in &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot; but it's &quot;I dream of You&quot; where the story really begins. So don't see this book as the start of SiP that you HAVE to get but see it more as a nice addition if you like SiP from other volumes. If you miss this one you won't be missing any essential knowledge (like you would if you missed either one of the later volumes), but you should get it anyway because, like I said, it still is great fun to read.

$review_text.: Brother Hagin again teaches in the easiest way the deep things of the Bible.  Many are confused between the gift of speaking in tongues and the gift of the Holy Spirit that every believer can have and should have as they received in the book of Acts. This book explains this very clearly and teaches how to receive this dear gift of God.  As for me I have been filled with the Holy Spirit and pray in tongues just about everyday and I do it privately and without anything weird.  The Lord has also used me to give a tongue in church and the interpretation and this is as the Spirit wills. Again this book will help anyone looking to receive this powerful gift from our Lord Jesus.  Read it and enjoy the truth.

$review_text.: This one took me by surprise.  Bo and Erick are two lovely, well-developed characters who felt so real to me.  Like other reviews have stated, their relationship and romance was a slow-burn.  But I think the author was smart to handle the narrative like this because it came across as plausible, which made the plot all the more heart-felt and relevant.  Bo and Erick actually GET TO KNOW each other.  What a novel idea!  And what they learn as their unexpected attraction and relationship blossoms is that they make each other stronger as individuals by being together, as friends first and lovers later.SLIGHT SPOILER:  I found myself tearing up at each of their back stories, but Erick's experience as a victim of domestic abuse of the worst kind was such an important issue to touch upon, I think.  Because it DOES unfortunately happen in gay relationships just like it does in straight ones, but I've never seen it brought to light for the audience of gay romances like I have for straight romance novels.  I was so pleased the author showed that although men can be victims, they can also fight to break the abusive cycles . . . and find self-worth and love again if given time.  Hopefully with someone who's soul is as gentle, sweet, and patient as Bo's.I had trouble putting this book down to get sleep last night.  Always the sign of the best reads.  So good.  You will not be disappointed.

$review_text.: At the beginning I thought that this is another sales guide, with all the usual jargons, but when I started to read it more deeply, I realized that my thoughts were totally wrong. I am currently a product manager in a big software company, and part of my role is to present some pre-sale presentations to huge corporates. I also agree with the author approach, that "understanding human nature" is the most important factor in sales, and this guide teaches you how to behave with your customers in different scenarios, how to read their body language, how to be sensitive to their needs, thoughts and questions. For example, how to present your sales presentation, how to answer questions from your clients, or how to ask the right questions, and how to take into consideration the timing factor as well.It also teaches you some tricks on how to divide your customers to groups, whether they want to buy or not.At the end of this guide you will receive some useful quotes as well.I'm sure this guide will assist me in my future deals.
$SUMMARY.: Great for salespeople!

$REVIEW.: The latest in a series of related writings from Gad Saad, this volume is a flirtatiously styled yet seriously presented text which seeks to enlighten the reader concerning the biological basis of consumer choice in the market place. Indeed, the book could as well be subtitled `Satisfying the Darwinian fears linked to survival, mating, family relationships and friendships', but may then likely sell fewer copies in the airport bookstore. Essential reading for all sales and marketing professionals, but also for anyone wishing to study explanations (if not the ultimate causes) of individual and collective consumer decision-making. Not another `self-help' book, however (far from it !), the author's intentions are to simply defend his main thesis that, "Homo consumericus is a Darwinian organism shaped by millions of years of evolution, [our] consumer choices manifestations of their common biological heritage", and thus possessive of a common `consumer instinct' rooted in our human biological history.  Although primarily an academic work written in clearly accessible prose, addressing (and presenting evidence for) largely the concerns and findings of academic research, Saad (successfully in my view) informs his readers as consumers, marketers, and policy decision makers.Combining much of the same ground covered in the recently reviewed `Genome' (Ridley, 2011) and `Unthinking' (Beckworth, 2011) (see Metapsy reviews at:[...] & [...]), Saad champions the cause of the view from evolutionary psychology that many consumer choices are driven by (if not at least explainable by) an appeal to their subsequent display as `extended phenotypes' (Dawkins); discussing cars, high heeled shoes, cosmetic use, and other luxury goods, as determined by their ostentatious personal possession, to be `artifacts rooted in a biological imperative'. Each of the 10 chapters (plus a concluding statement) cover a different exemplar area for exploration of Saad's thesis, with excellent referencing of the key papers and research findings supporting his claims for those wishing to follow up with the source literature. And the conclusions are consistent. Discussing fast food choices, the most popular (or at least globally best-selling) products are "directly linked in their congruence with an evolved predisposition" for fatty foods in lean times (Ch. 2). "Darwinian forces compel consumers to partake in a wide range of investments [read, purchases, for the purpose of] solidifying bonds of kinship" (Ch. 4). As for buying rounds in the bar, "Human sociality [online and offline these days] are driven by the evolutionary imperative to form bonds of reciprocity" (Ch. 6). In this sense, Saad's thesis is well presented and documented, with plenty of sex (as in reproductive success, not socialised `gender studies') thrown in as direct exemplar material for consideration (and entertaining if not newly informative reading), providing a text well worthy of addition to the two books mentioned above.Without giving too much away here, the current reviewer envisages that some marketers and/or advertising professionals may find this text a little burdensome in using its findings to drive the details of their own next campaign with the optimum `market fitness' in mind. However, this is neither a failing of the work, nor was it (I believe) Saad's intention to suggest what the consumer industry `should' instead be doing. The author's explanations and thesis' predictions (this is documented science after all, not post-MBA marketing critique fodder), if thought about seriously, may nonetheless be of significant use to those embarked upon a career involving the need/desire to influence the decision-making and motivations of others, whilst also (perhaps) help explain why they themselves made some of the investments that they did (and why, at the time of purchasing them !).Tony DickinsonAcademic Research Laboratory (ARL, HK), KBET+ (USA/China).

$REVIEW.: If this were to actually happen, a plague of a--holes overrunning the world (a la Night of the Living Dead), I would be their king, or at least a Lt. Colonel. I'd have some kind of rank.In Kevin Donihe's Night of the A--holes, a--holes are everywhere, as you might imagine. If you're an a--hole to an a--hole, then you become an a--hole as well. The only way to stop an a--hole is to ram a pole up said a--hole's a--hole. But aim carefully, for if you miss the a--hole's a--hole, then you will become an a--hole.This book is a parody of George Romero's zombie classic, but this is not the kind of parody that would feature Leslie Nielsen in the film adaption. Beyond the humorous premise and outstanding cover art, there is little humor to be found in this story, which wonders if, in the face of a worldwide epidemic of douchebaggery, is it possible to remain civil? If the entire world was overrun by a--holes, would there be any chance for kindness to survive?I won't spoil Donihe's vision here, but I know one thing - I wouldn't last five minutes in that world. In fact, I fear I have already turned.

The core desire for survival saved her from becoming an eternal victim and the fact that she Did survive does not in any way diminish the horrific interruption by &#34;the dude&#34;.

There are also great words to describe feelings when Kanani writes in her diary and when her cousin (Rachel) writes in her diary.  The situations and fears are very appropriate for kids in similar situations - very easy for kids to relate to.  And, as always, there is an educational element when the book discusses Monk Seals and their behaviors.  As well as, many native Hawaiian words and pronunciations.Lastly, the few pictures in the book are beautiful!  And they give a great visual element to feed the reader's imagination.Definitely, a great book.  A terrific gift for any 3rd, 4th or 5th grader.

$review_text.: This novel somewhat reminds me of those British television dramas I&#8217;m so fond of. Lots of drama. It&#8217;s a good story full of (mostly) good people, people you come to care about as the story continues. The problem for me is it&#8217;s awful long and it&#8217;s nothing but drama and everyday life. Every story should have some of that, but I like a little something more in my books. I like to walk away with a good laugh or some new bit of knowledge. Though the story takes place during the war and the heroine works in a factory, there&#8217;s not a whole lot of detail about that stuff. Next to none, to be honest. Oh, they sit in shelters and they have rationing coupons, but I&#8217;m especially disappointed in the lack of factory life as that bit is what drew me to this story to begin with.This is part of a series, but except for some references to Rosie and her problems, I never felt I was lost.It&#8217;s a tad predictable. That has to be the second biggest downside, but it&#8217;s enjoyable enough that that&#8217;s not overly bothersome.I was very easily able to get &#8220;lost&#8221; in the tale for four days. The heroines are Ruby and Peggy. Ruby is young and at first, I thought, &#8220;Oh no&#8230;a woman who lets herself get smacked around..ugh.&#8221; But she finds her backbone and then some. I think my favorite scene is when she stands up to Doris, but I digress. I appreciate Ruby&#8217;s story&#8212;battered wife trying to make it on her own, growing braver with each day, taking risks by up and moving from all she&#8217;s known and finding a job and a new home and opening up to people. Peggy is a strong older lady whose husband is off to war and has her own battles as her health declines and her home is bombed&#8230;but nothing&#8230;and I mean nothing stops this incredible woman from opening her home and her heart to other people, especially young girls in trouble, like Ruby.Peggy is a fabulous role model.We get brief looks at the other girls, such as Rita, who rides a motorbike and works as a firegirl, but you have to read their books to get their stories. This just offers teasers of sorts.I enjoyed it, but like I said above, I just like more in my books. If this was a TV drama on BBC, I&#8217;d be all over the series, but at 500-some pages per book, I want more of the war, of the factories, of the motorbiking. More of that interesting stuff, less drama and personal problems.

 Did you know that store workers can ask if your dog is a service dog but cannot ask what service he provides?  Also a store worker, can ask the person if he has a disability but not what the disability is
 If you ask details about these two things the store can be fined.Another interesting fact is that greyhounds are the only dogs that are mentioned in the Bible.Steven Wolf has an extreme spinal condition which forces him to leave his job as a lawyer and go into retirement
 He is attracted to a group that rescues retired racing greyhounds
 An interesting fact is that Comet actually chose Wolf


At first, Wolf helps Comet learn about the real world such as walking on tile floors or climbing stairs
 Then when Wolf's condition gets worse he decides to train Comet to be a service dog although greyhounds are not usually considered service dogs


 Comet helps him with some of the basic things in life such as getting out of bed, pulling his wheelchair, and pushing his grocery cart.His health issues did put pressure on his family relationships with his wife Freddie and his daughters
 You will have to read the book to find out how these relationships end up.I would recommend you read this book


 It is heart-warming and humorous.______________This review is based on a free electronic copy provided by the publisher for the purpose of creating this review

$REVIEW.: *I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review*A local magician does a trick at a kid's birthday party which kills his wife, and a fixed trial and the silence of the kids who were messing around with the guillotine condemn him to prison. Now the children have grown up and the town is going to get a very unwelcome visitor seeking revenge.It might be nice if Goodreads and Amazon change their blurb to reflect that the magician is called ARNOLD, not Albert. But I digress.This was an excellent horror read with all the things that I love about the genre. First there was the horrors of the birthday party. I hate kids so a nice bloody party was the perfect start for me to get into the book along with the dry humour of the author as he told us how excited and nervous the kids were getting."It was a potent combination and several parents feared for not having brought changes of underwear."Loved that! There were scenes of inventive and amusing murders of people who deserve what they got, all with a magical twist. The magician was funny and dramatic as he killed people, giving him a twisted kind of charisma."The shadow stepped back from the sodden mess and surveyed the work. "Ta-dah" it whispered softly."There was the tension of knowing that the boogeyman was out in the shadows waiting to pounce. You knew who some of the victims were to be but not how they would die or in which order. As people go to investigate noises in the dark(silly!) or wander off on their own(dumb!) you were just waiting on Arnold to jump out with his silky cloak on. The mixture of tension and bloody death were perfectly combined in a story that moved along smoothly. I enjoyed the way the author put the story together.The characters were developed well within the story and I disliked Dixon from the start, as the author intended I believe! Out of the five I liked McEwan the best and he seemed to be the one who suffered the most from the events at the party. Even the bad characters were a perfect fit and you looked forward to them getting what they deserved. The grand finale was very good and I was left satisfied by the way everything worked out.There were good plot twists as well. I did suspect a few of them but the final big reveal I only guessed right at the very last second which shows that the author does an equally good job of hinting and concealing. I'd love to talk more about these twists but of course that would mean huge spoilers and I won't do that. But I can tell you that the twists are great and fit perfectly into the story.If you love horror and scary thrillers then you should enjoy this book. I will be looking at other work by the author and if this comes out in paperback, I will definitely add it to my collection. Brilliant book!

$review_text.: I really enjoy Gooseberry Patch cookbooks, but my preference I think is for the holiday books and the ones with the Christmas and Autumn theme. This book's focus is on farmstand vegetables and produce, and to be honest, I just didn't see a lot here I wanted to cook. My family is pretty generic in their vegetable and fruit tastes, and not especially adventurous, and while these recipes are both easy to make and accessible I just didn't find myself jazzed about them.Still, it is a Gooseberry Patch cookbook, and as such I'm keeping it, I just don't think I'll use it that much, sadly.

$review_text.: Renee outdid herself with this second book in the Quaid series. The blood-dripping-from-his-teeth killer is right up there near the top of the heap of nightmare-worthy villains. The story is edge-of-the-seat stuff. Once you get into it, you aren't gonna want to put it down. Some of the side characters are quite memorable, too. Like the underhanded lady psychiatrist who has her sneaky little cap set for the detective. And the beautiful young woman Phoenix, who escaped from the killer once, but is still very much in danger. Oh, and main character Sara's ex-beau Scott, whose underhandness is about as devious as the  psychiatrist's.As for the detective and his lady love Sara, you're gonna want to bang their heads together. Really. Especially the detective, who has his head shoved so far up his... job... he has no idea what's going on with the woman he allegedly adores. He breaks so many promises and drops the proverbial ball so many times, it isn't funny. It's a wonder his mother didn't paddle his bottom and put him in time out. He certainly deserved it. The fact that their foolishness got me so frustrated simply proves what a great job Renee did drawing me into the story.To tell the truth, when I started reading this book, I found some of the writing and editing to be a little looser than in the first book, so I thought I'd end up giving it less than five stars. But you know what? The story and characters are more than strong enough to make this book a winner. I loved it, and I think you would, too.

$REVIEW.: I'm rather picky when it comes to reading, therefore I must research any book before considering it. I've missed reading a novel that could truly engulf me in its story, a novel for the thrill seeker in me.  It was definitely written with flair and skill, each page grabbing a tighter hold on the reader.  It's very colorful, in the sense that it perfectly balances humor, action passages and sexy encounters.The plot is very well thought out, yet flows naturally and somehow still manages to enhance the suspense. I only wish I could have read this novel when it first got out, when the times were far more relevant and the actions seemed far bolder. The intrigue is quite sophisticated, much different from what I had expected. You will certainly stumble upon creative passages, full of action and hear gripping descriptions.In my view, Johnny outshines James Bond himself. He's very real to me, he enjoys the small things in life, indulges in different vices and chases beautiful women. When you put card player and gunfighter into the mix, you undoubtedly know that he's a keeper!I'd full heartedly recommend it to any avid reader who seeks that perfect balance between quality spy action and mischievous crimes.

$review_text.: I read the first four of these just to be fair.  The author has just enough of a flair for writing (and the subject matter is of course compelling) that you can get sucked into the vortex of this drivel.  The disconnect from any kind of ordinary kind of common sense or cause and effect was painful and jarring.  This story has absolutely no credibility.  As a bonus, the writer has the skills of a sixth grader who missed many days of school.  Grammar, syntax and choice of words are abysmal.  Words are used that are wrong given the context.  This evidence of the devolution of our culture is sometimes worth suffering through, but certainly not in this case.

$REVIEW.: I bought the trilogy as a set and read it through its entirety in a day

 I loved the characters and the array of emotions this book takes the reader through
 The Plus One Chronicles is not just a love story about a girl and a boy, it's a story about imperfection, insecurities, taking risks and saying good-bye.Something I haven't seen before that happened in this book are the two different plots which run together, have some similarities yet close in total contrast to one another

 The author does an amazing job of branching out with side stories that include a number of additional characters but each story is neatly wrapped up at just the right time and by the time the reader reaches the end of the book, they will close it feeling satisfied.The sex scenes are intense - not a dirty intense but rather an emotional intense, something I think made Kat and Sloane so much more interesting


There are a couple scenes that have a hint of kink which add a twist but but unlike other romances I've read, I don't feel like this story is chasing Fifty Shades.I loved that chronicles one and two didn't end in cliff hangers as so often series do and yet I still couldn't wait to get to the next one.This series was well-written with great story lines and the right mix of characters

It's a great read and I can't wait to read more by Jennifer Lyon!

For those familiar with the Jenetta Carver series, this new series also takes place in the Galaxy Unknown universe.The character development and creative world building were continually engrossing, I just could not put this book down.  I greedily gobbled up every morsel of the story but was disappointed once I reached the last page, solely because the story was so enjoyable, I wished this book would never end!There was a perfect symmetry between action and adventure, moreover the battle tactics were interesting and clever. The protagonist was very likeable and all around brilliant.I highly recommend this book and the Jenetta Carver series to fellow SF readers and I can't for the next book in this series; in addition, I also look forward to the next Jenetta Carver book due out December 2012.To fellow dark urban fantasy readers who are looking for a good space opera but do not want to end up with a space romance, I also recommend these books to you.I also recommend:On Silver Wings (Warrior's Wings Book One)The Hour of Dust and AshesMutineer (Kris Longknife)Mech 1: The Parent (Imperium Series)Peacekeeper: A Major Ariane Kedros Novel

$REVIEW.: *I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*Final verdict: 3.5 starsAll right Hooker Readers, he we go ya'll! (Warning: there will be spoilers)Upon seeing the name and cover art of this book, I was quite intrigued. Then I read the first chapter and was like "Oh boy, what did I get myself into?!". All the text talk was very over the top and quite annoying at first. Especially the word "zomg!", it has to go.Being the loyal Book Whore that I am, I pushed on and was determined to give Blaire Reese a real shot. Chapter 2 got my attention and I had to know what happened next.Blaire was a hot college student in academia limbo. Unable to find her niche in any particular area of study. She had raw talent in terms of using her womanly ways to charm the pants off men. As much as she enjoyed sex, it certainly wasn't anything that would earn her a college degree. Enter her Psychology professor who recognized her special abilities and recommended her to the CIA for Project Cathouse.This top secret project consists of 30 gorgeous people who just happen to be amazing in the sack. They're put up in a swanky mansion, where they're trained in all things seduction in order to gather intel from terrorists. They basically become sex ninjas, all for the love of America.As part of her training, Blaire was assigned a seduction mentor referred to as Mr. Lucky. I absolutely loved his character and all the wisdom that poured out of his mouth. All that talk about learning to yield your womanly powers, had me wanting to sign up to receive classes from him!In true Real World style, there are cliques, random hookups and rivalries. Here we meet Sabrina the self proclaimed Queen Bee. Also part of the gang is Drummond, the sexiest manly man alive, who just so happens to be Sabrina's husband! That was a WTF moment, didn't see that coming at all! My heart broke for Blaire, when she found out the horrible news. Then she goes and declares her love to him and we find out he loves her back! Naturally, I'm all OMG, YAY...now they can ride off into the sunset, right? WRONG! Well sort of. In true Britney Spears form, the book ends with a "1, 2, 3, Blaire, Sabrina and Drummond" flare, which totally shocked me...in a good way. The ending was unexpected with a non-traditionally happy way, yet completely appropriate.I fell in love with Blaire Reese, she totally reminds me of a redneck extra ghetto (is that redundant or what!) version of Britney Spears with all the ya'll-ing she did. She was a very fun character to read and so enthusiastic...she would often get a bit carried away with the "AHHHHHHHHH". Then there were classic lines such as "bitch be trippin'", "bitches be learnin' how to cut a fool" and one of my favorites "hair dun, nails dun, everything dun."Although It took me a hot second to get into this book, I'm glad I stuck with it. In a nut shell, it was a refreshing read about a college girl with a huge heart who found love in a very unexpected place. Since this is the story of how Blaire became a patriotic whore, I'd really like to see how she performs in the field.Which leads to the epilogue...WTF was that?! I need more!On an extremely random side note...I thoroughly enjoyed the homage or jab at Twilight with the Isabella character.Yours Truly,Colombian Hooker Reader :)

$REVIEW.: Summer was looking for a master, someone who would recognize the submissive in her and be everything she hoped for


Summer also wanted to help her friend Kei, a Kitsune, who had his talisman stolen
However, once Summer saw Jubal she knew without a doubt that he was the master she had been searching for.Likewise, Jubal wanted Summer after seeing her picture and having her sister Lyra promise to introduce the two
Jubal, a Dragon, had to find her before any of the other dragons did especially since they were also looking for their mates


Knowing that Summer was into the BDSM lifestyle, Jubal helped her gain entrance to a private party by declaring himself her master.Dragon Master is the sequel to Dragon Games and can be read as a stand-alone but I would recommend that you read Dragon Games first because it sets the stage for Dragon Master

The characters were interesting and the chemistry between Summer and Jubal was electric

Summer was the perfect submissive to Jubal's Dom and his cousin Nisien, also a Dragon, helped to keep the story interesting

The back story of finding the kitsune Kei's talisman was a nice touch because it helped give dimension to the story, and helped introduce Summer to the supernatural world

Of course, since the story was about Summer finding her master and Jubal finding his mate, and they were both into the BDSM lifestyle, the author allowed the reader to take a glimpse into what those living this lifestyle experience.Even though BDSM is woven throughout the story and it is the main theme, there was more to this story than just that


Dragon Master was a love story about two people coming together to form a lasting relationship built on mutual trust and affection, Jubal needed his mate just as much as Summer needed to be dominated and loved by her master.Dragon Master was definitely an interesting story and if you're into this type of lifestyle or are curious about it, then you should pick up Dragon Master.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews

$REVIEW.: The Damsel and the Daggerman is the latest entry into Delilah S. Dawson&#8217;s Blud series. It is an enovella that takes place between the events of the second novel, Wicked As She Wants, and the upcoming novel, Wicked After Midnight. Like all of the Blud stories, it&#8217;s deliciously good.Jacinda Harville is a daring journalist who wiggles her way into Criminy Stain&#8217;s caravan. She wants to write a book on the people of the caravan, pinkies and bludmen alike, but there&#8217;s something that draws her to Marco Taresque, the devilishly handsome daggerman. He has a mysterious and deadly history, which has all the girls fawning over him.Dawson manages to develop a wonderfully wicked story in a relatively short amount of pages. It is quite possibly her hottest story to date, and there&#8217;s quite the intriguing gender role reversal that had me perking my metaphorical ears.My only complaint is that it was all over too quickly. Luckily Wicked After Midnight releases later this month!(originally posted on loebick.com)

$review_text.: "All will be reconciled, and we shall see no longer as 'through a glass, darkly,' the infinitude, the beauty, the harmony of nature.  I must return to the volcano, if it is only to look-to look and admire".These words came from David Douglas's writings towards the end of his short life and contrast to the head-strong plant collector, who on his first journey to the Northwest, would occasionally let his desire for fame contaminate his boyish zeal for the natural world.  Jack Nisbet's biography uses Douglas's journals as well as very extensive research of all available material on Douglas and related history to not only tell his story but let us inside the man.David Douglas's first journey to the Northwest occupies the first half of the book and I was amazed at the insight and look into the very heart of the man we get.  Less than two decades after Lewis and Clark, Douglas goes to the same region and explores thoroughly throughout what is now Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and BC.  When it came to the second half I was afraid that beautiful narrative and insight would be lost on learning that Douglas's journals were lost in a canoe accident on the Frazier River late in the journey.  But Nisbet picks and prods the available literature, uses the context of Douglas's first journey, and delivers us a compelling story on his second journey to the Northwest, California, and Hawaii.I was struck by David Douglas's passion for the out of doors; his love of plants, geology, and everything natural.  There is something very modern about this man, something two centuries before his time.  In the end, though, the most compelling thing is the depth of the man whose name is on the Douglas fir.  While other Northwest names like Rainier, Puget, or Baker warrant little more than footnotes in the annals of history, Douglas is a name with depth, passion, and story.  David Douglas definitely deserves this book and I enjoyed it immensely.  The Collector inspired me, and more than once I wished there was another continent, virtually unexplored, and available for me to go collect plants on.  But there is not.

$REVIEW.: Remnants of Magic (The Sidhe Collection)"Remnants of Magic" took me seamlessly into the world of the Fey born of the Earth and those surviving the Collapse.  Lugh, the "Light" also known as the Champion of the Fey, is now battling his own demons of Dark Magic as he confronts the Captain of the Unseelie Elite guard, Donovan.In "Scattered Magic" the lines of good/evil, light/dark & right/wrong seemed definitively marked.  In "Remnants...", the lines are blurring, the characters seem to switch roles and fluctuate according to circumstances they find themselves in as well as evolving due to new and changed reality. Questions that begin to be answered include (but are not limited to):Will the surviving Seelie form a successful alliance with the surviving Unseelie/Earthborn for the good of all Fey without losing themselves to a fade-like demise or slavery-type of existence?Will the Sidhe loose the distinctions of "light vs.dark" or Seelie vs.Unseelie?Does the former Seelie King make himself known to the Fey on Earth?Are the Wizards Successful?Is there One person to Become all powerful?  If so, have we yet met that character?Will we learn what happens to the characters we've begun to love/hate in Scattered Magic?I'm so intrigued by this storyline; I'm so drawn into the lives of the Characters; I feel like I am living along side the characters.  I'm anxious to resolve the Fade.  I'm anxious to rid the world of Wizards like the ones imprisoning Kaitlin.  I look for answers to allow "my" people of the Fey and the Sidhe in particular.  Like the authors, I find myself with dual citizenship!Now, when is the next installment?  I don't want to wait for months to resume my journey!

$review_text.: I had never read anything by Ms. Turansky, but as this was a book in the genre I enjoy most (Inspirational Historical Fiction) I was eager to give it a try.***Here is a brief plot synopsis (taken from book cover):Missionary Julia Foster loves working alongside her parents, ministering and caring for young girls in India. But when the family must return to England due to illness, she readily accepts the burden for her parents' financial support. Taking on a job at Highland Hall as governess, she quickly finds that teaching her four privileged, ill-mannered charges at a grand estate is more challenging than expected, and she isn't sure what to make of the estate's preoccupied master, Sir William Ramsey.Widowed and left to care for his two young children and his deceased cousin Randolph's two teenage girls, William is consumed with saving the estate from the financial ruin. The last thing he needs is any distraction coming from the kindhearted-yet-determined governess who seems to be quietly transforming his household with her persuasive personality, vibrant prayer life, and strong faith.While both are tending past wounds and guarding fragile secrets, Julia and William are determined to do what it takes to save their families--common ground that proves fertile for unexpected feelings. But will William choose Julia's steadfast heart and faith over the wealth and power he needs to secure Highland Hall's future?***After reading an exciting book in the same genre (Inspirational historical fiction) directly before this one, I admit I found that it started off very lackluster. I wasn't grabbed by the first page--or even the first chapter...but I finally had to stop comparing them and just enjoy the read.And I did! Though it started slow, this story was well written and did get interesting.I enjoyed the way that Julia handles always with love the children who torment her so. To see how gradually they come to view her differently because of her endless kindness. She truly has a servant's heart towards her God and those she has entrusted in her care including her family at home.I liked seeing her and William's love blossom as well as William sister Sarah's "forbidden" love with the gardener. I enjoyed watching William battle with his feelings about class separation when he's in love with a servant and then to find out his sister is too, well it's a very good aspect of the plot!I would say that if you like storylines similar to a show like Downton Abbey with the intrigue of the "upstairs" and "downstairs" and enjoy inspirational fiction, I think you will enjoy this novel!Out of five stars, I would give it a solid 3 1/2--but here on Amazon because they don't DO 3 1/2, I gave it 4...I didn't adore it, but I didn't dislike it either. It was good book and I did enjoy it...but definitely not as good as many of the others I have read recently.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from WaterBrookMultnomah as part of their book review bloggers program through Blogging for Books. All opinions expressed are my own and I was not required to write a positive review.

$review_text.: Cute and charming.  I love the recipe box packaging.  The 50's style artwork is whimsical and invokes the true spirit of the card meanings.  But, I purchased these to do readings on a select group of people.  Unfortunately, these cards lack a coating and are very susceptible to getting dirty and/or creased when shuffled or read.  This is the second recent set of cards (Deviant Moon being the other) that is produced on poor card stock.  They are fun to look at, but unusable without being ruined.  Cards should have a coating, like the Rider-Waite decks or other "regular" playing cards do.  These are strictly for collecting.  Not reading.

$REVIEW.: I get beat up by my endocrinologist and her certified diabetes nurse educator for my use of the insulin pump.  This book put them in their &#34;place&#34; about recent recommendations of the American Diabetes Association.This book has just the right amount of information on each chapter.Don't hesitate, if you're using insulin or especially if you're using an insulin pump.  The vendor manual for your pump tells you which buttons to push.  This book gives you the strategy for using the pump, to control your diabetes.Pump or no pump, a diabetic CAN control diabetes, to the guidelines.  I've had it for 20 years. Just had an eye exam with no problems detected. Sure, everybody's different, no doubt. But, if insulin therapy seems overwhelming, GET this book.

For those of you who, like me, have never read the series, you can absolutely start here.  This works very well as a standalone novel.  Just be prepared to want to order the prior books as soon as you finish.The book is a fun, fast read.  Funny, without being ridiculous, the situations in which Stacy finds herself made me want to keep reading. I tore through this book.  By far my favorite little sub plot was the one about the dogs.  If there are any dog lovers out there, you'll love that part!The romance is sweet and flirty and the situation with her aunt's never-to-be marriage was heartbreaking.  I enjoyed every word of this little book and I'm looking forward to reading the author again soon!

$REVIEW.: Bryn is a 15 year old headstrong human girl

She was quite literally Raised by Wolves (Werewolves to be exact)


Her mom and dad died when she was 4


they were killed by a rouge werewolf aka a Rabid

Throughout the book she repeats the same description of her parents death over and over.A man with a wolf


Man killed Mommy


Wolf killed Daddy
And then started looking for me
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? Blood-Blood-Blood-Blood.Callum is her protecter, father, brother, guardian and friend all roled into one
Callum also is the alpha of the pack

When a peculiar rouge werewolf is spotted on his territory, he is the first to react


He knows something is coming
Something big
He gives Bryn a stricter curfew, and assigns a bodyguard to her at all times

Bryn knows something is wrong, and she's going to figure it out if it's the last thing she does.But in her drive to find the truth, will Bryn push too far beyond the constraints of the pack, forcing her to leave behind her friends, her family, and the identity that she's shaped?I enjoyed this book
The author has a great sense of humor and had me laughing through the whole book
This is one of the first werewolf books I picked up and it didn't dissapoint


One of the main reasons I loved this book was that Bryn wasnt a damsel in distress


She was strong, intelligent, resourceful and funny
Of course if she wasnt all these things she wouldve never survived.He's in a cage, I reminded myself, but the words meant nothing to me, because I just couldn't stop staring into his wild eyes and playing the last words he'd said before he Shifted, over and over agian.I got bit.I got bit.I got bit.

$REVIEW.: I am impressed at how real and how honest Kristen was in this account of her death to self and true life in Christ


I was encouraged and convicted to be real and transparent even in my blog posts and how I present myself to those around me


That is probably why I haven't been quick to blog about much lately


In the beginning Kristen mentions that her story probably isn't that much different from the reader and at first I really brushed that notion aside


I may not have laid down on railroad tracks ready to end my life or tried to fill a void with drinking, drugs, or partying; but there was clearly a time in my life before Christ where I attempted to fill a void in my life with activity--school, sports, extracurriculars, etc
Frankly, everyone is trying to fill that void with something

What are you trying to fill yours with? It's a void that can only be filled by Christ.

$REVIEW.: We all know there are jobs out there where its one of those things of 'somebody has to do it and it might as well be me and I might as well get paid well for mucking about in nasty stuff'


 Crime scene clean up and bio hazard wast disposal is that 'mmm just so lovely' job in this book
It was such a different sort of backdrop and career for the hero that I just couldn't pass it up and plus plus I like the author's writing.The story opens when Jack one of the owners of the business starts his day to find one of his employees in his kitchen making him coffee and leaving him a cat to cat sit for a few days


 Life hasn't been good to Jack and he can't even handle the thought of a relationship let alone caring for an animal
 He had a near death experience as a firefighter that several surgeries later has left him still broken up and in pain with his career ruined and then there was that incident back in high school that still haunts him

 But his day takes a turn for the worse when he gets a call from his 'friends with bennies' cop friend who calls him about a crime scene that he needs to know about

 A guy from high school days has committed suicide


 Everyone warns him not to go out on this job, but to let someone else


 Jack needs to be there and he can't even work it out for himself exactly why that is
 It appears that someone else needs to be there and Jack meets Nick's cousin Ryan who needs to be there closing things up too.The plot on this one was an interesting piece of character development and relationship development


 Jack has physical injuries that sideline him many times, but it is the scars from that incident in high school that he really needs to heal from


 I enjoyed following that path of healing and the beginnings of something with Jack and Ryan


Things are complicated by well meaning friends and an undefined relationship


 I love the addition of Tasha the cat and Skippy one of Jack's workers
 If ever a guy was misnamed, its the huge mob enforcer looking Skippy.All in all this was an enjoyable read that offered a great story line and a blazing hot couple that m/m contemporary romance fans might want to give a try.My thanks to Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review this book.

Carla has a unique way of writing flash fiction stories that touch on love, dating, marriage, and family. Each story touches on different areas of love which makes it a sweet short story collection.For Better or Worse: is a story about a middle aged married couple who both change things they don't like about each other.A Dose of Eternal: is a story about Eternal Love Potions and a blind date. Looks aren't everything when it comes to love and marriage. Marriage should last forever not just 60 years.Crazy Lovebirds: is a story about a couple who doesn't have a perfect marriage but still stand by each other.Victor's Proposal: is a story about an unusual way a man proposes to a woman.Dad Takes Flight: is a story about a dad who hasn't flown on an airplane in years, bringing stuff that isn't allowed in his suitcase, and enjoys the trip to California.I look forward to reading more books written by Carla Sarett. I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Excellent m/m fantasy romance novel
(And heads-up, it's available in paperback, but is also available free to read online.)At over 177k words, The God Eaters tells an amazing and enthralling story set in an alternative world where magic abilities exist, and a totalitarian government has tight control over who is allowed to have these abilities


Kieran and Ash are two young men who meet while they are being sent to prison for their crimes--robbery and murder for Kieran, and distributing rebellious propaganda for Ash

Both have talents, and they find that the prison isn't just a place to contain criminals, but is a government testing ground for magical abilities

Surviving prison life and the torturous tests is made only easier by the slow growing relationship between them, a relationship that incites them to plan an escape from the inescapable mountain they're locked in.This is a long book, but totally captivating
The world-building and characterization is rich and vivid, and the character and relationship development is riveting

I was totally enveloped in Kieran and Ash's fight for freedom and for their desperate, heart-aching love for each other
(I cried at one point like a baby too.) Even with that weepy interlude, the ending is thoroughly satisfying.Excellent excellent book, and highly recommended for anyone looking for an m/m fantasy read

Definitely one of the best fantasy books I've read in the genre.

$REVIEW.: The cover and title are profoundly misleading to the enchantment you&#8217;ll uncover once you crack open the pages and dive in.  Who says being dead has to be anything except fabulous&#8230; and all to like the life of the living. This Gay Satirical Romance story will pull at your heartstrings, leave you all a flutter, and remind you to never settle, even if you&#8217;re dead! And to have fun!Alan is that guy that defines the majority of humans; gay or straight. Often we go through lives not taking chances or chasing after our dreams only to find our life abruptly ended with so many unfulfilled dreams. But why? Klehr gives the readers back some of those choices in a fun loving and humorous way all while getting down to business and drowning in juicy drama that gays know best!&#34;Don't smile like that, it doesn't match the decor.&#34;The characters are easy to connect with and all have such flamboyant personalities that you&#8217;d be amiss to not think it&#8217;s just another typical night out with the boys. With feelings finally surfacing, and new intrigues entering into the picture, things just might not be so bad after all.Hopefully Klehr hasn&#8217;t put his pen away just yet and has some more wickedly dreamy stories to share with the world as the LGBT literature is starting to really take off, especially in America, and he certainly has a flair for writing! So, pick up this book, make some tea, and settle in because it&#8217;s going to be a bumpy ride!*This book was provided in exchange for an honest review*You can find this review at Musing with Crayolakym

$REVIEW.: Molly's mother is getting married again, and she is dreading having a new potential father. She's even less thrilled to be joining the newly weds on their honeymoon.Charlie was looking forward to his summer riding his bike in the mountains of Colorado discovering new trails to conquer. However, his two mothers have a different summer planned for the family and it's nowhere near the snowy peaks.Little do they know Molly and Charlie are in for the most memorable summer of their lives. Molly's family will be heading to Colorado and Charlie's family will be heading to L.A. it's a house swap!Getting to know the other person by staying in each others rooms is one thing, but these two end up finding out more about themselves in someone else's room.Let me just start out saying that I loved this book! It was fun, it was fast, it was cute! I'm a sucker for a good love story, what can I say?! Yes, it was a love story, but it wasn't an over the top too cheesy even for me love story. It was balanced and possibly even believable. So, don't let that turn you away!We have Molly the fashion guru, timid, pretty, afraid to get her heart broken. Then there's Charlie, the mountain bike maniac, genuine, hot, 100% guy. I don't know if you could get much different, but somehow it works.I love the fact that they literally fall in love with each other's personalities, I mean it's like match.com, but without the stupid questionnaire and compatibility test. Not that I've ever been to match.com, or even know that they have a questionnaire. I mean you've seen the commercials too, right? Anyway, it's like they bring out the best in each other and they do it from thousands of miles away. Sucker for the romantics, I know!Still, Charlie isn't like some made up version of a guy from a Nicholas Sparks novel, he is flawed and the poor guy he screws up. I can't say that I really blame him though, but that's beside the point. The point is their relationship works, because they have this crazy thing that they do called communication! It also helps that they are actually attracted to each other too, I mean you do have to have some level of attraction, I don't care what you say!I can't really pinpoint one thing that made me like the story so much, I think maybe it was a combination of the characters and just the whole premise of the novel itself, but I just picked it up and I just had to know.... are these two ever going to get together!And believe me, you'll want to know too!My only complaint..... I want more!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed Miranda and Andrew's story.  Miranda is the daughter of a baronet.  Since childhood she has been promised to the son and heir of the neighboring Earl.  Elizabeth, her betrothed's sister, is her best friend.  Miranda is a bit of a wallflower.  She is sweet, shy, and a gifted musician.  Julian, her betrothed, is a dissolute drunk.The hero, Andrew, is Julian and Elizabeth's cousin.  Andrew is an honorable gentleman who is also a gifted musician.  He has had a tendre for Miranda since his teenage years, but knows she is promised to his cousin.  Miranda, now 21 (or was it 22?) is almost in despair of Julian's ever marrying her.  As for Andrew, Miranda is quite intimidated by him as he is such an amazing pianist and he seems to be always criticizing her.Miranda and Julian are supposed to meet to attend the May Eve events together.  When Julian stands her up, Andrew steps in to accompany Miranda.  The events of that evening leads to Miranda questioning the feelings she think she's had for Julian all these years and to examine what her true feelings are for Andrew.  How Andrew and Miranda finally achieve their HEA makes a very interesting story.  There are a few obstacles that the couple must overcome, including Miranda's parents' intense opposition, before they can be together, but ultimately they are able to marry.Ms. Malin quite skillfully provides us with a well developed plot with three dimensional characters despite this being a novella.  "A Perfect Duet" is a very satisfying read.

$review_text.: I absolutely love a book that has me thinking about things and laughing all at the same time.Waiting for 2000 is one of these books. I love that Zack isn&#8217;t afraid to write comedy type books and make people smile while he&#8217;s doing it.All of the people on Bob&#8217;s ship are just hilariously funny and leave you wondering if most people really are that way. Well rich people that is. Each person on the ship has there own uniqueness about them and there own view of how things should be. This book is a breath of fresh air with all of it&#8217;s differences.I really enjoyed listening to Al and Sam talking about all the passengers and crazy things that keep going on on the ship. It&#8217;s a bit wild. But I promise this book will leave you grinning from ear to ear and it&#8217;s funniness is just enlightening. As always Zack has given me another book to say I loved and truly enjoyed reading. A must read.

$review_text.: The outstanding setting of the south carolina coastal region, a.k.a. the lowcountry, is surpassed by the well developed characters and politics that form the basis for this story. Carl Smith weaves a credible tale of corruption interspersing human vices and virutes ... greed, lust, infidelity, conceit, bigotry, humility, bravery, and honesty. Although the author brings the story to a satisfying conclusion, he leaves a several hooks for other Sam Larkin adventures. I highly recommend this book to readers who enjoy great southern fiction.

$review_text.: Let me state up front that I don't really like to read stories told in first person.  It annoys me!  Getting past that, I read the entire book and found too many irritating holes in the story with absolutely NO resolution.  The author hints at a major relationship between Loki and Odin, and major conflict with Thor.  The anger, punishment, and behaviour of those living among the gods was ridiculously irritating, and the author offered no hint of a reason or a resolution throughout the story.  I would honestly like to know what happens to Loki, but reading the next instalment was just too much trouble.  I never learned to like the heroin, her grandmother is either way too wise about mythology or she too has a hidden secret that also never gets shared.  If an author is going to lead me into an instalment before I will be allowed to see even the slightest hint of resolution, then tell me up front this is only half a story!  Don't put me through all the torture of getting involved in their lives and then end the book without giving me something!  I would possibly have read the next book, but it just wasn't worth it.  Sometimes it's better to cut your losses and move on.

$REVIEW.: I'm glad I read the book, but it lacked drama

The events described were related in a ho-hum manner rather than in the nerve-wracking intensity that undoubtedly took place

British understatement, perhaps


The theater of action and the time frame kept changing, making the story feel a bit disjointed
However, if the author's purpose was to highlight the role of the Hurricane and its pilots in the war effort, he did a superb job

The versatility, the ruggedness, and the performance of this fine bird has shone through clearly


Any true student of WWII owes it to himself to read this book.

I don't want to wade through lines, trying to find the message.The Color of Dawn by Amber Jerome-Norrgard is touchingly direct and revealing. As it navigates the story of her life we share her happiness, fondness, sadness and woes; which resonate with particular moments in our own lives. This collection covers love, loss, motherhood and lifestyle; aspects that we all experience, and shows a strength of character and resilience that is to be admired.

$REVIEW.: There are lots of novels about the Second World War and the Holocaust, but lately they are focusing on the ones who got away--lucky. How lucky were they really? I don't mean they weren't better off than people who were shipped to the death camps, but the people in this book, who went to England and the United States did not find anything remotely like their old lives in Germany, and it was no paradise. Louisa, a young Jewish girl, leaves Nuremberg (the most Nazified city of them all) to study in England. Her father, a lawyer, has enough foresight to see what is coming, and during the mid-30s he is able to get some of her grandmother's jewelry to her. Rolf and Otto, Louisa's childhood friends, get jobs in New York. Louisa runs out of money and is told the only job foreigners can get in England is as domestic servants. This is later confirmed by Gustav, their old family doctor, who knew many doctors and lawyers in Munich who were learning how to become butlers in hopes of getting a job in England. Through some lucky connections, Louisa is able to get a job as a governess. It's explained that during the hyperinflation of the 1920s, German children were starving, and many can't do heavy work. Eventually Louisa makes it to New York and marries Rolf. Their parents, left behind in Germany, go through the horrors of the Kristallnacht, and the three fathers are shipped to Dachau with other Jewish men. This is all totally accurate; there are whole books on the subject. Rolf manages to get his mother and Louisa's parents to America, but the Nazis confiscate most of their property and elderly people can't work. The doctor finds work as a translator and his daughter gets a job cleaning. The young men are drafted when the United States enters the war. Jews who were despised in Germany are now despised as Germans in America. Some people commit suicide. And Louisa, who seems to have the most luck, develops a medical problem that leaves her disabled.This is a really good book, based loosely on the author's parents' lives. The writing is spare and realistic. Just a few sentences about the men's experience in Dachau is enough to create the picture. This author doesn't need much graphic detail. She builds up the apprehension of what is happening to family left in Germany, the not knowing. Id really recommend this book. Of course the story is depressing, and people in those times had plenty to be depressed about. This novel reminded me of one called Displaced Persons that I read last year, a similar story of Jews who got out of Poland. If you like this one, you'll like that also.

$review_text.: This book was brilliant.  I love this series but I think we all became a bit complacent and took our "Action Boys" for granted.  We got comfortable in the knowledge that they loved each other and were together and would always be that way.  G A Hauser decided to shake things up a bit and added a scenario in this edition that definitely teaches us to appreciate that which we have in our lives and not to take them for granted.  My heart almost stopped beating I got such a fright and that is the sort of reaction that you would like to experience when you read a story.  It needs to keep you enthralled right to the end and boy did it ever.  I loved this book.  I cannot wait for the next book to see what is going to happen next.

$REVIEW.: Frigid is full of what Jennifer L Armentrout does best, and as J Lynn, she can push the limits a bit more. What does that mean? That means we get the same humour, the same witty banter and even more steamy & swoony scenes!Kyler and Sydney have been friends since kindergarten, always being there for each other through thick and thin. Once puberty hit the friendship continued but at some point both fell in love with each other, Sydney accepted it, Kyler didn't think he was good enough for Syd so he hid it in denial and a lot of casual dating and sex.Now, they're in college and continue being best of friends, Kyler taking care of Syd and finding fault in any guy that shows an interest on her with a "no guy is good enough for me, least of all me" mentality, and Syd is trying to continue being a friend to Kyler despite the continue hurting that his men-whore ways bring to her.Everything is bound to change when they get stuck in a big snow storm during their usual winter break retreat in the mountains, isolated and just the two of them. That means loads of tension, Syd taking a "to hell with it" attitude and Kyler having to face what he has been denying for a loong time! It is not an easy road for them, and since both of them have a lot of baggage to deal with: Syd mostly insecurities and Kyler mostly mistakes, they're gonna have a lot to deal with!I loved reading this book, and not even the wrong assumptions and confusions took me from enjoying Syd & Kyler, with their banter, the steamy chemistry and most of all, their insane loyalty to each other and their friendship.A 4 star read and the perfect summer book!

$REVIEW.: Gabriella is a young lady who enjoys her life in the country, treating animals and trying her best to keep up the veterinary practice left vacant by her deceased father.  Although her father was the second son of a Viscount, she was never given the opportunity to have a Season and in fact, would just as soon stay in the country making the best of her situation.  Her mother, however, has other ideas and persuades her older daughter, Angela and wife of a baronet, to invite Gabriella to London for a Season - invitation to include the provision of all the clothing and accoutrements necessary.Gabriella, knowing Angela is not a very pleasant woman, has no choice but to abide by her mother's wishes and heads out to London with her maid.  During the first stop of the post chaise, Gabriella sees a very sad, severely beaten horse being led to the stables and she goes off the deep end wanting to know who the owner is, etc.  When she finds out where the owner is ensconced, she accosts him, calling him to account for the treatment of the horse.  Unbeknownst to Gabriella, she has just encountered the Duke of Ravenham and he has other priorities than to take a scolding from someone who looks to be no more than a simple servant.  She realizes the best she can do is go treat the horse's wounds as best as she can and then gets back on the post chaise and continues on to London.Once she arrives in London, she is disheartened to learn that her sister is even more cold and calculating than she had previously thought.  Concurrently, the Duke of Ravenham (Dexter) has lost a wager and finds himself agreeing to &#34;take on&#34; a fresh young lady who has just arrived from the country and sponsor her for the Season.  Imagine his surprise when he realizes it is the young woman who gave him a scolding.  Imagine Gabriella's surprise when she realizes the man she confronted back at the inn is the almighty Duke of Ravenham.As time goes on, it seems Dexter might not be as cruel to animals as Gabriella thought and conversely, it seems that Gabriella, when dressed up and beautified doesn't seem quite so drab as the young lady who accosted Dexter at the inn.  This was a very refreshing read mostly due to the fact that Gabriella was feisty, honest, non-superficial and all that was honorable in her dealings with people.  In the end, these qualities gave her what she wanted in life.

$review_text.: Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of scary stories, scary movies, or anything that makes me want to sleep with all the lights on, however, this collection of stalker based reads are simply amazing. I was asked to give an honest review, and I can, without a doubt, tell you that these authors blew me away. Every single story drew me in, kept me in a trance, and spit me out wanting more! My favorite being Autumn (The season where everything dies) by Elizabeth Collins. Crazy chick who wants her man and will do anything to get him. Gave me major goosebumps! I will be looking up each and every one of these outstanding authors to see what else they have in store. If you like great authors, amazing story lines, and chills up your spin, you will love this book! 5 Stars, two thumbs up, A+!!!Side effects: May cause paranoia, looking over your shoulder, triple checking windows and doors and not sleeping.ENJOY!

$review_text.: Cree was like reading a diary, a very personal diary.  Millie opened up and shared her feelings, her thoughts, her fears, and most of all her love in every word of every paragraph throughout this entire story.  From the very beginning my emotions were raw and ever changing.  I was heartbroken with tears reading about Millie being abused and ultimately left by her horrendous parents.  Then I could feel her hope when she finally divorced the BASTARD and was able to make her life her own, starting with checking things off her bucket list and opening her own store.  The story just went up from there.  There were some rough moments, which for most of us would be just part of life, I worried if Millie would be able to hold on and keep the life she finally has.  Millie quickly proved how strong she was and that she was a heroine in this story.Then I met Cree, oh my goodness Cree (I say with a big sigh).  Farm boy, bacon cooking, barefoot, and shirtless Cree.  He is sexy, sweet, and in charge.  He lives his life for his girls, Annie his daughter and Millie.  Cree sacrifices without making it a big deal just to keep everyone else happy in his life.  Even when he was acting out he was alpha male.The best part of this story is Annie.  Annie is Cree&#8217;s daughter and is so absolutely the sweetest most loving little girl in the world.  She wins the hearts of everyone who comes into her world and never lets them go.Cree is an absolute amazing book.  It has everything I love and look for in a book.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  This is an adult book.  It has some language and some steamy scenes that are not appropriate for younger adults.

$review_text.: This is worth the read and while some beloved characters are lost some of the lesser known characters seem to rise up and take a more dominant position in this epic story telling. Everything is not as it seems and you'll be left guessing who is who and who is on what side. Below explains why I'm not able to go more in depth about this specific book.I was once again forced to read endlessly as I heard book 6 was soon to be released. About a week before book 6's release I picked up book 4 and 5. I then read in every free moment I had knowing that 6 would be purchased the second it was released. As a result Book 4 and Book 5 seem to run together and are more of a combined edition in my head.

$REVIEW.: I was reading through the reviews here and noticed that although most people are really enjoying my book, a few were taken aback. I'd like to mention a couple things so that someone who may not appreciate the book won't end up buying it. (Please read the summary in the editorial review section posted on this web page). A few people mentioned that the book is not about diving and/or involves drinking. I would like to make it clear that the book is a travelogue about the lifestyle of dive instructors in resort locations, not a text on scuba. If books with "Fear and Loathing" in the title don't appeal to you, you may not be making the best choice with this purchase. To all others who praised the book, (and sent encouraging e-mail), thank you very much. Getting positive comments helps make the whole project worthwhile.

$REVIEW.: The recipes do look yummy, but then I bought a 5# bag of Anthony's almond flour.  I did not realize how heavy the baked goods turned out because after all, the almond flour consists of solid almonds (only ground up.)  I thought my almond flour goodies would be as light as those made with white flour.  So it was a major disappointment when I found my recipes were not feather light, but it is a learning experience and somewhere in these  and other recipes, I will meet with some sort of success.Anyway, white flour is terrible for you since it contains gluten which is responsible for brain cell damage.  I gotta find a substitute and plan to make almond flour crackers as a bread substitute.  I am sure the cookie recipes would be good/  Not so sure about the pizza recipe, I mean, who wants heavy cardboard-like pizza crust??

$REVIEW.: This is one of C.S. Forester's first novels about war, published in 1936 and hence pre-dating Hornblower.Like almost all the novels which Forester wrote before he created the Hornblower books, this is brilliant, far less well known today than it deserves, and consequently quite rare. The author H.G. Wells described "The General" as "a magnificent piece of work."Some of Forester's other books, particularly those describing battles against opponents of whom he strongly disapproved of such as Hitler's nazis or indeed Napoleon, can come over as patriotic to the point of jingoism or chauvinism. This story does not come into that category and it would not be far from the truth to call it one of the first great anti-war novels.If you collect books about war, and you are fortunate enough to find a copy of "The General" for sale at a remotely reasonable price, buy it at once.This novel describes the military career of a fictional first world war general. It begins and ends between the wars, with a sharp pen-picture of the retired general Curzon sitting in a bathchair on Bournemouth Promenade, having lost his leg during the great war and never managed to learn to walk properly with an artificial one.Then the story goes back to Curzon's first battle as a subaltern in 1899 during the Boer war, and follows him through to the climax of the book at the battle of St Quentin on March 21st 1918 when the last desperate German offensive nearly snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.Forester appears to have set out to do three things; to entertain, inform, and explain. He entertains with an engaging story; he informs by describing the ghastly conditions and waste of life which was the first world war in the trenches; and he tries to explain one possible answer to the question of how British commanders could possibly have given the orders which sent hundreds of thousands of young men to their deaths.One of the most memorable passages in the book describes the debate as generals and senior staff officers of an army corps prepared a report of why the attack they had just organised had failed and how to succeed next time. "In some ways it was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed they were devising methods of applying more force still ... they could hardly be blamed for not guessing that by rotating the screw it would come out after the exertion of far less effort".But that does not mean that Forester is simply repeating the popular caricature of First World War generals as dangerous idiots. Although he is critical of the mistakes of the generals who wasted so many lives, his criticism is far more sophisticated than the old "Lions led by donkeys" cliche.Although Curzon, the central figure of this book, is old fashioned and conventional, he is intelligent enough to change his mind when confronted with clear evidence of the need to do so, and decisive enough to enforce that change of mind on others when many men would freeze in panic. Had he been as stupid as some reviewers make out, Curzon would not have survived the first few months of World War 1, let alone been rapidly promoted.He is intelligent enough to realise that his men need to eat and to make sure that they are fed properly, and to make use of officers who understand newfangled things like engineering, railways, or how many men it takes to carry a gas canister. He is ruthless enough to sack staff officers who are not up to the job even when one of them is his wife's cousin.Within minutes of arriving at the front and seeing what artillery and machine-guns can do, Curzon abandons his pre-war attitude of deliberately evading training on how to dig trenches, and instead orders his men to dig for their lives, demanding compliance from junior officers who are afraid that the men might get dirt on their uniforms. "God damn it, man!" he explodes, "Get your men digging, and don't ask damn fool questions."In the first round of battles in the Great War, heroic efforts from Curzon in the face of greatly superior german numbers prevent the British from being flanked and probably defeated at the First Battle of Ypres. Having fought with distinction up to this point, he is promoted to much more senior positions. But then things start to go wrong.Forester makes a great many good points about the need to use the tactics which will win the current battle rather than the last war: indeed, that  even the tactics which won earlier battles of the current war should be dropped if they are out of date. But that is not the only message he is trying to put over.The main theme of "The General" is a World War One version of the Peter Principle. The very qualities which make Curzon successful on the battlefield up to and including the command of a brigade have disastrous consequences for England when he is a Lieutenant-General commanding an army corps, and when both he and all the other senior officers of the army are still displaying the characteristics which colonels and brigadiers need to hold their regiments in the line.Forester states quite explicitly in the book that the very strengths of the World War One generals, not just their weaknesses, were part of the problem. I quote - "It might have been ... more advantageous to England if the British Army had not been quite so full of men of high rank who were so ready for responsibility, so unflinchingly devoted to their duty, so unmoved in the face of difficulties, of such unfaltering courage."This book is an unforgettable classic.

$REVIEW.: The cookbook is bound a bit differently than I've seen before, with spiral binding along the top third and the bottom third. There are pictures for at least half, and probably more, of the finished dishes and they are inspiring. The ingredients are called out clearly, the directions are clear and just detailed enough. Most recipes fit on a single page or are at least on facing pages (I hate having to turn a page in the middle of cooking!). Aside from all that, they "read" great (I'm pretty good at interpreting recipes by reading them through at this point) and the three I've tried have been fantastic.If all you're looking for is Ramen noodle recipes, tuna melts, and grilled cheese sandwiches, pick up a different book. But if you're looking for creative recipes that will be fun to cook and don't require much special equipment, buy this book or send it to your budding college cook.  I had hoped to have my daughter try out a few recipes but somehow summer job and a social life has gotten in the way. I sent her off to college with this book (after photocopying a few recipes!) since she has a kitchen in her dorm and is looking forward to cooking.

$REVIEW.: This is an edited edition of Darwin's "Voyage of the HMS Beagle."  A good bit of the original text is left out
 But one still gets most of the story and the illustrations help several episodes come to life

 It would be an especially good book to give to a child, tween or teen who is interested in Darwin or science in general, but who probably wouldn't have the patience to wade through all his 19th Century prose
 I only wish someone would put out a TRUE Annotated version of Darwin's original text, and do it in the much more reader friendly style of coffee-table books today


 Now that would be well worth reading, discussing and generally enjoying!  There are at least five different English language "Annotated Walden's" on the market, -- tho' oddly not a single one of "A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers" -- so surely this classic first work of science and literature by Thoreau's equally famous contemporary, -- a work Thoreau clearly loved and even cites in Walden, -- deserves at least a single annotated edition of its own to gratify all the latter-day, armchair "natural historians" our nature-obsessed age has produced.

$REVIEW.: I took a chance on this book based on previous reviews 

I got a lot for my 99 cents.What a treat to read.Don't let the cover and title fool you, this book could easily be the cost of a best seller

The story line was rich in content and neatly tied together


The story never lagged

I was amazed with the how the author Merabeth James managed to cover so many genres; Romance, Paranormal, Gothic, Mystery, History and Travel


There are not many books that grab my attention like this one did

I did not want to put it down.Merabeth packs in a lot of suprises along the way.I could not wait to see what happens next

It would be on my keeper shelf but I downloaded it on kindle

Do yourself a favor, if you are a romantic who enjoys stories by authors like Karen Marie Moning, Cindy Miles or Lynn Kurland, spend the 99 cents and download this book


But try not to read it too fast because you will find yourself wishing for a sequel.I am getting ready to download her other title "Sanctuary Annie".I can't wait to start reading it


Please write more Merabeth !

But throw in that most students cannot afford to attend at a Christian college so it gets much tougher.This book will help the student and or parent deal with the challenge of attending college in America today.There is no dispute that the majority of professors are very liberal


They are also very aggressive at pushing their liberal views onto to students
In many circumstances, students who do not agree are out right abused for not embracing atheism.I am only touching on one challenge that students face

$REVIEW.: This is the first book to paint a real picture of Osama Bin Laden's ideology in real terms

The letters declaring War against America should have been released to the public and discussed with at least as much vigor as the "Laci Peterson Case" or the idiot rape case in Colorado

Instead, the American Public has been duped by the media moguls and again by the politico's and their pundits into some false sense of safety


It is too bad that we have the attention span of five year olds as is thoroughly demonstrated throughout our social consciousness.Osama Bin Laden doesn't care if you are liberal or conservative, gay or straight, educated or uneducated, rich or poor, or even an athiest but watch out if you are a Christian or a Jew
HE HATES ALL and is DETERMINED to DESTROY ALL that is not Traditional Islam


He despises our weaknesses and the fact that we import these things to Arabian countries


He has used our liberal, must tolerate everything, politically correct society against us..
in fact...he literally took it to the BANK


THIS society is bankrolling his Jihad along with Muslim extremist societies around the world

He laughs at the fact that we have no backbone in this country and stand for nothing....except some arbitrary concept called "Freedom" which has been taken far out of context in our society
Everything LIBERAL AMERICA espouses....from the Hollywood elitists to the Michael Moore idiots, is exactly what Bin Laden sites as a reason for his Jihad.....WE DO NOT STAND TOGETHER proud of who we are....we have allowed ourselves to be divided by special interests and this year more than any other....liberal interests that are more concerned with power than with people.....Bin Laden singles out Clinton and his actions with Lewinsky going unpunished and his turning tail in Somalia as examples of our "cowardice." He blames the United States for what the United Nations, France, Germany, and Russia did in scamming the world in the "Oil for Food Program." Yet Kerry wants to buddy up with exactly these people who put each and every one of us in jeopardy


Kerry isn't helping and he won't make us safer or safe


He is divisive and has created a chasm in a self serving attempt to regain the White House.There is no negotiating with Bin Laden and his group......and as best I can tell.....we can't even figure out who his lackey's are here in the United States because they came in during the Clinton years and settled into our society as members indistinguishable from our neighbors

He is ready to do the utmost at all costs to take us out, one by one if necessary, and make us pay!!!!Sadly, we aren't ready for a thing
The American public is interested only in their own petty lives


They no longer vote, but Bin Laden is holding each member of our society accountable because we can, and therefore to him we are all legitimate targets

He takes our freedoms more seriously than we do and in that respect he has a point

We have allowed ourselves to be overtaken with immoral, ignoble ideology that has created more harm than good and more trouble than help.WE ARE NOT ONE BIT SAFER TODAY.....BOTH politcal parties are responsible because they don't wish to OFFEND anyone

WHERE ARE THE ADULTS in this society? Where are those that say enough of this behavior, it's time for responsible decisions even if at times offensive.....like it or not....Bin Laden will hold us accountable for what we have failed to hold our politicians accountable for.Who cares what you drive or what rights you think you're entitled to or what amount of fat is in a hamburger or what Jesus would eat or what "value" which party currently holds......IF THIS BOOK IS CORRECT and BIN LADEN has suitcase Nuclear weapons...this country will have a rude awakening and will be required to take a good hard look at itself and it's leaders the self serving, self interested, demagogues who haven't done a thing to make us safer.So, the next time you get on a plane and have to take your shoes off or give up your cuticle scissors.....remember the fact that those intending to do us harm ARE REAL and ARE HERE NOW while we screen for shoe bombs and scissors that couldn't do as much harm as a ball point pen
Always playing catch up
The irony is that so much of our tax dollars have been wasted from the local entities to the national entities that could have secured this country through updated technology and training and instead of politically dividing national security agencies our government should have been demanding a spirit of cooperation
Shame on us for what we have allowed our government to get away with while sitting back hoping to get ours.SO MUCH FOR AN OPEN SOCIETY!!!!!!!

$REVIEW.: Two stars for this book. Initially, I wanted to give it one star but I changed my mind.There are several only loosely related stories in the book. The main one is based on 'cellular memory', a 100% figment of imagination. I never heard of it before but Google helped: it is a scientifically preposterous claim that not only our brains but our DNA provide storage for our personal memories. Furthermore, any organ transplant (brains cannot be transplanted, yet) can pass these memories from the donor DNA to the recipient brain. A slight alternative is also mentioned in the book: somehow the 'souls' of the donor and the recipient can merge. The second one, of course, is completely outside the realm of science but may be acceptable to religious people.However, once you accept this fantasy as reality, you may be able to enjoy the book, somewhat. I did not personally enjoy it at all but I forced myself to read it anyway just to evaluate the author's skills as a narrator. Hence not a complete rejection of the book - they guy knows how to write in a language bit 'alien' to someone fluent in US English but understandable enough.So two stars, more like one and half.The 'official' description warns about 'explicit language' but says nothing about the 'supernatural'. On the contrary, it says "a true medical mystery that scientists and doctors do not yet understand". True? I do not think so although, apparently, movies and TV shows about this fictitious phenomenon (cellular memory) have been already made.Not recommended to anyone who prefers reality to total fantasy. It is even not a good science fiction.

$REVIEW.: Extremely well laid out, this iconic book is valuable to get a birds-eye view about the Children's Book market and personal remarks from some of its known publishers and agents. (I really enjoyed these "Q&A;" interviews with editors, author suggestions and other 'side-bars'.) Still, this book is what I would call a 'scaffolding tool'. I mean, you have to read this book with an attentive spirit, take a lot of the information seriously, but then RESEARCH more. AND do not take all items stated as 'Bible'. As a reference book, it's already aging!For example, there is a superb section "Book Publishers". Most publishers are listed. With each listing is the address & webpage, acquisition team info' (editors, etc.), the type of books they publish, how to contact them and other information. However, a writer intended to be published, must go to each website, cross reference and update the information you find.I bought this book in 8/2009 (mind you this IS a 2010 reference) and in my own efforts, looking at each publisher's web site, I found enough info' in the "Book Publishers" section to be 'incorrect'. Of course this makes sense...the book was likely written and finalized at the beginning of this year!Keep in mind, the market is fluid, editors change jobs, companies are tightening their acquisition preferences and some have very, very clear specifics relative to how and what to submit and most importantly, even if you should submit a manuscript(Seriously, some even tell you their preferred envelope type. FOLLOW their directions to a 't').Do you homework! Good luck!

$review_text.: "Serbian and Yugoslav Mauser Rifles" is one of the titles from North Cape Publications' "For Collectors Only Series" and, like the other titles in this series, information regarding these specific types of firearms is very complete, including: production tables, identifying markings, model specifications and historical context. Pictures and illustrations are basic black and white, photos are historical, all are of a high enough quality to serve their purpose. I was easily able to identify the origins and general history of a Yugo 1924/47 I recently purchased.The book begins with the first Serbian produced firearm in 1832 and wraps up with the Model 1993 50 BMG Black Arrow Sniper ifle, however the concentration is as the title implies, Serbian Mausers.  There is also as encapsulated history of Serbia - Yugoslavia in the context of wars and government. I grew up with the work "Yugoslavia" and Serbia was not something that was a part of my geographic vocabulary, so in this respect the book was helpful in more broad terms. It is an interesting historical work, it is accurate and an excellent research resource and well worth the money to anyone who owns or is contemplating buying one of the firearms of this origin.

$REVIEW.: Initially I thought that the reason I didn&#8217;t like Southern Fried Sushi was because it was a heavy handed Christian novel. I don&#8217;t generally read many Christian titles but there&#8217;s been a few here and there that I&#8217;ve picked up for free on my Kindle&#8230;and generally I&#8217;ve been able to enjoy them. This one however I felt was too heavy handed, one too many times did I have biblical verses shoved down my throat that completely took any enjoyment I was getting out of the novel away.Then I really thought about it and I realized that not only did I dislike all the verses being shoved down my throat (in what I felt was a clumsy way at that) I also realized that I absolutely could not stand Shiloh. In fact, I downright hated her. She was stupid, her morals were terrible and she was so judgemental that I wanted to punch her in the face. It was absolutely hell trying to put up with Shiloh. I don&#8217;t know how I managed to get through this.

He got these female lacing him with the latest gear and lining his pockets.This is my first book by Cairo and will not be my last

This book is about a male gigolo who is essentially addicted to sex but will not admit it
Alex lets female know he is just about sleeping with them and wants nothing more so if someone gets their feelings hurt it on them


Cairo wrote a gritty straight up book about what signs a female should be looking for so a man won't take them for all they got
In reality there are a lot of males out there that does the same thing and this book gives you the sign.The language is not for the faint of heart and is writing in straight streets but you will laugh out loud, shake you head but overall you will love this book, I know I do.

$REVIEW.: At the risk of sounding preachy, if you do anything with teenagers in your life, even if you are just a next-door-neighbor, this is a must read. The explanations for the reasons behind self-harm are so clear when we see them through Kendra's eyes. As someone who had a charmed childhood with nothing more than the usual bumps in the road, this really helped me see why more and more teens are coming to my classroom with criss-crossed jagged scars from self-harm.All too often, these students are sneered at for being strange, when they are truly being misunderstood. I am guilty of it myself. Despite having taught in a juvenile correctional facility for the past five years, working with some of the most abused and troubled kids imaginable, when we would get reports that a new inmate was a "cutter," I wouldn't immediately think of a scared individual who was trying to maintain some level of control over her life. I shamefully admit it, I would think, "Oh great. Another crazy one."After reading Scars, I now see the error behind my judgements. Reinfield drags us by the hand through Kendra's mindset, forcing us to see the hurting person that she is. We stand right beside her while the pressure and fear slowly builds until she can't breathe, made to watch while she hurts herself yet again.I read some reviews that were displeased with the graphic descriptions of Kendra's self-injurious behavior, but that is the reality for so many young people. We have to know what's happening so we can be one of the few people in their lives that they can slowly begin to trust.

$REVIEW.: Fourteen year old Everett Singh belongs to the Divorcedads.com forum where children swap tales of embarrassing dad stories.  Knowing his dad is different after all he named him after a dead scientist, on a rainy cold December night in London Everett follows his quantum physicist father Tejendra with both riding their bikes.  The teen notices a black car following his dad with no attempt to pass him.  Suddenly three men get out and abduct Tejendra to the shock and fear of Everett.  He tells his mom, the police and his dad's boss at the lab, but no one seems disturbed by the kidnapping except the victim's son.Not long after his father was snatched, Everett, a math prodigy, receives a complex digital map, the Infundibulum, which enables him to plot an infinite number of alternate worlds.  He realizes his dad was kidnapped because the leaders of Ten Known Worlds alliance and others want the Infundibulum.  The lad flees to an electro-punk Britain where Sen, the adopted daughter of Captain Anastasia Sixsmyth of the Everness dirigible, tries to steal the infinity map, but fails.  Soon these two people from different worlds become friends and allies as enemy agents hunt for Everett and the Infundibulum.The first Everness young adult science fiction thriller is a terrific tale starring a brave, intelligent teenage Planesrunner who adapts too easily to whatever he goes up against.  The storyline is fast-paced from the opening abduction and never slows down.  With a nod to Time Bandits, filled with plenty of action, a vivid alternate realm, plenty of humor, and a precocious teen hero, fans will want to join Everett and the crew of the Everness in their rescue attempt.Harriet Klausner

$review_text.: This book focuses on photographing the highlights of the respective countries of the world. In some cases it may be just one photo, or could be a multiple set.  However, each country only is allowed the same amount of pages, hence even small countries get the same "page space" as the largest in the world.  Although it may seem fair, this formula may or may not work, depending on how you look at the issue, as some countries have so many subcultures of their own that it's hard to generalize the one country itself.I thought everything was fairly well placed.  There is not much in the way of textual information but this is not the aim of the book.  There are plenty of almanac-type books out there so this does not try to replicate them in any way, but instead just focuses on the photography.  For this reason I think the objective of the book was well done.Only caveat is I would've like to have seen more pages in the book so that more photos could be included.  The entire world is an ambitious project to do so a few more pages wouldn't have hurt.

$review_text.: A light, fast read geared to the adolescent male.  The thin plot line - super hero warrior out to save family and the universe - is used merely to set up the next long action sequence.  If first person shooter video games are your bag, then I suspect you are the target audience for Birthright.  Still, considering the cheap 99 cent download, one can't complain too much.  The book does have a strange text format as it's hard to figure out where one paragraph ends and the next one begins.  Be advised the book does not have `go to chapter' function.

Kirin is Teigen`s Sherlock and every bit as cool. Kaye Wagner brings his characters and scenes to life with the finesse of an experienced writer and artist- a combination that is indeed rare to find in an author these days. This novel sucked me right in and I was enthralled all the way until the third story was finished, and then I was sad! It was over! We need more soon! The scene has been set and the main players introduced for what should be a very engaging and entertaining series.In my opinion, I could see these as awesome graphic novels or movies as well!This was a fantastic read and I could not put it down. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys dystopian sci fi literature or anyone looking for a change from their normal mysteries. Well done!

$review_text.: I liked the synopsis and was looking forward to reading Charles Prandy&#8217;s debut novel featuring Detective Jacob Hayden. I must say that the story starts off pretty fast paced and it didn&#8217;t take me long to like Hayden. He&#8217;s a solid cop with a great career and home life. However, as most fictional Detectives know, that status doesn&#8217;t normally last long and the same must be said for Jacob.The chapters are short and sharp and I couldn&#8217;t help drawing comparisons with James Patterson&#8217;s Alex Cross series. I can only assume that Prandy has been heavily influenced by these sorts of books. That said, he has also delivered an incredibly good book. It only took me a day to finish and I instantly went on to purchase the second book in the series (both of which were under 1 on Kindle). Hayden is likeable, the story and plot involving what starts out as a simple murder, turns into something much more complex and had various elements which adds to the suspense.Characters that heavily feature in the story such as Judge Frank Peter&#8217;s were sometimes verging on the clich&eacute;d, but it certainly didn&#8217;t detract from my enjoyment of the story. There were certain elements which were a little too close to the &#8216;far fetched&#8217; side of the line, but again it&#8217;s Prandy&#8217;s debut and I can only see his books improving over time. Although the story and characters are nothing new, there is a certain likeability factor here and the writing also kept me focused and attentive. I think a solid 4 out of 5 is deserved for this book and think the majority of people will really like it. All in all, I really enjoyed this and think it won&#8217;t take long for Prandy to gain quite a big following. I can only hope that he continues with a good series and doesn&#8217;t become too predictable. This book is certainly for fans of the Patterson type of book and for the price it&#8217;s a bargain as well.

$REVIEW.: A mother goes on a search for the daughter she&#8217;d given up for adoption. She finds the adoptive mother and learns that the adoptive mother never got around to letting her know that she was adopted. Even though there is another adopted child in the family who knows he&#8217;s adopted. Molly Harper is the daughter and it turns out she had a nice life and is actually an Oscar winning actress with a famous husband. A husband who nobody knows has dumped her and he actually did It over the phone. The Jerk!The adoptive mother was in her way nice, rich and a bit of a traditionalist. The biological mother went on to have more kids after she had to give up the kid and the dad and his family wanted nothing to do with the mother or the child. She was shocked to learn her daughter was so famous. Imagine Molly&#8217;s shock when she learns she&#8217;s adopted. She eventually comes to terms with it and everything becomes alright with the world again. Definitely a real good story with likable characters and you really like Molly, her adoptive mom and the biological mom that set out to find her. They all go on an incredible journey. Pick it up, you&#8217;ll definitely like it.

Mark does a fantastic job of letting her find her way and make her mistakes
He makes his own but I personally feel like Cadence overreacted but, she is 18


What do you expect? She is maturing and in parts of the story you will be proud of her.This story will make you laugh, and make you wanna cry

In the end it is about to lost souls finding love with each other
S Walden does an amazing job telling this story

 Right from the start this book captured my attention, the writing is superb and so descriptive, I felt like I was right there with the characters


 This book has a lot to offer....mystery, suspense, romance....I laughed, I cried, and I felt many emotions throughout
 And, I'll even admit, I actually liked the &#34;ghost&#34; part of the book....it was done in way that it just flowed naturally and I really enjoyed every part of it

 I'm excited for the next installment based on where this book left off....can't wait to see what is in store for Graciela next.

The author wasted more time on details of her surroundings and her thoughts on sex with him

This book could of been good and I honestly do not understand all the high reviews


It's seems now a days, readers are easily impressed by constant sex scenes, instead of a good story

I like the sex scenes, don't get me wrong, too much of it kills the book.I won't be reading anymore of Jasinda Wilders books

$REVIEW.: This novel left me feeling empty, confused and bored.  Perhaps it could have been a thriller if each character had not spent pages upon pages of reminiscence or longed for glory.Also, The author switched point of view frequently and took her time letting us know which who was thinking, or speaking.Many, many loose ends, seemingly important characters that were poorly explained.Sorry, I just did not care for this story, I think with a good editor that has an eye for story continuity it could be shaped into a decent tale.

$review_text.: Relationship Marketing is a networking guide for bloggers and pretty much anyone who wants to make powerful connections online.I know the author from BlogcastFM, which is a popular podcasting site about successful bloggers and online entrepreneurs.Judging from those interviews and Mr


Rao's vast connections, he's more than credible to write a book about building relationships online.Now, let's talk about the book.The writing style is casual and straight to the point - don't expect a scientific Shakespeare in this one

Personally - I like this style becausemost of the how-to books out there are full of fillers and stiff language.Nothing in this guide is revolutionary either, but you get a lot of practical advice that you can act on STRAIGHT AWAY.Since I'm a practical person who loves actionable advice, this really turned me on.Get this book, if you want to:expand your influence onlinemake kick-ass connectionspromote yourself/and your brand onlineIn short: It's a rock-solid infotaining networking know-how guide that's both useful and fun to read.

$REVIEW.: Its amazing! Most romance novels are either too trashy, over the top, and can be considered more like cheap smut than fine literature. But this book is none of that! It is amazing! It describes the best type of romance between the main character and the love interest. The business setting is hard to understand but it does not deter from the story. It is eloquently written with plenty of intrigue and mystery. So its not just the romance that gets you hooked, it's the whodunnit factor as well. All in all this book rocks! Its realistic, and straight to the point. Buy it, read it, and review it because it is so worth it!

$REVIEW.: This book was completely unexpected even though the blurb is pretty clear on what this book is about. I think I went into this book with preconceived notions on what this book would be about and the conflicts that would arise. I was so very wrong and that is what kept me unable to put this book down.If you are on the fence about this book, I urge you to read the Prologue. It explains how Mason got into his line of work and I became so fascinated with the story I had to keep reading. I&#8217;ve read some other stories where the hero is a gigolo, but I knew this one was different from the very beginning.When Reese sees Mason across the campus, she is instantly smitten with him. However, before she even gets to meet him, she finds out that he is a gigolo. This was surprise number one for me. I was surprised that it would be out in the open that Mason was a gigolo and that the heroine would find out right away. I loved that Mason never tries to lie about it either. Reese and Mason get to know one another without the gigolo issue as a secret &#8211; this storyline played out in such an interesting way.This book is classic New Adult &#8211; jam packed with all the angst and sexual tension that I love in books in this genre. Reese is not delusional, she knows what Mason does and despite her growing feelings for him she keeps telling herself she can&#8217;t have him. I understood her dilemma and really felt for her. What do you do when you want someone so bad and you know they want you, but there something you cannot get over? Gah I was frustrated for her and for once I understood when she kept going back and forth with her feelings for him.I have a bleeding heart for Mason Lowe. Yes, he voluntarily entered into his profession, but it was out of complete necessity and once he was in it was almost impossible to get out of it. He has never even had a relationship because of what he does, so when he meets Reese he is forced to really look at what he is doing to decide if it is worth it. His story really touched me and I couldn&#8217;t help feel exactly how Reese felt about him.At first I was a little put off by the way Reese thought and talked about him &#8211; like he was a piece of meat &#8211; but then when she started to get to know him and realized that there was so much more, I instantly forgave her, especially after all the times she would come to Mason&#8217;s defense to anyone who ever said anything remotely negative about him.And then there was Reese&#8217;s past. I loved that I, the reader, knew what she was hiding, yet the people around her did not. I liked how this plot point played out in the background of Reese and Mason&#8217;s story. It added an extra element to the story that wasn&#8217;t necessarily needed but definitely appreciated to add dimension to the storyline.Given Mason&#8217;s line of work, I was worried there would be situations he would find himself in that would make me cringe. Unfortunately, it did happen &#8211; once. As much as I respect and understand the reason he put himself in that situation, I cringed the entire time and felt like I myself had to scrub my eyes for reading that part. I know I am being vague here, but once you read the book I think you will know the exact moment I am talking about. Was it necessary to the story? Maybe &#8211; I keep going back and forth in my head. I&#8217;ll let you read it and decide for yourself.This book was exactly what I was looking for on a lazy weekend afternoon. I could not put the book down because my angst level was at a high the entire time. I loved that Mason being a gigolo was a known fact between him and Reese so there was no subterfuge involved them. Oh and bonus points to the author for throwing in Harry Potter facts and references &#8211; this pushed me over the edge, especially with the image of Mason sprawled out on a couch reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.I highly recommend you read this book if you like New Adult romances that don&#8217;t follow a predictable storyline. If you want  book that has angst and will keep you on the edge of your seat, then this is the book for you!!

$REVIEW.: Ah, "Battle Royale". 42 kids, mostly about 15 - 16 years old, stuck on a small island, fighting and killing each other in a variety of ways as gruesome as any you'd see in a "Friday the 13th" film. What's not to love?The basic story is still the same as in the other forms of this work. Some of the deaths are different. Some of the choices the characters make are different (especially Shuya, who doesn't really bloody his hands in the movie, but gets them quite red in this book). The lighthouse scene is as delightful as ever.The novel is not without it's flaws. The localization is a little iffy in some areas and the pace drags somewhat at times. You also don't get any hint of the relationships between the gentleman who is running the program and some of the students.I've seen the movie, read about half the manga, and now read the novel, and of the three, I have to say the novel is clearly best medium. It gives the characters more depth and more feeling. It makes the whole thing seem more real. It also gives you a little more of the alternate universe this series is set in.Of course a little bit of warning: this book is not for kids. I wouldn't let anyone under about the age of thirteen read it. And I'd be scared of anyone over 13 who reads it and uses a highlighter in certain areas...Still, a good read all around. Recommended!

 I wasn't crazy about the book cover (actually the color scheme; though much improved from the previous one) but once I started reading I was hooked

 There was something hypnotic about Ms
Parker's writing and this was my kind of love story

 It had heart, adventure, mystery, magic, twists, and a love triangle that rocked!  I seriously did the squeeze-chest-shoulders-giddy-claps with a big grin after finishing the read because I was so happy.I'm a bit apprehensive about reading the rest of the installments because I loved the ending to this so much that I don't want anything shaken

 As far as I'm concern, this book was perfect as is

 I was fulfilled
Yet, I want to experience and revisit this type of adventure again so I'm definitely continuing


 I've fallen in love with the world of Tallenmere!Let me tell you why this romance novel worked for me
 It was tender, exquisite, passionate, and down right heartfelt
 It had the elements of Disney's Brave mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and Robin Hood in family dynamics and adventure

 I giggled, I cried, and I cheered


 It really was an intoxicatingly fun read.Thank you Ms
Parker!  You are now on my list of favorite authors

$REVIEW.: I was interested in seeing another take on the post-apocalyptic genre in &#34;Renewal,&#34; but I ultimately didn't like the book


The backstory was implausible, and seemed to have a number of holes
(Where was Europe in this global conflict?) Quite a bit of this book is spent telling this backstory, to the detriment of the rest of the plot
In fact, &#34;Renewal&#34; seems more like a setup for the next book than anything worth reading alone

There is little significant plot advancement, and I had trouble investing myself in the story.

$review_text.: Don't Look Back AgnesA short story concentrating mostly on the psychological as it delves into Agnes' memories of her kidnapping, the regret of the loss of her friends' lives, and the guilt that she escaped to continue to live and mourn them.  Her confusion over the sudden appearances of a mysterious EMT-driver Herb, and his plausible but unsatisfactory explanations, as well as the things she tries to convince herself she doesn't see, all add to the chills.I personally felt a little more should've been done with Officer Ben's interest in Agnes but he was a good, stalwart rock for her to fall back on, and since this was her story, and she had to face her demons alone, perhaps that was best.A chilling little story, short of gruesomeness, long on tension.In This HouseBernard and Althea are growing older, spending most of their time reading the papers, going to Senior Citizens' Bingo night, or to the funerals of their friends.  But they love each other, and are happy together, and that's what's important.  While the land around them is being renovated and leveled through Progress, they think of happier times, and what has been, not what will be...My Opinion:  A sweet love story, a nostalgic, bittersweet ghost story, In this House has a bit of a Twilight Zone-ish quality about it.  Readers may guess the end of the story but that won't stop them from enjoying both the way it's written as well as the touching ending.

This first short part of the series was on point form the very beginning of the story to the very last sentence. In this installment we get introduce to the very sexy biker/attorney Flint and the sexy curvy veterinarian Kendra. Kendra was called out on a house call to come save  animal but little did she know it wasn't an  animal it was a human and very alpha male. This short story packs all the goods of a full length novel. It has action,some romance and the passion between the two is pure FIYAH!!!

I love a woman who has claws and isn't afraid to use them!Rune Alexander is on the hunt! She wants the head of the C.O.S. Bach Horner, he took the twins Levi and Denim away from Shiv Crew and Lex told the crew that they were being tortured. There isn't anything that Rune won't do to get them back. Along the way to finding them they are given a case of a bird shifter who was nailed onto a wall...the more that Rune finds out about the bird shifters the more that she begins to suspect that they might be involved with the COS, but why would a group of others help the one group who is determined to eradicate all others completely?As the bodies start to pile up Rune shares her concerns with her Berserker,but he completely dismisses her concerns, he assures her that she is wrong. As the crew is betrayed and Rune is kidnapped it looks like she might not make it out of the hands of COS, and Rune feels like the one person she could count on has not only let her down; but also the entire crew. With so much anger bubbling up in her, Rune lets her &#34;monster&#34; off the leash. She now understands that she can no longer separate herself from her monster, if she wants to save herself and the twins she needs to embrace her unique talents.....before COS is able to call a demon forth.Enjoy the next thrilling adventure of Shiv Crew and see how Rune and her crew save the day! There were moments of tears, and sheer frustration;so have your box of tissues handy! This is one book you won't want to miss!

$REVIEW.: Vincent Sorenson ranks right up there with Christian Grey and Gideon Cross!  He's hot, a billionaire and he has a woman he wants no matter what!Kristen Daley is an analyst with the firm Waterbridge-Howser, a wealth management firm.  She has been given the rare opportunity for someone in her position to present a proposal to a billionaire client along with her boss.  The client is Vincent Sorenson.Mr. Sorenson agrees to hire Waterbridge-Howser to manage his money but only if Ms. Daley is his direct contact.  He not only saw the brilliance in her work but he wants her to be his.  But despite feeling a strong attraction to Vincent, Kristen is avoiding any kind of relationship with him.  Part of her reasoning is that Vincent probably just wants a fling and she's not that type of girl.  But she also has a dark secret from her past that makes her gun shy to enter into any type of relationship. But a successful man like Vincent Sorenson doesn't give up easily.Vincent: &#34;You're attracted to me and I'm attracted to you.  We're getting somewhere.&#34;Kristen-I flushed with embarrassment.  It was an unintentional admission.  &#34;No we're not.  There's no way I'm having sex with you in your office.&#34;  Vincent: &#34;I can pleasure you in so many ways beyond sex.  Let me show you.&#34;To keep her job and Vincent Sorenson's account, Kristen will have to spend a lot of one on one time with the charismatic Vincent.  Will she be able to keep a strictly professional relationship with this sexy man or will he wear down her defenses?Just as Kristen is beginning to feel comfortable with Vincent her past comes back to terrorize her but she doesn't want to burden Vincent with her past even though she could be in danger.I'm afraid I'm not making this book sound as exciting as it really is but I'm trying to avoid spoilers.  This book is hot and steamy!  The main characters are well defined.  And the book is well written.  I highly recommend this book...especially if you liked the &#34;Crossfire&#34; series and the &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; series.The writer does leave the reader with a big cliff hanger!  The good news is that all 3 of the books are already out in this series.
$SUMMARY.: Hot, steamy, boyfriend material hero!  Awesome read!

The author of this well written tale has a knack for describing Bud's environment, the heat of the summer, the tawdry homestead, and the taste of dirt in his mouth.I rooted for Bud from start to finish and hope there is a sequel to see how Bud manages in later life to overcome his early childhood.

$REVIEW.: I was given this book free to review from Waterbrook Multnomah.I must say that I'm glad I didn't buy it.  I was very excited to read it when it came, but was very disappointed once I had read it.  I think that I am just not at a stage of my life for this book to be relevant to me, nor is the country in a financial state for it to be as relevant as it was 10 years ago when it was written.On top of that, I felt that the author used out of context scripture and circular logic to argue his point many times.  He began every chapter with an out of place cliche or a story about a miserable millionaire.  (Plus based on his other book titles, it seems that he fancies himself to be C.S. Lewis, but his eloquence is definitely lacking...)I did not disagree with many things that he said, mostly just the way he put things.  I do think that people should give as they are able.  He did try to make an argument for what types of organizations should be given to and which are not as worthwhile, and I think that is a very personal decision that he has not much business delving into.I also did not like how he assumed all of his readers had plenty enough income to spare, and that his main motivation for giving was so that he could be some sort of big shot in Heaven.  I guess he thinks the homeless christians are going to be screwed over in Heaven too since they have nothing to give on Earth??  I just don't think that is how it works, nor should that be the motivating factor in giving.

$review_text.: Giles Milton (&#34;Nathaniel's Nutmeg&#34;) writes with the infectious joy of your favorite uncle telling tall tales after a snort or two of good bourbon.  With &#34;Russian Roulette,&#34; Milton uses some real-life British spies as his Good Guys while Lenin and the Bolsheviks wear Black Hats in several tales of risking life and limb for God and country.  Anyone who likes their history footnote-free and full of narrative will enjoy &#34;RR.&#34;It may be hard to believe in our cynical world, but at the dawn of the 20th century the concept of espionage was fairly primitive.  The concept of &#34;a gentleman does not read another gentleman's mail&#34; still pervaded the halls of government . . . and this was a time when being a gentleman meant something.  But Britain found itself dealing with a major new threat once the Bolsheviks tore apart the Russian monarchy and Lenin started his plan for global domination.  Lenin, with his hatred of the West and his single-minded determination, actually serves as a viable villain for such a story, as one could imagine James Bond crossing swords with him.Against Lenin, Britain plays such brilliant thinkers as Mansfield Cumming, reclusive nobleman and strategist who leads Britain's spy network, and brave field agents as Sidney Reilly, Arthur Ransome, Paul Dukes, and George Hill, who lived behind enemy lines for years.  These agents, often working with a literal price on their heads, provided the British government with vital information of Bolshevik political developments, troop movements, supply chains, and other skullduggery that gave the Brits a vital check against the rampaging Bolsheviks.For the Bolsheviks were looking to topple the western powers of Capitalism at a time those powers were exhausted by World War I.  Energized by their successful revolution, the Bolsheviks were primed to make major inroads in their war against the West, most particularly through a campaign into India to oust the British from their valued colonial holdings.  The British might say that this would not stand, but the reality was that the British military was not certain it could stop the Bolsheviks through sheer force of arms.Enter the spies.  These men and women (the men get more fame in this book, but there is a great book to be written about the women who are in these pages) risk everything to advance Britain's cause.  Many of them are caught, and many pay the ultimate price.Milton's book flies by as he is far more interested in story than analysis.  But that's fine - not every book of history needs to be heavily footnoted.  But Milton has clearly done his research as his story is steeped in intriguing details and revealing anecdotes.  It is a little episodic, and except for the final chapter where the spies break the Indian campaign of the Army of God, there are few major incidents were Milton can say, &#34;Look - the spies accomplished this.&#34;  Much of the spies' successes came in getting the little bits of information back to Britain where they could be analyzed . . . this was a campaign of tiny victories leading to major coups.Highly recommended, but Milton's book is limited in scope and purpose - it would hardly serve as a definitive account of British-Bolshevik antagonism or even British espionage in the early 20th century.  But what a read!

$REVIEW.: A short story in which Brad Taylor showcases Jennifer Cahill who is Pike Logan's business partner in the company they run in order to front their Taskforce operations.  Jennifer is a member of the team and provides some love interest for Pike as the series develops.  The story begins with a meeting between Jennifer and her ex husband in her business office.  She suffered years of physical abuse at his hands including the loss of a baby she was carrying before dumping him. Pike walks into the meeting and instead of beating up the ex he closes the door and tells Jennifer to use her training against the man.  A feel good segment to open the remainder of the story.Pike is recovering from wounds received in the Taskforce's last action when another team asks for Jennifer's help in stopping a terrorist in the Far East.  Jennifer agrees and gets Pike to come along as backup and advisor.  Jennifer accomplishes her mission which involves spying on two women that are thought to be links to the terrorist but she does not think that the two ladies are involved in the plot.  Her advice is looked down on by the other Taskforce team, but Jennifer prevails and all ends  well with her feeling good about herself.This is a short story, to be read in a short time and will not provide the depth of one of Taylor's full length novels about Pike and Jennifer, but is a good interlude for a reader of the series.In addition to the story the publication includes an introduction to Brad Taylor's next book, "The Widow's Strike".

$review_text.: This book starts out with well-drawn characters.  Elsie Dinsmore is a little christian girl of the pre-American Civil War era.  The first books present a sweet picture of this girl who has only a slave woman ( herself a deeply-commited christian) to comfort and console her when the family with which she lives mistreats or ignores her.  There are some good lessons on how a child who has made a profession of faith can deal with a parent who is not a christian.  Her father does eventually give his life to Christ.  Unfortunately, in later books, when Elsie has married and moved away from home, her father behaves in a manner I personally consider CREEPY.  Perhaps I am reading too much into his actions considering that I am a woman born in the mid-20th century, and these books cover the time period of the mid-19th century.  Still, I am definately made uncomfortable by the overwrought prose describing the relationship between father and grown-up daughter.

 Ms

Tipton has done an excellent job of blending and bending the past with the present

$REVIEW.: Wow, this is one of the best books I have read in a really long time! Jasmine has a multi-sided personality that just sucks you up and leaves you asking for more

Her emotions are so real when you read that you just want to cry or laugh with her and the author did a supreme job with this book

Tyran shows real emotion, not just the fake things from other books that are all about shallow love triangles

He is truly an extrodinary character and his relationship with Jasmine is genuine

Orion knows little from the beginning, but puts complete trust in Jasmine, showing he will never doubt her even though she may not be all the kingdom needs.This is an incredibly well written story and the author deserves a lot of recognition for her work
Just when you think you have got the plot all figured out she throws in a new twist, something unique and suprising that just shakes everything and completly contradicts whatever you thought was going to happen
It is hard to do this in books, but then the author tops it off with truly captivating scenes and personalities that leave you hungering for more and more


I only had one very, very, tiny problem with this book, and that's that occasionally a letter would get replaced by another

In one incident, the o in who was traded for a y, turning who into why.Overall, this is an astounding book and I can't wait to get more


I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, as it is completly worth your time and money!!!

$REVIEW.: Like millions of Americans I was glued to my TV and Larry King Live for the entire second half of 1994 following every bit of the OJ case.  This is as close to the real story that we will ever get--I couldn't put it down, I read it non-stop until I finished it.  I believe Mike Gilbert answers every question anyone who followed the trial would have about the truth.  This isn't a cheap sell-out book either, you can feel true remorse in the authors tone. At the beginning of the book Gilbert acknowledges that he, like all of us, saw the evidence, but unlike us, he had a profound conflict, he loved OJ Simpson.  The book is how he comes to peace with this conflict after fourteen years.  I found it very moving and would like the author to know that his apologies to those involved brought me to tears.  Highly recommended.

Why should the widow attempt to prove something that has already been proven?  What a horrible thing Mrs. Faulkner has been forced to endure.

$review_text.: This is another of Greene's backlist reissues from when she wrote as Jeanne Grant for Berkley in the 1980's which she's been updating as they roll out and I think she's done a fairly thoughtful job here, even with a couple of anachronisms here and there.Nunnish, plain Leigh has just finished up a huge accounting project for Brian's firm and approaches him at a company party afterwards.  The handsome playboy had been the subject of a gushing write-up in a social column listing him as a perfect genetic specimen and she wants to pay him ten grand to be the father of her baby.  She has no interest in having sex with him or having any contact with him after the baby's born, but before she can explain what she really wants, he starts taking apart her bland exterior, revealing a very attractive woman under some ugly clothes.  When she gets around to shoving him off of her and telling him why she approached him, he tells her he would want to be involved with the baby and he'll have to think about it.He finally decides and the two set out their terms: they'll marry before they start the in-vitro process, Leigh won't be required to have sex with Brian, he'll be free to keep seeing his mistresses discreetly, she'll handle the public hostess/wifely duties that do along with his professional life and they'll live at her estate.  Neither turns out to be what the other expected though and romance blooms between the two, definitely against Leigh's plans.Both Brian and Leigh were easy to like.  Because of her family past, Leigh had horribly low self-esteem and honestly never expected a single thing from Brian beyond his swimmers.  She was fiercely protective of the people in her life that she loved and she wanted this baby so badly she was willing to come out of her self-imposed shell to ask for Brian's help.  When she started accepting that she was liked and needed for who she was, she was able to open up to Brian and tell him about her past.Brian was what I like to call a Harlequin Playboy.  He wasn't really as much of a male tramp as people thought and as soon as the ring slid on his finger, he never touched another woman even if it looked like he did.  He wanted to be a good, loving parent as much as Leigh did, but he wasn't going to settle for a platonic relationship with her to go along with it.  At times he came off as a little bit arrogant and he tended to tell Leigh what to do a lot, but that's one of those anachronisms I think.  That stuff wouldn't have been out of place in a 1980's-ish book.  If I remember right, it would have been swooned over.While the subject matter of this book is a little dated and there are a few things in it that might make a contemporary reader cringe a little, underneath is all is a nice little story about a couple falling in love and starting a family, just in reverse order.  This is one of Greene's nicer re-issues so far.

Carrie Daly could be living the "ideal" life with book shop owner, Nate Chastain, but wanderer, gambler and horseman Griff Rutledge appears to have captured the attention of the lovely lady. When Griff remains in Hickory Ridge to ride a horse in a race that may help the town regain its economic footing, Carrie seems to want a closer relationship but fears what will happen when he leaves.Griff is running away from his father's disappointment, his family home and his past. His mind is set on a ship bound for Australia - and freedom - but he never planned on Hickory Ridge or the widow, Carrie Daly. This incredibly engaging Christian romance is a terrific weekend read.

The story was well written as always but I did not love the story itself.STOP if you have not read it!!!!I think she loved Maro too but that the relationship scared her (being with a Dom can be that way) but it was never explored.  I like Adam but is he really Mr. Right-for-Chyna?  I am not sure.  And finally you give her something that is hers (modeling) and then let a man take it from her. . . really!  She deserves this.

But at some point it just took a weird turn and scattered off into several different directions. I had to make myself finish it, from about the halfway mark, because I felt that having gotten that far, I should find out what happened.It just felt like the author wanted to cover too many different topics in one book. Sometimes I felt like I just had no idea what was happening because it jumped around so much.

$REVIEW.: When I first began reading this book I told myself to keep an open mind. I am one who doesn't like to read overly religious books. It's a personal preference. I decided to read this one, well because we all need to branch out of our comfort zones sometimes, right?What I did like about this book was that the author's writing did flow very well. The book is understandable and easy to follow. I liked how even though it is a one person perception, it still involved other characters' stories that blended together well. I liked that attention was brought to teen pregnancy and teen drinking. Book also brings to light that you have choices. Ty made a choice to drink and drive and the result was that people where hurt and could have been killed. Tessa got pregnant as a  teen and she had different choices but ultimately chose to give the baby up.What I didn't like was that Lacey wasn't a stronger character. She didn't seem to fight hard enough to make her own choices. She seemed more mediocre compared to Starla Joy her BFF. Being a lead character I wanted her to stand out more. Have a louder voice. I wish that Lacey and Ty's relationship developed maybe a little more. I also didn't like the whole concept of Hell House. I found that to be disturbing. Especially Lacey wanting to play the part of abortion girl. I thought that it made light of a situation that is very serious. I wasn't crazy for that part.Overall would I recommend this book. Yes but If you have a teen that reads it, I recommend reading it yourself and then discussing it. I am big on a person thinking for them self. That includes a teen. I understand small town life, I came from one. You are expected to live in your parents shadow. That is another thing I liked about this book. It showed you that you can choose to move out of the shadow and be your own person.

$review_text.: I am not typically a fan of paranormal books. But I have to tell you that this book is SO well written with characters that are SO believable that I just loved it. Villere House starts out &#34;normal&#34; enough. Three college friends in New Orleans for spring break. But that's where the &#34;normal&#34; stops. Charlotte starts having dreams that are anything but normal. From there CD Hussey and Leslie Fear take the reader on a journey of romance, heartbreak, mystery, and Voodoo. I found myself so drawn into the story that the paranormal aspect of it really didn't seem all that unbelievable. I would give it more stars if I could, I loved it THAT much!

$review_text.: When heiress to the McLeon fortune, Ainsley McLeon realized someone is out to kill her, she made sure to get far away from Beverly Hills, California and fled for her life.  No using credit cards or that massive bank account for Miss Ainsley.  That would make it easy for the bad guys to track her down! So with just $50 in her pocket and a broken down truck, Ainsley walks into a bar and demands a job as a waitress.Luc needs a waitress as his last one just went into labor.  But the last thing he needs is someone like Ainsley. In her fancy clothes and high heels, she is nothing but trouble and he wants nothing to do with her.  But when Ainsley breaks down in tears and he hears her story, Luc can't resist helping her.Ainsley just wants to make enough money waitressing to fix the truck and be on her way.  But Luc is irresistible and she is really starting to fall for him. Unfortunately, Ainsley doesn't know the truth about him and the other patrons of the bar.  They're not all what they seem to be.Will Ainsley find out who is trying to kill her and make it back home? Or will Montana forever change this heiress and show her what true love really feels like?LIONS, TIGERS, AND SEXY BEARS OH MY! is a short story by author Candace Havens.  This was a fun romantic read that kept me interested from the beginning.  Ainsley and Luc had an undeniable chemistry even though they were such opposites.  If you're looking for something nice to read without violence this is a sweet story to curl up with and read before bedtime. Overall, I enjoyed reading about Ainsley and Luc and would love to revisit them in another story.
$SUMMARY.: A fun short story that is romantic and sweet!

A chance meeting has become one of the most meaningful moments in my life.&#8221;Hallie is starting a new job as an RN and with that comes new anxieties, a new atmosphere and new co-workers. Starting at Regional Hospital is about to open a Hallie up to a whole new world, but is she ready for everything that comes with that? After years of being friend-zoned by men she starts to think her life plan of becoming a nurse, getting married, having children and a white picket fence by the age of 24 might be unattainable but she hasn&#8217;t fully given up yet&#8230; I mean she still has 2 years right?A lot can happen in 2 years&#8230;After being sent to a conference for her department Hallie meets two men that will forever change the course of her life. Sean and Ryan are in completion with each other right from the beginning but who will show her how to love and who will get her love forever?I loved Hallie right from the first sentence. She is funny and sassy. Her inner monologue had me laughing hysterically. Gia did an amazing job bringing her to life. The story being completely in Hallie&#8217;s pov takes you on the journey of a single girl being a friend to the girl that two men will come to want. But life happens and Hallie has things she has to come to terms with. She has promises to keep, and in the end its peace with herself that she needs to make.Hallie pulled me along with her on this story. I laughed and cried with her, I fought with and for her at times. There were moments I wanted to shake her but then thought &#8220;What would I do in that situation&#8230;&#8221; Probably the same damn thing&#8230;They story has a cliffhanger but informs you there will be a second one that I for one CAN NOT WAIT TO READ!

$REVIEW.: The art was once again excellent
 Mensink uses vibrant colors, the proportions were spot on and the people didn't look cartoonish


 The sex was hot and explicitly rendered, as in the first installment


 However, this "novel" is shorter and the story was a disappointing follow-up to chapter one.Chapter one ended with another vampire Lord becoming aware of Kristina's presence and wanting her as their queen because she's so strong


 She does visit them, and naturally an orgy ensues

 But yet, she was quickly foiled again by the female DA and ended up wounded exactly as in chapter one!  If she's so powerful why shouldn't she come out ahead this time?  And how has the coven survived so long when they're supposedly so much weaker than her?Sure, I realize this is "just" an adult comic, but that doesn't mean the story can't be as good as in part 1
 Another thing I didn't care for was the increased amount of F/F action than in the first book


 I will definitely buy chapter 3 when it's finally released, but I hope it follows through on the promise of chapter 1.

If you do the math, how many will you read in your lifetime?

I am in the middle of Season 3 and there should be a warning somewhere on these books not to start them if you need to sleep anytime soon.  They are very hard to put down.  Plus, it can be confusing when you come back the next day and trying to remember what happened to who on which Earth.  Don't worry - no spoilers! You need to read them to figure out what I mean.I recommend the series (so far at least).

 Imagine getting to test out the hottest games before they hit the market! It may sound like a nice dream but, what if it was possible


There are many people that not only get to test the game; they are paid to test the game and sometimes paid rather well


This book is a how to guide for how you could turn your hobby into something more
The book reads easy and the instructions are clear

The author starts out with an explanation of what a gamer really does


Then it asks a vital question; is this really for you? The book then follows through with how to prep for the job, pointers and how to succeed

Overall, a great book.

$review_text.: In science, we define the term Computational Equivalence as follows:"Computational equivalence is defined to be that the time taken and the effort required to draw an inference from two different representations is the same."This is a good and practical one.Mr. Wolfram defines The Principle of Computational Equivalence as follows:"Whenever behavior is observed that is not obviously simple, it can be thought of as corresponding to a computation of equivalent sophistication (Wolfram 2002, p.5)."This is merely a fashion of speculation, but not about scientific methodology.  And this definition is the central theme of all that opus, which took Mr. Wolfram 15 years.The principle has been taken by scientists and philosophers for hundreds of years.  It often failed to describe the "principle" of a system.A good example is that Deep Blue reveals the mind of a chess player, and the machine is just like a human's brain.  Some people even claimed that this kind of machine is threatening!!  Obviously, this is wrong.  The machine is far more stupid than Kasparov.  No matter how far that machine evolves, it cannot help understand how the mind of a chess player works.  Deep Blue merely looks up and compares lots of patterns in the database, i.e., searching by brute force.The whole thing is called "simulation."  Simulation is the way to represent a system when we don't really know how it works.  The purpose is usually art, but not science.Another sort of simulation is that when we have already understood the principle of a system, we can write a program and demonstrate the process.  And we don't need to experience the same process, such as earthquake.  In that sense, simulation is meaningful and useful.Another example is that the L-system and Fractal Geometry could make a computer draw beautiful plants on the screen.  However, the system doesn't explain how a tree grows.  The process of growth of tree is far more complicated than the simple algorithm.  It involves the effect of sunlight, and fertilizer contained in the soil, etc.Think about starting off some simple rules, and feed them into a computer, so that the computer would draw lots of beautiful patterns which are similar to some physical systems.  And we conclude that the systems work just like the program.... Well.. this is called dogmatism.Another problem with this book is that we cannot find the bibliography.  We can list tens of books in that section, if not hundreds.  I would keep this book in my shelf if someday Mr. Wolfram could do that for curious and serious thinkers like me.  If you are interested in research in Japan, you would find that Japanese researchers like to do that -- pretend that they discovered the whole theory, just reinvent those jargons.  It's very usual in Japan's circles of science.  A Caltech-trained scientist should not do that.Thanks in advance!"Good artists copy, great artists steal." -- Picaso.

$REVIEW.: Bond of Love started off a little slow for me


It's very detailed which I do like, as it builds a picture for you but this was walking the line

Even with that it sucked me in and I had to know what happened to both the mother and the daughter.I have to admit that I skimmed some of it but I needed to know and as long as an author has you caring, their job is done.It was an emotional journey that was told through three points of view


Avery was a strong character, Kara was flighty, and well..


I'm not telling you about the third
If you are looking for an easy beach read then this isn't it


But if you are looking for something emotional with mystery then I do recommend.I received a copy of this book for my honest review, no other compensation was received.

$REVIEW.: OK, there are numerous minor typos and grammatical errors in this book. But anyone with a lick of sense can easily read through them and get a ton of very valuable information about a very sophisticated camera! The author's suggestions for settings are very valuable and made with thought and logic. The Nikon manual is very hard to read and has been printed so much that the printing plates are worn out and the menu and camera symbals are unreadable. This a much preffered book in my opinion. And in addition it's also more thorough. I highly recommend it, typos and all! Since you already have, or contemplate getting, a Nikon D80, get this book, it will be invaluable.

$REVIEW.: Sweetie was a very pleasurable read, with very well developed characters.  I really enjoyed the author's style of writing, as well as the story itself.The main characters seemed to be real, not the hollow sterotypes you typically find in 'women's' novels.  I did really feel for them, and I did ache for them in ways I didn't expect to.  This isn't a light and cheerful 'buddy book'.  It is a tender look into the lives of two girls on the edge of their childhood, and the ways that they deal with their last summer as 'kids'.I would recommend this novel to someone who wants to engage with their characters, not someone who's looking for a cute, quick summer read.

$review_text.: We're all drowning in information -- it's coming at us every day via more channels than one person can possibly handle. But there's a reason that some ideas get through the noise and others don't -- the ideas that work, that stick, that move us are "vivid" - Dan Roam's word for verbal, visual and interdependent. These are ideas that appeal to both sides of our brain, that speak two different languages.Roam is an exceptional teacher and in Blah Blah Blah explains clearly and, ahem, vividly how we lost touch with our powerful, visual mind. Then, he gives us tools to tap into the power of both our visual minds and verbal minds. The techniques in Blah Blah Blah help you troubleshoot ineffective communication and supercharge your ideas.

$REVIEW.: I believe I read it took David Rhodes ten years to write this book. I can understand why it took so long - it is a very well written.  In the beginning the reader is left wondering where the book is going. The first chapter is intriguing but quite confusing.  There is a bit of mystery.  It is almost scary wondering what will unfold.  I gradually understood, but for a while I questioned if what I thought was true.  Having said that, I do prefer character development over plot.  David Rhodes described his characters so fully that I felt like they were my neighbors.  I &#34;saw&#34; them; I knew their personalities;  I knew their strong points;  I knew their foibles.  Most importantly I cared about them.  How he tied them all together was gratifying.  I knew each one individually but also a part of the whole.  Mixed in with the well-developed characters was just enough of a plot line to keep the reader wondering.  For me, wondering if it would develop and what it would develop into.  I stayed up late at night reading this book, but when I was nearing the end I barely read it.  I did not want it to end, so delayed as much as I could.  It was almost like having a good angel (read it) on one should and a bad angel (don't read it) on the other.  The ending left me feeling like I lost someone important.  But even more important than that, I was remembered that one person can touch many lives without even realizing it.  This can be even if that person is not whole and doesn't initially seem to have much to give. It also reminded me that at times we just drift through life, taking each wave, each turn in the road as it comes. This book helps the reader remember how important the human connection is.  Is that what it (life) is all about?  Human connection is almost an oxymoron in that reading is such a solitary experience.  I highly recommend this book.
$SUMMARY.: I put this book down just to delay finishing it....

I trusted the four stars meant it would be an entertaining story with well developed characters but found neither. For me, it felt as if the author was developing the story as she went along, adult characters immature, erratic and confusing and dialog unbelievably unimaginative. I am sorry to be so uncharitable, but I paid to read this and I still cannot understand how it got published. This will teach me to read the reviews... Regardless of how many stars a book has.

$review_text.: Tilly Bagshawe's FAME is filled with characters that she does a good job of defining. I have read many of her books and always liked them and this was no different. It wasn't my favorite but that was only because I did find it to be pretty predictable. The characters of Dorian and Sabrina Leon seemed a likely pair up . However, Viorel as the love interest didn't seem to fit well for me. All the characters are fleshed out and there are a lot of them so be careful and keep track. If you do that, you should find FAME to be an enjoyable and easy read.

Several changes have come to the department: a new police chief, some retirements, and a promotion for Felix Zachary to detective. That doesn't mean new fans will feel lost. Not only is there just enough backstory to help newbies feel comfortable, each book is a stand alone, so you truly can pick up any book in the series for a great read that blends the personal and professional lives of the members of the Rocky Bluff P.D.Murder in the Worst Degree, like the other books in the series, draws its strength from the likable, complex set of characters working within the department. Coupling this cast with an intriguing plot with twists and turns along the way, you'll enjoy getting to know everyone while trying to figure out the suspects and motives.One of the best aspects of this series, and this book in particular, is that you see plausible situations played out in this fictional police setting, by a group of people who seem almost as real as one of your friends or relatives.You meet new characters within the town as the police department follows the clues and works to keep the residents of Rocky Bluff safe. It's a perfect blend of both worlds.If you enjoy mysteries that are equally character driven and plot driven, Murder in the Worst Degree is a perfect choice.I received a free digital copy of this book from the author.

$REVIEW.: This book tells us just how much the polygamist wives have lost since Joseph Smith founding of Mormonism. These women, whether they married Joseph Smith before or after his death, yielded as much, or very close to the same powers as the men.  Some even stayed with their 1st husbands, whom may or may not have been Mormons. They taught school, Doctored the sick. Had the free will to lay on the hands to cure everything from a headache to depression. Which is always prevalent in family's with so many children and sister wives. They had meetings without the men to discuss who needed help with firewood in the winter to clothing the children of women who couldn't possibly cloth their own child. Although I do not believe in polygamy. I think it is abuse and an abuse of power. Today, it seems polygamists are more interested in marrying young girls before they can understand that they are free to marry anyone they choose. And getting rid of the young boys early because they are a definite threat to the much older men who have the power over the very young girls. I did not read in this book about the taking away of a wives children and giving them to another man for punishment. Or trading off of they daughters and sisters, although I'm sure they did all the above.

$REVIEW.: There are a lot of books out there whose author claims they'll teach you how to write a novel. It's been my experience that most of them are full of fluff.Not this one.In the book's introduction Bell speaks about The Lie. I've heard. I know you've heard it. Or at least felt it as you looked at your writing and that of published authors.The Lie is that writers are born. In other words you can't be taught how to write. You either can do it or you can't. End of story. Bell confesses that he burned ten years of writing time in belief of this lie.That comforts me. I've always written something. It started with what we now call journaling. Then went to poetry and song writing. Then short stories and scripts. Finally novels.But somewhere along the way I bought The Lie. I didn't know any of the techiques and methods. I didn't know what to do with a manuscript once I finished one. So I never did.Until this year. I have one completed novel manuscript and two more in the works. I own this accomplishment, in part, to James Scott Bell's Plot & Structure put out by Writer's Digest.He wanted to make things simple and accessible for the average Joe. I believe he accomplishes this goal. I now understand things that for a long time eluded me. Things like Character Arcs and the Three Act Structure. I'd read other books claiming to explain these things and came to the final page of said books scratching my head.That one novel I've finished? I was writing it when I picked a copy of P & S. One piece of advise changed my manuscript immediately. I had a good idea. I just didn't start the thing in a way that would compel must folks to want to continue after the first paragraph. With Bell's advice in hand, I rewrote the first chapter and saw a whole new novel and greater potential.And that was just one piece of advice. He covers everything I could think to ask if I could sit with him for a couple hours and pick his brain. And more I never thought of.He explains what a plot is. Developing plot ideas. Stong beginnings. Continuing middles (arguably one of the most difficult things about writing a novel). And ending well so that you and the reader resolve the plot.He provides several pieces of advice to help you learn plot. He explains a simple way to develop plot, The LOCK system. He talks about characters, settings, dialogue, action, reaction. He discusses various plots that are used over and over again successfully. He shares what he calls the BELL Pyramid in the chapter on ideas. He covers hooks to keep your reader turning those pages. He explains scenes in detail; the different kinds and how they work.There is so much to this amazing book. I haven't given you half of what's in there. I want you to find out for yourself.By this book!If you've ever dreamed of writing a novel, this book will give you the tools and teach you how to use them properly.After reading Plot & Structure I emailed JSB to thank him for writing such a wonderful, practical book. He responded, that same evening I believe, with a very kind note of thanks and well wishes for my own writing. I heard he was a nice guy. Now I know it's true. :-) Not that I've ever doubted it. Too many authors I know have said so.

I remembered vaguely reading a bit of Dianetics in 1982 or so, which was given to me by an acquaintance and true believer who insisted it would change my life.  I found it boring and somewhat off the wall.  Then a scandal about Scientology in Toronto appeared in the news, but I didn't give it much attention until I saw that the 'religion' had been started by a science fiction writer, the same individual who had written the book. Again, although slightly interesting and amusing, I forgot about it as I went on with my life.Cruise's biographer mentioned that Scientology was a very big part of his life and he was using his celebrity status to proselytize.  That did catch my interest and so I began reading some books on the subject, pro and con, including this one.  I chose it first because it was written prior to the others.I was horrified and sickened by what I read, about the crimes and atrocities that were committed, in particular by its core membership, the Sea Org. Not only exposed were crimes such as espionage, malicious libel, infiltration of government bodies and persecution of organizations and businesses, but also harassment of individual private citizens, including writers and reporters who dared to criticize Scientology. These, and perhaps even more maliciously, were also perpetrated against the cult's own membership.This begged the question: If the religion was so wonderful, so liberating, so superior spiritually, why would it persecute its members who wished to leave it for one reason or another?  Why engage in such activities such as kidnapping, imprisonment, unlawful detainment, physical violence - even toward its executive command, and why would its membership condone and excuse this?  I found this shocking, revolting and reminiscent of the former Soviet Union and Maoist China.  I could never understand that practice.  If communism was such a superior way to live, why did many of its citizens continually try to escape?  Why would the leaders of their countries punish, imprison, torture and even kill those who wanted to leave?  The same frame of mind and the virtually identical practices also seem to apply to this cult.Why do they do this? Shame. Embarrassment . Fear of ridicule in the eyes of the world and of their leaders starkly and undeniably being viewed as 'emperors without clothes', revealed in naked abhorrence  and  their systems of government as corrupt to the core and unsustainable.  They also did not want the crimes perpetrated on their own citizens and their espionage in other countries exposed to the world. This scenario applies to Scientology almost exactly.As I continued reading, it was revealed that many of its members were afraid to leave Scientology and chose to remain - if it could be said that such a choice existed -  simply because they live in fear of their own leader and his vicious vindictive temper. They are coerced to stay through the threat of being separated, often permanently, from their own families still inside, and worst of all, from their own children.  They fear incarceration and violence, physical and emotional.  They also live in terror of their deepest most shameful secrets being released publicly, including being mailed to their neighbours and posted on poles and in businesses in the main streets of the towns that they and their children live in.At first, I didn't know whether to believe all this or not, as these accounts were so unbelievably outrageous, so I continued reading other books and watching videos, including Scientology's own. Some members, like Tom Cruise and other celebrities had embraced it on their own, their treatment being completely differently from the rank-and-file members, while some had been brought into it by parents and had no choice in the decision. This would explain why certain celebrities deny such criminal abuse occurs.  All members are directed not to read or watch anything about Scientology in the media, including them.This book is a shocking expose, but long overdue at the time, a stark and courageous attempt by the author to reveal the worm of corruption at the organization's heart.As I began reading other books, namely Janet Reitman's and Lawrence Wright's, both of which are excellent as well, I sometimes thought I was back reading this author's book since much of their work seemed taken directly from this one, and, sometimes it seemed to me, almost verbatim in some sections.  I kept thinking  haven't I just read this recently?He's done a remarkable job. His research is top notch.  His courage is to be commended for even undertaking such an expose.There are so many things I want to comment on, but this isn't the place.  If you are interested in learning more about this corporate business (I cannot bring myself to call it a 'church'),and and are contemplating whether to buy this book, do it, and do it before you read other accounts.  If you are contemplating becoming a member of this cult, read this first. It was written and published a few decades ago and this is the revised version that many agree is better even than the first.  In fact, after having read a few other, also very well written accounts, I still think this is the best of the lot.
$SUMMARY.: If deciding whether to buy or contemplating joining Scientology read this now

$review_text.: I received this book as a gift earlier this week and I knew from the moment I flipped through it that it was a keeper.This book combines interesting profiles of American yarn companies with a collection of beautiful patterns, my many well-known designers in those American yarns. The patterns are clearly written and many have easy to read charts. There are so many beautiful patterns that it's hard to choose which one should go on the needles first. So far, the cover hat, the Oquirrh Mountains Wrap and Pike's Mitts are the front-runners, but I have no doubt that I'll continue to pull this book down off the shelf for years to come. There are just so many patterns that I love.Kudos to Tanis Gray for putting together such a great collection!

Poor 4 year old Jonathan loses his family when their house burns.The judgemental status of some in church still happens today and not just to ex-cons.  It happens to many people.A story of Christmas blessing but so much more.  Clayton gets a second chance.  Merry believes in him all along.  Little Jonathan gets his Christmas wish of a family - thanks Jesus for answering his prayers.This is a page turner that hold you in its character.  I feel truly blessed for eading it.

$REVIEW.: On the back cover of the book" "The book includes:" are eight items. The books totally  fails to hit the mark on any. For instance: "In-depth practical and theoretical explanations of martial applications". Well just go to page 122 Tui zhang where you get one snap shot and a 60 word pharagraph description that's it -done,fini!  There is a whole Southern Style White Crane system  virtually based/rooted on this single movement but anybody reading this book would never get a clue of the potential. Trust me, I have been involved with the the martial arts since the time i was a student  over 35 years ago at UCLA and have had the good fortune over the years to train with the best including  several "legends". You'll have a far more valuable martial arts experience watching Chuck in reruns of "Texas Rangers" than reading this.
$review_summary.: No Thanks As far as I'm concerned anybody who gives this more than one star has never experienced "the real deal".

Can't say enough for Blackaby's book and am very excited that our daughter is reading it

I love how real the characters are with all their amazing qualities and their faults


Can't wait to see what happens next with Cody and Jade as their adventure continues
But I'm sure that no matter how the plot unfolds that the story will shine and entertain

A great read for teens and adults alike.

$REVIEW.: Every September, when fall breezes become the norm, I start looking for scary stories, part of my passion for Halloween and all the things that creep in really dark places. Michael Montoure's Still Life was my first choice this year and it started my season with a bang. Complete with all the creepy crawlies in dark places, but it also takes you even further into the darkness of their psyches. This is a story of what they feel and fear and very much worth the read!

$review_text.: Cleveland and its surrounding suburbs is really a nice place.  Good people live there.  There are great public venues; everything from the arts, Playhouse Square, the small clubs to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame and the sports teams that never seem to make it to the top.  But its the people that make Cleveland a viable place to live and work.  Sadly, there is also corruption.  In the past few years, Cleveland and his host county - Cuyahoga - has had its fair share of scandals, investigations, arrests and trials.  Since 1988 in Les Roberts' first local book Pepper Pike, Milan Yacovich has confronted many bad guys and bad situations and has prevailed.  In todays culture, it is refreshing to have a stand up guy who "does the right thing".  If you like books that still have the good guy doing the right thing, then this, like all the Yacovich books, is one you'll really enjoy.  I look forward to the next Milan Yacovich book.  It can't be published soon enough!

$review_text.: As from my title, the book has some great information for both the amatuer and professional photographer. However, after some basic introductory information and some basic, but very important composition discussion, the majority of the book is about the author's reasoning behind some of his images. Interesting and insighful but not a book about the 'ART' of black and white photography.There is too much similarity in his images and discussion of the images. His chapters on the types of photography such as abstracts, surreal and mystical are all identical and the images all look alike. There is not enough discussion of the bBlack and White photograph or its differences with a color photograph.I find his discussion of the digital darkroom quite minimal. I did not expect, nor want, a lengthy Photoshop class but what is included is very basic and really does not help in making artful black and white imagesThe actual production of the book is excellent. the printing and imagery is a first class printing job.

$REVIEW.: This is one of those books we're 'supposed' to like. The other two reviewers have likened the story to classical literature, on a popular note one might even call it Sci-Fi/fantasy's answer to "The Devil Wears Prada."Amazon's reviewers summarized the plot pretty well.  The rest of the book reads like quotations from fashion magazines and society columns.  "Grey" is predictible and somewhat tiresome.

 It was well written, trying to answer the &#34;why&#34; question that we always ask when someone does something that most of us would not attempt


 It was obvious that Ben Montgomery is a fan of Grandma Gatewood, and it came through in his writing

 He did not sensationalize Emma's story, but gave it to us with facts and not pathos

 Ben Montgomery will be a permanent member of my reading list.This story has made me re-examine and simply my own travel plans! :)

But, you can't judge a book....well, you know the rest.  The daily devotions build on one another, to make us aware of God in our world through our own observation and with the help of the church Doctors.  Very gratifying read each day. It was a big investment for me, a bit pricey, but I don't regret it. If it was cheaper, I'd have given it 5 stars.
