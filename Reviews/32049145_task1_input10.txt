$REVIEW.: This drive is very fast, the included software from Samsung is pretty good, including the imaging software which is fast and easy to use.  Beware trying to use USB to Sata adapters if your going to image a drive to this SSD. (like switching out your boot drive to this like I did.)  IF your using the included Samsung software, as I did, it will not recognize the SSD connected to any of the three that I have tried, but your mileage may vary.
$review_summary.: Great drive, good software, decent price per GB

$REVIEW.: I ordered 2 of these, one for my dslr and one for my superzoom, they hold 4 batteries each, and seem to do the job, I am usually pretty forgiving on these reviews, but I cannot go with 5 stars here, I think they could have been made much better for very little effort and money, so I am giving them 3 stars. I received them quickly and they were packaged fine, no problems, price was ok, but like I said, I think a bit more quality could have been put into this product. it keeps your batteries from shorting out against each other.I would recommend these for that reason alone, and I couldn't find another manufacturer.

$REVIEW.: I bought this modem because my speed varies drastically at different times of the day, especially between 6pmto midnight when I needed the Internet the most, the speed would drop to less than 8 Mbps. I called the isp and they said that there was something wrong with my signal strength, but they sold me a higher plan that goes from 20 to 30 mbps. That didn't seem to improve. The Cox service guy came out and replaced all the connectors, saying the problem of reduced strength was due to bad connectors. Well, that didn't seem to improve. The same service guy disconnected my phones and it took another service visit two weeks later to fix my phone. The second service guy didn't fix my Internet speed either. I called the service department and the technical help said maybe I should replace my modem from the old Motorola Doscis 2 to Doscis 3. Got nothing to lose except maybe another $100 to try something else. Well, that seem to solve the problem. Whereas before I was getting 8 Mbps from 6 to midnight, I am getting 20+ Mbps during those times. Mostly I am getting 30mbps. I am happy.

$REVIEW.: It is white (not black) but I knew that from the other reviews so I'm fine with the color. The stand is sturdy enough and won't fall over unless you try to knock it over. Don't except to insert or remove a memory card without supporting the reader with your other hand. The stand is useful for taking up less desk space. I don't have USB 3.0 on my computer but with USB 2.0 I was averaging transfer speeds of 28 MB/sec from a CF card (using Sandisk Extreme, which is 60 MB/sec) to my computer. Overall a great product!

$review_text.: This device is flat out too big.  I drive a 2000 Dodge Durango and have a pretty decent sized windshield.  However, with this beast attached, it is nothing but a distraction no matter how I have it mounted.  The cables coming from this device are everywhere and even if I chose a professional installation, I'm not sure I'd use it.  One of the cables is as thick as my extension cords for outdoor use.  You have a power cable, a connector cable, an audio out cable and a buy it separately mic cable.  Who in the world needs that many cables running down from their windshield?  Not to mention if you have an older car like mine, there is no audio jack, so you'd have to buy a converter to use with a tape deck (male to male jack) in order for you to get sound from the device.Yes, but it uses TuneIn radio and Pandora you say.  So what.  I use that on my 4S now along with my tape deck converter and it works fine...thereby making this unnecessary.  But you can post to FB and Twitter from it.  Big deal.  My 4S already does that without all of this junk hanging down from the windshield.I would venture to say that if a police officer was having a rather slow day you would easily get pulled over for view obstruction with this.  Yes, it is that large and distracting.

$review_text.: Bought these to connect my Klipsch speakers and Pioneer AV Receiver, both of which accept banana plugs. I can't say I notice a remarkable change in audio quality, but it is noticeably easier to connect and disconnect and they are very firmly seated in both receiver and speakers - so no doubt they are as good or better than threading stranded speaker wire into binding posts. It's a tool-less assembly, the gold part and bottom rubber piece unscrew, you pull the stranded cable through. Ensure about 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; of untwisted cable is exposed and spread bend over the rim of the base (visually you can think of spaghetti standing in a pot of water when you first drop it in and it spread around - just imagine then bending the noodles over the side). You then screw the gold part back on to the base and it clamps down on the wire. It's very snug and will not come loose. Simple, effective, exactly what I needed.

It is thin, light and rugged.500 GB is a massive amount of data. As more and more of us go towards Solid State Hard Drives, external hard drives are increasingly popular. They also work well with Time Machine, providing a convenient source of backup and restoration.The Slim is synced via USB 3.0, much faster than the traditional USB 2.0 ables of just a few months ago.Because it's small and light I carry mine in my briefcase just in case I may need to restore my MacBook Pro or an app. Don't  forget to set Time Machine to it as an alternative backup drive.The only reason I do not give this a five is that its recommended sync program Seagate Media Sync is hard to load-many, many forced quits.

I had no idea Amazon made cables but figured it was worth a try at the bargain price.These HDMI cables work fine and I see no difference from the high end cables costing 4 times the price.  The no hassle packaging makes it easy to get these cables connected in under 5 minutes.  I do wish they offered a shorter length (3 feet) to help cut down on all the cables in our home theater.Since I have not them for a long period of time, I cannot comment on longevity.  I will update if they stop working properly.

$REVIEW.: If you're going to use this product in a car, or if you place your portable MP3 player and this unit CLOSE to your home boom box, stereo receiver, etc., it will work well.  However, if like me, you want to transmit your desk PC's MP3 music files to a boom box outside the house, or my stereo receiver on the other side of the house, near my patio (I run outside patio speakers from this stereo receiver), forget it.  The FCC currently only allows for very low output transmit power (50 milliwatts or thereabouts?) on these devices, and the compromised antennas on these things don't allow for good range.  It would be great if the FCC allowed for more output power, let's say 100 milliwatts or more, as well as better antennas, so these devices had greater transmit range.  The FCC needs to change the laws regarding these devices so the consumer can benefit better from increased range!

$review_text.: Currently, my only computer that has an ExpressCard 34 slot is my late 2k8 15&#34; MacBook Pro @ 2.53 GHz running 10.6.8.I don't want to upgrade to a new one until this one gives out. However, I do want the newer connectivity interfaces. I really do like having an ExpressCard slot, even though back in the PCCard days when EC34/54 came out, I was skeptical and dismissive. I have come to love the accessory options what with the cellular modems, USB3, card readers, SSDs, etc.Getting to the point, I bought this card because it was low-priced, had two ports without the need for an adapter (just don't run more than one portable hard drive on it), adds two more USB ports, and sits flush in the slot. One issue I noticed right away was how close the ports are together. I mean REALLY close. I really can't plug in more than one thing at a time unless I grind down the sides of either my USB drives or the plug on a cable.A word on the best way to plug things in and remove them. It is very easy to eject the card when you plug in devices as well as remove them. As long as you don't jam it in there, it can be plugged in without a problem. Removing is easy as well, so long as you hold on the card while unplugging a device.On first attachment, the computer recognized a USB Controller in the slot. That was it. I could power it down from the menu bar and see a device in the System Profiler. That was it. I read some posts on some forums and around Amazon and finally came across the &#34;MultiBeast for Snow Leopard&#34; pack with the NEC drivers from tonymacx86. There is a link to the exact package on the MacUpdate site. Make sure when you get it to only install the drivers you need, unless you want the rest.The structure in the installer goes:Drivers & BootloadersKexts & EnablersMiscellaneousUSB 3.0 - NEC/RenesasJust make sure you restart after installation and the card is in the slot, obviously.To get it, type/copy into Google Search exactly &#34;here's where you'll find the drivers. You need the mulitbeast version for your OS, I've tried it on snow leopard and lion, and works fine. Multibeast @ tonymac - bit.ly/OBmx0Jyou'll need to create an account at tonymac to download the drivers, but it's free, so go for it.&#34; Thanks to Joe Schmo aka snowschmo on MacUpdate!Overall, this card is working wonderfully and I haven't had a problem mounting, unmounting, and then remounting any drive. Everything transfers very fast, even on my oldest 128MB CruzerMicro drive. The card doesn't seem to use too much power either.
$SUMMARY.: Great card, when you get the proper drivers installed!

$review_text.: I had my doubts but decided to order the Play 5 anyway. I had not been able to hear it in person so was not sure what to expect. I had read some reviews saying that the bass lacked. Having now set this up, adjusted EQ settings every way possible (including jacking up the bass), I am back to neutral eq and love the way it sounds. The bass is deep and very capable when needed. The sound is real (if that makes sense) compared to Bose. Bose, which I do enjoy the sound of, tends to tweak the music. Although many enjoy this, it is not always what the artist wanted you to hear. The Sonos Play 5 set to neutral does an excellent job of giving you what was intended including the bass.I now have 3 Play 5's in my house and they work perfectly together. The layout of my place allows a nice transition from room to room when I have them all grouped together.As far as setup...this is really where Sonos shines. Plug in your Sonos player, select add Sonos component  and push a couple of buttons (which are clearly shown in the app). That is it. The app will recognize the new software and then add it. From there you can name it as you desire, tweak EQ settings (I recommend leaving them alone), group with other Sonos players or just send music to it alone.

$REVIEW.: I was skeptical at first about the range but after testing outdoors in my back yard, I get awesome range; about 70ft. I've not tested it beyond that distance because I am limited by the size of the yard. There were no obstructions during this test. I get about 30ft indoors and that is with windows, metal, plastic, drywall, wood in between rooms and whatnot. I'm very pleased with this product. The only downer is that I have two of these in my home and they both have the same ID so my phone cannot tell them apart and I have to manually repair to them when I switch between the two devices. Whereas when devices have unique IDs, my phone can automatically connect when I'm in range or with a single button press from the Bluetooth menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to give the device a unique name.
$SUMMARY.: I would recommend.

$REVIEW.: I've been looking for a good back up hard drive on which to store my photographs, so I couldn't resist trying the Iomega eGo when it was offered for review by Amazon Vine.I'm a firm believer in plug and play when it comes to technology as I don't want to waste time on configuring, etc. The Iomega eGo definitely satisfies in that regard! It works just like any other USB flash drive as nothing extra is required to make it work on the PC (note: I don't have a Mac but the instructions indicate that formatting on a Mac is required). Please note that when the instructions mention that the short line on the USB cable is for auxiliary power, well, they really mean that. It won't work if you plug in the wrong USB cable. Overall, the instructions provided are straightforward and simple- 2 pages in length.The design of the Iomega eGo appears to be fairly sturdy and rugged. It was a bit warm after using it for about 45 minutes but not to the point I worried it was overheating in any way. Apparently there is free software available for download but I'm a little leery as I've had bad experiences with conflicts between different security programs in the past so I probably won't try that.Overall, the Iomega eGo USB 2.0 320 GB Compact Portable Hard Drive 34886 fits my needs perfectly. Easy to use, portable, and sturdy in design, it is a good start for anyone like me first venturing into the use of portable hard drives.

$REVIEW.: When I was looking for my first external hard drive, I obsessed over the reviews and quite frankly, it seemed like every external hard drive I found, there were mixed reviews on it.  I finally decided to take the plunge on this one because the price point and storage seemed perfect for my needs.  I figured that I would risk it.  I bought the drive late last year.Now, after two major drops (accidents because I am a klutz), the drive is still functioning brilliantly.  No exaggeration.  I can't tell you how pleased and shocked I am.  Seriously, my expectations that this would work after the accidents... they were low.The transfer rate of files with Picasa is fine.  I don't wait long for things to be transferred over or back.The only bit of confusion I have, as a complete novice to external drives, is how do you photo organize on the external without having to reimport back to your C drive?  Can you download photo organizing software on the external drive?  I think I need to contact SimpleTech about this question.

I can fit all my perpiherals as well as work materials (folders, papers, a book or two, pens, and so forth), along with a water bottle, smartphone, tablet and any other items I need to carry with me.  The backpack is sturdy, and the straps are supportive and comfortable.  The sections of the backpack that hold the laptop and the tablet are adequately cushioned so there's no worry about my electronics being damaged with normal wear and use.  It can get confusing shopping for certain things online, especially with the pro and con reviews that accompany the merchandise, but I am glad I listened to the favorable reviews of this product because it was just what I wanted/needed and at a decent price as well.  I take good care of my things, and I have no doubt this backpack is going to last me a very long time.

The keyboard itself lets me type comfortably, fast, and they keys give back a reassuring feedback.

$review_text.: To the naked eye, this mouse is simply desirable due to the fact that it is extremely affordable and neat looking, but what isn't known is the dirty little surprise that actually awaits when you use it for the first time. A very nice shade of black, as smooth as a freshly shaved kitty, this mouse will leave you feeling devilishly satisfied after every kill streak. You'll want to whomp on noobs for a few extra hours.Although it is convenient, I find no use for interchangeable sensitivity by the push of a button while in-game, but I do appreciate the added side buttons (Though I've been too lazy to configure them to anything else as of yet). Just as well, I find the scroller to work quite efficiently when you aren't slamming on it like a keyboard-barbarian- though I do not use it to switch weapons often.It has been noted that the blue light does not shut off upon powering down the PC. It is related to where you plug it in, of which I don't care about either. The people who complain about that sexy blue haze keeping them awake all night are just sensitive. I sleep in a blacked-out room (I hate light) soundly with this blue monster beaming at me. It isn't bad at all; the cool hue has a calming effect really.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this Aluratek ADMPF412F digital frame to show jpeg images.  I didn't need or want any of the additional features (video, alarm, calendar, audio, etc.) so I can't/won't comment on those.  I wanted the frame to run continuously (the same way I've used other digital frames from other manufacturers with no problems).Problem is, after several hours of operation the screen goes to green and freezes.  The remote doesn't function, and I have to unplug to restart.  Once I do a "cold restart" I have to set everything up again and begin the slide show again.Yes, I have turned the timer to 'Off'.  Yes, this happens whether I'm showing photos from the internal memory or from an SD card.  There aren't any firmware updates on the Aluratek site (and Aluratek support confirms they don't offer any for this frame anyway).Aluratek's customer service can't tell me what the problem is, though they confirm it's not likely user error -- probably some kind of overheating problem.  They tell me this is not a common issue; based on other reviews on Amazon I'm inclined to believe it.  Regardless, the frame is totally useless for my needs.On a positive note, though, I am very impressed with Amazon's return policies and process.  This is the first item I've ever returned to Amazon, and it is by far the easiest return I've ever experienced.  Five stars (*****) for Amazon's world-class service.

I had to call Sony and do everything manually but it does work now..plus there are more steps that are not user friendly.  But it works!  So far netflix has streamed seamlessly.  I dont like the look of this one as much.. the menu is okay..might take some getting used to.  The remote is okay.  I would prefer one with larger buttons.  As long as everything keeps working well this is a keeper since it has the features i want.Update: still streams perfect and I have watched hours and hours.. I am happy with my purchase.Update 2: crapped out after 3 weeks.  it plays discs..has messed up though. but refuses to stream more than 20 minutes..needs a restart, then it works for 20 more mins.  I checked all my options..i talked to sony and my internet provider and troubleshooted everything. it was the player.This is the second one i bought, and sent back.. i have opted for a roku and regular cd player and couldnt be happier.

$REVIEW.: I bought these to give me a little extra distance on my third monitor.  They work wonderfully.  I run three 24" monitors and have them sli in span mode.  Span mode requires nice cables and will complain if you have lesser cables. It did not complain about this at all! Thanks!

$review_text.: Ok, I admit it - I am addicted to all of the mini-camcorders, even though they are all similar. The newest version of Creatives Vado HD looks and feels like a quality item, this time with the trendy (and fingerprint magnet) piano black.Sometimes people forget to mention the packaging, which can be vital if giving the item as a gift. I am pleased to say time was taken in the presentation- very high end box, and presentation on par with the Flip and Kodak models.  I mention this because the original Vado (non HD) came in a plastic clam shell with a hang tag at the top -kinda cheap looking ( it was not, but still...) You need not worry here, 1st class all the way.The unit is small and sleek, and quite easy to use.  I am lucky enough to have a few 'testers' - my parents are in their 70's, I have several friends in their 30's and 40's, some with kids from 7-19 or so.The Vado passed with flying colors (and rich colors on the bright screen) - it is intuitive,and everyone felt comfortable after just a few minutes. It really is point and shoot. People of ALL ages love the mini-cam's! The instant on feature is nice and a improvement (slightly) over the last model. I keep it in HD+ mode, which seems to offer the best picture.The software is acceptable,and it is quite easy to shoot a clip and upload to YouTube.  Editing can be be a bit of a challenge,and does not compare well to the Flip or Kodak models.Picture quality is sensational,and the included HDMI cable allows you to view your clips on a big screen - nice!Creative offers a massive 8GB on this model- probably MORE then you will ever use.  The battery has a long life but out of the box is set up to recharge ONLY via USB, which may be limiting to some.All in all, a fine product, and currently at a great price.  The software could be improved, and the ability to quickly email videos ( as you can with Flip) is an update that I look forward to.I think you will like this!  One reminder - all the mini cams require good light (probably MORE then you think you need, inside) to perform well.  Also, a tripod would be almost essential.

$REVIEW.: *UPDATED* [5/12/2014] This review was originally from when this watch first came out and before any other Garmin triathlon focused watches came out. I've made some updates to the review over time in hopes that the review will stay relevant and help others to make a good decision on a triathlon focused GPS watch.----------------------------------------------------This device has been represented as a triathlete's watch and the first swim proof GPS watch. If you watch the video from Garmin or see any of the advertisements, Garmin leads you to believe that this watch will collect reliable data for all 3 multisport events. It is reasonable for someone to assume this watch can be worn in a race and collect GPS data in the water, since, of course, swimming is the first event in a triathlon.If you are considering buying this watch, hopefully the following information will help you:-This device does not collect usable data in the water (other than time, which any $20 waterproof watch can collect in a much smaller form factor). No heart rate data and totally unusable and inaccurate GPS data will be collected while in the water.-There are preset modes for "run," "bike," and "other," in which "other" shows a person on skis (obviously a mode for skiing and not swimming). They intentionally omit a category for swimming, despite advertising that this watch is for triathletes and show people coming out of the water in transition (see the photo I added under product photos).-You will need to purchase a separate quick release kit if you want to use this watch on a bike. For some reason, it does not get accurate data on a bike if you are wearing in on your wrist. It auto pauses, then un-pauses for most of the time I am riding if I wear it on my wrist -- even if I have it set to only auto pause when completely stopped. The quick release kit is not the more common one for the 205 and 305, so do not buy that one. [UPDATE: They made a new quick release kit specifically for this watch, then they updated it again. The current [updated] quick release kit that you want to buy isGARMIN 010-10615-00 Quick-Release Mounting Kit]-If you want foot cadence or the ability to track distance indoors, you will want to buy a foot pod. Older, less expensive Garmin models included them in their kits, but it looks like they no longer do that. Either the currentGarmin Foot Pod [Retail Packaging] or the olderGarmin Foot Pod for Forerunner 305, 405, and 50will work, but the newer one is cheaper (as of 5/12/2014), so there is no reason to buy it over the old one. I had the older version and it stopped working after about a year of use (I never ran in the rain or got it wet).-The watch is large and sits high on top of the wrist (they packed 20 hours of battery life into this watch), so to wear it under your wetsuit will let water in the wetsuit, or you will have to wear it on top of (or crammed in front of) the wetsuit, which will not allow you to remove your wetsuit without first removing the watch (adding time and/or complication to your transition, and sort of negating that whole "triathlete" angle). You can see a photo of this watch on my wrist under the photos section of the product to hopefully give you a better idea of what it will look like on you (I'm a 6' 195 lb male with a good sized wrist). If you purchase the quick release kit, you can simply twist off the watch portion from the band before removing your wetsuit, making the wetsuit come off much easier around your wrist (highly recommend buy the quick release kit, by the way).-There is no way to turn off GPS tracking for only one of the 3 events in multisport mode. This means you will always either have incorrect GPS data recording for the swimming mode (or, actually "other", since there is no "swim" mode, as previously mentioned). I have called customer support and they confirm this. Their solution was to turn off GPS while I am swimming, then reset and manually start a new timer and mode during transition 1 for my bike event. I'll let you be the judge of how to take that advice. [UPDATE: I've been told by people in the comments that updates to the Garmin software help correct this information, but I have not been able to verify those changes myself. Feel free to comment if you have details on this.]So, in conclusion, if you want to setup this watch for a bike and run, and want the ability to wear the watch in the water before hand (and not start it unless you want some incorrect distance data included), you will need to buy:(pricing as of 5/12/2014)~$188 - the Garmin 310XT with HR~$16 - Quick release kit (for wrist and bike)GARMIN 010-10615-00 Quick-Release Mounting Kit~$49 - Foot pod (if you want cadence while running)Garmin Foot Pod [Retail Packaging]~$38 - speed/cadence sensor (if you want cadence for the bike)Garmin GSC 10 Speed/Cadence Bike SensorYou'll be into it for $291 (as of 5/12/2014)[Conclusion Update 05/12/2014] When I originally purchased all of those parts above in 2009, it was $575. Current pricing is much more reasonable. At the current price of $187 for this watch/heart rate monitor combo, it's not a bad deal at all, even if the watch is somewhat dated. I feel that Garmin did the consumer wrong on this model with the false advertising (in 2009) and high cost of itemized accessories, but with the current total being about half of the original cost, it's now a viable option.[EDIT: I have edited the title of this review to what it currently reads from "Misleading: Not a Triathlete's Watch," because it seems that Garmin has softened their advertising and marketing surrounding this watch. I purchased this watch when it first came out in 2009, and at the time the marketing videos and advertising in triathlon magazines mentioned nothing about the fact that it doesn't track GPS data in the water, and in fact seemed to lead the consumer into believing that it does. That advertising has since softened and is now replaced by a newer modelGarmin Forerunner 910XT GPS-Enabled Sport Watch. I would look at that newer model and compare it to this one to decide which model you would prefer. As of 5/12/2014, it is $399 by itself, $449 with heart rate monitor, or $499 with the triathlon kit.

$REVIEW.: I have a Canon 60d and purchased several of these.  They permit the camera to autofocus and also permit me to shoot with a 2 second delay so I can be in the picture without showing the remote in it.  The only downside I've encountered is that this device has a fairly limited range at which at will activate the camera, maybe 10 feet.  However, for the price of roughly $4, it's hard to beat.

 I have never installed a protector and it was much easier than everyone else made it out to be
 Seems like this protector will be durable and last
 Very happy to see it come in multiples in case you mess up, or if you get it right the first time you will have an extra for later use.Cons:  Must be VERY clean during installation, i noticed a couple specs of debris (very tiny) causing bubbles i couldn't work out, luckily the they were on the edges and my tablet cover hides these
 The case was actually for my fiance's tablet and she likes everything about it except for the fact that it reduces the screen clarity and brightness, small price to pay for protection though.

$REVIEW.: I had a Microsoft keyboard that would not lay flat and it shed its key cap legends after a couple of months. I picked up this keyboard as a replacement and it is terrific. It has some weight so it lays flat and stays put, same when using the elevating feet. The wireless response is instantaneous and the keyboard is USB rechargeable.The key caps are double shot so the legends are molded all the way through and won't wear off. They are also back lit so they are always clearly visible. The keyboard senses ambient light levels and adjusts accordingly. The key resistance is perfect, not to hard or too light for touch typing.  Excellent keyboard.Revised - Went back to order another within three days and the price went from $68, when sold and shipped by Amazon Prime, to $30 more from an Amazon reseller and fulfilled by Amazon. Great keyboard as I reviewed the first time, but not at a 50% higher price. I'm finding that resellers listed as Prime do not honor in spirit the free shipping benefit that comes with Prime membership. They just grossly pad their selling prices and negate the benefit.
$SUMMARY.: Finally, a keyboard I can see! (Revised)

$REVIEW.: After using the IMP50D for several months I am very happy with the performance.  I have two and keep them with me wherever I go.  It has been a perfect match for my everyday use.  I participate in the emergency services field and I need to be able to reliably charge several USB devices if I am in a situation where I do not have available power to plug into.  I also use it regularly with I am camping with the Scouts to always ensure I can make a phone call in the event of an emergency.  On trips I use it to allow my kids to charge their electronic devices in the car without having to mess with a bunch of cigarette lighter cords.As an example of how handy this can be for everyday use - this past weekend we were camping and took several hikes - try taking your iPhone4, using the GPS to go Geocaching, and taking pictures and video of the kids.  You will drain the iPhone in about 2 to 3 hours without something like an IMP50.I chose the New Trent product because of the good reputation and recommendation from another co-worker.  I specifically chose the IMP50D because #1 - it could charge it iPad.  #2 - because it is the largest pack from New Trent that can be charged by USB (I dont want to carry a wall wart with me).I can generally get 3 to 4 charge cycles on my iphone and blackberry.  I get around 50% charge on my iPad, so two IMP50s gets me a full charge for the iPad.  I have also used it to recharge iPods, Nintendo DS (with USB cable), mobile hotspot router, FRS/GMRS radios, Flashlights - you name it, if it is USB, this should handle it well.The IMP50 does like to be used and recharged (even if just a little bit) in order to keep it at peak performance, so I would not recommend throwing it at the bottom of a bag and expect it to be ready 6 weeks later.If I would recommend any improvement on the IMP50d, it would be to the power button so it can no accidentally be turned off when charging but that is a very minor issue.

But everything did fit like it should.PROS: 1-Price; 2-came with a lot of stuff...cables, power supply, plenty of screws.CONS: 1-Front panel door takes a lot of pressure to get it to click open; 2-instructions were sketchy; 3-No clearance between the CPU fan and power supply. 4-Slim space for the single mini pci card. A graphics card with fan may not fit.My biggest beef with this case is that the corner of the power supply actually touches the motor housing of the cpu fan (core i3 3225). It still works fine like that but it bugs me. Other than that it's a decent case for the money.

In the process of trying to find out the cause I ended up updating some drivers and doing general clean up and maintenance that I did not realize needed to be done anyway. So it really worked out better for me that the first one did not work. Funny how things work out.Ice as very nice and paid for the return shipping and sent me a new one even before the defective one had gotten to him.He was very patient (takes a lot to work with old folks sometime) and he came thru like a champ.The price of the battery was really good and the customer service is great.Highly recommend company and product.

$REVIEW.: BDP-BX58 Blu-ray playerThere are so many issues with this device, I probably can't remember them all


Here are most of them, I think.The unit has terrible response to its remote control, requiring repeated button presses or playing around with the angle or distance until the device recognizes the instruction
Sometimes it ignores button presses from just 2 feet away
New batteries do not help

Third-party universal remotes show the same issue as the original remote
The unit powers itself back on sometimes after being recently powered off
The player will frequently not remember where it left off playing a DVD, forcing me to scan from the beginning


 The Netflix video streaming service frequently stops or is reduced to low-rate (&#60;1Mbps)
Wireless or wired network makes no difference (I have verified it is not the home network - other streaming devices work great)


I suppose this could be an issue Netflix has with the device, but other devices work just fine when I use them instead of this product.

 This was recommended to me and I bought it

 I really like the size of this tripod

 Not only does it work with my iPhone it also works with my Gopro Hero 2 and my Canon Elph 110 HS both attached using the grip or the 1/4 20 bolt
 I did a video of a graduation party with my Gopro using this tripod and it worked great.I've been using tabletop tripods for years and have a small collection of them

 I'm thinking for sure this will get a lot of use by me

 I really like the size as it fits into my Lowe two pouch belt camera bag, along with my camera, micro cloth and compact mirror
 I use the mirror to see the screen if the camera screen is not so visible.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small lightweight table top tripod.I do have some reservations about the tightening slot but that's just me

 I don't always have a coin with me

 I suppose I could throw one in my walkabout camera bag.

$review_text.: So I got this for macro photography
It fits
It's a tight fit
I was a little worried at first


But it does fit, and the electrical conduit is genuine

I can control my aperture with this extension electronically, which is the reason you get an electrical extension tube in the first place


For $50, you are converting ANY lens into a serious macro lens, with full electrical control on the aperture, which is what you do not have when using the $15 ones that do not have electrical conduits

Works great
I was able to take my f-stop any direction and open and close my aperture to control depth of field during macro photography with literally any lens (I'm using my 18-55mm, but it works fine even for my 50-250mm lens too).Using a Canon Rebel T4i.18-55mm, 50-250mm Canon lens fit just fine and work perfectly.Full aperture control during use.Basically turn your humble lens into a $500+ macro lens for $50.Perfect for someone wanting to experiment with macro, or do great macro on a budget.If you're a serious enthusiast, just buy a good macro lens for $700~1500.

$SUMMARY.: Fits my Rebel T4i, tight fit, but works

Inexpensive.

None have stopped working despite mild surface scratching.There's not really much else to say about a spindle of CD's, to be fair.

$review_text.: About 6 months ago, I purchased this USB cable for my phone


When I received it, it worked just fine


I loved the material it was made out of and how durable it seemed to be
After about 6 months, it just stopped working all of a sudden
It now easily slips out and won't even charge


Very disappointed

It should last for at least a year, if not more
Disappointed.

$review_text.: When I first got this item it worked OK. But soon the buttons started to act weird. Hit &#34;pause&#34; and the volume goes up or down or to mute; hit &#34;volume up&#34; and the machine stops; hit the up-down arrow buttons to maneuver the menu and 9 out of 10 times they don't respond. Yesterday the picture went to &#34;green screen&#34;, which it now does intermittently. On the bright side, there's still sound. In summary, this item is poorly made and not worth half the money.

$REVIEW.: Love this mouse.  I bought it by mistake-- thought I was getting the full-sized one (M310).  This one is the scaled-down laptop-sized model.  I ended up buying a second one so I have one for my laptop and one for my desktop.  It's probably one of those &#34;you like it or you don't&#34; things.  If you have giant hands, buy the M310.  If not, this M325 may be a winner.Oh, and the batteries last forever.  This was my first wireless mouse so I thought I'd be changing batteries every 2 weeks.  I use my desktop 8-9 hours a day and the M325 is still running the original battery 9 months later.

$REVIEW.: Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says "Nook"Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a "Nook" is not required, it should say, "Not intended for Nook Devices". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to "DeskTop Study", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.

$review_text.: When the AT&T; technician was setting up service to my house, I asked him what modem I should look for instead of paying the $100 rental fee for their modem/router combination. I have the ASUS RT-AC66 and I wanted to use it as my router. He said any DSL modem would work, so I hopped on Amazon and went to work looking for one. I picked the Actiontec and worked with it for a few days, but it never picked up the signal, even when the AT&T; equipment did. I did a bit more research and called around; it turns out that AT&T; service in my area is VDSL and this modem isn't capable of working with VDSL.In the time that I was working with the settings and the configuration trying to get it to work, I learned a bit about the modem. It's really simple to setup (provided you have the right service), and it seemed to run reasonably cool. I can't speak to performance with regards to internet speed and connectivity. Currently, I am running my router behind the AT&T; modem/router (I convinced another tech to give me one for free).

$review_text.: The biggest thing I love about this headset is the ease of going back and forth between our iPhone, Samsung Galaxy SII and PC
The connecting back and forth between these devices is simple and seamless
Note: I'm running Windows 8

 Critique/Information:1) The manual is missing key information and Plantronics support, although very patient and friendly, suggested I return the headset because even they thought it was malfunctioning (2 stars for the manual).2) Flashing blue light means charging and solid blue means charged
I also think the flashing read light means charging, but the battery is really low


I'll keep playing around with it, but I think the battery meter accuracy is not the best.3) If battery meter is not accurate drain battery completely and then charge fully

I almost returned headset because battery level information was inaccurate, but tried this and now the battery and meter levels seems to be accurate.4) The phone does not have a sleep mode, so if you leave the headset on and sitting for long enough the battery will die

Apparently, Plantronics did this because there are connection issues when having a sleep mode on these phones


Again, this information is not in the manual.5) The software seems a bit buggy in terms of charging accuracy, pressing buttons on the headset to use, getting voice battery level information from the headset, connecting to the PC, and/or using the voice commands


It could just be me and the learning curve, but it seems a bit more complicated than it has to be.6) You can have two headsets connected if you like


Say one for listening to Youtube videos, etc


and the Legend for communication
Just set Legend as the communication device and the other as the default device in the Windows sound control panel.7) It doesn't work with Google Hangouts

The sound test works in the headset, but when I make the Hangout call the sound does not go into the headset


This may be an issue with Hangouts, but not sure yet.8) You can personalize the headset and get updates by going to: [...] -> Support -> Downloads & Apps -> Get Started (Under Personal on the right)-> Headset Updates -> Voyager Legend.So, it loses one star for all of this, but I still highly recommend the headset


Hopefully this information will save people some headaches.Update: 10/18/2013Comment #5: It's not me it's you Plantronics
Having used this device for awhile now I can say it is a bit "fussy." The voice commands don't always work, the battery level accuracy can be off, and the reception can be very up and down


I wanted to use this headset for business meetings, but it is just too unreliable with softphones or other cloud calling methods
When using on my computer, I now only use it for more casual calls through Skype, etc.Comment #7: It now works with Google Hangouts
Strangely, it will ring my wired headphones, but when the call is picked up the call is with the Plantronics headset


For getting to the Google Hangout settings follow these instructions: [...]Update: 12/12/2013I come to realize I have a love-hate relationship with this headset
I love it when it works, but when it doesn't work I want to throw it out the window

But like an overly attached lover, I just can't bring myself to do it

As example of what finicky partner this thing is, it was working beautifully until the battery died the other day

Like it a jilted lover not getting enough attention, it seemed to get all moody on me and stopped connecting to my phone or answer calls when they came in

I'm in the process of updating my firmware, but at this point I have to reduce the ratings down to three stars


It's just way to finicky for 5 or even 4 stars
Edit: I did update and that took care of the problem, but I'm keeping the rating at three stars because this headset is just way too finicky.

$REVIEW.: Edit: After about a year of heavy use (I take them to the office and listen to them for about 4-6 hours a day) they have broken. Its not a short in the wire or a dent in the speaker like you would expect, but instead a manufacturing issue. The speaker in the right "earcup" has become detached from it's housing. It still plays music, but also shakes around in the container, which makes for some annoying ruckus whenever I turn my head. The bass has also suffered in quality; I am sure the lack of a sure and attached housing decreases its ability to correctly produce low notes.Huge bummer...I really liked these.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------They look good, seem durable, and generally sound good. I have had them for about a week, so there's a bit of inexperience on my part.I have had some trouble with the sound, but it seems that people have had luck breaking them in. Hopefully the small amount of static goes away soon.Also the fit was a bit tough at first: they dug in just below my ears. However, they are very flexible and it seems that the wire band goes all throughout the overtop support, so you can bend it to just how you like it. Good stuff.Might come back and give these 5 stars. If they are durable and last for a few years I certainly will. So far they are great.

$REVIEW.: I've been playing with this camera for the last 2 days. It has rich features packed in it and lightweight.Based on the pictures that I took, I feel you have to know how to use Manual setting to get better pictures. Several shots were taken outdoor with ISO 80 in P mode didn't look good (it was a little bit cloudy that day). I didn't want to bump up the ISO to more than ISO 200 (this camera has grainy problems on higher ISO values). Then I took several shots with Manual mode with the same ISO, changed shutter speed and set appropriate aperture, the pictures look very nice.[...].I can't complain too much about low LCD resolution or low battery efficiency. This camera is pretty cheap ($179) and has some nice features.Overall is a good buy for somebody that wants to learn Manual setting.UPDATE: 09/08/07The more I use this camera, the more I feel bad buying an SLR :(. This camera has so much on it. I wish I hadn't spent so much money on an SLR.

$review_text.: I've owned several bluetooth headsets over the years, and I've always chosen Plantronics.  (The one time I picked a non-Plantronics product, I ended up bringing it back to the store.)  So I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the Motorola 89561N HK250 Headset.  The sound quality and the range are excellent, and I didn't hear any complaints from the other end of my phone calls about background noise.  I also liked the voice prompt feature, which tells you how much talk time you have left.  I have a bad habit of forgetting to charge my Bluetooth headset, and it usually dies when it's the most inconvenient.  This feature spared me from having that happen.  The only drawback I found with this headset was the earpiece - I'm used to something a little more substantial - but it's not bad once you get used to it.  Recommended.

$review_text.: I was having a lot of problems with my CD player skipping, refusing to play certain CDs, and randomly changing CDs. I thought I would have to replace it, which I didn't want to because it's a high-end one, and I just love the sound quality. In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player, in my case a 5 CD changer, and hit play. It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels. I was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly.Tonight I put in a CD that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song. Will wonders never cease...it played perfectly!Couldn't ask for a better product. Saved me a ton of money on a new, high end (I was going to choose a Yamaha) player.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this Radar Detector since February of 2011. The reason i bought this detector is because i drive 100 miles a day to and from my workplace and it is a very highly traveled area for state and local police. What I've noticed is that this detector is spot on with K, KA and X Bands, while it seems that Airports and Cell Phone towers in some cases put out a high amount of X Band Radar, it can cause some interference with this detector. But it's manageable to clear those alerts using the quiet button.However, this detector does not register Laser Radars (LIDARS) in my area. I have watched countless Wisconsin state trooper's point their LIDAR at me with no notification from this detector that they in fact are tracking me. I can recall at least 4 times that i know of, where i saw this happen.With that said, buy this detector for the RADAR detecting, not the Laser detecting. I thought about returning this product, but since you can't do much when your hit by a LIDAR to make it worth the trouble to return it.

$review_text.: In the past couple of years my job has unfortunately intruded into my home life in the form of conference calls with folks from offshore.  At work I have a nice plantronics headset hooked up to my desk phone.  Being able to type and talk at the same time and not having to contort my neck to hold a handset to my head has been a godsend.  But, since the calls invaded my home life where I didn't have access to that nice office headset I had to go searching for options.  Bluetooth headsets with my cell phone just didn't work very well for my needs.  And, holding my handset from the landline got old.  I ultimately found this unit when I was searching and seeing that the price wasn't too bad I punched the button.I've had the headset now for a couple years and it's more than met my needs as a home user.  The sound quality is pretty decent, not exceptional, but is on par with most cordless handsets in my experience.  The headset band expands well enough to fit my large head without giving me pressure points.My only real complaint is simply that there is no easy to find/press mute button on the module.  If you clip the phone to your belt to walk around and need to mute the call you'll be searching the face of the box for the right button to press to mute/unmute.  Since I spend a lot of time on conference calls I frequently need to be on mute and then speak up at different points.  So that mute button gets a decent amount of play from me.  And, despite how often I use it I still find myself hunting the face of the phone for it.

$review_text.: I loved this camera when I first got it. I brought it on a tubing trip down a river with a load of friends (there were like 12 of us that day I guess?), and got some great pictures and video with it. The closeups were awesome, the zoom was nice. I did take a few underwater pictures, but not many. I love the way it fits in your hand! Very easy to hold in action situations. But then..I brought it home and was playing around in the pool we have with it, following this little wind-up toy we have that swims around. I was going from above water to underwater every couple minutes, and not leaving it under for more than 30 seconds at a time. The pool was only 3.5 ft deep, and it never touched the bottom, but after about 20 minutes, it died, while underwater.Fearing the worst, I quickly picked it up and checked to make sure the battery cover tab was pushed down (which creates the seal with the gasket). It was, so I got out and toweled it off, and pulled the battery compartment open. There were drops of water on the inside, like there had been a slow leak happening. Bummer..So I let it dry for a few hours (about 8 hours) without touching it, the battery or anything. I put the battery on the charger after I was sure it was dry, and the charger lit up like it was charging it. After the charger light went off, I put the battery in the camera, and tried it. Nothing happened. Dead camera.So I got in touch with Amazon about returning it (these guys are great about returns!), and brought it to the UPS store to return it. The girl at the UPS store said that was the THIRD ONE THAT WEEK that was being returned, all because of water damage.Now that said, this camera is obviously supposed to be waterproof, but I think you'd be chancing it to keep it underwater for longer than 20-30 seconds at a time, which is pretty lame since it claims to be waterPROOF, not resistant. I'm sure it would also be a great one to bring to the beach to keep sand from getting in the works of it also, but I noticed that a little did get in the hinge between the screen and the camera body itself, making a grinding noise occur when it was adjusted until I washed it out.So, I can't recommend this camera, because there's another one just like it by the same company and priced less and doesn't claim to be waterproof, because obviously neither one of them are.

$review_text.: I bought the Canon f/2.8L 70-200mm  because I was looking for sharper night shots.  It definitely delivered.  For me it produces its most crisp images at f/11 and the detail even at 100% crop is simply astounding. My skyline night shots are better balanced than with any other lens and the lens extracts definition and color that makes me smile a lot.  It does seem to hesitate sometimes while focusing on dark shots but not at a rate which would alarm me.  The zoom ring is firm but smooth and I am comfortable using it with my normal grip.  The tripod collar fits perfectly and mates to my tripod firmly.The lens normally rides on my 5D but when I want to reach out farther I slip it on my 7D for the crop sensor advantage.  The 1.6x crop factor pushes the lens out to a 320mm equivalent, while still maintaining max aperture at f/2.8L.  The image compressed on the smaller 7D sensor is theoretically less sharp than a full frame but having that extra reach comes in handy sometimes.The IS works silently and produces very smooth images while the lens is hand held.  I sat on the bow of a small boat and photographed other boats and floating houses in Vietnam and Cambodia  while zooming up and down rivers and around the delta and even though my boat was bouncing and the subjects were moving quickly towards me, the sharpness was outstanding.  I added a B&W; polarization filter, which eliminated glare from the water and pulled out some wonderful contrast and vivid colors -- even at mid-day.I've also used this as a portrait lens and it delivers in that department as well.  Wide open it produces impressive bokeh and a gentle softness on the subject.  Stepping up a few stops the images are sharper with less DoF but still lovely.  It is easy to override the autofocus when manually fine-tuning and the tension is firm enough to keep the ring in place for the shot.The overall performance of this glass is top notch, but it is big and heavy and not discrete.  It has worn me out some days carrying it around.  Before I bought it I considered the f/4L 70-200mm IS and may invest in that one day, but my ego convinced me to go large initially so I went with the f/2.8L first.  Image quality, at least optical clarity, is higher with the f/2.8L but you pay the price with increased bulk, increased weight and increased price.I've read great things about Canon's 135mm f/2L Prime and have added that to my wish list.  While not having the reach of a 200mm, the reduced weight and size are definitely appealing and the price is attractive as well, sitting right around a $1000 right now.  That may be my comprise rather than buying a f/4L 70-200mm.  Slipping the 135mm f/2L on the 7D would give me the equivalent of 216mms in a compact, bright and very sharp prime package.My wife can never have enough shoes and I can never have enough lenses.  It is the secret to a happy marriage, especially if she never really knows how many lenses I truly have :-)

$review_text.: I ordered this as soon as they became available so its been outside doing its job for years now. Im not cheap but the price for Cable and Satellite to me is a prohibitive waste. We live 60 miles from Houston and about that far from most of the Broadcast antennas. I mounted this on a 15 foot pole braced and anchored by our 9 foot Gate. LIne of sight, Horizon, and Trees are all an issue. We have sets in 3 rooms so besides the amplifier on the cable entering the house we have amplifiers for each set. I only get the larger amplifiers with 4 to 6 outputs because they last longer and give me flexibility. You can get them locally too so easy fix from Walmart if one goes down. We get strong clear signal from most of the 68 channels available in this market. PBS is the weakest and is best on cloudy days. We have a CW station that since the sun spot issues started only comes in clearly on clear days and nights. Muti Directional can be misleading though its true. We used walkie talkies to focus for best signal reception. A little more involved that the old Field Strength Meters but probably easier. We can get some pretty intense storms here on the Texas Gulf Coast and though we have had no direct Hurricane hits since I installed this antenna we have had some bad storms. We have large old growth pine trees and squirrels so the antenna has been assaulted by falling branches, fast flying  Pine cones , and Squirrels. Most pine needles come off on their own and at my age this is truly a blessing not to have to try and clear these from the antenna. If a better antenna is on the market I would buy it but unless directed to one Im good with this bad boy.

$review_text.: Had to dig out an old phone that had a wired handset to test the device. The Tt System Tele-recorder adapter record feature was okay (recording to a computer) but the play feature did not work at all. I was concerned since the device has a mono plug and the computer microphone input is stereo, but the computer just recorded both channels with the same signal. To test the play I used a stereo MP3 player. I needed a device with both play and record working so this didn't work. I'd recommend saving your money, buying an RJ9 adapter and making your own adapter. You'll spend more money and time trying out adapters that don't work.

$review_text.: I have Sharp LC-60LE640U tv, it has smart features built in.  You will ask: why do you need it if you've already had the smart tv?Well, first of all, convenience.  Each time I turn on my tv, Chromecast becomes available within a few seconds (WIFI connection), no mater you switch to that channel or not, it's always there.  When I need to cast something from my pc or tablet, I just click that icon in the corner, it will automatically switch to Chromecast channel on tv.  Life is much more enjoyable now...Secondly, each time I tried to stream my photo and video from my pc to tv, I had to use its built-in DLNA feature to PULL the sources (because it's a DLNA DMP, not DMR), it's very hard to use remote control to search on tv.  Now with Chromecast, I can PUSH anything from my pc to tv, that saves me a lot of time and energy!  This is another $30 (it's now back to $35)  well spent, it's worth every penny.Last but not least, after I got this, I've found the viki site, which has tons of free tv series from China, Korea, Japan, and many other countries, literally you can watch tv shows from the whole world!  Viki has built-in Chromecast support now, just like Youtube.I'd highly recommend it if you are someone like me.

The counter did not work in the record mode. The microphone didn't work. When I tried to count to 30 directly into the recorder microphone, what voice did record was so garbled that you couldn't understand it as a human voice. This is what you get when you order a "used-like new" and this is not the first time this has happened to me with Amazon.com products, unfortunately. I've learned my lesson.

$REVIEW.: I used to carry my previous small cameras in a Timbuk2 iPod case that was old and understated
Nobody paid too much attention to it, which is what I really wanted
Right as I bought my Sony DSC-TX7 my case suddenly disappeared and I was left with no choice but to pick up a new one.Sony's obvious offerings are crazy


They either want too much money for their leather cases, or their cloth cases are not providing the functionality that I want


Tried to check out a local Target, they had at least 20 different designs, either these didn't fit my camera, or they did but they had a zipper, or the colors were too loud.Then I found this baby here, almost by accident

It is priced ridiculously low (over half of what I was expecting to pay for the ugly cases I saw at Target), it has the belt buckle I want and it doesn't use a zipper


According to the published dimensions it would be about 5mm shorter than what I would need for my Sony DSC-TX7 but I was hoping that between the flexibility of the leather and maybe manufacturing tolerances it wouldn't be an issue.It wasn't: the case fits my camera like a glove


It is soft black leather on the outside, and it is lined in suede

It has a small pocket inside that can be used to hold a memory card or that kind of thing


My camera is much thinner than the space available, but due to its construction the case still fits snugly and the camera doesn't bounce inside
I have no idea how long the clasp is going to last, but the leather itself looks like it is going to age nicely, it is a bit softer than what I would expect for a wallet.The belt loop is not fixed, it uses velcro on its bottom so you can hook it to your belt without having to unbuckle it.

$REVIEW.: These are the kind of earbuds I've been waiting for since bluetooth was invented.-Amazingly small form factor. Not much bigger or heavier than corded earbuds. Without an attached cord yanking down, these actually stay in your ear better.-Very lightweight and comfortable in the ear. Multiple sizes of buds and earwings.-Magnetic (buttonless) on/off with auto-connect is very convenient. This makes it unlikely you will forget to turn it off and have the battery die.-Sound quality is excellent for an earbud although there is a bit of background static when something is playing. If there is nothing playing, the static goes away.-Charges via universal micro-usb.My main complaint is that the carrying case is a flimsy afterthought. For such an expensive, fragile headphone, a hard case would have been nice.

$review_text.: I recently bought the X-E2 camera, and got this case to beef up the handgrip and protect the camera from bumps and scratches. The bottom half-case attaches to the camera by screwing into the tripod mount. The half case provides an alternative mount, though on my case the threads are too cheaply cast to be used. They aren't even, and there is some extra metal stuck on, indicating poor manufacturing. This case also means that when you put your camera down, it doesn't rest flat. You have to unscrew the case to get to the battery and SD card. The fujifilm batteries aren't known for long life, you end up having to unscrew this case frequently to charge and change batteries. This case also doesn't have any pouches or pockets. If you have an extra battery, or a lens cloth for example, you can't store it anywhere on this case.I suppose you get what you pay for with this case. The fujifilm cases cost 4X as much. This case is OK for the price, in that it fits and it adds a bit of protection to your camera. It's not a very practical case though, and I will keep searching for an economical solution for transporting and protecting my fujifilm camera.If all you're looking for is a bit of protection, and aren't worried about the above mentioned problems, then this is the case for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend against buying this case.

$review_text.: The sound quality is excellent. Charging and synchronizing with my iTunes library is automatic and easy. Two issues where Apple could do a bit more work are the controls and the earbuds. Because so many functions are combined in the touch wheel, it's easy to do something you didn't intend to do (e.g. switch to the menu when you're trying to adjust the volume) This is not a serious problem, and it gets easier to control the unit as you get accustomed to it. The earbuds don't stay in my ears very well when working out. I replaced them with a set of Sony noise canceling headphones.

$REVIEW.: If you're serious about shortwave, this isn't the radio you want, but this radio is great as a &quot;do- I-want-to-pursue-this-shortwave-thing-further&quot; radio, or as a  lightweight travel rig. It'll will bring in the higher-power shortwave  stations:  BBC, Radio Netherlands, Radio Japan etc.  Sound quality is quite  good.  Like most analog radios, knowing what frequency you are on is  impossible, but for casual tuning, or to get a taste of what shortwave has  to offer, this radio is fine. It's also small and light enough to make a  decent travel portable (and cheap enough that if you lose it, it's not the  end of the world.) And, its a good radio to toss into your emergency  preparedness kit.It will perform better with an external antenna  &quot;boost&quot; - just take a 10'-30' piece of wire, attach a couple of  alligator clips, and save yourself $15 by not buying a &quot;reel in&quot;  antenna.

$REVIEW.: So I wanted to hook this up to my projector, for a nice, clean installation, but alas, the USB port that it draws power from is on the side and so I can't plug it in because the HDMI port on the projector is slightly recessed. If it had been on the back like ChromeCast, it would have been fine.  Now, I could use the HDMI extension cable that came with it, but the back of the projector is highly visible and it gives it sort of a sloppy look, so I don't know that I'll leave this there.HOWEVERAs long as it fits where you want it, it's totally easy plug 'n' play.  There was no set up and nothing to configure--it just worked out of the box and the picture looked great.Note that this is NOT a competitor for the Chromecast, even though it looks very similar.  The main thing I use my Chromecast for is to cast my chrome page to the TV from my computer.  As far as I know, you can't use &#34;miracast&#34; to go from a computer to this--it has to be a mobile device of some sort.  I hope that changes some day, but I doubt it will with the ridiculous copyright restriction this-and-that laws out there.  Pity.

$REVIEW.: If it weren't for the sticky return key, I would have given this four stars.  I hate one-finger typing, and this meets my needs for the occasional email when using the pad.  For more serious typing, I bought a Micro USB Host Mode OTG (On The Go) Cable, plugged that into the Nexus seven and plugged the other end into a USB hub.  With the Hub in place, I plugged in a USB mouse and a USB keyboard (Goldtouch Go! Travel Keyboard).  With this setup, I can type normally, and the Nexus doesn't have to be rooted first.  I'm waiting for a Blurex Ultra-Slim Case for Google Nexus 7 inch Tablet before I try some serious work.  At that point, my far-sighted eyes may be the limiting factor to using this instead of a normal laptop (mine bit the dust a while ago.)

$REVIEW.: Used these adapters when installing 4 Pioneer 6x8 speakers (TS-A6885R). With these adapters, installation is a breeze. Simply plug into the aftermarket speaker, and into the factory ford adapter in the door and you are good to go!

$review_text.: I originally owned a Denon DVD-1920, but could not get the black levels to look crisp and clear.  Very dark scenes looked "smudged" and glossy.  It appeared to be a macroblocking problem with the processor chip.So I ordered the OPPO and all I can say is wow!  I am using a Sony CRT front projector running at 720p and 1080i and I now know what I was missing.  Scene 9 from Saving Private Ryan was almost unbearable to watch with the Denon, but not with the OPPO.  Blacks and the shadows are crisp and clear.  Great price for a very good product!

$REVIEW.: If you own an external flash you probably know that one of the great things about it is bouncing it off walls and ceilings to achieve a soft and more balanced light effect, unlike direct light on your photo subject. Well, if you don't know, then look it up right away! it upgrades indoor photos by a factor of about zillion...But the problem with bouncing is thatA) you don't always have the right wall to bounce from - it may be too far (or too high if it's a ceiling) or it may be dark or the direction is not what you expect andB) if you change the way you hold the camera from landscape to portrait of the other way around you are likely to need to re-tilt the plash which is annoying.This simple and reasonably priced gadget fixes BOTH issues. No longer bouncing, just put this on your flash and tilt it 45 degrees (or even directly at your subject if you're using ETTL) and you're done. The only caveat is that it reduces the light level but I didn't think it was an issue with photos i've taken so far.Unlike some other diffusers, this one simply goes on top of your flash and is tight enough to stay there. no adapters needed.

$REVIEW.: 24 Hour ReviewI have had this tablet/netbook/convertable for a day and I'll relay my first impressions.First the oddities.1. When attached to the keyboard, it sits at one angle. No ajustment. This doesnt bother me much, but it might some people.2. The keyboard is slightly off center to the center of the screen. This does bother me a bit as a touch typist; and the home ribs on the F and J keys are the line at the bottom.Oddity or benefit?The keyboard needs to be traveled with imo. The tablet portion locks into the postion with the keyboard which forms the protective side for the screen.Likes.1. Audio quality from the headphone jack is excellent. (Pandora + Monster Turbines)2. Very nice looking screen, with fast seeming pixal response.3. Touch Screen is responsive and acurate. My sausage fingers do sometimes miss, but people with normal sized hands shouldn't have any problems.4. Full size SD slot. Not micro. Sure you can use micro on a adaptor, but why pay that much extra?Will update as I get more time with it.Day 2 Update...Basic battery test; Wifi streamed Pandora, headphones, powersave mode, LCD off about 60% = 5.4 hours until Windows started on the "automaticly sleep" stuff at 7% battery remaining.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this product thinking it would be awesome and let me tell you the case does look awesome.  The cable guides are also great.I was rocking along with not a care in the world for a month and a half.  Then one morning, I awoke and my computer was off and the air smelled of fried electronics.I thought at first that I had messed up the tubing but then I noticed water droplets on the fans of the radiator.  The built in radiator is top mounted and preinstalled.  I had never had reason or motivation to mess with it.  Since all the tubes are BELOW the radiator, there was no way for water to flow UP through air to the radiator.  I took pictures that clearly show the water droplets on the bottom side of the fan blades and the computer components below the radiator.  Then I started disassembling the computer.Sadly, the water fried my graphics cards, wireless card and the LED cable lights I had added.  (My rig looked cool.)When I presented everything including the pictures and a long explanation by email to Thermaltake, do you know what response I got?NOTHING.  Not even an acknowledgement.  My calls were never answers and subsequent emails met the same silence.NOTHING.  I finally gave up, ordered a Corsair H100i to replace the watercooling system, and had to replace my graphics card.I ordered the preinstalled watercooling version so I wouldn't have to risk the installation of the radiator causing problems.  Instead, the pre-installed watercooler cost me over $400 to replace the graphic cards and did not perform as well as the Corsair H100i anyway.DO NOT BUY THEIR WATER COOLING version and do not expect them to care if a defect causes a leak.I would recommend the non-watercooling version except that the horrible customer service makes me extremely leery of buying anything from Thermaltake ever again.
$SUMMARY.: Built in radiator spontaneously leaked after about 45 days and Thermaltake ignored my support request

I was having trouble with the Amped product crashing at least once per week.  I did have a little issue setting the UniFi AP up in January.  I forget the problem I had but it had to do with the monitoring software seeing the WAP.  I googled around and found some sort of fix.  Can't remember what it was unfortunately.  Anyway, I had no issues with the WAP since I installed it.  It has been 24x7 reliable which is a good thing.Would definitely buy it again.  Never again will I buy Amped Wireless products.

$REVIEW.: I've been selling, installing and supporting ViewSonic video displays for over 15 years now and they have always seemed to make a high quality product.  I am now in a position to comment as a consumer.I already own a 24" version of this great display (slightly different model but very close to the same features and specs) and have been very pleased with it for the last 2+ years.  Now I've been blessed with this 27" disply for Christmas by my family and I am already really enjoying it.  The same quality that you have always come to expect from a ViewSonic monitor with clear, crisp and bright picture quality at a fast refresh rate.  It's great for everything; viewing web pages, pictures, videos and HD movies, and of course gaming  :)-----------------------------Cons:  Just 3 as I see it.It does lack the HDMI input that my 24" ViewSonic monitor has.  If you plan to use the HDMI connection you will need another display model.  This was not an issue for me because I'm not using the HDMI input.  I connect to my displays via the DVI inputs.Another thing I am not crazy about is true on both my 24" and this one and that is the fact that the button labels are very hard to see.  They are just molded impressions in the plastic case front but are not colored in any way so you have to move your head a round a bit to get the light on them right in order to be bale to read them.  A little color in those impressions would go a long way to helping ease the reading of those labels.Finally both models have fixed bases that do not swivel or raise/lower.  This is part of the price point however so it also was not an issue for me, I don't need either feature.-----------------------------Now with this 27" display I've really been appreciating the enlarged picture while running at 1920x1080.  I have a very large desk and this display compliments my desktop computing set up very nicely.  This monitor is a great, very hard to beat deal at this current price.I would recommend it to anyone.

$REVIEW.: Your search stops here. Just get 'em. The price on this set of speakers has never been lower and is worth every penny. I upgraded from a set of Logitech Z-2300 speakers and the price difference is worth it. I won't go into all the technical details since it's been mentioned many times. The speakers are easy to setup, although it will take a few minutes.Most of all, get a good sound card. Most motherboard onboard cards won't do these speakers justice. I have the  HT Omega Claro 7.1 sound card, but there are others which are just as good. Nonetheless, if you can't afford a new sound card, these speakers will sound better than the speakers you probably have.The control panel is very nice and the remote can't be beat. Wiring was plenty long enough for me. Bass is very controllable, so don't let that scare you away. Lots of output options, each which can alter the sound, so pick the one that best suits you.I'm a fan of almost all music, but mainly pop music. One song which I  have found to found to test this set of speakers is Pancho and Lefty by Merle haggard and Willie Nelson. This song has a good combination of highs, middles and lows. Set your panel to PLII Music, center 6 bars, surround full bars and sit back about 10-15 feet from the speaker. Make yourself listen to the whole song even if you are not a fan of this type music. You'll be amazed.

In comes the second round of throat microphones, and I get another set of  single-pinned throat microphones.What is wrong here?

$REVIEW.: My husband and I are incompatible sleep partners. In the bedroom he cannot sleep unless all the lights are off and there is no t.v. on. I am the opposite, and over the years have had so much guilt over falling asleep on the couch watching t.v.These headphones are miraculous! I got my husband a sleep mask for a few bucks so his eyes are covered and the light coming from the t.v. will not bother him. I can now watch t.v. all night long if I want.These headphones are very high quality and well made. They do not feel or look cheap or flimsy. The sound is excellent and it feels like you are in a movie theater or are listening to your t.v. with an expensive surround sound stereo system.The rechargeable battery has an extremely long life. It has not gone dead on me at all even after sleeping 8-9 hours wearing them. All I do is either mute the volume on my t.v or just lower the t.v. volume down to 0 and he can no longer hear it. It has a very convenient volume + or - knob built onto the headphones so I can control the volume levels. It also has an on/off switch on the head phones so I can shut the unit off to save the internal rechargeable batteries when I am not using them. The headphone's ear cups are so padded no sound even leaks from them. The rechargeable stand is very high tech looking and is the only thing that has plugs or wires.The only negative is that you have to get used to trying to sleep with these big, bulky things on your head and ears, but I have gotten accustomed to it rather quickly and it no longer bothers me.These headphones are so awesome because we can now compromise and there is no more issues about watching cable t.v., dvd's, roku, etc... in the bedroom.

I found the two 2.5&#34; and two 3.5&#34; hard drives that were around, discovered the one that's trash, and now the others are out of boxes and serving as additional external storage. Right now, just using them for Time Machine back ups over USB 2.0. Given that I won't be moving the drives, or even swapping them much, this has turned out to be a better, cheaper alternative to a drive enclosure.The LEDs on front are bright enough to land a plane, especially the blue one.OSX (10.6.8) spins up the drives every time I try to save, so that's been a bit of a slowdown. It's good to know they spin down when not being used.

$REVIEW.: I was provided a Tek Republic TUN-300 USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Fast, reliable transfer speeds.&#9830; Very small and portable design with a built in cable. Great size for travel.&#9830; Perfect solution if have a bad Ethernet port.&#9830; No Driver Disc included which may be a problem if you don't have a working internet connection.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a simple plastic hanging display bag with product information on the package and a spec sheet on the inside. It is very small with a nice, solid build. It has a short built in USB cable that you use to plug into your computer's USB port.  It has two lights to indicate connection and data transfer.  The quality seems great and it is very compact for travel or home use without taking up much space.  There was no driver disc included, just some information saying to download the driver from the Tek Republic web site.  That could be a problem if your OS can't find the driver automatically and you don't have a working internet connection.&#9830; Installation - For me, Windows 7 didn't find the drivers automatically so I had to go to the Tek Republic web site to download them and install them manually through the device manager.  This could be a problem if you don't have a working internet connection and can't get to Windows Update or the Tek Republic web site.  It would have been nice to have a cheap driver disc included in the package just to avoid any issues.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once installed using the drivers from the Tek Republic web site, I did some testing.Test #1 (Speed Test) - My first test consisted of running a speedtest dot net test to get a baseline from my internal Gigabit Ethernet card.  I got results of 84.49Mbps Download and 39.16Mbps Upload.  I then plugged in the adapter into a USB 3.0 port and ran another speedtest dot net test with the network cable plugged into the Tek Republic adapter.  I got results of 84.17Mbps Download and 39.18Mbps Upload.  Basically the exact same speeds.  No material difference at all.  The adapter in a USB 3.0 port and the original Ethernet port on my computer worked exactly the same.  Excellent result.Test #2 (Data Transfer Test) - My next test consisted of logging into an FTP site and downloading a 1GB file.  The file completed in 2 minutes and 10 seconds.  That is an 8MB/s transfer speed (Megabytes, not Megabits).  An excellent result and consistent with what I am used to with my internal Ethernet card.  I transferred another 2GB just for good measure and the downloads completed very quickly with no problems.Conclusion:Overall, this is a great USB to Ethernet adapter. The build is solid and the performance is great. It maintains maximum speed as compared to a built in Ethernet port. In my opinion, it should have come with a Driver Disc because people that need this may not have a working internet connection to be able to download the drivers (from Windows Update or the Tek Republic web site).  It is really only for specialized situations like if your current Ethernet port is not working or you simply don't have one for some reason. If you are looking for a way to add an Ethernet port to a computer using a USB port, you should give this adapter a try. Highly Recommended!

Also the remote  seems to work fine with my COX cable box, but I have not had time to check it out in detail. I tried some custom adjustments from AVS forums and went back to factory settings for now.OLD REVIEW BELOWSears delivered this with black gloves and outstanding service. LOLGot a price match plus 10% off and free delivery. BB refused my 10% coupon.So far the unit is perfect. It has a very strong back lighting which may be the source of some of the complaints with flashlights, clouds, thunderstorms, hail, rain etc.However the strong back lighting is set at the factory and I am still reading up on adjustments. "As is out of the box" the picture is perfect and the remote works with my COX cable box without a hitch.Very nice LCD folks.updtate:Bad news/ loud pop last night and no TV. Sears is bringing me a new one Monday. I wonder how many of these fry the power supply in the first week. Very poor quality control and hopefully not quality by Samsung. Sure glad I bought this at Sears. Made in Oct 2008 and the box was clean and perfect.For the 12 hours it worked it was the best picture I have ever seen. If the second one burns out I will be finished with Samsung and Sharp which leaves Sony.After the Sharp 52-94U through the mail return fiasco, I will never by another large TV over the internet.I will try to update the rating but that usually does not work. ARGH!

$review_text.: I bought this unit to be the hub of my home GbE network.  I had a TRENDnet 5-Port GbE switch on one of the ports.  The two switches did not seem to work together, the 8-Port switch did not seem to see the 5-Port switch.  I had old CAT-5 wiring between them and had not yet upgraded my physical wiring to CAT-6.  I replaced the 8-Port TRENDnet switch with a Netgear GS108 and the two switches seem to work together. They communicated over the old CAT-5 wiring but could not work at 1GbE.  I have since upgraded to CAT-6 wiring and everything works at 1 Gbps.  I have continued to use the TRENDnet 5-Port GbE switch.Not sure why the 8-port TRENDnet hub failed to work with the 5-port TRENDnet switch over the old CAT-5 wiring?  It looked like the 8-port TRENDnet switch didn't see the other switch and may have powered down that port to save energy?  It is also possible the old CAT-5 wiring may have had a problem.In any case the Netgear 8-port GS108 switch worked in the network.  I have other Netgear GbE switches and have been satisfied with them, I tried the TRENDnet switches because they use less power and are lower cost.  The 5-Port TRENDnet switch seems to work fine.
$SUMMARY.: Did not seem to work in my network

$review_text.: I bought this thing thinking that it would be less of a hassle for my playsport zx5 as a dash cam, boy was I wrong. First of all the only thing that works is the record button, all of the other buttons are completely obsolete and it is a complete waste of time and money. Then after the reviews I see that its not compatible with the playtouch either but that is one of the models it is made for! It says what its compatible with, the zx5 wasn't listed but when I did the search for the playsport zx5 on amazon this was the only remote available and said it would work! I am completely disappointed with this purchase and really do not recommend this product at all. Just shows how desperate Kodak is for money, shoveling crap off of their shelves like this.

I get all 4 major networks, and some off the wall local stations that play a lot of old TV series.  My kids love the old shows, and I like the old quality family entertainment.  I also get to still watch NFL football in High Def.  I  live in the Central Valley, Ca. and the closest towers are 65 miles away in Fresno.  I still pick up a strong signal.  I used a compass and a satalite locator website to find the location of a tower that carried the most stations.  With Netflix and Roku box's, I now have a whole bunch of TV entertainment options.  I went from $90 a month to $8 a month for a TV bill.  I used all my old satellite dish cables and mount for the antenna install.  I love sticken to those over priced satalite and cable companies.

 It has a "selectable wattage switch" which sets the trigger load to either 15 watts or 25 watts


 Apparently my media player draws less that 15 watts, so it wouldn't trigger the power to the switched outlets

 I solved this by plugging in an additional adapter into the control outlet to bring up the load, but I wasn't originally expecting to do this.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a more professional camera, but had my budget set low at around $400. I was amazed at how easy it was to learn to use the G1, and how terrific the kit lens is.  I have no need for movies, so this was a better choice over the G2, which was more expensive. At $390 with the Amazon Card shopper discount this was quite a deal from Amazon. It looks like thePanasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameraswould go well with the G1, so that will be my next purchase as I favor low light photography.

$review_text.: I bought this because i needed a remote shutter, and did not want to pay for the actual canon one for a lot more money. I bought this one expecting it to be cheap, and it is... very cheap. When I first used it, it would not focus the camera, but only take a picture. Also, the moment I plugged it in, it would take a picture whether I was pushing the button or not, and not allow me to take another one unless I unplugged it. Essentially, it was not working like it should. So, I took it apart, and saw three metal plates. When I push the button, it bends these plates to touch each other in a certain sequence. I had to adjust these plates so that when I pushed the button, the proper plates touched at the proper times. I think I maybe spent an hour or so getting it right. After all that, the thing works perfectly! I could not be more happy with it now.

$review_text.: I love the fact that this macro extension tube has several different sections, they can be used individually or together. It took me a couple of tries to master getting it secure but once I figure it out worked like a charm. I am new to macro photography but this handy dandy little tool just made life a lot easier at a very small portion of the price a macro lens would have cost me.I have been using macro filters, which were getting me pretty close to my subjects but this got me even closer.  You will however sacrifice your auto focus with this so find yourself manually adjusting your camera. I highly recommend this part just be prepared to play with it a bit to master it.  But as any with any new toy in your camera arsenal that is half the fun. Don't give up just adjust your distance from your subject, try different angles and take lots and lots of shots to master it.  I think I took around 100 shots laying flat on my stomach in our front yard.  But I got some truly amazing shots of ants on our clover flowers, and was in such detail could count the petals as individuals.If you are just starting out in Macro photography this is a great option to a rather expensive macro lens which will set you back a ton. The thing I like best about these are they fit with my other lenses so now instead of carrying a dedicated macro lens all I have to do is attach this to my camera body and attach regular lens and I am ready to do some macro shots where ever I might be.  Two thumbs up for this purchase, its quality for its price pleasantly surprised me.Side note to release you have to press in and down on the metal button to release your lens from the tube.  Just a tip I learned after playing with it for about 20 minutes and make sure is fully engaged before trying to take pictures. Sometimes the tip did not fully engage which made for a loose mount with my lens. But after I used it a time or two got the hang of it.

$REVIEW.: I did some extensive research to figure out which flavour to buy for my Samsung D51P550 plasma that I've had for 6 months but never watched 3d content
 These glasses work excellent -- I decided on these because my basement media room has no windows and hence very dark


 Setup is a snap..
you simply put in the battery and press the power button

 It blinks for 3 seconds and the TV has a prompt that says "3d glasses now connected", at which point if you are wearing the glasses they go from not working to working perfectly

 They seem to auto shut off when my TV stops broadcasting 3d, which is nice

 I am watching all of my 3d content directly through my TV since I have a DLNA compliant NAS in a closet upstairs.And for $17 these are a bargain


 I bought 2 pairs and am so happy with them I am ordering 2 more to have when friends are around.

Not sure if this will degrade faster than the original but righ now I am enjoying the freedom of battery power.  With that being said it easily earns a 5/5 for cheaply replacing my old battery and giving me my freedom back.

$REVIEW.: In doing a recent family wedding, we used the small and med FlashBenders, and they performed well
We didn't use the large one and it remains unopened, because of the weight! The med one was really heavy and would cause my flash to flip down on its own, so I knew the large would be a problem


I will open it and try it, but not in a situation where I can't afford to mess up

I do like the fact that with the flashbenders, I can reach my hand up and quickly 'directionalize' the light if I need to
I mounted the flashbenders 'sideways' onto the flashes as suggested and kept my flash head swiveled perpendicular to the front.(meaning that the center of the flashbender is facing the narrow side of the flash unit, not the wider side...think of the rectangular shape of the flash head, and the flashbender is centered on one of the narrow sides of the rectangle)
By doing this, you can change your picture orientation from landscape to portrait, and the flashbender can perform the same when you angle your flash head upwards
They do direct the light well, and are probably the best diffusers I have used thus far


Basically, they are expensive, well made (so as to be probably pretty indestructable), adjustable, mold-able bounce-cards


I like them.

$review_text.: Last year we purchased a Roku player for my mother-in-law who is deaf to a certain range of tones, so she rely's on subtitles a lot. We thought it would be great for her to finally be able to watch streaming movies on Netflix. Well not to get into specifics but the last version of the Roku player was a bit deceptive on it's ability to play subtitles.Thankfully it seems like this version has ironed out the subtitles issue with Netflix and they now work without to much of a problem. Keep in mind not ALL Netflix material has subtitles yet, but they claim by the end of 2011 it will be 90-100% of shows. You can also go to [...] to see all available shows and movies.The player itself is very easy to setup, it comes with RCA cables (red, yellow, white) but supports HDMI (not included) and is a simple install. The XD version supports 1080 while the cheaper one only handles 720, so if you have a HDTV spend the extra $10 and get the XD player. Also during setup Roku try's to get you to enter credit card information, please know you can skip this step and it's not required. You will need to know your Wi-Fi routers name and login however, so may want to have that ready in advance for a quicker setup.Good product for the money and still the cheapest way to stream Netflix to a TV with subtitles. The next two closest alternatives are the Nintendo Wii and the Logitech Revu.

It required spacers for the Fusion, which happen to be black and are friction fit which makes for extremely easy to lose spacers. Luckily I had some spare washers at home to replace them. On top of all of that, this installation kit doesn't even sit centered in the opening for radio. I'll be avoiding Metra products after this debacle.
$SUMMARY.: Don't buy this for Ford Fusions/Mercury Milans

$REVIEW.: These new ultra light laptops are so thin that they do not have an Ethernet connection so I purchased this item for that reason. The price was very good and it works great for what it was purchased for. I saw some for USB 3.0 didn't see the need for it because that speed does not apply to Ethernet ports. So save your money 2.0 is just fine. Save your USB 3 port for more important things. I would buy from this seller again. Item arrived on time and was package nicely!!

$review_text.: I own RC cars, planes, and heli's.  The closest I have flown to the Phantom is the AR DRone which I thought was incredible until it became unpredictable, was horrible in wind, and struggled to fly properly carrying a Go Pro.First let me say that it is best to go through and watch all of the videos on the manufactures website after you place the order and then watch it while you are putting together your Phantom.  It requires very little assembly but what you are connecting to it is important.  Also, watch the calibration video.  If you are flying in the same area, you really only need to calibrate it once.FIRST TIME RC FLYERS: This is not a toy, although it will put a smile on your face like a kid on Christmas morning.  It is a hobby grade flight vehicle that, once you understand how to fly it, is incredibly easy to control and has great reliability.  That being said, if you have never flown any RC products, take it slow.  It is not difficult but if you try to go for height or distance on your first flights without getting a feel for it, you will risk a potential pricey error.FLYERS WITH A LITTLE OR MORE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE: This will be easier to fly than anything you have flown in the past.  Buy it.My first flight was on a open golf course with a fair amount of wind.  A flag on a flag pole in the distance was standing straight out in the wind so I knew I did not want to take the Phantom too far off of the ground.  I cautiously elevated it and moved it around to get a feel for the controls.  Once was comfortable, I took it higher and higher.  I had my Go Pro on it so watching back the video, I ended up taking this thing high enough in the air to see the entire neighborhood.  When I brought it straight down, it came down to the same spot I began elevating it.  Now understand this is in GPS mode so the vehicle, after calibration, knew where it was and fought the wind to stay above the same location it took off from.  The video was not so bad for the fact it was balancing against the wind.  Better than any video I got from AR Drone and this was in substantial wind.Video quality.  There was limited &#34;Jello&#34; in the video but this was as the sun was setting and not in heavy sunlight where the video shake (or jello) is more noticeable.  There are plenty of You Tube help videos to get you fine tuned on getting the best Video.Over all, I was skeptical that this, for what I consider to be a big price tag, would deliver the results I would expect for the investment.  So far, it has.  I have experience with other flight vehicles (not necessarily required to learn this) and this is the easiest to master and most reliable flight vehicle I have flown.  If you are on the fence, pull the trigger.
$review_summary.: Different than any other flying machine. I was skeptical at first....not any more (honest review)

$review_text.: I originally purchased the Logitech Z515. The Z515 could not handle sound too well especially with higher volume setting. Virtually no bass with the Z515. Decided to get the Creative D100 instead. The D100 sounded a lot better than the Z515 but I kept on having disconnection issues. I did not have this issue with the Z515. I have read numerous positive reviews about the Sony BT100. I decided to purchase the BT100 in order to replace the D100. I have been amazed by the sound quality. It is significantly better than both the Z515 and D100. It puts out clear sound with good amount of bass. It pretty much has been able to handle anything I have thrown at it with no problem. The sound fills the room similar to some Bose units. It is a much larger speaker than both other speakers. I was able to connect in a few seconds to my Droid X and also my laptop. It has not had any connection issues at all. This speaker is not made to be a portable speaker like the Z515 and D100. There is no battery option like the D100 or rechargeable battery like the Z515. This speaker is more of a shelf speaker since it is larger in size and has no portability features. If you are looking for a portable bluetooth speaker, I suggest the D100. If you do not need a portable speaker but want excellent sound with bluetooth connection, this is probably one of the best sounding bluetooth speakers on the market.

$review_text.: My son was visiting us from out of town and I noticed he plugged a spare cell phone battery into this thing.  We have the same cell phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus) and he sold me on the idea of keeping a spare battery and using this device to keep it charged.  I ordered the spare battery and battery charger.  They arrived after he went back home.  I was surprised to find the charger had no instructions.  Too proud to call my son and ask him how it worked, I messed with it until I figured it out.You have to position your battery and the two sliding pins at the top so that one pin is touching the metal strip on the battery marked positive and the other pin is touching the negative (apparently the pins are interchangeable).  I actually have four metal strips at the top of my battery and wasn't really clear which strips the positive and negative signs were referring to, but I eventually figured it out.  Once I got pass that, the charger worked great.  Now it's a breeze to insert and remove the battery.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because there were no instructions. Either Anker thinks its charger is more intuitive to use than it really is or I'm a lot denser than I think I am.

$REVIEW.: I bought this photo frame mainly for the price. It is the same price I paid for a 10" Insignia DPF I bought on sale.The 15" size is great, exactly what I would like for my wall.The brightness and colors are poor. I could never make it come anywhere near the quality of my other two 10" photo frames.Even then, I would have kept it because of the wonderful size, but the viewing angle is the worst I have ever seen in an LCD screen. If you looked directly at the frame or slightly to the side, it was reasonable. If you were above, below or to the side it looked horrible. A large frame like this should be given a prominent spot, but if you give it one, it looks ugly any time it is looked at from any angle other than straight in front of it. I had hoped to replace a 10" photo frame in my living room, but instead I am returning this one and I appreciate my 10" one a little more.The remote works great.Only buy this if you expect to put it in a place with a very limited viewing angle. Then it would be reasonable. Otherwise, there are many good quality smaller frames that will look much better.

$REVIEW.: I'm a professional commercial photographer and I bought the Drobo to store all of my photo files and this product along with it's software has caused me many system-wide problems . It sometimes doesn't mount, sometimes won't dismount. The software almost always hangs causing me to do a hard reboot; the LAST thing I want to have to do on my work computer in the middle of a shoot. Plus it seems to cause problems with my other software ! ( which goes away when I have this thing disconnected).  It's bad enough to have problems with just the unit but for it to also cause problems with other programs I have running is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE !I bought it to make me feel more secure in that my images are safely stored but the absolute opposite is the case . I have used it for a few months hoping the bugs would go away with updates but they haven't. I'll be going with something else in the near future, probably Wiebetech as recommended by my photo store . POS!

$REVIEW.: This camcorder sounded intriguing and fun, but it turned out to be a big waste of money. The included accessories are extremely cheap, cheap to the point of not being functional. The plastic clip broke on first try to load the cam into it. The camcorder itself gives decent image resolution, but you never know when it is on since the led's don't work. Half the time when it is supposed to record, it doesn't when the button is pushed. The sound detection is also a hit and miss kind of thing. The cam did arrive in the mail quickly, but I do have to say I feel somewhat cheated since the item doesn't live up to it's advertising. Save your money, don't buy this cam, you too will be disatisfied.

$REVIEW.: I've had this PJ for about 3 weeks
 Mounted 15'-4" away from a 110" 1.0 gain screen
 I have very dark walls, and a white ceiling
 Read up on the reviews online and at avsforum
 The unit has about 900 calibrated lumens (that's a lot)

 For a 110" screen, that's about 25 foot-lamberts


 It's a bright PJ in 2D mode


 My first PJ had only 600 calibrated lumens, and once the bulb aged the image was way too dim


 So I'd rather have extra lumens to start with.In 3D mode, the PJ uses the Dynamic 3D setting by default
 Colors are not exact in Dynamic 3D, but pretty close


 I also tried the Cinema 3D mode..

colors are more accurate, but the image is not as bright as Dynamic 3D

 Did not notice any ghosting with the supplied Epson 3D glasses
 Note:  Sony makes 3D glasses for the PS3..


cost about $49


 They work with this PJ since they adhere to the 3D standard for glasses


 Epson glasses cost about $100 each


 Calibrated lumens is approx 400

 For my screen, that's 12 foot-lamberts


 3D spec states 4.5 foot-lamberts at the minimum
 So when the bulb ages, even by 50%, the image still may be bright enough.The PJ accepts 24p native signals (for DVD and Blu Ray) and will display the signals as 24p

 There is a setting in the PJ that doubles (called 2-2 pull-down) the 24p so that the PJ displays signals at 48p

 It is supposed to smooth out 24p sources by removing the judder.Fan in eco mode is quiet
 In 3D mode, using Dynamic 3D, the fan goes into high speed
 I can hear the fan on high speed during very quiet scenes


 But not during normal movie scenes

 Besides, if the 3D movie does not suck, you probably won't notice the fan.Overall, it's an excellent PJ.

$REVIEW.: Its a typical nice Logitech mouse.  Everything works nicely.  The click wheel turns too easily for me, but it doesn't take long to get used to.  Pushing the click wheel to the left or right is back or forward when you are using a web browser.  It's ok, but I usually forget I have that option.  What I really like about this mouse is the USB receiver is so small.  It sticks out of my computer about 1/4", so it's small enough I can leave it plugged in even when I put my laptop in my bag.  If you open the battery compartment on the mouse there is a little place to store the receiver.  It works well on all surfaces.  I have yet to find a surface where the mouse won't work perfectly.

$review_text.: I've been searching a long time for decent headphones to replace the stock ones that came with my ipod Nano 2G.  These are it.  They fit comfortably and form a tight seal to stay seated in my ears and block out almost all external noise.  The cord is the Y-type variety (equal lengths rather than 1 short wire & 1 long wire), and even has the small adjustable guide to prevent the wires from tangling.  The plug is narrow like the Apple earbuds so they fit just about flush on my Nano.The sound is blissful, with tight bass and clear highs.  I bought a pair of Shure E2c's at the same time as these, and the Shures are going back.  These have more bass and volume, and are so much easier to put on than the Shures (which require that you wrap the wires above and over your ears).  To be fair, I listen mostly to electronica/dance/trance, so maybe the Shures would fare better on more detailed music.Bottom line: I am in love with these headphones, and think they are a steal for the money.  Don't bother with the Sonys, JBuds, I've tried them all and there's no comparison.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect replacement for my ipod earbuds

$review_text.: I bought this to keep my new Canon PowerShot SX260HS safe.  My camera fits inside perfectly.  It's a bit bulkier than some of the other cases that were advertised to also fit this camera, but I bought it because it had the side pouch which I store my extra battery in, so I don't mind the bulk.

$review_text.: I have been using the same 17 inch CRT that came with a computer that died over 4 years ago, it had a 1280 x 1024 resolution and flickered quite a bit. finally i decided to upgrade to this to go with my new mac pro, let me just say that i am more than satisfied.This thing is humongous, you don't really realize how big it is until you get it set up! the extra screen real-estate is incredible, i can have two normal size browser windows open side by side, or one absolutely enormous browser window.this is also very thin, i save so much desktop space with this monitor, finally my small desk is no long cluttered due to a enormous monitor that took up half the desk. also, the stand is kinda flimsy and non-adjustable, but is can be removed and replaced with a mount, but the one that comes with it will suffice until that day comes.I played lots of world of warcraft on my crt, it doesn't look as crisp on this monitor, but not only am i willing to trade image sharpness for the sheer size of this thing, but one must also realize that a crt will always look sharper and crisper than a LCD.much like other reviewers state, the backlight does bleed through on the top and bottom of the screen but i hardly ever notice it. I also have not noticed any ghosting on this monitor since i got it. the colors are also very bright and vibrant.i was skeptical about this upgrade at first, mainly considering that i could have squeezed another couple months out of my old crt, but let me tell you, if you are thinking about upgrading to this monitor...DO IT, for the price you will not be disappointed!!!

$REVIEW.: I've had this more than a month now. I use it all the time, so my review is based on fairly extensive, everyday use.Overall, I love it! I would definitely feel deprived without it. And I definitely recommend it! But it does have areas for mostly easy improvement.Good:(1) Even though a little heavy (3.2 lbs) it's nothing compared to my laptops. I carry it around easily in one hand.I put it in my pack and take it to work with me everyday so I can study Spanish with it at some lunch place and on my commute. No, I don't drive to work.(2) The huge battery life is terrific. Turning off bluetooth, the webcam, and the wireless when I'm commuting saves further.I can take it around to different rooms in the house (including my favorite reading spot--guess where) without having to worry about its running out of battery. I often just plug it in at night to recharge.(3) The built-in webcam is more than adequate at 1.3mp.(4) The keyboard (except for the right-shift key) is fine, and I type fast.Here are the downsides as I see it. But remember, I really like it! But everything can use improvement. Even me. (Probably.)Areas for improvement:(1) the processor is underpowered. Yes, no one offers a better one now, but you should know. It's decent, but if you have a modern desktop or laptop you'll notice it.Note: you can overclock the processor (the eee pc control panel provides performance options). This improves performance but cuts into the battery life. Not an issue for me.(2) You need to upgrade to 2GB memory. Ran much faster when I did.(3) It weighs in a little heavy at 3.2 lbs. I was really hoping for no more than 2.75 lbs.(4) The right shift key is way too small. This can impede my ability to type fast, a frustration. Why they didn't cut down the generally useless CapsLock instead I'll never understand.(5) The screen is challenged vertically. It's annoying to have to continually scroll down.What's really needed is the ability to rotate the screen (the actual screen) to a vertical position. Yeah, yeah, mucho more dollars and a point of physical failure... (I'm not holding my breath on this.)(6) The right/left clickers surrounding the touch pad are too stiff.(7) The touch pad is too sensitive. For me, anyway. I need to look for how to adjust the sensitivity. I turned off the magnification right away.With respect to (5), (6), and (7) when scrolling up/down, say a newspaper article, I have found that using the arrow up/down keys makes things easier.(8) The speaker is really tinny. Come on, $5 more and there could have been some real improvement.(9) There's some issue with the wireless N. Others describe it here. The BIOS upgrade didn't fix it.Please understand that I really like the 1000HE, use it everyday, take it to work with me, and that these are mostly MINOR annoyances. I just want to give an overall assessment.You can't have everything. When the next generation or two comes out (read: better processor, less weight, adequately sized/priced solid state drive) I'll probably upgrade and give this to one of my sons. I'm GLAD I DIDN'T wait!!Meanwhile, I use it everyday. And we have four other computers in the house, including two laptops.I definitely recommend the 1000HE.
$SUMMARY.: Love it, use it all the time, there's room for improvement

$REVIEW.: I read all the reviews and complaints and still ordered the camera and I am not disappointed
Once you have the right card that does not slip into the hole, the right size:B00768ZS4WThe camera asked to format it which you have to so it can install its own player on the drive, and you are ready to go

Yes, the instructions were pretty much a waste of paper but as others have stated, the camera operations are pretty self explanatory
Yes that camera does go black after a minute or less but as long as the red light continues to blink, it is still recording

And the player loads right up with all the video., the camera has taken when you place the microCard into a computer


The player is easy to navigate through and understand


The google map makes it fun to follow your trip also


The mic is great but if you play music with a lot of bass, loud, the sound recorded is highly distorted


A few little problems with the instruction booklet has lowered the camera to 4 stars but the camera operates as advertised and works great for the price.

The backup is fast, and quiet.Hard drives works off the USB power, and hence no big power supplies or cords to carry. The USB cable is supplied.My macbook does not have USB 3.0 so anyways I don't care about it, else you might want to consider USB 3.0 adapter. They also have alternatively a thunder bold adapter. Frankly speaking I would save the few bucks if you are going to just use as casual time machine backup for home machine.I am thinking to also store some of my photos in this one, as the time machine seems to be an incremental backup and is not hogging up a lot of space.I am very much into aesthetics, and yes, this one looks good, whitish aluminium, light weight, quiet, and small in size.

$REVIEW.: I bought this case because I still wanted the smart cover from apple but didn't want a unified body of the cover and backing.  The case arrived in great condition, no scratches or anything and it clicked into the ipad 3rd generation just fine. It was def made for the ipad 2 but it still fits just fine and holds on very well.  Its a good plastic so that when I put the ipad on a table it just slides smoothly on the surface without that "hesitation" that is sometimes in cheaper plastics and doesn't make rough sounding noises.  I like it and I've recommended it to other people as well... and you can't beat the price especially when compared to the equivalent Speck product (which I also have on the other ipad).

$review_text.: I decided to upgrade my current Westinghouse LCD monitor to a new 1080p resolution LCD

 After checking on Amazon, I saw that Viewsonic had a really good deal on a 22" 1080P LCD

 Having used Viewsonic monitors at work, I was more than willing to give it a try
 The new monitor arrived at my house and here are my impressions:Pros:1

Good picture

 The screen has a non-glossy finish
 While this makes the image a little less sharp, it's easier to keep clean and has less glare.2

Great price
 $150 for a 1080p monitor is ridiculously cheap

 The price seems to vary a lot, so check around before purchasing.3


Attractive bezel and stand
 Looks really nice and "high-tech" on my computer desk

The blue/amber power button is particularly cool.4
The monitor includes VGA D-sub and DVI-D inputs
 It also has an audio input.Cons:1

No HDMI input
 Even though DVI-D is basically HDMI, it would have been nice to have an actual HDMI input


 The HDMI cables are just so much more manageable than the DVI cables.2

Audio on the built in speakers is pretty tinny


 This is to be expected for an LCD monitor of this size and price

 You just can't pack a subwoofer on this.So, why did I give this monitor only 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 as my review would indicate?  Well, after I got the monitor setup and played a game on it, I was pretty pleased with it


 But, then I loaded Firefox to check a website
 The background was mostly white and I saw that there was a weird blemish in the upper center of the screen
 It looked like the monitor had a hair on it or was scratched
 When I looked closely, I saw that the problem was actually in the LCD panel, behind the LCD arrays and in front of the light generating part
 No way for me to remove it myself

 So, I had to exchange it

 Amazon is great and sent out the replacement monitor immediately and also issued a return UPS label so that I wasn't out any of my money for the exchange


 But, the fact that this rather obvious flaw in this monitor got past Viewsonic quality control gives me some doubt about their current quality

 The replacement monitor was perfect and I am quite happy with it

 If not for the issue with the first monitor, this would have been a 5-star review
 And, Amazon's handling of the return definitely rates 5-stars.

$REVIEW.: Despite what has been written about this item I found it to be a great buy.  The bass is very good for a home office/bedroom setting.  If you are expecting a system good enough to play movie-theather like THX soundtracks on then you may be disappointed but it has been good enough for me.  I use it to play games and watch an occasional movie and i have no complaints.The one and only drawback for this item is that the volume control for the subwoofer is on the back of the subwoofer so you may find yourself crawline on the floor a few times to get it right.  Also, you may find that the wires are a bit short but a trip to radio shack can cure that.My experience has been with a new Dell with a Creative Labs 5.1 sound card.

$review_text.: I was going to buy an iMac for twice the cost of this MacMini


I'm so glad I purchased the MacMini

I wanted something nice and glitzy to go with this computer, so I gifted myself with a 25" ViewSonic display monitor (see my review), although I could have used a 19-inch monitor I already own
Unlike my Dell computer (for example), this Apple MacMini is really quiet, takes little space, looks good, and delivers everything you expect from a powerful computer

I bought a used MacMini a couple of years ago, and it's still going strong, so I have personally validated its reputation for quality and durability.Before purchasing, I called Apple to ensure that even though I purchased it through Amazon (no price savings to speak of), I would still receive all of the limited warranties and customer service that Apple offers with each purchase


Apple assured me I would


In fact, I recently called Apple for technical assistance with an iTunes problem, and received help at no cost under Apple's 90 day free technical assistance policy

It's good to know that my purchase was protected by both Amazon and Apple policies.Setting up the new Apple MacMini was very easy
I bought the MacMini to replace an old iMac, which Apple's Time Machine program backed up every day into an Omega Prestige 2TB external hard drive (see my review of this hard drive)


All I did was to plug the Omega Prestige external hard drive into a USB port on the new MacMini, follow some simple instructions that came with the MacMini, and all of my files, settings, and configurations were transferred to the new MacMini

It took about 2 or 3 hours to complete the transfer process (I had over 100,000 files of all sizes and types).

$review_text.: It's great to have a charger that displays status in two independent channels. The 3 output options are nice too for faster charging on larger capacity batteries. Have not used the repair mode for over discharged batteries but the fact that it even offers it makes it better than any other charger I've seen. A vast upgrade from the ones that come with most APV kits.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased the yamaha htr 6090 to go with my samsung 61 HDTV 1080p, samsung blu-ray player, klipsch quintets and klipsch subwoofer. This combo of products are simply awesome.  I was able to easily hook up my hdmi cables from my samsung player and cable box into the receiver.  And from the receiver hdmi to my tv's hdmi.  I went from lots of cables to just three, the two inputs and one output.  What a difference in sound and video.  If you can afford this player, get it.  The surround sound is a noticable difference from the old 5.1.  Please do not waste your time if you are not prepared to buy the latest in technology.

$review_text.: I have had this bag for over 6 months and no sign of breaking. I guess with the few mix reviews I have been lucky so far. I will say I am a bit weary if I leave the zipper open a little at the top. Easy fix is zip the bag to one side all the way to the bottom and it feels extra secure. I feel the bag provides adequate protection from the sides, the front has very limited protection other than the firm padding dividers inside. I feel it protects my mid-grade camera equipment pretty well, but I may purchase a new bag to protect my equipment more once I upgrade a few more pieces. Great price for the bag.

$review_text.: This is a pretty lousy product that I will be sending back.  I had it sitting INCHES away from my router during the auto configuration and it was showing 50% signal strength.  It took five tries for the auto configuration software to work.  Once I moved it downstairs and plugged into my receiver it lost signal connection.  My cell phone, which was sitting right next to the Netgear box was showing full strength wifi.  The installation instructions are OK if you are technically competent but definitely not for novices (the installation page does NOT launch on Win7, you have to find the IP address with ipconfig then point your browser to that address manually).  I will give it a day to make sure I am not missing something, but this is very likely going back to Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I decided to get the carbon after seeing the price here on amazon.com, only $169


The price is what sold me
I was originally going to get the 6gig Ipod mini, but for 100 dollars less and only one less gig, i found this deal unresistable
I got my rio a few days ago in the mail, already filled it up with about 3.5 gigs of music from my cds, and so far so good
However, there are a few things i wish rio could have done to make it better
The case just sucks, you can't access the controls while the rio is in the case, you have to take it out, which can be a pain in the ass cause the case is such a tight fit

Also there is no hold button on the outside, which, if you put the rio in your pocket without the case turns out to be a pain
Additional worries about the Rio are that it just isnt reliable


Although i have had no problems, the stuff i have read in the reviews here is kind of scary,so i am trying to be extra careful with mine


Other that that the rio has turned out to be awesome, good music quality, everything one could want from a digital music player, but who knows if my opinon will change after a few more months of using it.

$review_text.: I just purchased this Toshiba 42 inch 1080p television and have been blown away by the picture quality both in HD and SD. Set-up was about 15 minutes from the box to turn-on. The stand was easy to install and the set-up on the TV was a snap.I have it hooked up to my hi-def cable box and I am quite impressed by the clarity and sharpness of the picture. The HD is outstanding and the SD channels looke great! I am watching a standard definition DVD of a Boz Scaggs concert, which looks hi-def, and it is hooked up to the component video connection. There are plenty of audio and video inputs to satisfy anyone. I am not surprised by the beauty of this television, as I already own another Toshiba 42 inch HD TV with 1080p resolution, and I have always been happy with that set. My next purchase will be a hi-def DVD player to complete the HD experience. And by the way, the sound from the TV is actually quite good, so I can take my time to find a compact speaker system to connect this to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great 1080p hi-def TV. Hope you enjoy it as much as I am.

The performance has been snappy enough for my needs and I can copy things into and off of it very easily. Since ASUS tablets are known to slow down if their main storage gets too full, this is really useful for giving me a place to offload things to, like apps that I don't want to download again but want to keep on hand, media files, my ebook collection, more music, etc.

$REVIEW.: I'd heard problems about various, earlier editions of Ipod radio transmitters (not just Griffin) and decided to wait til the product improved.  This system works very well in my car.  I spend most of my time away from NYC and rarely have a problem finding a channel to get good, reasonable quality sound.  All these products will have variable success in large cities, I would imagine, but I hooked it up, found a channel and got what I was looking for.  Just remember to switch the device from "DX" (mono) to "LX" (stereo)--which frankly is not as easy it sounds and go to the website if you get confused.  When I turned mine on and had mono sound, my heart sank.  But it's fine on LX/Stereo.I bought the Griffin because of the reviews on this site.  I have found customer reviews on Amazon to be reasonably accurate and helpful and I think you can rely on what you read about this product.

$REVIEW.: This was an excellent monitor, that I used daily for over a year.  Great picture, great look, and overall good quality.UNTIL...You may have heard in other reviews about the "flickering gray screen of death".  That is exactly what happened to mine, unexpectedly last week.  The monitor never moved from my desk, never fell, etc., it just happened randomly while using the computer.  If I hit the monitor on the back panel with my hand, it would go away, and reappear in another hour.  Then it became more frequent, and a week later, I could not get the screen to work properly, no matter what I tried.Overall, I cannot and will not recommend this monitor to anyone.  Do not buy this monitor.

My first impressions are outstanding!  From all appearances, this looks like a reliable, light weight, sturdy tripod to take photos in any setting.  I have owned several different tripods over the years and this is by far the best I've found in this price range.  If the size and features suit your needs, you should give this one a go.  Mine even came with a bonus table top tripod, and each tripod came with its own carrying case.  Very nice.  If you are having doubts, just buy one, you'll be glad you did.

I have a few running and have had no issues. They are not super easy to configure. What I do is Google the basic SOHO config for the router and that gets me up and running pretty quick. The port forwarding is a little confusing with the lingo and it takes a few tries to get it working. But it does work well. I have had one up and running for over and year and no issues.

$review_text.: This bluray player has great bluray picture quality, but one of the most glaring problems with this player has to do with netflix streaming


Every few minutes, a series of black screen flash during your movie


It happens despite a good wifi signal and ruins the moviegoing experience
Its too bad Panasonic didn't test this player enough to detect this problem.As a result, I returned the player to Amazon

Apparently, Panasonic's new BDT220 player has this netflix problem resolved so I'm considering getting that model
But since its still new, I'm going to wait a while to make sure its really fixed.The other thing that I hated about the 210 was the terribly slow and ugly viera cast interface


Apparently they still haven't fixed this with the 220 model.Anyhows, if you decide to get this player, be aware of the black flashing problem with netflix.

$review_text.: The TPU case fits an Apple iPod 4th generation snugly and provides adequate protection for daily use. However, there are two issues with it which is probably why the price is so low.1) The edge of the case does not wrap over the screen enough so if you have applied a screen protector it can push the edge of the screen protector and lift it introducing bubbles. This is a flaw of this case as I had another seemingly similar TPU case from a local store for my other son's 4th gen iPod and it does not have this issue.2) The volume up/down buttons which are TPU molds over the actual iPod are very hard to press.Buy another case if these issues could be important for you. I will be replacing this one soon due to issue #1

$review_text.: Well, what can I say? It works correctly right now. Has as many features as you need and more. Bought for the super cheap price of $345. Right now hooked up to Sony SF-7000s and a BIC LCR speaker for the center channel with a Yamaha HTiaB subwoofer. Powers them well, can't tell the difference between a Yamaha 371 and this besides it seems louder at quieter volumes. The OSD is nice, but slower than the display on the receiver itself. I had to perform the update that came out on October 10th and ends in 300. Mine was shipped to me with a firmware ending in 200. The update took about half an hour off a USB, THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS UPDATE! You MUST do it this way. But like I said, works well so far. Nob lights up white around it, with no apparent way to shut it off, somewhat annoying to me. Can't comment on the networking features or remote app because I haven't used them yet. But cheap, powerful, and feature filled. Very happy.Edit: I found a way to shut off the white glow light around the volume nob, there's a "Dimmer" button on the remote and receiver itself that shuts it off. Easy to do, should have spotted it earlier.

$REVIEW.: There is a lot to be impressed about with Harmony remotes, but one of the most appreciated is the easy set up
 Open the beautifully packaged remote, follow the simple picture instructions showing where to plug the Harmony Hub, IR mini blaster, and AC adapter, and you're ready to get started


Remember the not-so-old days when it took hours or even days to figure out how to run fussy macros and instructions to automate commands on your remote?  And how sometimes one measly little thing that you did wrong would screw up everything else and then you'd have to start over?  Those days are gone


These new Harmony remotes are truly easy to set up

 Really.It took a little longer to set this remote up than some of the other "point and discover" remotes from the past, only because it required brand names and model numbers of all the components in our home entertainment system
That meant pulling them out from the shelves and turning them around enough to see the model numbers without accidentally disconnecting anything
That was the only "hard" part

I wrote down all the names numbers on the little check sheet they sent along


Then I logged onto to their website, myharmony.com and set up an account, and followed the set-up instructions which were basically to enter the names and model numbers and tell which components were connected to each other

Then I downloaded the Harmony app to my iPhone at the Apple App Store and it automatically set everything up and I was ready to go

The nice thing was that I didn't have to do anything, just sat there and watched.Once set up, I see all the "activities" or things we do with our system

If I click on "Watch TV" it will turn the TV and the DVR and switch to the proper HDMI setting for the DVR


If, after a while, I decide to watch a movie, I just click on "Watch a Movie" on the remote and it will turn on the receiver and the Blue Ray player and set them to the movie settings, turn off the DVR and change the HDMI on the TV to the correct input for watching movies
Even with other remotes I always had to use at least two remotes to do all of this, sometimes more


The menu on the screen of your smartphone or tablet is then changed to the settings to control the Blue Ray player and the receiver for things like starting the movie, skipping ahead, adjusting the volume, etc
We still have to insert the movie disc but the iPhone or remote will open and close the slot

When we're done watching the movie, simply clicking on "Watch TV" will turn off the Blue Ray player, turn off the receiver, turn on the DVR and change the HDMI setting on the TV for the DVR


When I want to listen to music, I just tap the "Listen to Music" button and it turns off the TV and turns on the settings on the receiver and those from whatever input device I'm using, in my case and iTouch that is connected to the receiver.If other family members or friends who you would never let touch your smartphone or tablet want to control your entertainment, there is also a Harmony remote that runs on a battery (included) that has buttons for all the commands that you need to do any of the same functions


 Without and LED touchscreen on the remote the battery should last a really long time

In a way the Harmony remote is better when you're just sitting around watching TV because you don't have to look down at the screen to change things once you've memorized where all the buttons are

With the phone or tablet it's a little easier to touch the wrong command on the screen if you're not looking
It's also nice when your phone or tablet is busy recharging.If you want to set up some customized commands and change the way your menus and buttons work, you can go to the Harmony site and download and install their web browser plug-in which let you set things up your way
They made this simple to use as well


 I love being able to swipe and tap to change channels, swipe to adjust volume, and my favorite - swipe to fast-forward or rewind


(Great for skipping commercials.)Logitech finally made remotes truly easy to set up and use


 I'm impressed!

For example, when I do GPS in the truck, I'd lay the phone on the speedometer area (plastic glass). I can no longer do that with this case... it'll fall to the floorboard.The primary reason I like this case is that the phone looks cool.I would say the color is the same as Mazda's &#34;laser red&#34; or you could say &#34;candy apple red&#34;.The only con I would mention is that it tries to collect dirt along the boundary edge and sometimes pulls my hair out.

$REVIEW.: I have had the Toshiba Thrive for about 2 weeks now and it has been great!!! I tried to put some mp4 movies on it from my laptop but they wouldn't run. I found a program called Foxreal that converts movies to a different format.I purchased the program (about $30) and converted the movies I wanted to put on my thrive. Now my movies run great and it was much cheaper than trying to replace all of my movies for the tablet. I really like having the expansion ports. They work great to move data to and from my thrive. Ports are for transfer only. I like the way I can hook my thrive up to my labtop with the USB cable and move data back and forth using windows explorer. The thrive connects just like it is another drive. Still learning how to use the google system but it is working well. As soon as you connect to the thrive (after charging) it will take you through several steps. Be sure to upgrade it really helps to have the latest updates. I looked at just about every tablet I could lay my hands on and finally pulled the trigger on the thrive when I saw the price drop, and I am so happy I did. I don't see how you can go wrong unless you feel the little bit of extra weight is a problem. Personally I think the thickness and little bit of extra weight make it feel rugged, especially with the rubber backing, perfect for me.

$REVIEW.: If you want the best tiny speaker, this is it.  I'm talking about a speaker that will fit in your pocket if you have baggy pants.  I have A Bunch of portable speakers.  This has the best sound quality.  Of course, it matters where you place it to get the most out of its bass.  My son likes this one the best.  Now, if you want the most bass and loudness, BY FAR, go with the mm28.  It blows all other small portable speakers away, but it's double the size of this one and is heavy in the mid-bass area.  If you put it on something hard and run it at a higher volume, it shakes and rattles on the surface.  How many portable speakers have that problem?  If your traveling with a laptop, then the Saitek might be better.  If you plan on bringing music to the park, then the mm28 has 4 times the volume and 10 times the bass.  Buy dot com had these for $12 delivered and the mm28 for about $16 delivered.  Just to give you an idea of the mark-up on these.  Still, if you only want the best, I believe each of these are the best depending on what you are looking for.  The Saitek has about two times the mass of your standard mouse - and the same shape.  mm28 = tad bigger than 11x4x1.

$review_text.: The Netgear Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender was used in our home, which is about 1,800 sq ft.  Our computer and router is next to the southwest wall of the home.  I plugged in the Extender into, just about, the farthest (socket) point from the router--west/north/west wall.  Setting up was very easy.  I read the instructions very carefully and followed them to the letter.  Which only took a few seconds.  Within just a few minutes of clicking both the Extender button and the router's Push n Connect button, I turned on my iPad 2 and saw an immediate boost of our Wi-Fi.  Streaming video was much smoother and other downloads from you tube and iTunes were faster.  It was easy as pie and worked pretty much automatically.  I turned off the Extender & Router for the evening, then turned everything back on the next morning and both Router & Extender found each other without my having to push any buttons at all.  I recommend this product to anyone who needs to extend his/her wi-fi connection.  I've had this product for about one week, as of this writing.  All things still work as described.  So far, so good.

$review_text.: It's a little big (I'm a big guy), but not bad looking on the wrist. This is not a dress watch.A bit pricey, but the overall quality is first rate. It takes no more than a minute to assemble (there is a Youtube Video if you need a little help).The watchband is totally unwearable. It's like wearing a fur bracelet. Very hot and sweaty (I'm not a sweaty guy). The watchband will not easily move around the wrist (bring the face from front to back for example). Once on the wrist, it just sticks there.One major concern I have is wearing this watch around water (washing hands). The data port and headphone jack are both exposed. For safety, I would not wash my hands wearing this watch.

$review_text.: The SRS-BTX300 is not very big, but it is surprisingly heavy (5 lbs). When you slide the latch at the top right of the unit, the edge flips open as shown on the picture and reveals the main controls, and also serves as a stand. It's a fairly useful feature that prevents accidentally switching it on during transport, but the speaker is unable to stand upright unless the stand is unfolded, which is a somewhat strange design choice.The power supply is world-capable (100-240V) but it's big and features a non-standard connector; don't lose it or the speaker becomes useless. The speaker comes with a form-fitted neoprene sleeve; a nice intention, although a semi-rigid case with a spot for the power adapter would have been better.The controls are simple; power, bluetooth (source selection/pairing), line in, audio mode. The top features volume control, kickstand latch and the bluetooth phone action.On the back, you can find the line in jack, a recessed reset button, a USB connector (to power a phone, MP3 player, etc...), the power connector and a bluetooth standby switch which allows you to leave bluetooth running even when the speaker is turned off (this lets a phone turn the speaker on via bluetooth at the expense of a slight battery drain).Sound quality is good, even excellent for a speaker of this size, but do not expect earth-shattering bass. Presence is good and distortion low even at very loud levels. These speakers can definitely fill up a room. The speakerphone feature is spectacular; it actually performs better than dedicated conference phones that cost twice as much.For music, the apt-X capability really shone when using it with the S3 which supports the feature.I use the SRS-BTX300 with an iPad, iPhone 4, Galaxy S3 and Nexus 7. Switching between the four is completely painless; I only had to pair each device once. As far as I'm concerned the NFC pairing featured is a complete dud; it never worked with my S3 or the Nexus 7. At any rate, pairing manually the old way is easy enough, but this much-ballyhooed NFC is not ready for prime time in my opinion.It's hard to review the SRS-BTX300 without evoking its closest competitor, theJawbone BIG JAMBOX. They're really very close in terms of features and capabilities. The Jawbone can be charged using a standard microUSB charger, the Sony needs its own charger. The Sony can power/charge an external device, a useful feature. Both sound really good and excel as a conference speakerphone, but the Sony is almost twice as big, weighs twice as much... and runs about half as long (it does play louder).PROS----- Beautiful design, solid feel, metal grille- power button covered during transport- USB power out to power/charge a phone or music player- Great sound for its size- works beautifully as a speakerphone- Apt-X support (improved bluetooth audio when used with devices supporting it like the Galaxy S3)- Bundled neoprene carry sleeve- international power adapter- bluetooth pairing simple, fast and reliable- reset button (I never had to use it but it's good to know it's there!)CONS------ can only be charged using proprietary power adapter- odd shape- very heavy- NFC pairing gimmicky and unreliable (worked once out of over 20 attempts, and didn't even complete pairing)CONCLUSION-----------A well rounded speaker, solidly built, at a very reasonable price, as long as you don't mind its hefty weight. Recommended.[UPDATE] I have recently replaced my Samsung Galaxy S3 with a Sony Xperia Z and found out the NFC pairing worked flawlessly with the Sony phone.

$review_text.: To me, iPod docking stations are like mullets; I'd have one if they weren't so disgusting to look at.  My biggest beef with docking stations is that they are traditionally very aesthetically intrusive and bulky if not downright ugly.  On top of that, half the time the docks have so little treble that they sound like an aged McDonalds drive-thru speaker system albeit without the offer for a hot apple pie.  Combine these two elements with the ridiculous costs due to "specialization" and the so-called "portability" and you've got products that typically are not on very many people's want list.Philips took these issues to task when they released the aesthetically pleasing Fidelio docking station with superior sound quality at a cost that wasn't bad.When I first received my Fidelio, I gave it the ultimate test by allowing my death metal-listening brother place the newest Avenged Sevenfold CD in and played "Welcome to the Family."  We later played the whole album at 3/4ths the maximum and the Fidelio still played with the same crystal-clear quality as when we first took it out of the box.  Even my brother was impressed given how many speakers and home theater systems he's blown.What I liked most about the Fidelio was that, unlike most docking stations, the speakers aimed upward instead of out.  This allows sound to resonate in all direction since it shoots in a general upward direction rather than a hyper-focused one that most speakers do.  We paced around the Fidelio and heard the same quality and volume at a perfect 360 degrees.All in all, the Fidelio actually impressed me.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking an iPod dock.

$review_text.: I would like to start by saying I currently have the iPad 3 as well as the iPhone 5; and I have had Android devices in the past.This Playbook tablet is quicker and more glitch free than the Android devices I have used. It loads aps in seconds, and browser pages almost as fast as my iPad. The Playbook browser is capable of flash, so you can watch embedded videos and media in your browser without having to open a separate ap. It does have a dedicated YouTube ap, as well as a Facebook ap. It also has an email client/ap, as well as video chat aka Face Time.For faster web browsing, you can enable/disable Javascript and Flash with a quick swipe- by swiping from the top down while browsing and selecting the content icon. This results in near instantaneous loading of pages, otherwise you get a several second lag. I only enable Javascript or Flash when the web page requires it and I need the functionality it brings.The other tip I have and its a BIGGIE, is, Get The Rapid Charger Immediately and use it. [...]Blackberry Rapid Charging Stand for Playbook - Retail Packaging - Black]]  The Playbook Rapid Charger or Playbook Charging Pod/Stand uses a magnetic three (thick) prong receptacle that is far sturdier, as well as charges much faster. The stand can be found on Amazon for about $17 total with shipping. It is currently $6 cheaper than the Rapid Charger wall plug.  [...] Blackberry Rapid Travel Charger for Playbook - Retail Packaging - Black]]The charging cord that they give you is a micro USB; and anyone who has had one of these stop working on their cell phone knows what I am speaking of. Not only that- the charger has a Blackberry icon on the top side that goes in the port, with the USB symbol on the bottom side. This is contrary to industry standards calling for the USB symbol to be inserted with the top side up. RIM Blackberry also decided to use a dual AB micro USB for the charging/data port instead of just a B type, which means that you can insert the cable in upside down(which would be industry standard correct). If you insert this charging cable in upside down even ONCE, you can kill the port. Some recommend putting a white or red dot on the proper side so this (costly) mistake isn't made. eBay is full of Playbooks for sale with bad micro USB ports.I would like to mention that Office Depot had a great Clearance Sale of the 64 GB model Playbook at $150. They sold out quickly. I found one in a store in Palm Bay, Florida; and a manager named Brian was kind enough to go out of his way to have it transferred/shipped cross country to my local store. I am very grateful for what Brian did and I would go out of my way to shop at his Office Depot location as a result of his awesome dedication to customer service.

First of, it comes with two USB cables, I knew that when I bought it, but me being use to portable hard drives that sometimes have multiple cables, I thought it would at least work with just one plugged in
WRONG! You need both

Second, even though my computer was running Windows 7, it was NOT plug an play
No matter what i tried I could not get it working

(FYI, I have a degree in Computer Science and could build a computer from scratch with my eyes closed) Third, when i wen to read the instructions, they were nearly incoherent! Basically all I got from them was that if the computer doesn't recognize it, insert the included software Mini CD into your computer and install the software


But wait..


isn't the reason I bought this because I DON'T HAVE A CD DRIVE ON MY COMPUTER!! Overall, it was not usable at all

I threw it in the garbage because it wasn't even worth returning.

$review_text.: that was busy serving me..


(complete with melody, of course)More seriously, though, I read most of the reviews complaining of the big size compared to other drives

 I have not had the drive long enough to comment on the electrical and mechanical quality, but I have had the drive long enough to render an initial judgment.This drive replaced a Patriot 32GB USB 2.0 thumb drive

 I purchased the Patriot drive approximately end of the first quarter last year

 Your next question should be why would I &#34;replace&#34; the drive.Easy
 (Mathematical equation follows:)Patriot = Garbage, trash, rubbish, ...I purchased last summer another Patriot drive, a 32GB micro HDHC card for my Sony, who refuses to upgrade to HDXC camera, but I am off topic there.About mid December, the nice and slim Patriot drive decided that it would break


 The mechanical retraction mechanism broke off


 Nice and small, which lends itself to being lost easier, is not so nice

 Thankfully for me, the retraction mechanism broke off in the extended position, so there was no data loss, just time and money


 (I had to pay to send it back plus purchase a new drive


 I do not trust Patriot thumb drives anymore.)I still held onto the belief that Patriot was fine as a company, though.I went on a trip to Las Vegas and took many videos and photos

 I hardly ever go to Las Vegas, but that does not matter
 I came back home, attempted to download the photos and the memory card died

 I lost all the photos and videos

 Gone


 I should have downloaded every day on my trip to my laptop

 That thought does not help me now

 I was forced to send back just last week another defective Patriot memory card.The corsair Flash Voyager seems quite rugged and well put together
 I hope that the mechanical is an outwardly visible sign of the inside.One should look for quality first, not size
 Speed is okay, just I do not have a USB 3.0 port on my PC, so hard to judge speed

 Just from a using point of view, I think that this drive is a bit faster than the Patriot, but have not done any scientific benchmarks.

However, the plastic very nearly matches the look and feel of the rest of the case so it's not a deal breaker.  I installed the SilverStone CFP52B bay converter in the 5.25in bays and subsequently installed 12 hard drives into this case.  It's a great arrangement at a fantastic price.  I bought a second one of these for my next rig.The power and reset puttons are a tad loose for my taste.

$REVIEW.: I don't like this for my non-touch-screen computers.The menus and how you access them have been moved around quite a bit. everything's still named the same you just have to go about finding it differently. It seems that MS wants users to just use the search box for navigation and everything else or something. like Ubuntu and Google there is a tile screen where you click apps  "nothing new". anyway!!! I could go on about all of the idiosyncrasy's that I don't care for but instead let me just say this.Windows has developed a pattern with how they create,evolve,regress and then succeed with each distribution they put out.So my verdict is too stick with Windows 7, until Windows 9 or what ever they are going to call the thing that replaces Windows 8 comes out... unless you have to have a touch screen windows phone or tablet.hope that helps some.

Ergonomically, this mouse is very well designed; one's hand rests comfortably and naturally on it
I use this mouse for many hours each day and have never had a problem with my thumb.....true, some folks may experience some thumb discomfort after heavy use, but everyone's different, right?  There's no one mouse that's perfect for everyone.The previous reviewer's claim that the four screws on the bottom of the mouse need to be removed for cleaning of the trackball and cradle are untrue
 One merely pulls the trackball out of it's cradle and then wipes the ball and cradle with a cloth.....a very easy procedure.This is, definitely, one of my very favorite mice.

 If you are located on a Hill and the TV tower is located on a flat land 17 miles away then don't stick the antenna in the attic instead consider putting antenna close to the floor or in the basement.This Antenna is fine it is just a little bulky to be considered an indoor antenna

$REVIEW.: The protector is made of thicker PET sheet than the one you usually see included in cases (the version which can be easily rolled or crumpled or folded when youre not careful)
This one is probably as thick and firm as five bond papers
The thick substance helps in avoiding bubbles after application

So, a pesky dust (after all the cleaning and wiping that youve done) can be the only reason for a bubble


(Just hope the dust will be on the outer portion, so you can peel the protector carefully on the edges, and remove the one dot of dirt with an ordinary scotch tape).It doesnt come with a protective sheet on the non-adhesive part
Since the finish is matte, manufacturer probably thinks that there's a slim chance for it to get scratched during application


But lo and behold, after I finished putting the protector and squeezed in the iPad inside a tight orange I-Blason case, I scratched the film with my nail near one corner
The scratch could have been avoided if there's a protective sheet on the facing side


But in any case, it was the result of my own carelessness, it was my fault, so no complains

The wide scratch line was annoying at the start, but I got used to it eventually.Three months after though, when we intentionally hid iPad charger from my daughter (too much play time), she got hold of ballpoint pen and madly wrote in the uncharged iPad


The result: 4 deep, long scratches and the film lost its adhesiveness (it came off) in the middle


 I now have to use the second sheet (will apply this weekend).Btw, I bought the matte because a friend recommended that it would make the iPad more suitable for reading

I confirm this; I since finished 2 kindle books using the iPad


But you indeed will lose some of the retina display's sharpness, so it's a trade-off.

$REVIEW.: I got this for my hard-of-hearing mother who had trouble hearing TV programs. Now she can turn it up as much as needed and understand what the people are saying. The speakers on most TVs are lousy.  I needed a y-attachment of red and white male inserts into the TV. The female part hooked into the green cord that comes with the speakers. I got it on Amazon for about $1. There were a lot of adjustments she made to get the right base (less) and treble (more) for her tastes. The hockey puck adjustment has the correct tweeking button for making adjustments.  As long as she is happy and can enjoy TV programs, I am happy.

$REVIEW.: The power outlet unit is very sturdy, but the remote is very poorly made

When I received the unit the remote looked so poorly made that at first I though it won't even work
Anyway, it did work, for about one week and then just died
Amazon sent me a replacement which looked just as poorly made, but at least it had been working for about a month now


But then I accidentally dropped it from my hand (a 3 foot drop may be?) on my carpet, and the battery cover "stopper" broke off
No suprise, actually, given how low quality plastic they used to build the remote


Now the battery won't stay in place properly, of course, without a battery chamber cover.I'd rather recommend this, which anyway gives you 2 outlets with one remote-http://www.amazon.com/Bye-Standby-BBSBUSA-Energy-Saving/dp/B0010383XM/

$REVIEW.: This device may work great with some TVs listed as "compatible," but just because your TV is on the compatibility list does NOT mean the Wireless LAN Adapter will provide you with anything of great value
 Samsung's web site has all sorts of APPS that can be used with SOME TVs
 Unfortunately, I believed the packaging (I chose not to buy it locally but to go through Amazon)
 The back of the packaging clearly shows that this device is compatible with all 2010 C550 series TVs and above


 With ours being a C610, that would seem to be "above."  Well, it is - sort of
 It will set up OK (a little tricky but it finally did connect with the wireless router)
 But don't expect to be able to do ANYthing other than look at slide shows or listen to music you've got on your PC connected to the same network


 Not one of the APPs works with the C610 model
 But they can claim "compatibility" because it will connect to the router and allow you to interact with your computer
 Internet?  Netflix?  Other APPs?  Not possible
 Very poor marketing of the product by Samsung (not Amazon's fault - as usual, they made a return easy).I do have to say that once I really understood what the TV manual was saying, I can now see that our model wasn't intended to do any of the "cool" internet things, or use any of the APPs

 It will just allow interaction with our PCs

 And if you have other Samsung products, you can control them all with one remote, for example


 But they must be all Samsung.This may be worth a 5-star rating for someone with one of the TV models that can use ALL of the designed functions of the Link Stick

 But with our "compatible" model Samsung TV, it's nearly worthless.

$review_text.: I've been asked many times how this 4k UHD TN monitor compares to a IPS display, so I recorded this little bit with my old 2560x1440 panel next to the Samsung UHD panel. Note that there is a color profile difference and that is because I used a spyder 3 for calibration. It only calibrates a single monitor.While the Samsung UHD panel is very impressive for a TN panel, there is some color shifting as you move left to right and up and down. If you can look directly at the panel color is, for the most part, even. If you are using this panel for color grading keep that in mind. Also note that the resolution of a panel like this at 28 inches makes text very hard to read. I've had to increase my windows and browser display to 110% in order to read things properly. This does not cause any problems with the monitor or the text, but it does use up more space than it would if you could use 3840x2160 at 100% as opposed to 110%.Last complaint is the stand. While the panel is great, I kind of wish I'd have held off and picked up the Asus version. It has the same TN panel but on a much better stand for only $50 more. The stand on the Samsung is ok, but it lacks a Vesa mount and the foot is sort of wobbly. The Asus panel has many more adjustments, a better stand, and a Vesa mount if needed. If you need adjustment range the Asus is the way to go, if you just want a good panel and don't care much about the stand the Samsung is a pretty decent 4k 60hrz panel.For the price it's a great monitor.

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying that if you happen to be looking for a way to record music from one of the 41,000 radio stations that this company supports and then take it to your car without having to record it yourself and put it on an mp3 player, it does work.That being said, the stations are not very inclusive.  This isn't going to be XM radio we're talking about.  most of the stations are non-US stations (which is a good thing for some people, but not what I was looking for).  I wanted children's music for my kids to listen to.  I love XM's Kids Place Live, and I wanted something like that.  What I found was less than a dozen channels, only 4 in English, and at the time that I set this up all 4 were playing music that wasn't appropriate for my kids.  So I decided to move on to pop and use it for myself.  This was even harder.  There were about 100 top 40 channels, mostly not in English again, and the ones that were were just random stations like 94.9 FM in Nashville, TN (I couldn't tell anything from the names and there is no way to get user reviews of the stations).  So I picked one at random and decided to record it just to write the review and then I can add this to the pile of gadgets that I don't use anymore.That wasn't easy either.  You have to start it recording, let it go for the amount of time that you want (this isn't mp3 downloading where you can get a few hours in a few minutes), and make sure your computer doesn't go to sleep.  Also, the station dropped out after about 20 minutes and when I came back 4 hours later I discovered that the software doesn't reconnect you automatically, so you really have to use this to listen to music at your computer and then replay the same music in the same order in your car.The device is also missing features that I just assumed it would have like identifying when songs start and stop to separate tracks, identifying the music and labeling the tracks so I know what I am listening to, or the ability to mark a song at the unit while I am playing it back and later be reminded to go buy that song.The device was very easy to set up, despite the fact that my 64 bit version of Windows doesn't support their 64 bit client and I had to run the 32 bit version (not a big deal just not sure why they bothered to include the 64 bit version if it doesn't work).  I updated to the latest software quite easily as well.This is a buyer beware situation.  The device works as advertised, but has no bells and whistles that aren't mentioned in the product description (like auto-reconnect, which I would consider a standard part of this device's operation).  And it is easy to use (if you don't mind baby sitting it).  But you can access 100 times that many radio channels online and record them using free software that will do these other things and then download them to your mp3 player in minutes (assuming that you have one, if not check out the Samsung ones and remember to get one with speakers if you will ever want that capability, don't waste your money on a Zune or an IPod unless you have a good reason to).For me, the product was a free test product, so I didn't waste anything.  but I would be returning this if I had paid for it.

For whatever reason, with this button broken, it seems one of the 2 drivers on each side is not working.  If I push the button and hold it down, both drivers work and it sounds better.  Considering the packaging was pristine with no issues, the damage had to have occurred at the factory, prior to packaging.  Very disappointing.  I was eager to try them.  Not sure if I will bother going through the hassle of trying to return them.

$REVIEW.: I have 3 of these now. I will probably buy 2 or 3 more. I do most of my strobist work in manual mode so these are perfect for me. There are many channels to use, you can channel group and use one group or another or both, the fire from a long distance, the mounts are sturdy. The only thing I wish is that the thumb screw on the mount turned a little easier. It can be difficult to tighten or loosen the mount.

$REVIEW.: I used this to replace a 5 port gigabit unmanaged switch. What I like about the unit is that it is very compact (see photo vs. trend net 5 port gigabit green switch), very much plug & play and sturdy (steel design). It works as expected with ultrafast connection (no noticeable difference vs. trendnet).All in all a great product.4/5 stars for compact size, plug & play (unmanaged), and steel frame case.

$REVIEW.: I opened the box and first impressions it doesn&#8217;t look much different than many other cases. But then you take it out of the box and wow, this thing is really well built.Basically a basic bodyglove type case wrapped around and even better inner case.Tack on a very comfortable leather strap and a collapsible stand and you have the Gladius Air.Getting the inner case out of the sleeve is quick and painless, but separating the inner waterproof case apart to insert your iPad, this is where you have to take your time.I thought I was going to break 2 of the clips off, both of the middle ones lengthwise. But they finally both came apart.Nice thing is your iPad is not going to fall out of this case anytime soon. Slip inside the outer sleeve and now you are protected.I was never a big fan of this type of case, and then I tried it, the strap and the weight of this case feel very well balanced. It makes holding the device and using it much more comfortable.Gone are the days of feeling like your iPad is going to fall out of your hands while using it.The rotatable strap on the back is a little tough to turn at first, but I worked it a little in both directions and now it spins nice and smoothly, but still firmly locking into each of the 8 positions.The stand is probably not something I will ever use, but people who travel frequently  are like to watch movies on their iPad will find the included stand to be very nice and high quality.A nice brushed aluminum look that folds in on itself and does not interfere with any of the other functions.The false &#8220;waterproof&#8221; covers over the connections on the sides of the iPad are a little tough to get out at first. I was glad I went through and worked them all a few times before I installed my iPad.I could see the power or lock button ones getting stuck if you didn&#8217;t open and close them a few times before inserting your device, but after that they seemed to be much smoother, and they will protect your device fairly well.People on the move, people that travel a lot or technicians working in the field will find many uses for this type of case, I know I will be using it at work more than anywhere else. Being able to walk and stand while still having easy access to your iPad without fear of dropping it is great.The strap feels night and snug on your hand, but also is very comfortable.For use with the iPad Air 64GB LTE I would have to give this case 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: Radio reception is horrible in our condo.  So, I've been searching for some sort of appliance that could play internet radio programs.  Up until about a week ago, none apparently existed.  A few days ago, I discovered the LinkSys Wireless Internet Radio at Amazon.There is a unit that, for want of a better name is an Internet radio tuner and two detachable powered speakers.  The tuner can be hooked up to a stereo using standard RCA plugs or an optical connection.  The tuner connects wirelessly (11Mbps) to the Internet through a standard wireless Access Point.  It uses the same Internet connection you normally use.You can access Internet programs using the unit's front panel LCD and buttons or you can use the unit's remote control. There are 1200 stations and the list is updated regularly. You can set up a list of 20 favorite stations.  I've got such stations as KPFA and WBAI (Pacifica San Francisco and New York), KUSC, KCSN and a bunch of college stations set up.The tuner also uses a new technology called Universal Plug-and-Play Server.  This makes it possible for on-line services to provide access to program material on the Internet and for you to play it on your Internet radio appliance.  I am using the Rhapsody service.  It's music oriented with 60 pre-set music stations (I'm listening to the Baroque station right now) and you can even create your own by setting up a list of artists.  Tracks are served up randomly.  The service claims to have hundreds of thousands of albums.There are only two current drawbacks.First, the unit currently natively plays only streaming MP3 Internet radio stations.  That's still a lot, but it doesn't allow for stations that use proprietary formats like Real Player or Microsoft Media Player.  Universal Plug-and-Play Server services can get around that by converting streams to MP3.  Since Real Player operates Rhapsody, I hope they soon convert at least Real Player streams to MP3.The second drawback is that the unit isn't portable. Even though you can wireless receive the Internet signals that carry input anywhere in your home, you have to plug the unit into a 120 volt receptable. This could be fixed easily on the tuner by turning off the always-on front panel LCD and running both the tuner and speakers off of batteries.  Internally recharged batteries would be ideal.
$SUMMARY.: A Pretty Good First Internet Radio Appliance

$review_text.: My broadband connection was changed from DSL to U-verse 10/27/2012.  Obviously, I had no choice and had to convert.  But, hey, AT&T; sent me a brand new 3600HGV, at no cost and doubled my broadband speed.  Easy to set up and worked fine for a little over a month then the wifi portion died.  Broadband worked fine.  Called tech support who quickly ran a couple of tests and said they would send a new modem.  Got it yesterday (12/5/12) and installed it immediately.  It was another easy set up.  Worked fine until this morning.  Broadband failed, wifi working fine.  Contacted U-verse support again.  This time they sent a tech to the house.  He checked incoming broadband connection.  It was running fine.  Replaced the 3600HGV with a 3801HGV.  Working great so far.  Will update if this one fails.One bright spot in this adventure was the quality of the U-verse techs working this problem.  I talked to 2 at the 1-800 number and had one come to my house.  All were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the modem and it's history of problems.

$review_text.: Overall it's a nice little MP3 player.  However though the touch screen is not sensitive enough.  You'll have too really push hard on the screen icons too get it too navigate from screen too screen.  For me it's been less than a week, and I'm ready too trash it, just because of the sensitivity issues.The player only comes with a USB cable for charging the batteries.  If your out in the field, away from a computer and the battery goes dead, then your out of luck.  It would have been nice if this would have came with a USB/120v electrical adapter. It's very easy too transfer files from your computer too the MP3 player.The sound clarity is very good, and the external speaker is a bonus.  Recording video footage is a breeze, and playback looks acceptable as well.  I would recommend this product too others, but I'd caution on the sensitivity issues with the touch screen.

They are very clear and bright-- and the bass is pretty good too. Some songs on these sound exceptional. As for others, not as impressive, but still very good. I'm not sure if there is some kind of super-deal out there on speakers better than these for a lower price; but I don't think you can go wrong with these speakers. Great overall value!

$review_text.: The Good:- Feels cheap, but sort of a good cheap feeling, maybe because of the texture of the plastic, but it feels cheap.The Bad- Sound is so terrible that while I'm watching something I can't even pay attention to the dialogue.  I just want it to stop the whole time, and when it finally does I'm relieved.  It really is that, bad I'm not exaggerating. It sounds like an old 80s tv from a motor home.- Typical Android buggy stuff like force closing and waiting on apps, sometimes not recognizing my finger, having to touch buttons on the display multiple times before they do anything.  This tablet seems to have the horsepower to get through the weird stuff faster, but it's still there.- Display color isn't so true to life or bright enough. I've compared this to my Kindle Fire HD, and people on the Nexus display sorta look like they've rubbed ash on their faces or they're very sick.- I pick up my iPhone over this thing whenever I have to search or read or anything.  When I pick up the Nexus instead it's just to give it some use - like I imagine a nice world where it's not annoying to use, and all of my touches make things happen, and it doesn't have weird delays and lags and make me crazy.I know iPads are boring tablets for dumb art students and ya ya ya I get it, I know.  But I'm going to get an iPad mini because I'm completely tired of my attention being focused on trying to use the device, rather than what I'm trying to use the device to do.Also, I've fought the fight saying Android is better, saying Apple stuff is for people who wear colorful scarves in the summer time.  I want Android to work, I voted for Romney, I like cats and not dogs... but I have to admit that Apple is clearly better.

$REVIEW.: Thought about my purchase for about 6 months

And after much research, I decided on an HP computer with a wireless card built in


This model is the one I chose and it is just perfect!PROS about this HP Computer:1) Wireless N Card built in

I just turned on the computer, and the card read my router and I was up and running on the internet in just 5 minutes! (Having the built in card on this desktop like the laptops do was a MUST for me
Also, the internet runs so quickly with this card in the computer, I am just amazed!2) The LARGE 750 Gig Hard Disk is so so quiet, even when it runs it is hard to hear

(Good sign as in the past when I had a noisy hard drive, it usually crashed within one year!)3) Hard disk does not run often, another very, very good sign!4) In addition, I bought the HP S2331 with 23" monitor and the display is superb (I bought this the same day separately at another store).5) Love the Windows 7 Home Premium that is on this computer (even though MOST of of older programs do not work in Windows 7, 64 bit)
I was aware of this and bought new software at the same time that I bought this computer

And I was ready to do this as in my last computer, I had Vista and I had a love/hate relationship with Vista and wanted the change to Windows 7 and also I wanted a new computer so it all worked out great

So this experience so far with Windows 7 and this new HP PC has been great!6) This system came with keyboard, mouse and computer (no monitor, but I bought the 23" HP S2331 monitor and am so happy with all of this put together).CONS: NO CONS with this HP, it is PERFECT, however, with Windows 7 here is my experience:*I have been upgrading for many years with new computers and new Windows and each time I have found I had to buy all new software as most of the old softwares would not run with the new Windows program
In addition, about 50% of the time, I had to buy a new printer as well


The last two times I bought a new system, with Vista and now Windows 7, I was able to update the driver of my printer online and install with no problem

**I bought this same model of computer in August, 2010 and was totally prepared that I would have to buy new software that would run in Windows 7, 64 bit

So I prepared myself for this and planned it for 6 months BEFORE I purchased this new HP system with Windows 7, 64 bit

And to make the transition even easier, I kept my older computer with Vista on it as a backup computer so I still have some of my older programs that I like


The funny thing is that now that I have upgraded with a new system and Windows 7 with new software, I like the new software so much, after 4 weeks, I rarely go back to the old Vista computer anymore! Yes, it is costly and also takes time and patience when upgrading from the old Windows, older computer to the newer Windows  and newer computer, however, in just about 4 weeks, I can smile and am so glad that I did this
Thanks HP and Windows 7! Premium

$REVIEW.: There's not much good competition in the emergency radio market, and it seems like Ambient Weather offers perhaps the best bang-for-the-buck product.  The device is certainly easy to use, but make sure to read the manual before hand as there as some things you can do that will damage the device.  For example, if you install AAA batteries and then crank the device, it can cause damage (you'd think they'd protect against that!).  That's okay for me because I don't plan on using AAA batteries but rather the lithium battery that came with it.The device's exterior feels solid as if it could handle a light fall.  I wouldn't recommend it though due to the solar panel being exposed.  The front panel buttons feel a bit cheap, but the flash light button is solid.  There is also a nice easy latch that you can hook onto to something if say you want to hang the radio in a tent.  The exterior part that concerns me the most is the crank.  I've owned other hand crank radios, and this part for some reason often feels like it could break if you are too rough with it.  The good news is that the manual recommend cranking slowly -- and not for more than two minutes.  Make sure you tell kids this because they have a tendency to crank fast and long.  Tuck the hand crank back in when done otherwise it will extend out where it could get snapped or bent off.I tested the weather alert system on a Wednesday as suggested in the manual.  It worked for me.  Everything works well, actually.  Given that the alert simply turns itself on to the weather station, I'm not sure I'll every use this feature in the field.  I'd rather just turn on the radio periodically to hear the latest weather.The siren and the strobe light are nothing impressive.  Save yourself $10 or so and get the WR-333-U.  Although I do recommend this radio, it does seem a bit overpriced for how straight forward it is.  I'd value it at about $30.

$REVIEW.: Well the Linkstation Live is up and running. It's not great - but it's better than say - managing a small Wintel server at home for simple common shared storage... it's also very quiet and low power. It's quite fast serving data over my gigabit connection, though for some reason management software (via either Firefox or Safari) is dog slow no matter what connection I use.The web interface LOOKS clean and sharp - but it's actually pretty clunky... a bit of lipstick on a rather plain-looking pig. Still - it works alright - if slowly and in convoluted ways. At least it's a departure from the usual Windows-inspired management software that looks and feels as bad as it works... Still, the clunky interface makes setting up users and groups a pig - so it's not something you'd want to try for more than a few users (or with anything too complex in terms of permissions)  Of course it's also limited to the dread Windows 12-characters, no-spaces naming convention for shares - frustrating step backwards for those who had so far avoided SMB sharing on their networks.Most interesting discovery so far is that it will read and mount USB card readers and flash drives via the ports on the back. They are automatically shared (unprotected) to the network - which is good for some things I can think of - obviously bad for others. It appears that they can be secured, but it seems to be on a per-device basis (and maybe even a per-mount basis, can't tell yet).It also would seem that it shouldn't have any trouble reading/mounting (and charging) the data partition of an iPod. Since I can't find my USB iPod cable right now, I haven't tried yet. (I'm not suggesting that the resulting share could sync with iTunes, but it might make a nice remote charging station and mounting the data to the network could be useful)The iTunes support is pretty good - although again, lacking in the details. All music files in the iTunes shared folder on the Linkstation (no matter how they are organized) have to appear in one giant shared folder in iTunes. It would be nice to have each subfolder share as a separate playlist... OR to allow multiple iTunes shared folders (you can have only one).It seems very flexible and powerful under the hood - only limited by a rather dire control interface and sparse instructions (There are many pages in the manual, they just don't say much you couldn't figure out on your own). I'm curious to see if it can share an all-in-one scanner/printer combo over the USB port. I'm sure the printer would be fine - but most new scanners share nicely as well, so that's a future experiment. Stay tuned.Over all - not bad. Not spectacular either. Better than several others I've encountered, and it's still easier for the average user than setting up a dedicated Linux/Windows/MacOS server at home. A solid 3 stars.

The ergonomics are great, and the glossy finish feels really nice as well as making the mouse easier to clean. The extra buttons (above and below the scroll wheel) are a little difficult to press, but I think it may just take more getting used to.The problem with the package is Logitech's horrible "Mouseware" drivers. They are buggy, hard to configure, and have a horrible GUI. I had problems with acceleration turning off/on in games, which is really hard to deal with. I reverted back to Microsoft's Intellipoint drivers, which work MUCH better than Logitech's, but unfortunately they don't let you customize the 6th and 7th button (since no Microsoft mouse has 7 buttons).

 My tests show mixed results regarding image quality

 With both lenses wide open the Sigma wins at the wide end from 18-24mm, especially away from the center, while the Canon wins at the 135-200mm long end, also especially away from the center

 Further, the Sigma is f6.3 wide open at 200mm while the Canon is f5.6
 This is only a small difference, but it does give the Canon even more advantage at 200mm where shutter speed needs to be the highest.Both lenses auto-focus accurately (no front or back focus) although the Sigma is slower to lock focus in low light and is a little noisier in getting there


 Their IS/OS are equally effective at about 3 stops of compensation


 Build quality, size and weight are about the same and both use the same 72mm filter size
 Sigma includes a lens hood while Canon wants to sell you one.In summary, the Canon is slightly better for me due to the faster and quieter low-light focus and improved telephoto image quality
 The trade-off is poorer image quality than the Sigma for wide angle shots, even after stopping down
 Finally, the Canon lens costs about $200 more than the Sigma at this time.

$review_text.: I wanted review the general aspects of this product and then show a case usage on how my famliy used this device over the summer.Overall product impressions:-Great form factor-Built-in battery-Low Price Point-64GB is a little low for a TON of movies, but it's very accomodating for a handful of movies, plus music for the kids.  Additionally, you can expand if needed via SD/SDHC/SDXC cards.-iPad and iPhones work with this unit (and this is really why you want this product)-Cheaper than some of the other competitor's wireless drives (Seagate specifically)Now, I want to highlight how my family uses this product to make our multi-hour road trips easier.  We have pre-loaded a bunch of MP4 movies (converted from our collection) onto this unit as well as music and some select family photos.  There are currently over 10 full-length movies, 300 songs, and an assortment of crazy pictures they took from their iPad cameras!I then take the router and plug it into the AC adapter in our car, which then creates a portable hot-spot inside the car.  Then, each kid connects his iPad to the hotspot which allows them access to the files via the Sandisk Media App (available for free in iTunes).  They are then able to view the listing of movies, music, photos available to then and simply click the one they want.Since the router is in the car, the signal strength is great and there is never a hiccup in streaming the movies.  The router handles both kids streaming different movies at the same time without an issue.  In fact, sandisk says the device can actually stream up to 8 devices at the same time, stream 5 HD videos concurrently.We've even utilized the onboard battery-pack for this device and done the same thing on a flight.This beats having to buy one or two movies for the kids on iTunes and eating up precious space on their 16GB iPads.No data requirements, multi-user streaming, fully portable = happy parents!The only gripe I have about this product is the utilization of the power button.  The power button serves three functions: pressing and holding it for 2 seconds turns the device off/on, 10 seconds restores the default passwords, and for 25 seconds performs a factory reset.  I found that several times my kids held the power button down too long or it got jammed between a seat and we suspect that it caused the reset.  I wish, like most routers, a pin was required to force a reset insetead of it being tied to the power button.All in all, a great solution at a very affordable price point which should bring some easy streaming to your kids' iPads.
$review_summary.: Great for the road trip!

$review_text.: I am writing this review using my Menotek keyboard, which is attached to my wifi Ipad via it's bluetooth capacity!  It outdid my expectations to say the least!  I don't even need wifi around to use my keyboard-- once I've linked the keyboard (go to settings, then bluetooth, then enter the  # that pops up on the iPad screen
 note:  you have to do this each time you use the keyboard, but it doesn't take long) it can be used anywhere


 meetings

 conferences
seminars
 I know


 I used it during a week-long conference where the power points were extensive and moving fast

 With this keyboard, I kept up with all the notes and then some!  I should mention that I had JUST gotten the keyboard, yet was able to use it immediately without extra practice

 It DOESN'T take much to  get used to it
 :)  I simply rested iPad and keyboard on a book I'd brought along

 :)This keyboard is the first flexible one I have owned
 the fact that it was said to work great with the  Ipad (a true claim), has raised keys, is waterproof, bluetooth AND rechargeable helped me decide to buy it
 But mainly I went by the reviews...


that is why I'm writing this one..


so YOU don't have to worry/search  as long as I did.Here are some of my original questions answered:-  YES it works with wifi (even wifi only) iPads.-  BELIEVE the almost 5 star rating (other flexible keyboards are lucky to get three stars)-  YES, the keyboard REALLY is extremely flexible and DOES roll up pretty tiny
 (DON'T keep it in a ziplock like I did...I don't think it is very good for it not to "breath"...besides, I've since had reason to need more protection for it than a simple baggie (on a plane flight I stuffed the keyboard into my carry-on and ended up forgetting its presence and damaging it later, fitting more stuff on top of it :( ..


 Shows I love this product, I guess, because, I forked out the dough for a new one  ;)

)-  YES, it has a number pad
 It's  enough for me -and I work in an office!  (the #'s double up with the main keyboard
just turn on # lock)-  I LIKE the mini sized keyboard (the KEYS aren't really THAT  mini...it just doesn't have an additional number pad attached to the side, so it looks shorter.-  product shipped to me fairly fast from this company.-  the keyboard looks great with the ipad, and is size appropriate :)-  keyboard battery life lasts at LEAST all day with full use (I haven't tested longer than that before charging it)-  keyboard WORKS with my iphone 3Gs, after the iphone4 update
yay!-  I CAN pretty much rest my fingers on these keys since they are raised, WITHOUT it typing uncontrollably


 a BIG plus!  Just don't rest too hard....note:  you will need a lap desk, large book, or other to use the keyboard


 not a problem for me.Also, Apple  bluetooth keyboard = $70

 This bluetooth easy-travel keyboard? = $30!  yeah

 That's a no brainer


 :)  I'm a happy typer now!  :DNote to cynics or people wondering:  I am NOT a paid reviewer, or affiliated with the company

 Just sharing what I've learned about this little device


 I wrote this review in early 2010, and am happy to say my keyboard still works perfectly 2 years later
 ( I keep it protected in a hard case), I think that helps


 I have yet to find a better flexible keyboard, let me know if you do


 :) take care

 When following the instructions to calibrate my monitor, I could never get the screen to display what the huey software says it should (eg


to get the top and bottom to look the same, or to 'see' the same number of rings on the top and bottom or right and left
 The problem may be the monitor (a Dell), and it is somewhat easier to get the printed output to match the screen after quite a bit of trial and error, but it wasn't a total easy solution.

 My only complaint is I don't like was how the cord is different from my other iPod
 This normally wouldn't be a problem except I use my iPod in my car to listen to XM radio


 I have a device from XM (specific for iPods) that you plug your iPod into and it plays XM radio through your car radio


 The plug is different therefore I had to buy another cord to convert it

$review_text.: I bought this camera new

Amazon was awesome as always
I have used many Canon cameras (I own an A60, A75, A400, A510, A540, and an A580)


I have taken and printed many pictures from all of these cameras

I have always liked the feel of Canon's cameras, because they feel substantial and comfortable.The first thing I noticed about this camera is how out-of-balance it felt


The grip area was too thin, and it always felt like it was going to slip out of my hands
The large LCD is nice, but would benefit hugely from some kind of hood, or the choice of an optical viewfinder


The LCD is very hard to see in bright sunlight.The controls of this camera felt well laid out to me
I liked the wheel for scrolling through adjustments or reviewing pictures

Again, they would have felt that much better had the grip been more substantial.The zoom is magnificent


Control of the speed of it seems well balanced and smooth
I like the automatic lens cover.Battery life was very good


I was able to take over 200 photographs, some with flash, on one set of batteries with time to spare
I used 2400 mAh NIMH batteries.I bought this camera in April 2011
I sold it in June

After taking almost 400 photographs with it, I can say without hesitation that I did not like the quality of the photos it produced


This is funny, because most of the professional reviews I read of this camera stated that photo quality was the main redeeming characteristic of this camera

I found it to be most inaccurate while in the "Auto" mode

White balance was almost never right, colors appeared under-saturated, and the photos always seemed to be over- or under-exposed

Again, this is with the selector in "Auto" mode


I actually got my best photographs in full manual mode


Even in Aperture-Priority mode, my favorite mode when I want to be more creative, the camera seemed hard to predict
The results were most predictable in manual


I spent most of our vacation taking pictures in manual mode so I could get some decent prints! These traits I find unacceptable.I have snapped gorgeous off-the-cuff photos with my wife's A580 in Auto mode

To me, this is the way "Auto" mode should be

I shouldn't have to hope the white balance is correct, or that the camera will choose the best shutter speed and aperture

 My A510, which is a 3.2 megapixel camera, takes beautiful pictures that yield nice 8 X 10 prints
I like the 510's pictures better than the SX120 IS pictures

What gives, Canon?As a result of these findings, I sold this camera and bought an older Canon Powershot S3 IS 6 megapixel camera, one of Canon's older "Pro" cameras

I can say without hesitation that the S3 photos are heads and tails above the SX120
The S3 also feels like a well-made professional piece of gear in my hand, with good balance and a good grip
When I want serious photographic power, this six-year-old, comparitively low-resolution camera is the camera I will be taking with me.In conclusion, I have to say that I no longer believe in megapixels or that newer is better


 I feel like Canon has dropped the ball with this unit


It has a lot of features and a high-resolution sensor, but if the picture quality isn't there, who cares? I'd rather have an older model with a better feel and better quality prints than the latest and greatest with lousy prints


I'm happier with Canon's older units


Perhaps, when the time comes, it may be necessary to give loyalty to another brand.


$SUMMARY.: My older Canons take better pictures.

$REVIEW.: My G router went kaput and without doing any research (a mistake right there), I went and purchased the Cisco Valet due to reading how easy it was suppose to be in setting it up. I'm moderately in touch technically, but really wanted something that I could set up easily. No fuss, no muss. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. I found the process a bit confusing with the USB plug (instructing me to disconnect the USB and when I did it would inform me I needed to have it plugged in) and ultimately could not get connected. I have three laptops, an IPOD touch, and a WII, and I needed wireless access immediately. I did try to set it up manually, but just could not get it to work.Honestly, it could have been me, but the product's claim was that it was suppose to be simple. I'm fairly determined when I want something to work, but in this case, I was not willing to spend hours on the phone with technical support to get it going. So, I took it back.After I did some research, I purchased theCisco-Linksys E3000 High-Performance Wireless-N Routerand had wireless in my home within 30 minutes and it works great. So, perhaps I just got a lemon Valet router.
$SUMMARY.: It didn't work out for me.

$REVIEW.: I was in the market for a new DVD player when someone said to me, `DVD players are ancient'. Man, did that comment make me feel old and busted. Anyways, someone told me about streaming media players. I always see them when shopping, but I already had my PS3 to stream Netflix, so I had no interest in buying a streaming media player to play Netflix when i already had my PS3 and Wii. However, I have a very extensive media library that contains tons of movies. I thought what a perfect world it would be if I was able to just plug in my USB external hard drive into my PS3 and watch movies from it. Turns out, it doesn't work that easy. If only it did. The only thing that PS3 consoles pick up is flash memory and 2TB external hard drives aren't made of flash memory.I finally gave in and purchased WD Live because it was probably the only device I found after extensive research that plays MP4 files. All my movies are in MP4 format. Anyways, I am pleased with this player because it can play all the movies I have stored on my 2TB external hard drive and now I no longer have to flip through my huge library of DVDs to watch what I want. Going from DVD to DVD can be so cumbersome. Browsing through movie files is sooooo much easier. WD Live is great because it also has built in wi-fi. Initial setup was beyond super easy. I don't know why Apple TV or Roku Players dont play MP4 files. Those companies would make soooo much more money if they made a device that does, or if their players could play media from huge 2TB hard drives. Considering the majority of the population has an iPod/iPhone/iPod Touch, it makes no sense why other players don't have the ability to play Quicktime (MP4) files. It just doesn't seem logical, but WD Live does. Also, if you already have a PS3/Xbox 360, or Wii, don't bother setting up the wi-fi if you are strictly using this to view movies via an external hard drive. What happens is, the internet connection will try and attach a small photo to go along with your movie files. Example: If you have the movie "Baby Mama" with Tina Fey, the internet will try and attach a small photo to your external hard drive to match the movie with its DVD cover. Soooo annoying and sooo pointless. Not to mention, it takes up room on your hard drive. The tendency is to have the wrong photo attached to the wrong movie. Anyways, I am not going into a lengthy review. I'll just list the pros and cons below.Pros:- Small, compact and portable- Two USB slots- Built in Wi-Fi- Built in Netflix App, Pandora, YouTube, etc- Plays MP4 files (Quicktime)Cons:- User Interface and software installed is CLUNKY- Should come with a mini keyboard to make typing easier- Can't play music videos by VEVO on the YouTube App- Navigating through 2TB worth of movies can slow the device down

$review_text.: The Lowepro Sausalito camera case is a well thought out and well made product.  The material quality is among the best (of several) neoprene cases that I own.  The material itself provides cushioning, while the hard inserts protect more well than most soft cases.  It is water-resistant if not outright waterproof, and I expect it will buffer a camera or other small electronic better than most.  There is also an attached microfiber cloth to protect and clean glass components. The case will fit a range of small electronics: slim compact cameras, Mp3 players, PDAs.  I am guessing it is about the perfect size for an Exelim or other thin camera (though we  do not have one around to test it with), and I will note, is the perfect fit for an Ipod touch. That said, if you are not as careful as you could be with your electronics, throw them into a purse, briefcase or other bag where they could be knocked around a bit, this is just the thing to keep them safe.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I am a pocket fiend.  If there were a little outside pouch for whatever extras you might require (battery, card, earbuds...) then i would have considered it just about perfect.If you are looking for a basic slim case which offers a lot of protection, I have not had any better than this.Edited to note that it fits the Panasonic Lumix p3 with a bit of room to spare; almost a perfect fit.

$review_text.: First I'll state that these are my first set of "upper end" headphones that I've ever purchased, but they sound amazing in every aspect of the word. I listen to all genres. All kinds of Rock, Reggae, Metal of all kinds, some hip hop and Industrial and Techno. If the frequencies are lined up properly I'll listen to it :). They are sturdy headphones with a detachable, lockable cord. Although they're a little heavy I don't find them to be uncomfortable in the slightest. If you want some extra comfort you can purchase the Velour pads for the SRH940 (although some debate loss in audio quality, though I don't hear it). I confirm they fit just like the 840 pads and I think they make the SRH840 feel a little better and also the clarity is still there.The Shure SRH840's seem to be all around great except I'll agree that they may be lacking a little bass. I recently purchased the Fiio E11 Portable Headphone amp and one of the EQ settings fixes this problem and brings the headphones to volumes that nobody has business listening to... but while maintaining the clarity and detail. Also a highly recommended accessory IMO.I feel like I did enough research on my first pair of nice headphones to say that I plan on keeping these for decades to come and as of right can't picture myself needing to upgrade for that amount of time to come. They sound incredible and I would recommend this set to anyone and everyone. Good job Shure! You've earned a customer for life!

$review_text.: Looked up a replacement battery for my laptop on dell's website and got sticker shock

 I came to Amazon and bought this battery under the assumption that if it did not work very well I wasn't out much $

 This battery works great!  It charges just as fast, and  lasts just as long as the OEM battery

 I have had no problems at all

 Did I mention it costs 1/4 of the price of the original?  Don't think twice about it, go ahead and give this battery a try.

$review_text.: Bought these as part of a project to replace my stand mounted Sony 52 inch tv and Vizio soundbar with a wall mount Sony 65 inch TV, Bower & Wilkins speakers, and an Integra A/V receiver. Running all wiring/cables in the walls. The cables have an in wall rating so they should meet all code requirements. These cables support the latest HDMI version and are doing their job well as part of our new system.I elected to not go with a 4K TV since the human eye cannot see the difference between 4K and 1080p on a 65 inch screen unless you are sitting closer than 6 feet from the screen. Even at that distance, you need pretty good eyes!! So I opted to put the savings into other components.

$review_text.: OK - I realize it's a sin to put Olympus cameras into a Canon bag but my video is all Canon and my stills are all Olympus - so if you shoot with the E series OLY cams, this bag has no problems with other brands.Negative - I took this on a 15 day cruise loaded with 3 E-300 backs and 3 lenses to avoid changing lenses.  The only thing I would do differently is NOT use the velcro pockets on the side for ANYTHING of value.  Everytime you step on or off the ship, you do the entire X-ray, cavity search, etc TSA routine.  I lost alot of small stuff out of the side pockets.  Their flaps let small stuff leak through the TSA security x-ray and bucket brigade.Positives.  I used this solidly every day for 15 days to cary 3 ea E-300 backs, 1 50mm prime lens, 1 14-54 mm zoom, and 1 50-200 mm along with a teleconverter, 2 flashes (a long range and a ring flash), and a 300+ volt rapid recharge flash accessory for short recharge times, typically under 1/2 second.  There are plenty of pockets - as I mentioned the side pockets are vulnerable to loosing contents inside Xray machines, but the main compartment is amazing.  The straps that crosshatch the back did a great job holding the strobe power supply while allowing the coiled cord to exit to the strobe attachment point - it was a very effective system even allowing the rapid strobe charger to run and to stay cool while in the pack.All backs were carried mated to their associated lens - avoiding the risk of changing lenses in the field.  The main camera back had the dual battery accessory on it - the two smaller ones did not and went face to face like lenses with padding.  All of this, plus the macro hardware went in the main compartment.  If I were not on a ship with narrow passages, I could have tied my tripod to the two straps under the main bag but I chose not to as I'd get stuck in so many tight spaces if I did.  There are also two heavy mounted 1" strap ties on the sides that can be used to attach other cases to the pack.Padding is very generous inside the main compartment, so your preciuos cargo is protected against drops and mishandling by those people who keep us safe  (HINT - put UV filters on all lenses before traveling - TSA likes to touch the glass on your lens to make sure its not a bomb)I was simply amazed that I could carry so much in a compact backpack, have it organized ready to pull the right camera for that quick shot, and still have every accessory needed for a full day's shooting on the run.  Empty, the pack is very light and adds little weight to your overall load.  The zippers are all well attached to handle some stretching - they held up well without damage.  All cameras survived the trip and the bag looks good as new.  It was, of course, my carry on item, so it got the most scrutiny and fingerpoking by TSA's "challenged" employees.If you are planning a trip with cameras and accessories, this *IS* the best way to make it through security and still have working equipment on the other side.  I doubt you will find anything as well thought out at a camera store for this price either.I did not try fitting any video equipment in this pack as it travels in a hard pelican case.  Holding 3 D-SLR cameras and all accessories speaks volumes as to its ability though.  This is a keeper for traveling and just general storage.
$review_summary.: Well constructed and designed for cameras.

$review_text.: I am a huge fan of Logitech and already use some of their products including probably the world's oldest mouse (it still works so great!) and a great set of five speakers for my computer

These Ultimate Ears are dull silver in color and come with a flat, three foot, non-tangle rubber covered cord

It comes with five sets of silicone ear cushions so one can pick the size that is most comfortable and they really, really block outside sounds!I assumed that these were going to be good but I have to say that the sound is astonishing, especially for the price


 I am listening to Khyber Pass by the Ministry as i am writing this and I had to turn the volume almost off so as not to damage my eardrums! Honestly, the sound is as clear as high end speakers and I love the deep thump of the bass beats

Wearing the Ears for DVD viewing is comparable to the sound quality at the cineplex
If you are a fan of movies from the British Isles as I am, go back and re-watch your favorites with these, you don't need to use the subtitles to decipher the Irish or Scots accents

I swear I have missed out on so many plot points due to not wearing these sooner!They come with a small plastic carrying case and an alligator clip to attach to your garments

I tried them and they worked on my I-phone for the musical apps


 Try them, I think you will like them as much as I do.

$REVIEW.: First let me say that I have seen these types of protectors sell for around $30.00 for just one protector. That is insane. With this product, you get 3 protectors in a single order and for a truly fantastic price. Did I say these things are really easy to install? After the initial installation, I discovered that I needed to reposition the protector, I thought that would a real pain in the putt, but it reinstalled very easy. If you get a flick of just under the protector, and you may, you simply use our finger to wipe away the just fragment and continue. There is no need to apply any wet product to you expensive iPad2.This thing is absolutely anti-reflective and it shows no... I mean no finger prints. The screen sharpness is not diminished. Reading outdoors and in places where reflections were a problem is a problem no more. Did I say that you get 3 of these protectors in a single order? The holes for the camera and the home button are perfectly aligned.Great deal... Wonderful product... Simple installation... Fantastic price... A must buy item for any iPad2 user.

 I ordered these with the extra bass addition and have nothing but praise for this product

 I have used and own many versions of the MDR-sony line and they all still work-some 25 yrs

old, what does that tell you-With Sony you get the best tech


and at a VERY fair price
 I've seen these selling for $60.00 in the stores-I paid $28.50 on Amazon


 The quality is on par with the most expensive models out there
 Unless you are a engineer, these do the trick and for so much less $, save your time and $ and buy these-you won't be sorry!

I run through a lot of  these headphones and found that I run through them just as fast whether they cost much or not, so have decided to just stock on the cheaper ones. I bought some Sony ones at the same time I got these that were around same price and I think the sound is better on these. My husband advised me to stock up on these since they would probably quit making them as soon as everyone got hooked on them. Sound advice, indeed.

$review_text.: Was looking for a high capacity USB charger to use on a road trip.Overall this is a really nice charger.Note, I also picked up the &#34;Saicoo 6A / 30W 4 USB High output Ports Car Charger (83CM Cable Length), with separated ON/OFF Switch / LED indicator and one Silicone Paste&#34;. [I got both thru Amazon.]For the iXCC, I had a TomTom GPS and smartphone (Galaxy S3 clone) plugged in for a 3+ hour road trip with no problems. It kept the gps charged ...while recharging the smartphone quickly.Only issue that I can complain about is more related to the (rental) car. It was manual shift. Given the location of the 12v plug (right in front of the gear shift) and the size of the charger with the USB cables plugged in, I had to take care with shifting gears as the stick would occasionally bump into the cables.For comparison, I had also used the other (Saicoo) charger. Also very good and quick (with same items plugged in). Overall, it is bigger (but not too big ...given the built-in cord) than this one. But the positive here is that the cord gives the flexibility to move the connected USB cables out of the way if needed.Both are nice chargers, but depending on what you are plugging into it ...and where it gets plugged in ...one may be better suited for you than the other.

I have bought four sets of other brands that were supposed to be really good ranging in the $20-$40


I refuse to pay for earbuds exceeding $40, just don't see the means
I wasn't blown away by any of those, sure they sounded good but the bass wasn't there
I'm talking about normal filling bass, not overwhelming bass

I these based on the reviews and figured "what the heck, it's less than $20"
I was thoroughly impressed as soon as I plugged these in right out of the package
Wow, I really wasn't expecting this sound


Everything is there, clarity, volume and nice filling bass

It's hard to explain the sound, you have to listen for yourself

Light weight, comfortable, nice cord, just a really good set of earbuds
I've had them for about a month now and I'm still impressed
When these go out I will definitely go a grab another set, no question about it

$review_text.: I needed a pure sine wave UPS.  My computer has a high-efficiency power supply that cuts out if fed a stepped sine wave.  (Active PFC)For that, it's great, and at a good price.  This is the second one I've bought.But, there are problems that make me wonder how we it is built inside.It reeks of cheap plastic.  It took more than two weeks for the smell to begin to dissipate.  (Both units were the same.)There is a sticker on it explaining that the very first time you turn it on, it won't turn on until you charge the unit for eight hours.  You don't need the sticker after the first time.There is also a sticker explaining that the outlets that are not battery backup (surge protection only) are always on, even if you switch the unit off.  Don't electrocute yourself.  A useful warning to keep around.Guess which sticker easily peels off, and which sticker is glued on with the strongest adhesive I have ever seen.  Even sticker-remover products don't work.  It leaves a giant white mess on the front of the sleek, black case.  Boo.  Hiss.  Someone messed up.The cheap plastic smell goes away, but the junk sticker look does not.It's a shame, because it really does have a nice, sleek black case.  It also has a nice display on the front that you can switch between different power readings.  (I like to see the display for the number of watts I'm currently using, so I have a sense of when I'm adding too many items.)If you press and hold the mute button for a second, you get  very clear graphic (a speaker with a circle and a line through it, like a no-smoking sign) indicating that the unit is muted and won't start beeping when power is lost.  (If that's what you want.)

I found using Photo Cell Batteries will last way longer
Also I like how after you take the picture it pops up and lets you preview and/or delete if you don't like it without having to press extra bottons


The optical zoom is pretty helpful but the digital zoom ruins the picture

$review_text.: This is my second pair of headphones (my first purchase were MEElectronics M9-BK earbuds)from this manufactuer and I've been pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of both sets of headphones. These particular pair are lightweight and foldable (perfect for travel). They are comfortable, but don't fit as snug as I'd like, so the sound suffers a bit. They are very inexpensive for the quality and not big and bulky. I would definitely recommend these headphones.

$REVIEW.: I was nervous about this modem from the reviews I've read


Half seemed to really like it and half wanted their money back


I find myself in the first camp


Installation was quick and painless


Modem speeds were 4 times faster than the old Linksys cable modem I had previously


I also assume part of the speed change was the Gigabyte switch that replaced my old Linksys wireless hotspot
Lastly, the 802.11n wireless hotspot worked great - quick and great range
My laptop logs in wherever I go in the house

I will mention that I made the standard configuration changes that other reviewers mentioned in other reviews before I went to work on using it


The software to set up the modem is not the best and I have trouble assigning a new password, but otherwise it is doing great.

$REVIEW.: Some reviewers have stated that the only difference between the TZe-231 and TZ-231 tape is the eco-friendly packaging. But I noticed another small difference which is an update to the product line. The label backing used to match the white of the label, but is now a light blue to easier distinguish and remove the disposable backing.While outputting the first few labels, I noticed a 1mm clear plastic lip that allowed easier peeling, but that was only in the beginning of the roll. The lip disappears after printing several labels.Hope this helps.

$REVIEW.: I have been a Nikon user since the 1960's, going back to the Nikormat EL 35mm.  I jumped into the digital world and worked my way back to Nikon with a 995, then a D70 and most currently the D90 until I purchased this D7100.  I am by far not a pro, or even a semi-pro, but just an enthusiast that enjoys taking photos and I like going out of the box and getting away from the Auto or point and shoot modes.After many weeks of swaying back and forth, reading all kinds of user and professional reviews,  I finally made the decision to buy the D7100.  I could not justify going full frame as the cost of the camera and investing all new lenses, was just not realistic.  I don't do large prints that often.  Mostly I do Meetups and just look for one day fun shoots.  So the DX format is more than adequate for me.  Yes, if you are a pro, or advanced semi-pro, you probably should be looking at a full frame model.  But that is overkill for someone like me. Oh if I had more money than I needed, LOL,  maybe then I would have gone full frame!!But this DX D7100 and the Nikon glass I have, I believe will do as much as I need to do with photography, at least for quite some time.  There may be additional glass options I will add to my arsenal but I believe I have the basic body I will be able to use.I have to say, for someone moving up to the D7100 or first time users,  I solidly recommend David Busch's full version of the D7100.  I am about 1/4 through it but it is making the transition from the D90 much smoother and helping me utilize all the features available to me with this model.  I want to avoid the Auto settings where I can and this books is super in my mind.Is the D7100 perfect? No, by no means.  But this it isn't a D4 either, nor the cost of the D4!!  For the money, is it worth the price?  So far I have to say an emphatic YES!!!!
$SUMMARY.: The D7100 met or exceeded my expectations!!

$REVIEW.: I like it


I had the MS wireless laser mouse but didn't care for the fact that every once in awhile, I would lose the signal
So, I bought this one.It's accurate and comfortable but it's not for large hands

I have kids and they use the computer so I don't mind this smaller mouse but if you have large hands, forget it.Also, the cord is very short (about 2 ft long) so you will need a hub on your desk top or an extension cable, neither of which is included.

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately, my Zune player had a bit of a fall on a rainy day so I no longer have the device.While I had it though, I loved it.The Zune player's GUI as well as that of the included software is not only pretty (girly webgrrls like myself I think will appreciate it) but extremely intuitive

I was up and running with it, literally, in minutes.The zune pad is awesome

Much more comfortable to scroll with than the iPod's clickwheel thingy.I can't really comment on sound because I'm not an audio major and I don't remember what kind of equalizer settings were offered
It sounded good to me, though.Now, on to why I give this 4 stars

First, the firmware on this device can be a bit sluggish and even locked up once

I had to figure out how to do a hard reset (it's usually done by depressing one or two buttons at once for about 5-7 seconds so I just tried every combination I could until one worked lol).The wireless syncing, in my experience rarely worked

I think it might've had something to do with my own wireless settings because I was able to share (zune-to-zune) wirelessly with no problems.And finally, the zune pad started to look...dirty :/ after only a few months of use

I must have filthy hands or something.Anyway
All in all, Zune is a great mp3 player
I miss it dearly

The only reason I didn't buy another one was because the iPod touch came out


:P

Originally saw something like it at Best Buy, tried that but it just didnt cut it.  So I searched amazon and found the Gorillapod.  Buy it, you'll find many uses for it you never even thought of.  If you have a larger camera, then make sure you do get the largest Gorillapod and check the specs.

$review_text.: This mouse feels great and operates nicely when it is working, but I use mine for work and multiple (15+) times a day, the mouse starts jumping around the screen instead of moving smoothly.  This goes for clicks, movement, scrolling, etc.  The mouse and receiver are about 2 feet away from each other, so it's not a distance issue, and I've tried it on multiple surfaces with no difference.I googled the issue and it seems like a very common problem that has gone unanswered but Microsoft (surprise... not).  I tried all of the suggestions (rebooting, reinstalling drivers, changing batteries, etc) but none of them worked.  I plugged in a different mouse and when this one starts getting jumpy, the other does not, so it's definitely THIS mouse that is the issue.I bought a Logitech Anywhere MX mouse, and it works great.  I'll be returning this one.

$REVIEW.: I will admit, after 4 years I realize there are better versions out there, but for the price and the expectations, this steering wheel is the best investment I've made for my gaming console.  I use it in a custom cockpit I built and the steering wheel's force feedback, quality, and ease of use all make it a great purchase.  Gear shifter is small and short, I don't use it very often, only when I'm just trying something new.  Also, the flappy paddle shifters are very small, but generally I have no complaints about their use. The pedals are plastic and simple, they work fine for the games I play, but if I wanted to get more serious, I'd want a set of pedals that used hydraulics or a form of their own force feedback.

$REVIEW.: I've been &#34;renting&#34; a modem from Centurylink for over a year and decided to buy my own since I couldn't beat the price.  All I can say is I wish I had done this earlier.  The setup was pretty easy and Centurylink support provided the necessary values for my DSL service.  They also are sending me a return shipping label and package for my old &#34;rented&#34; DSL modem. Linksys / Cisco provide a setup CD for first time installation; which I highly recommend non-techie people use to properly configure and secure their network.  Performance wise I haven't seen any problems and appears to work better than my ZyXEL PK5001Z.  There are of course differences in capabilities but my guess is the average user won't notice.  If you're using multiple SSID's, for instance, the X2000 only supports one main and one guest wireless network whereas I was able to have up to 4 or 5 on the PK5001Z along with distinct subnets.  The guest network requires users open a web browser and enter the network password.  I'm not a huge fan of having that the only option but it's limited in that regard.  My unit had firmware version 2.00.01 installed, however, there is a newer version on Linksys's website (2.00.05 as of the time of this review)  I downloaded the updated firmware from Linksys / Cisco and installed it on the router.  After the firmware was installed and the unit rebooted, my internet no longer worked as the DSL connection was broken.  During the initial setup with Centurylink, the DSL connection would only work with PPPoA, however, after upgrading firmware versions I had to change this to PPPoE in order to work.  Aside from that, there aren't any noticeable differences between the firmware versions.Some other things to consider:1.)  The switch only has 3 ports as opposed to 4 as most switches do.2.)  The WiFi signal strength appears to be improved over the standard ZyXEL PK50001Z3.)  The settings are very basic - fine for an ordinary user but lacking for a power user.4.)  There doesn't appear to be any third-party support with respect to firmware.  i.e. DD-WRT

$review_text.: I also owned a Manfrotto 322 Joystick head, and my review will be based on the comparison between the two.1.)  Function/weight.  If you are already familiar with the 322, the 324 works exactly the same way as the 322, only is much lighter.  It will fit better with a lighter weight tripod (e.g., a Manfrotto 190 models/Benro Travel Angel/Gitzo, etc).2.)  Quality.  The 322 is made up solid steel which can take the roughest handling.  The 324 seems quite solid in its own right, but it is definitely not made of solid steel, and I have my doubt whether it could be used as the same way as the 322.3.)  Ergonomic.  The handle in 322 is quite flat; while the 324 has a much better ergonomic.  The holding of the 324 feels better than the 322.  Having said that, however, the 322 has it advantage of being "flat".  Both side of the 322 have holes to allow you to change the "plate holder" by unscrewing it and screwed it on the other side; hence, allowing you to have the option to navigate the joystick head with either you right (default) or left hand (if you decided to change it).  The 324, however, takes away that option.  With the 324m, you are now limited to only squeezing the "trigger" with you right hand.4.)  Weight capacity.  The 322 can take much heavier weight and thus heavier lenses.  The 324 is for smaller lenses.  Nonetheless, it handles the combo of Nikon D300S and the Nikkor 70-200mm VR II (the heaviest pair that I own) with a combined weight of more than 2kgs (4.4 Ibs) without problem at all.  I don't know how would it performs with camera/lenses heavier than the Nikon D300S/Nikkor 70-200mm VR II combo, but I don't think it wouldn't have much problem with up to a 3kg load.  Anything heavier than that you will want to use either 327, or stick with the 322.To me, it is a worthy purchase and it makes the reason a lightweight tripod more justifiable - what's the point of buying a tripod that weight less than 1kg (2.2 Ibs) but paired it with a joystick head, such as the 322, which weight almost the same weight as the tripod?
$review_summary.: Great improvement and a worthy purchase

$REVIEW.: The HP Mini 210 is a great netbook overall


It features a Intel GMA 3150 which is capable of streaming video over sites such as youtube, hulu, etc; it doesn't stream any type of HD that great, however

I was even able to play older games such as Deus Ex, Aliens vs

Predator and even Unreal Tournament just fine
If you can't afford to pay the extra $100 for the HP 311 which sports a Nvidia ION, this netbook will serve you well.The keyboard is 93% full size and is great to type on


I'm a computer science student and I was delightfully surprised to see how comfortable it was to program on this netbook

If you plan to do any type of creative writing or programming, this netbook is ideal for that.I admit, it's taking me awhile to get use to the slower execution speeds and limits of multitasking with a netbook, but this HP seems to be faster then other netbooks I've tried
As long as you aren't trying to perform more then 2-3 tasks at a time, all is well and speedy.My major grip is with the touchpad

The left and right buttons aren't independent of the touchpad itself; you can move the mouse if you move your finger within either click buttons


I like to keep my finger on the left button as a I navigate the touchpad with my other finger, but on this netbook it causes the pointer to jump around the screen
It's just going to take a bit to change my style, but I would have preferred two buttons that were separate from the actual touchpad.Battery is life is advertised at 4 hours, but I've seen around 3 thus far

As soon as a replacement 6-cell battery is released, I will be purchasing and that should satisfy my needs.4 out of 5 stars for this netbook due to the touchpad and inability to stream HD videos properly.

$review_text.: I'll keep this review short.  If you want a compact (non-bridge and non-DSLR) camera that takes *great* pictures, this is it.A semi-pro friend of mine recently showed me his new S95, his first compact digital camera, and called it the next best thing to his arsenal of digital SLRs and lenses. He showed me some indoor and outdoor shots and I was immediately hooked and ordered my own.  While the resolution is "only" 10MP (I've never been a pixel junkie myself), the picture quality rivals that of many consumer-grade DSLRs from just a few years ago.  It has full manual controls and feels lightweight and solidly built.  The 720p video mode is very good.  While the optical zoom is only 3.8x, I think the lens is of such high quality which explains the great picture quality, as well as high price.If you're fed up with disappoining picture quality from your digicam, or want a compact model that takes excellent pictures, the S95 is most likely the one you've been looking for.

Resistive screen touch is unpredictable -- it works, but it misses some gestures and can be hard to control.Screen looks nice enough. It is small but adequate, and you don't have the pocket size if it is made bigger.  Battery life is marginal, seemingly like all these things -- three hours tops.Worst thing is that it is criminally incompetent with subtitled movies.  In at least 2 out of 3 cases, it fails to play the .SRT text with an AVI movie.  It was plainly meant to display subtitles, because some will work.  But it fails a very great deal.  If it would do this one thing, I could give it a 3 stars, maybe even 4.

The only problem is that compared to the device she had been using earlier the audible &#34;ding&#34; meaning &#34;turn now&#34; alert comes in about a second or two too late leaving you sometimes stranded in the wrong lane. Can't find the setting that would allow this to be changed. You'd think that it wouldn't be too hard to program in code allowing for that to be set to the user's preference. The built-in free traffic info is nice, but a bit too slow to really be of much use.

$REVIEW.: I purchased a Klipsch G-17 music system a few months ago. I have had problems connecting it to my wireless network from the time I received it. After trying various workarounds and not finding any workable solution to the problem I was experiencing, I attempted to contact Klipsch product support for assistance. I called Klipsch product support three times. Each time I have not been able to reach a person, and as instructed left a message with my name and telephone number for a return call from Klipsch. To date I have not received any callback from anyone at Klipsch. I have written letters to the CEO of Klipsch, Paul Jacobs, and to Fred Klipsch as well, informing them of Klipsch's product support problems. I await a reply from them.Update: Shortly after sending letters to Klipsch CEO Paul Jacobs and Fred Klipsch, I received phone calls from two Klipsch support personnel, including product manager Gavin Reeg, as well as an email from Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs expressed his distress at hearing about the product support problem I was having. I believe Mr. Jacobs was sincere in his comments to me, and hopefully whatever problems Klipsch support has been having will be fixed. Additionally, Mr. Reeg has worked extensively to try to solve my problem. We hope to have this resolved within the next week or two, when I will be able to test possible solutions. While my initial troubles with Klipsch support should never have occurred, I find Klipsch's response to my letters to be admirable and more than I could have expected.Update: After some further debugging based on recommendations from Klipsch support I was able to determine the cause of my problem. It seems that the G-17 cannot properly handle certain special characters in a network SSID. Whether this is an Airplay limitation, or a G-17 firmware problem I do not know. In any case, once I modified my network SSID, the G-17 was able to connect without any further problem. For its size (small) the G-17 is an excellent sounding speaker system, and for it's current Amazon price ($399), it is also a good buy. I can recommend the product, with my only caveat being that I hope the support problem at Klipsch that I encountered has been addressed and remedied.

$review_text.: Before I bought myGarmin Forerunner 610 Touchscreen GPS Watch, this was one of watches I was considering.  Now that I've tried both, I'm glad I spent the extra money on the Garmin.Considering this is Nike's first GPS watch, it's not bad.  Of primary concern would be the accuracy.  Having already verified the accuracy of my Garmin, I took it out on several runs of 6-15 miles along different courses and tested it in parallel with the Garmin.  In every case except one, they were always within .05 miles of each other.  Most of the time the difference was .02 or less.  So far so good.Functionally it offers about as much as the Garmin FR60 I used to use.  Which is to say it has about the same features as most of the other ~$200 GPS watches - total time, distance, laps, average pace, etc.  No problems there either.Battery life estimates of about 8 hours seem accurate.The inclusion of the footpod is a nice bonus, but I hope to never need to use it.  The ability to use a Polar HRM is also a good feature.Syncing with the satellite was a bit of a problem.  Most of the time it takes 60+ seconds to sync.  The Garmin remembers your previous position so that if you start a run from the same location it acquires the satellite lock quickly.  The Nike always took a long time to acquire a signal no matter where I started from.While I like the look of the watch, I didn't like several design features.  Building the USB dongle into the band was a lousy idea.  It feels flimsy and is awkward to insert when uploading data or charging.  It also lacks the ability to do wireless data uploads.  Even my Garmin FR60 could do that.  Size-wise it's roughly the same overall size as the Garmin 610.  I don't know they decided to display the time with the hour above the minutes.  It's a weird quirk that doesn't work for me.  The menus are easy to navigate and are generally very readable.  However it would be nice to have customizable data screens.Finally you're stuck using the Nike website for viewing your uploaded data.  Personally I hate it.  It's slow and provides poor data feedback.As an entry-level GPS, it's a decent alternative to the comparable Garmin models, although I would still pick the Garmin 210 over it.  But it's a good performer if you don't mind the oddball design features.

This Tenergy 200 mAh battery is the first one that I've ever had that the positive terminal post snapped off on the very first use! And that was from taking it out of the charger!I can't review the battery any further. I can not put it in any device since it has no terminal.

$review_text.: Pros:The H70 has removed almost all of the warts and improved on the already good features of its predecessor, the H50.  It's easy to install on the motherboard.  It cools remarkably well, as well as the best air-cooled CPU heatsinks with less noise.Cons:It may not install or install easily in some cases not made by Corsair.  The included fans are loud at max.  Some air-cooled heatsinks can provide the same cooling for less.However, I would make sure about a couple of points before buying the H70:1. Make sure that the H70's radiator will fit inside your case.  Do this by searching the Net about other people who have installed it in the same case as the one you have or are contemplating about buying.  For example, Antec cases can be a pain in the neck.  It's doable in some Antec cases, but not in others.2. The fans that are included are loud at maximum.  I purchased separate fans that are quieter yet are just as effective as the included Corsair fans.3. Make sure your mobo cutout is large enough and properly positioned or else you will have to install the backplate before you install the mobo.4. Make sure you have a lot of air going into the case.  Otherwise, the H70 isn't going to do much better than the stock heatsink.

$review_text.: I bought a DLink 930 model first to enable me to view the house while at work. The 930 did a decent job with ample light, but fell short in low light conditions.  So I purchased the 932 to use at my doorway and the 930 in another location.  The 932 and 930 are comparable in situations with ample lighting (edge in clarity to the 932), but the 932 is much better - as expected - in low light situations. The low light viewing is pretty clear in black/white - I can easily distinguish all objects and pets.Setup was easy.  I had this camera operating on my wireless network within 5 minutes of powering it on. There is no need to use the DLink software to configure the camera. Simply attach the camera to your wired network and power it on, find the IP address that it pulled from your router/firewall/AP and then use your web browser to connect to it.  (As a side note, the 930 was also very easy to setup) The GUI is very straight-forward and simple to use.  Also, I you don't HAVE to use the DLink cloud or whatever to view the video from the camera.  You can use port-forwarding on your router/firewall to connect directly to the camera from the Internet.  This may not be feasible for everyone, but it is possible if you are so inclined.Pros:Pretty good video quality. Not crystal clear, but not fuzzy eitherDecent good night video (again good, not great)Easy setupSupports "N" wireless. Some of the cameras only support B/G wirelessPriced rightCons:I would like a little bit better video quality, but for $89 it is very acceptableSummary:If you are looking for a decent wireless camera that has night video capability, this is a very good option.

$REVIEW.: Hooked these up to test them and they worked on my Nikon D200. They do appear to be cheaply made, but at this price I'll just handle them carefully and purchase an extra. My only complaint is the dip switches. The instructions say to remove the clear protective cover and set the switches. I was trying to remove what I thought was tape, but the clear plastic dip switch housing came right off and the tiny dip switches flew everywhere. It turns out that I was able to put them back in and they worked without changing dip switches. I will just leave them as they are for my limited use!

$REVIEW.: Let's start with the basics:  You would expect any remote control to actually transmit something to your appliance/device when you press a button on the remote, wouldn't you?Well, this gizmo doesn't.  There is, in fact, a tiny little, cute little icon that lights up on the bottom right corner of the screen, when you press a button, confirming that the remote is transmitting.  Half the time it works, half the time it doesn't.  Try to key in a 3 digit channel, say, 321?  Well, you'll hit 3 - no reaction, hit it again, and again, and again, until finally your TV confirms on screen that you've hit "3" - then try to hit 2, same story, maybe it will work quickly enough for your TV to show you that you've hit "32" - and then try the last digit - no dice, until your TV switches to channel 32 when you wanted 321.  Or, will never get past "3" and switch you to channel 3 when you wanted 321.  Why on Earth would anyone pay money for a remote control that can't even reliably transmit when you press a button?  What's the matter, Logitech, for the price of this product, you couldn't find it in your hearts to put on a keypad that actually works?  And don't tell me it's dirty, it's been that way since I opened the package brand spanking new.Then there's the "Activity-based programming."  Not a bad idea, in fact, good idea.  No logic in the implementation.  Example:I want to watch a DVD.  For this, my TV and DVD players need to be on.  Fine, you can program that.  And it will go ahead and turn your DVD player on, and your TV OFF, because it was already on.  And it will turn your cable/satellite provider's box/DVR/PVR off, because it assumes that once you're done watching your DVD movie, you won't want to watch the news or something else.  Really, Logitech?  And what if my PVR is in the middle of recording a show, or is scheduled to record a show later?  Really, Logitech?  Really?  What part of this is the "logic" in "Logitech?"Then, there's the software.  They give you an application, or you can download one from their site, and it insists on logging you in to one of their sites before you can program your remote.  Really, Logitech?  Really?  Is this "for my convenience and protection" or for your ability to collect data about me?  I need to be in touch with the whole planet to program my own remote?There's plenty, plenty more that's wrong with this, and the saddest part is, no one else offers anything much better, that I've seen.Really, Amazon, you need to give us a way to rate zero starts for products like this.

$review_text.: Honestly, this is a 5 star hub.  The other reviews are correct.  The LEDs are bright and the power cord is short.  But, I actually wanted a short cable and the lights are welcome.  I mounted this on the back of my monitor along with my Raspberry Pi and external hard drive.  The light is used for ambient behind-monitor lighting and the shorter power cord just means less mess.For my situation, the light and the short cable were desired.  However, know that if your power port is more than 3 feet away, this cord will not be long enough.  Also, the LEDs are BRIGHT.  This could be a good or bad thing.  I'm sure you could open the unit and clip the LED to kill the light.  But, just know that the LEDs give off a nice bright blue light.

$REVIEW.: I installed a set of Comply foam tips on my MEElectronics M6 earphones, which I use mostly as in-ear monitors for playing drums.The Comply tips are awesome! Super comfortable, easy to insert in your ears, the earphones stay in place even during heavy drumming sessions. Like magic, these tips made my earphones sound better. Bass is full and accurate. The noise isolation is great as well, way better than the silicone tips that came with the phones.When a products exceeds my expectations, a great review is well deserved. Kudos, Comply. This is a killer product!

$REVIEW.: This has the be the best camera for the money currently on the market. For under $400 bucks "got mine used for $300.00" you get a enhanced point and shoot images with some control features only found is $1,000 DSLRs.  And this camera video functionality will beat almost any consumer video camera under $800.00 on the market. So you get the best of both worlds.All of the DLSR reviewer need to realize that this isn't a DSLR, and considering only the Body of a DSLR cost 2-3 time more then this camera they are not even in the same league Like comparing a Chevrolet Malibu to BMW. DSLR are for professionals "or those who want to pretend they are", while this camera is for the common man/women who wants great pictures and video to be viewed on a normal computer screen.Great Feautres:ZOOM is crazy. I call it Stalker zoom.  If you can see if with you naked eye, you can view it as if you where 2 feet away from it with the zoom.  I was even able to zoom to the surface of the Moon!!!FAST, the camera doesn't boot, it just start with almost no delay, and you can take pictures as fast as you can click the shoot button. If you use the continuous shooting mode (L) you can hold the shoot button and take 5-10 pictures in less then 1 second.The Program modes rocks, Night shoots, Face Priority, Dusk/Dawn etc.The LCD screen is clear, but the view find is even better.  Taking picture with the view finder maks taking pictures so must easier.the snap back zoom is a life saver, you can zoom all the way back "to get a over view" then zoom all the way back to where you were at with one click.HD is insane, super clear video for a cheap under $400 camera.  Video suck with you try to zoom all the way out, but come on, your zooming at 36X with shaky hands. I purchased a cheap Tripod from radio shack for $9.99 and my videos look profession quality.You can shoot pictures at night in the dark with no flash and they look like you took them in the day time "beside some black/white dot speckled through out"Things that suck:Batteries suck big time, having a second battery isn't an option it's a must. Under normal use the battery should last about 200 picture and about 1 hour of video. But if your the type that love to keep it on, and keep the LCD screen on that batteries will go fast. I notices that if i only use the LCD view finder batteries last a whole lot longer, but i purchased 2 extra batteries just in case. Today I used it for about 3 hour "LCD only" and took a bout 1 hundred shot and it still lasted, but if i would have kept the LCD on it def would have died.Auto focus is slow in low light when you are zooming.  Sometimes i just turn on manual focus and focus it my self.Auto focus in full zoom is so slow it will sometimes cause you to miss a shot If you planning on shooting fast moving object do yourself a favor "set the side control to manual focus, increase shutter speed and use continuous shooting &lt;-- i save this under "User Setting" this way you never have to wait till the camera finishes focusing to snap a shot.  But don't get it confused, no point and shoot camera on the market is better "i tried them all", fast moving action with quick focus is a $1,000 DSLR class feature.  &lt;-- this doesn't apply under normal focus below 10X, auto focus is almost instant.No external Charger: brought my own for $9.99, but it should have def come with it in the box. matter of fact 2 batteries and external charger should have been standard, but you can get 2 battery and charger for an extra $25.00.Useless button that could have been better used else where.  The continuous shooting mode didn't need it's on button, nor those the exposure, or disp option require separate buttons.  Those 3 button would have been better served by other more important features "ISO, 1 button press for manual vs auto focus, etc"But all in all, for the common user this is by far the best camera deal in years!!! High quality images, advance functions if you need them and full HD video in one package for under $400.  I $100 recommend "only with extra battery purchase"

The unit also has multiply choices on the lower information readout including altitude and current speed  limit in 'dashboards', has lifetime live traffic which is an absolute must have, lifetime maps give the unit longevity, point of interest will help you find it without an address, lane assist for left or right exits, the voice command feature allows you to keep your hands on the wheel, history with trip meter, expandable memory card slot (microSD) with 2.9 GB free out of 7.2 GB on board upon arrival, ecoRoute is another function you could add to the unit with the purchase of a cable attachment to your vehicles computer, Audible is another feature and comes with a couple books loaded as a demonstration of it's capability. The Bluetooth capability provides pairing to your Android smart phone and among other things can give you the ability to make and receive hands free calls.

$review_text.: I never heard of Transcend before, but while doing research for SD cards, I found their cards had the best specifications and prices.  The reviews were glowing as well.  Now I own a total of 8 Transcend cards, all Class 10, six of the 32 GB versions, and 2 of the 16 GB versions.  They have all worked without a hith in all my computers and cameras.  I've used the cards in:GoPro Hero HDGoPro Hero 2Nikon D40Nikon D3100Canon T3iCanon D10Canon D20One thing that I do which I think helps cut down problems is I always use a card reader to upload my files and once I do this, I ALWAYS format the card in the camera, never on the computer.  It doesn't matter if I take 2 photos or 200, I always do a clean format in the CAMERA after each download.  Having dones this for over 10 years, I find this gives me minimal problems with photo corruption or any sort of card issues.  I love these cards and will continue to buy them as long as they keep the performance and reliability high and price low.  Great cards!
$review_summary.: Very reliable, great performance, great price!

$REVIEW.: I initially used the KOSS Volume Control inline with headphones, in order to listen to the TV late at night, without disturbing others. We have a 5.1 speaker system, controlled by one speaker volume knob (no remote control). It's wired from the TV to a 1/8" Y/duplex plug; one line continues to the speakers, the other goes to the headphones. Turn the speakers down all the way, and you only hear it through the headphones. Ok so far.But, guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway, with the headphones plugged in, and you change the volume on the headphone using the KOSS Volume Control? The volume of the external speakers changes! Huh? How is that possible? It was odd at first, but if you lowered the KOSS unit's volume, the speaker's volume went up. Raise the KOSS volume, the speaker's volume went down. It's something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5.1 speakers. I had to add a label "Loud" and "Soft", mounted just the opposite of the Low-to-High volume legend near the control wheel, since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you'd think.So the KOSS Volume Control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well, provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers. Who knew?p.s. I like it so much, I'm buying another.

$REVIEW.: NOTE: Ive tried two of the same brand mounts from walmart. This one, and the one with the blue "sticky back" -- the one with the sticky back will not stick to an iphone with a case, also when rotated to landscape the phone falls off.PROS1. I see where this could be stuck to the windshield then the neck curved down to the dash to add extra stability if your using it for an iphone or without a case.2. Sticks very well to the glass, again, try to curve the neck down to the dash for added support.3. Holds an iPhone 4 really well if it has no case.CONS1. I'm not going to have to remove and replace my case on my iPhone each time I mount it. Being on the road as a computer tech I have to be able to add remove it fast. Leave your iPhone in it and I guarantee someone will play snatch and grab at one of your pit-stops.2. If you do decide to add/remove your case each time you dock it your gonna scratch up your phone and when your ready to re-sell it at your next upgrade you'll get far less because of the scratching. Always put some case, even a cheap one on your phone and a screen guard day 1 when you buy it, that can add $200 (for example) to the resale value when you trade out phones a couple years later.MY RECOMMENDATIONThe best recommendation I have found is getting an Otterbox defender case (no, I'm not big on "trends" in names and think they are way overpriced, but read on) and here on amazon they make a window mount that snaps an Otterbox case no and off very simply. Thus, you have a good sturdy mount, solid case and protection for your phone -- the only test is that I run a lot of bumpy dirt roads and will review that product in the appropriate section. I'm still searching for a dash mount that does this. A window mount might be great if you have a mercedes and drive the interstate, but, I have a truck and drive through a lot of back-wood bumpy roads and the last thing I need is a $500+ phone falling off and busting (or flying out the window on a sharp turn).I really hope this review helps save you some frustration. Any comments or suggestions regarding my statements are welcome.thank you.

$REVIEW.: This thing is solid and works flawlessly.  There are no negative surprises in terms of technical functionality.Many of the reviews here are talking about the comfort of the grip - having fairly large hands (I am a 6'4" male) I find this grip very comfortable and well designed, but I understand why some of the other reviewers think it is too bulky to grip easily. Someone with medium or small hands may want to visit the local camera store and just try holding it to see... don't think there is anything else I can say that will help you figure it out.I had a generic battery grip on my last camera (Rebel xti), and while happy to have saved the money, admit the shutter button was a little loose feeling... not to mention the plastic would bend with a large 70-200 lens attached.  That said, it was fully functional and was happy to have saved $100 buying generic.  As of this writing (spring 2009) there isn't a generic available for the 5dmkII, but I suggest checking and considering generic if it will save you $ from the high Canon price tag.

$REVIEW.: Kensington makes great products - hands down. I love their stuff.. I am using their trackball right now and have one at work. This case however... well it's over kill for me. I like a small, thin light case for my ipad. This one fits the new ipad air (5th gen) but (imho) it takes the new thin ipad and makes it too bulky. This case, tho well made, has inserts for credits cards or business cards and other such items. That's a nice idea - but for me it's overkill. Also, it covers the front of the ipad's bezel which also is a no go for me.But... to each his own. I gave it 4 stars as it's a very well made case, seems solid and should last a long time.

$review_text.: These give a very sharp, bright image, with excellent color fidelity.  Actually, I was blown away by the image, considering the price.  The quality of the materials and the workmanship appear and feel excellent.  The primary focus ring is nice and snug, as is the right ocular focus ring and the swivel action pivot...meaning they will not easily bump out of adjustment.  The image does tend to blur a bit at the extreme edges of the field of view, and the red-blue refraction issue is apparent there as well.  However, in the center (broadly, and anywhere a typical person is likely to look in the field of view), the image is incredible.  The "edge" effect is therefore really not an issue.  If you demand a perfect image out to the edge, you can always spend ten times the price on a different pair of binoculars.  With these, however, I can easily see a couple of dozen craters on the moon and I am sure they will satisfy most birders, whale watchers, etc.  That said, I did not like the strap very much.  By comparison, it is cheap.  I guess Nikon expects you to probably buy a better one anyway and they decided instead to put their quality into the binoculars.  (I received these as an item off of my Amazon wish list.)

$review_text.: I was looking for an inexpensive iPad case with a handle. Let's face it, the amazing sleek design of the iPad makes it a pain to carry around the house if you have more than one other item to carry. You basically have to commit one hand and arm to the iPad. All of my experience tells me that if you try to carry it under your arm too often, you will, sooner or later, be writing about how you broke your iPad when it slipped out from under your arm, bounced down the back porch stairs, and crashed onto the concrete patio.So I was just looking for an easier, safer way to carry the iPad around. The  PixelShield Hard Carry Sleeve would be perfect except that designers assumed you would not use any other kind of protection, say a Griffin FlexGrip for iPad. Although it can be done, it is difficult to get an iPad with a skin-type case even as thin as theFlexGrip into the sleeve. It would work for me if it were just maybe an eighth of an inch wider or made from a fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. As it is, I'll keep using it, hoping it will stretch out a little over time.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this for a cheap price on Amazon (A lot cheaper then on Dell).  They snap on to the bottom of my Dell monitor (only certain monitor models) and are powered from the monitor (again, only certain monitor models), so no extra wire/power supply needed (speakers do need to be plugged into the computer via the normal speaker connection, they are not HDMI sound connected).  With this sound bar you do not have an extra set of speaker boxes to make room for on your desk.  There is a volume control on the right hand side, so adjusting the sound, or turning it off is easier then going into the sound config on a computer.  There are two head phone jacks on the left had side (I have not used them), so that would making connecting headphones very easy.  There is a white vertical light in the middle of the sound bar when you have it on.  Not really annoying, but not sure why they have it there.  I guess it lets you know if you have turned off the sound bar.

$REVIEW.: I bought this radio as a "companion" while doing over our kitchen.  I came to like it very much and it's now staying on the counter.  Sure, it's not a high-end stereo system, but it has a surprisingly nice sound for background music, morning news, or the occasional talk show.  Easily taken out on the back deck to listen to the ball game.  A nickle short of the free shipping caused me to purchase this ICF-38 and the S10MK2 in the "Frequently Bought Together" package.  I'm quite pleased that I have both. The smaller one will go on jobs with me where there is no electricity.  Both could go, but this one stays on the counter.  I would like a button to press to see the time illuminated at night (or even see the time at all), but that's a small consideration.  Energizer 8X lithium batteries allow either of these radios to keep playing for a very extended period of time.  Not a concert hall sound, but it's not made (or priced) for that.  Again, surprisingly good sound for something in this price range.  I like the package mentioned above and I'm glad I bought the duo.  I don't see how you could go wrong for the money spent.  One of the few times when I think I actually got more than I paid for._______________________Fourteen months since the above post.  I just wanted to mention that I'm still very pleased with this radio.  I did get a Boston Acoustics semi-portable radio for the counter in the kitchen. That's one excellent radio (the Boston Acoustics).  Now the Sony ICF-38 spends more time on the deck for ballgames, music stations and evening news.  I would like to add two thoughts to the original post.  I'm appreciating the little, red tone indicator to show that you have the station tuned in as precisely as you can get it.  The S10MK2 has the same feature.  Probably a Sony thing. Secondly, the ICF-38 has a little switch for "Hi" or "Low" tone.  This does make a difference if you're listening to music or talk - not a huge difference, but enough to notice.  The price, here on Amazon, has gone up five dollars since I purchased this radio in April of '09.  I recently had the occasion to listen to a friend's portable.  It sounded like the broadcast was from inside an empty can.  Couldn't compare with the pleasing sound of this ICF-38.  Having enjoyed the quality and simplicity of this unit, I would get it again.
$SUMMARY.: Sony quality - again

$review_text.: I wanted a nice but relatively inexpensive digital camera that used AA batteries and SD cards
 AA batteries as they're easy to buy and replace and SD cards as I have a bunch of them already
 It takes good pictures, up to 4&#34;x6&#34; I'd say
 Flash seems basic (good for about 15 feet indoors depending on existing lighting)

 Battery life has been OK so far, no worse than any other AA based digital camera


 I like that I can change some of the settings (i.e
resolution) so the JPEGs aren't so big


 The kids were filling the digital cards quickly until I rolled back some of the settings
 It's been working fine.

$REVIEW.: I have a few smaller bags, each serving a purpose.The past year or so I have been carrying three bags on a small ladder kart to haul my gear around at weddings, baptisms, etc.I felt like I would either forget which pouch had items in it or that it looked unprofessional to carry a mishmosh of bags.I was thinking of going with Pelican hard cases, or even Tamrac as I prefer their bags over Lowepro.I wish this bag had larger wheels because it seems as though the bag would wear down if dragged at the wrong angle.Apparently, Lowepro thought of this too because the bottom has hard plastic to prevent any material from ripping.The wheels are removable which is a big improvement over bags they made in the past..  There aren't an abundance of pockets which I was shocked with, but in thinking about it it's less stuff to lose (I cannot tell you how many lens pens I have).These companies always supply tons of dividers which I always end up ripping out.  I am sure that many of us can make our own bags with extra dividers we have laying around!The zippers on the bag are rugged and I have no doubt they will stand the test of time.A lot of thought went into this bag from the kickstand and tripod mounts I will hardly utilize to the handles on three sides of the bag for easy lifting (if you discount the weight).Make no mistake about it, this bag is HEAVY and is NOT an everyday bag.  However, for weddings, etc. I highly recommend it.My gear for reference:(2) Olympus E3's with battery Grips(2) FL50 flash units14-45mm14-54mm50mm macro50-200mm35-100mmLight meterHyperdriveQuantum power pack(2) lacrosse AA chargersSony mini DV camcorder43" 5-1 reflectorLaptopCables, cables and more cables(2)flash brackets from Demb.Cleaning pens, clothes, etc.

Basically, you get grey on black.I'm using mine for math


The big plus over scratch paper is no trash to dispose of
The BIG minus is you can't erase small mistakes

So let's say you write a 4 that is difficult to read


All you can do is scribble over it and write a new 4.So you might have to change the way you do things slightly

You can do it, but it is a pain.In general, though, it is charming and convenient

The stylus is nice but easy to lose

$REVIEW.: This is the sharpest fixed lens that I own now. For the price, it holds it's own against the 1.4. Keep in mind that you get the best results when you lower the aperture a couple of steps. It also makes it easier to get the soft DOF effect found on many professional portraits. One additional advantage is that the distortion found on shorter lenses is eliminated when taking portraits. Your shots on a DX should be equivalent to a 120mm lens.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to use this keyboard for not only typing documents but also for a little gaming here and there. But this keyboard is... basically a crappy keyboard with lights. The feel of the buttons are very strange; sort of like a laptop keyboard without the clicking sound. When you are typing, it feels as if the keys are getting stuck even though they're not and the responsiveness of the keys are pretty low so I end up typing really loudly because I'm trying to press hard to get the keys to work 100% (but that doesn't always work). While gaming, because this keyboard doesn't have the normal clicking of a regular keyboard, it feels very strange when you're walking around in the game. And in the pictures for the product, the keys look very big, bigger than a standard keyboard. IT'S A LIE. These keys are literally the exact same size as a normal keyboard, it's just that it creates the illusion that they're bigger. The colors for the lighting of the keyboard isn't as vibrant as I wanted them to be. It'd be like if you wanted to draw with highlighter on your keys, that would be around the same dull illumination you're getting. But, if you had the lights off in your room and the keyboard lights were on, then they look pretty sick. But in conclusion, get something else. The only decent thing about this keyboard are the lights.

$review_text.: I was debating between buying the Microsoft mobile mouse 8000 and the presenter mouse 8000. I wanted a mouse that was cheap, compatible with Vista (yes, I still have Vista and I refuse to switch over to Win7 which is basically Vista that is compatible) and I also wanted a mouse that could be charged so that I did not have to worry about replacing batteries. I decided to go with the mobile mouse, which I bought elsewhere for less than amazon is selling it for, instead of the much pricier but fancier presenter mouse. Now that I have received the mouse and have started to use it, I regret my decision. The mouse is small and it also has an odd shape which makes it uncomfortable to use. Also the dongle is huge! It is actually larger than my 32GB Kingston USB flash drive. On the plus side, it does function and is compatible with Vista and I do not have to worry about charging the mouse. I have also noticed that I can use it on a table without a mouse pad. I have no idea how long the battery lasts since I have only used the mouse for 1 day. Overall, I think that if the mouse had a similar shape and size to the microsoft 7000 mouse which I also have, I would give the mobile mouse 5 stars.

$review_text.: If you're looking at a Sigma DP2 (or any of the other variants) you surely know what you're looking for. Let me just say that this is all you expect it to be in regards to image quality, quirkiness and slow performance.If, however, you've stumbled upon this camera and are unsure about what makes it special, let me briefly introduce you to it: Sigma cameras have Foveon sensors that work different to anything else in the market. Most sensors use a red-green-blue array of pixels (50% green, 25% blue, 25% red), where each image really captures only about a third of the photographic information: light comes into the sensor, depending of its wavelenght it gets picked up by either the red, green or blue pixel, and that's the only color information you'll have. This is how 99% of the cameras work today and years of engineering have made this approach a safe bet that works pretty well. Sigma is different. Their Foveon sensors are not structured in a red-green-blue pixel array, instead there are three layers of pixels: a ful layer of green, another one of blue, and another one of red pixels. This allows each pixel to record absolutely complete light information per each pixel, since the light will penetrate all three layers of color per image captured. In comparison, the Bayer sensor only captures about a third of information and &#34;wings it&#34; with the missing 2/3 by guessing what the correct color information should be (this is called interpolation).On paper, it sounds like Sigma's sensors should be much better than anything else, since there's no interpolation through which to invent/guess colors that were never captured as it happens in Bayer sensors. Right? Not so easy. There's 2 problems:1) The 3 layer stack structure of Foveon sensors means that light gathering works different than the single layer in a Bayer sensor, hence it's quite easy to get amazing greens (top layer) but reds tend to suffer a little bit (lower layer). By no means to Sigma cameras give you bad image quality, but it's sometimes harder to get their images to where you want them to be, you need to know what you're doing. Another disadvantage that even to date hasn't been fixed, is the fact that by not having 1 layer perfectly exposed to light and instead having 3 layers where 2 are further from the light than the top layer, sensitivity noise is a problem for Sigma cameras from ISO400 and above, there's no way to get around this technologically (for now). The 3 layer structure also has a marketing quirk: when a Bayer camera mentions it has 15MP, you should know these are not real 15 megapixels because of what I just explained: the 15mp spatial resolution is divided roughly by 3, so there's about 8mp green, 2.5mp blue and 2.5mp red. Still, due to the checkerboard pattern, the image you get will be, spatially speaking, 15mp large (but as you now know, those aren't really 15MP, it's more around 2/3 that amount since the other third of the image is basically made up and not real detail). Since Foveon sensors are 3 layers stacked, it's effectively a 5mp green, 5mp blue and 5mp red configuration, which means that although the image has 15mp of information, spatially, the image only stretches to 5mp.2) As I said earlier, Bayer sensors have received most of the market's attention so far and have evolved greatly. Sigma is the only player to produce 3-layered sensors, and thus their progress has been much slower. This means that Sigma cameras tend to have many less features and technological advances than their Bayer counterparts, since Sigma isn't big enough to compete with Sony or Canon. However, make no mistake: 3 layered sensors are the future, and the fact that both Canon and most importantly Sony are getting these kinds of sensors ready to be marketed in the next few years proves it.So, should you buy a Sigma camera? It depends. If you want amazing crisp and clean image quality at low ISO values, if you don't need to take really fast pictures (these cameras are kind of slow) and you can put up with the quirks and uncomfortability of these cameras, then by all means BUY these cameras. You'll get amazing pictures that you would only get with much more expensive Bayer sensor cameras at a fraction of the price, but these cameras will make you WORK to get those images. These are not point and shoots, you need to know what you're doing with regards to ISO, aperture, etc. Personally, I bought both a DP2 and a DP1 and I'm delighted with both of them. While for all-around performance/quality my NEX 5N is untouchable, when I want something even smaller that takes great quality pictures I never hesitate to take the Sigmas with me. Take that for what it's worth.

$REVIEW.: It is a very good camera for the price BUT I would not buy it again for some reasons:1


The quality of the lens is not very good, there is a lot of chromatic aberration whenever you use the optical zoom.2


As happened with another Lumix I had (FZ30), there is a lot of noise whenever you use an ISO higher than 100
I compared images taken with this camera and a Canon Powershot A710is (under the same circumstances and similar settings) and when you amplify the image in your monitor at the point that you can see the pixels, there is a lot more noise on the images taken with the Lumix.Other than that, the video is very nice, and the optical zoom is simply unbelievable.

I recharge it every day, take the cable with me, and wanted to be able to attach it every evening at my desk.Also, I like having the cables organized in one place

I'm going to label them


As for the little blue light, I like it.I'm thinking of buying a second one

It looks like there's no end to usb devices and it's more convenient for me to leave the cables in and then simply attach the device when needed

In my case I have a blackberry 9900 phone and could connect via browser easily.- The card has a switch that let's you turn off or on manually it's wifi hotspot feature. This enables you to turn off the wifi signal of the card when you're not using it.

$review_text.: I purchased this MI-008 Tower Black P4 Chassis with 250W Itx Psu+sata Power Supply back in April of 2012 and thought it would be a good idea to write a review.I installed a brand new MSI E350IA-E45 as well as a Gigabyte Low Profile 6450 1GB Video Card.  I also installed a Samsung DVD burner, two sticks of OCZ 2GB RAM, and a 60GB OCZ Agility SSD.Everything has worked well.  I was a little uneasy about the lack of air flow in this small ITX form factor computer case....so guess what I did?  I modified it!Yep, I installed one 80mm fan on the inside of one of the case sides so we would have an increase in air flow, thereby decreasing the temperatures of every component inside the case.It was very easy to modify.  I simply drilled 4 holes in side of the case were you see those vent holes [fan wouldn't be able to do its job without the vent holes].I used an Antec 80mm Tri-Cool fan with the 3 speed switch.  I left the switch on high because my dad is hard of hearing and he didn't even know I installed an extra fan in this rig.How does everything work?  Well, no complaints from my dad at all.  He leaves this rig on 24/7 and uses it every day for stock market stuff.Would I purchase this case again?  Well....First, I would choose a CPU/MoBo that had more juice to it [I know, this has nothing whatsoever to do with this computer case I am reviewing].Second, [and I believe this is important], I would definitely install two fans in the case for a much greater air flow.How would I configure such a set up?  Real simple and real easy:Install an 80mm fan inside the case, pulling air out the side vent, and install an 80mm fan pushing air in from the other side vent.These two simple modifications will decrease the case temperatures as much as 10-15 degrees and that for me, is extremely important.Remember, the greater the air flow, the lower the temperatures, the greater the longevity of the computer components inside this tiny little computer case.I wish I could add a video review, but my dad lives two hours away, so I no longer have the computer case here in front of me.I will visit my dad next week for Thanksgiving, and I will do my best to do a video review and show the extra fans I installed, as well as how to do it right.Happy Thanksgiving everyone and have a wonderful rest of 2012!It's me,Soar

$review_text.: The very first &#34;sophisticated&#34; camera I owned was an ancient Exakta with a wonderful 58mm Zeiss Biotar lens


These days, my Nikons often wear my 60mm macro as my &#34;normal&#34; lens - while not as fast as the 50 1.4 I also own, it's quite sharp, focuses close and I find the perspective you get with the extra focal length more to my taste.When Nikon introduced the &#34;modern&#34; 58 f/1.4, I couldn't wait to try it, and so far I'm very impressed with the results.I like this lens a lot on the new Nikon Df, but it gives me stellar results on my D4 and my D800E as well...indeed, the D800E's 36MP sensor, this seems to be about the highest resolution lens I have yet seen


Where lesser lenses tend to be outperformed by the sensor, the 58 1..4 keeps up
Do a little &#34;pixel peeping&#34; and you still see impressive detail, even in those 36MP raw files.I also like the color, contrast and overall &#34;pop&#34; you get with this lens


I've used some of the best that Zeiss, Leica and so forth make, including medium format, and I have to say that the new 58 is at least as good as the rest

You get artistic, pleasant and saturated colors with lots of contrast and that &#34;pop&#34; you expect from pro quality lenses.Of course, the mechanicals - focus speed, construction quality and so forth - are all topnotch, as you'd expect in a lens at this price
For me, focus was dead-on with no adjustments necessary

About the only complaint I might offer is that this lens, while truly excellent from f/2 onwards, is only &#34;good&#34; wide open

Side by side against both the Nikon and Zeiss 50 1.4 lenses, it's somewhat better at 1.4, heading towards much better by 5.6.I'm not sure I buy the idea that it can replace a 50 and 85...the latest 85 1.4 is a marvel of modern optics capable of images unique to its design
But to me that's not really the point...the point is that the 58 1.4 is generally going to be about the best image quality you can get in a normal-range lens, period.Definitely worth a look, especially for the top-end Nikon cameras.

Due to the sensor configuration in the hot shoe, you can either pop-up the flash then install the diffuser, or you can slice a little plastic off one side of the foot so it does not trip the sensor in the shoe.  In other words, it's not made for this camera, but you can get to work without too much trouble.

$review_text.: I purchased these headphones when I realized that the smallest size ear buds available for my daughters Sony walkmans were too big to stay in their ears.  While they do fit my daughter they have one major problem.  The claim that, "High impedance allows for low volume headphones", is really silly... because what it should say is "High impedance does not allow reasonable volume."Yes your child will never suffer any hearing loss if they use these earphones, but then they will also never hear the music or video they are watching when they use them.  The only option I have found to work around these poor headphones is to use special software to boost the sound in videos and music that is going to be downloaded to their little walkmans.The true irony of all this is the Sony Walkmans they have include a function to limit sound to about 1/3 of full volume to protect kids ears... No need for that function is your kids use these head phones.  When you have that function turned on and use the head phones you can't hear anything.Sadly I couldn't recommend these headphones to anyone for anything.  They are more trouble than they are worth.  Fortunately for one daughter I have a pair of Sennheiser px300 headphones that are small enough for a child... unfortunately I will need to buy another pair for the other daughter... these Sony will be sold our next garage sale or thrown away.

Also supplied is a 15W power adapter - plug that into the wall and then plug the 7 Port hub into that and presto! You have multiple ports with varying USB positions and a separate button for each port with an LED indicator so that you are using only the ports needed, protecting the others


There is surge protection and full backward compatibility with USB 2.0 / 1.1.This device will find many applications in your home or office and it is especially good for traveling

$review_text.: The included documentation made no mention of the fact that Android users will need to install an app to get a device of this type to function. That information is buried in a forum post at the manufacturer's web site and was mentioned nowhere in the user guide or setup guide that I could find.The mini USB port on the device had one of those flimsy rubber covers that broke on the first day. Since I always have a USB cable plugged into it, this doesn't matter to me, but might matter to someone else.Of course, people do not buy this type of device for the mini USB port cover, they buy it for the GPS features, and in that regard this device is stellar. It gets a satellite lock stupidly fast, and the accuracy is as good or better than any dedicated GPS unit I've used, which is of course far better than the accuracy I'm used to dealing with in my phone.Speaking of which, the first bluetooth GPS app I installed on my Samsung Vibrant worked, but only for a few minutes at a time, after which it promptly lost all location information. This issue was not resolved until I installed a different bluetooth GPS app ("Bluetooth GPS Provider" by mobile-j.de). This new app is not entirely problem free (if I shut down a GPS-using app such as Google Navigate then fire it up again, the bluetooth GPS app can have trouble reconnecting to the GlobalSat BT-368i), but that could be a problem with my phone rather than with the app. The bottom line is: if you are using an Android phone or tablet, you may have to try more than one app before you get this device working properly.For maximum functionality, you'll want to position this device as far forward on your dashboard as possible so that less of your roof is between it and the satellites above. You'll have to get creative to keep it from sliding around, though. The USB cable helps in this regard somewhat.

$REVIEW.: My biggest complaint about the device is that it advertises Hulu coming soon and according to other reviews it has been saying the same things for over 6 months and maybe a lot longer.The WiFi on it is very poor likely due to the design and no place to put an antenna
 I use an Asus dual-band (G+N) router operating on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz


 So for comparison I placed the device where I wanted to use it (about 50ft

and 1 floor away from the router) and found that the signal strength was showing in &#34;red&#34; and was very poor
 Would play YouTube videos with pauses about every 3-6 sec


 I placed my iPod Touch in the same location and had full signal and was playing the same videos with no delays
 I moved the player to an open area and still got the weak signal so my next step is to connect it directly to ethernet which will likely resolve this issue
 I really wanted it to work wirelessly though.Bootup is a bit slow from a cold-boot state so I just leave it on most of the time with the screensaver options turned on.It advertises &#34;Apps&#34; which to me means you can download and install some application for use on the device


 There is a main Home Screen with App-like-icons to select as well as buttons for specific apps on the remote

 There is not any way to add something to this Home Screen
 You need to go into their apps section and browse the categories to find what you are looking to use then run it from there

 This is something they need to address with a firmware/OS update.Updating the device is easy as the first time I turned it on it said there was an update for the device so I installed it


Device is very stable and does not crash with these so-called-apps and I really like the app buttons on the remote although it really should be something changeable in the future.

$REVIEW.: So many of our family's vacations are at beaches, lakes, water-parks, or hikes and bringing along the sensitive digital camera has always been a problem. If I carried it then I could not get in water and I spent more time worrying whether the sand would damage it than taking pics of my family. I lost a camera on a Disney Park fun ride when water suddenly splashed into the ride and we were miserable for losing all our pics. With this camera you can drop it in water and not worry about your pics unless you lose the camera (happened to me another time when I fell overboard and dropped a camera in the open sea). I have other cameras that I have been too lazy to review but I am excited about this one so I sat down to write this review.This is like a regular Canon Camera with all the features and the added waterproof feature. It can be compared to the new SD780 IS which sells for fifty bucks less. The features are similar, except that this one is waterproof and bulkier and does not have a viewfinder (not that you can see much through a fogged up viewfinder in humid conditions).Some great features:- Good looking waterproof camera, "cuteness" is very important, I disliked those clear cases that you have to screw on your camera and as one reviewer reported they can still get fogged up- Rainproof/Waterproof up to 33 ft, good for most pools or waterparks- Freeze proof lens up to 14 deg F- SMART Auto mode that detects the right scene mode for each shot (works great)- Digic 4 processor, auto shots are nicer than some older Canon cameras, optical image stabilization and motion detection to prevent blurring of images- 2.5 inch extra bright LCD that's covered by a protective surface to prevent scratches and looks good in bright sun- 3X optical and 12X digital zoom- Face detection- "Blink" detection - the camera gives a blink warning if someone's eyes are closed in the picture- Contrast correction - Can be set while taking picture or even afterward to correct darker areas- Continuous shooting lets you capture the perfect water shot- Scene modes - The auto mode does a good job of sensing the conditions but if you want to set a mode you get the choice of - Night exposure, Panorama (stitch together shots in one), programmable mode, portrait, sunset, beach, fireworks, aquarium, underwater, snow, indoor, kids and pets, foliage, long shutter, color accent (keep only one color in a pic, so the water and jeans will be blue while the people black and white) and color swap (change one color to another, swap the color of your boat from beige to red).Negatives:- Slightly bulkier than your typical Canon SD, it's built for water, beach and rugged use, and it's rounder shape with no hard edges can take a fall or two- No threads for filters- No RAW mode- No lens cap but the glass shield is scratchproofThe back panel is pretty intuitive and you probably won't need the manual to figure it out. The buttons have been designed for waterproof operations and the zoom in and out is done through buttons on the back of the camera rather than with the shutter button lever like with other Canon cameras. The photo and video mode is toggled through a round button next to the shutter button.The best thing about this camera? You can give it to your 6 year old to take underwater pics and not worry about it, how many other "real" cameras can you do that with?! Now I can float down that lazy river at the water park with my family and take some nice shots rather than running along the edge trying to capture the perfect moment. And the best thing is that this camera works just as well on land. It's the perfect no-nonsense take along everywhere (really every where!) vacation camera.
$review_summary.: Finally, a "full service" waterproof camera for all those fun-filled vacations, let the kids go crazy!

$review_text.: This is a great speaker! I have many bluetooth speakers around the house for my devices and this has quickly become my favorite. The sound is incredible and the battery life outstanding. I'm getting about 8 hours of play each time at high volume. The device pairs flawlessly with my Apple devices and maintains a decent distance range. I can get a couple of rooms away before the signal cuts out.The bass sounds really more dynamic than I would expect from a portable speaker and I love it.

$review_text.: I'm generally of the opinion that the word &#34;classic&#34; gets thrown around too often in the world of headphones, but I have to say, for as old and storied as the Sennheiser HD600's are, they truly embody the title in every way possible. As far as &#34;mid-fi&#34; headphones go, I don't look to any other can out there, and to tell the truth they're actually my most used pair of headphones simply because the sound signature is so appealing and easy to listen to and appreciate.Sound:Obviously this is the most important aspect of headphones past a certain price point, and as I said, the HD600's don't disappoint in any discernible way. Sure, you're going to get better clarity and imaging as you go up in price, but for what they are, the HD600's have a truly outstanding sound signature.Highs are dark to the point that some would say they suffer from the infamous &#34;Sennheiser veil,&#34; but that term honestly means less and less to me everyday I use these. The highs are about as articulate and detailed as you're going to get at this price point, only they're not &#34;up front&#34; like you hear from the likes of Beyerdynamics, so there are never any bursts of shrillness from the likes of cymbals and hi-hats. For the longest time, the promise of &#34;darkness&#34; from these cans scared me away, but I have to say, it's hard to listen to brighter headphones after hearing these. It's all of the detail without any of the bite.Mids are perhaps slightly overextended, especially on the higher end of the mid-range spectrum, but not to the point of sounding unnatural. Just to the point of becoming a preferential option when considering different headphones. Overdriven guitars sound especially fantastic. As a testament to their greatness, I actually disliked the Black Keys until I heard &#34;Gold on the Ceiling&#34; through these.Lows are in keeping with the &#34;neutral&#34; sound of the HD600's. They never overpower anything, but they're there when they're supposed to be, and focused and tight to boot. Considering their open design, I have no complaints with the lows whatsoever, especially coming off more bass-anemic cans like the AKG Q701's. Obviously they are not basshead cans, but they still deliver what they need to.The soundstage is wonderful as well. It's not as wide as the Q701's (though to be fair, that's the widest I've ever heard), but it's natural, airy and articulate enough to create a very pleasant stage overall.Also, it's probably obvious if you're looking to spend this much on headphones, but a good headphone amp REALLY brings these alive. They are actually surprisingly easy to drive, but a good amp and DAC really makeComfort:No need to spend too much time here. These are Sennheiser headphones. They're most likely going to be some of the most comfortable headphones you ever put on your head. Though I will say that these in particular need a little &#34;bend-in&#34; time to really get comfy. Everything is padded very well, but the clamping force right out of the box is slightly too strong, but thankfully becomes a non-issue after ten or so hours of use.Build Quality/Features:&#34;Features&#34; isn't really a strong suit of most Sennheiser headphones (not that that's a particularly bad thing), so I'll just say feature-wise, they terminate in a 3.5mm plug and come with a 1/4&#34; adapter that fits nicely over the 3.5mm. That's about it, honestly.The build quality is great, though they are a bit more plastic-y than I would like. Other than that, I have no complaints here either. The velour pads are affixed nicely to the cups, the aluminum lining in the headband seems very sturdy, and even the plastic itself feels at least high quality and hearty. Also, it's worth noting that the binding method on the headband is totally different from Sennheiser's lesser HD models, so that infamous &#34;headband cracking&#34; you seen occasionally on the 598's, 595's and 555's is non-existent in these.Conclusion:I can't recommend these enough. They will most likely be an outstanding step up from whatever you're upgrading from. Some of my favorite headphones ever.
$review_summary.: These are great...GREAT headphones.

$REVIEW.: Well, I'm coming to this mini speaker from an old RCA SP10 Portable Speaker, which is a seven-dollar-terrible-thing.  So, the X-boom Mini is actually an upgrade for me, despite the fact that it's still a rather inexpensive speaker.  I got sick of the poor sound quality of the RCA SP10, and went off to research slightly better quality mini speakers, which is when I discovered the X-boom mini.  Anyway, since my previous speaker is extremely low-end (seriously, the only way I could've gotten one cheaper is if I'd bought one at Dollar Tree), the X-boom shouldn't have too hard of a time impressing me.  So, let's find out how it did...Let's start off with the most important aspect - the sound quality.  I'm no sound engineer or anything (far from it), but I'll give my best opinions.  It is indeed better than my old crappy speaker (even I can tell that), and I'm rather impressed.  I tested it with a variety of songs, and some videos with only talking in them (Dr. Ashen on youtube!  Woo!).  First I tried some rather bass-heavy songs (a Heavy Bass Dubstep Mix on youtube), and it was pretty good.  I could literally feel the vibrations on the table at full volume!  The bass of course isn't going to be the same as you'd get from a huge speaker, but for it's size, it's not too bad.  Next I tried some nice screechy metal ('Funeral in Carpathia' by Cradle of Filth).  The speaker managed to convey all the beauty of the song, and I can happily report that the speakers didn't crackle or pop at all - even during the highest-pitched shrieks!  After that I tried some opera to get even more of those high notes ('Lucia di Lammermoor' - the Vitas version) and it sounded absolutely lovely (also no popping or crackling)!  Then I tried some classical music for a softer piece (Clair de Lune - Claude Debussy).  I'm pleased to say that even at high volume I didn't hear any hissing during the quiet parts.  Lastly I tried some basic pop music ('Out Alive' and 'Sleazy' by Kesha).  Unsurprisingly, it did well with that too.I'm pretty darn pleased with the basic sound quality, so let's talk about some other aspects related to audio.  The volume is surprisingly loud, and it effectively boosts the volume output of other devices (it's certainly able to play videos on my computer louder than they normally sound through my monitor's built-in speakers).  This is an important point because one of the main reasons I needed a tiny speaker was to boost the low volume on my professor's barely-audible low-quality lecture videos.  I noticed that at even at max volume, the sound quality of the speaker barely distorts at all, so this should help me on those lecture videos.  Other than volume, there's one more thing to consider: the whole open vs. closed thing.  I've found that 99% of the time, everything sounds better if the unit is open.  I got fuller, better sounds that way.  This was certainly true for all the music I tested.  However, there is one circumstance I found where it's better to leave the unit closed.  If you are listening to a low quality recording of someone speaking (like a lecture, ahem) where there's a lot of fuzziness/static noise in the video, it helps to close the speaker.  I've noticed that doing so helps cut out some of that white noise and make the voice a bit more audible.Now let's talk about the physical characteristics of the speaker.  I ordered the green one (just because it looked like a fun color) and I can say that the online pics are true to color and appearance.  When I saw the pics I actually thought there might me a light on top of the speaker (yes, I'm an idiot sometimes) but it's just a shiny reflective silver thing on top of the speaker itself (from the pics, it looks like the black one might actually have a red-colored top).  I like the ridges on the speaker's body because they help to make gripping it easy, whereas if it were perfectly smooth it might be hard to keep a hold of a small slippery round thing.  The function where it pops open is easy to use and figure out (just twist slightly to the right).  The &#34;accordion&#34; thing is fairly stiff, so you will have to apply a little bit of force to close it, but just be gentle with it to avoid damage.  On the bright side, this means it'll never collapse while open.  Size-wise, it measures about 2 inches in diameter and 3 inches tall open (2 inches while closed).  Amusingly, it's about a third the size of my old speaker (which is shaped like a big rectangular bar thing) yet sounds much better.I like the fact that it has it's own volume slider (my old speaker didn't have one and was purely dependent on the volume from the original source file).  I also like the built-in audio jack cable.  It's attached directly and recessed into the bottom of the speaker.  This was a major selling point for me because I really hated how my old speaker didn't have one of these, so I was forced to awkwardly attach the needed cables to it with rubber bands during storage.  The cord is rather short (measuring only 4 inches), but it gets the job done.  Plus, if you need to use it farther away from its source, it also has a separate audio jack input so you can use whatever male/male audio cable you have to attach it to whatever you want.  I also noticed there are little rubber feet on the bottom to keep the speaker from sliding off a table easily - that's attention to detail!  The power button works well (it's just a little switch that isn't stiff at all) and when on it lights up a blue LED light.  This is rather bright, but thankfully once you set it down on a flat surface it blocks out most of it.  The light turns red while charging (via a standard USB to mini-USB cable)  and blue again once full.  I'm also really happy to report that you can charge this speaker while using it and it doesn't create any disruption in the sound quality (seriously, my old speaker would become so distorted/buzzy that it was unusable during charging).As for battery life, well, I'm not exactly sure.  I've used it for several days and I timed my usage each time.  The amazon page advertises 12+ hours of continuous use.  I got over 26 hours of use!  It wasn't on full volume the whole time, and there were times were I paused the video/song to go do something in another room so the speaker was on but not actively making sound, but I'm still duly impressed!  After 26 hours of testing, I forgot to turn it off that night and it actually sat there on for the whole night and yet, it still didn't run out of charge, and I only quit my testing because I got tired of waiting for the battery to drain.  If you ran it at full volume constantly, it might drain the battery faster, but either way, I can safely say that the battery life is absolutely excellent!I guess the last thing to talk about is the accessories it comes with.  The makers of this product were actually pretty kind about including a useful number of accessories.  It comes with a little cloth drawstring bag to hold it in, and a couple cables.  One of the cables is a longer male/male audio cable and the other is a strange audio jack/ mini-USB to USB charging cable hybrid thing.  This is a strange inclusion since it's about the same length as the other audio cable, and because of the way it's made, the charging portion of it is really short.  I don't know why they didn't include just this one hybrid cable, or just a normal USB cable to go with the other audio cable.  Weird, but oh well.  One thing I really like is that both cables have a little velcro closure thing on them to keep them tidy when rolled up.  It's a small touch, but I appreciate the effort.  The last thing to come with it is an instruction manual.  This is an extremely minimal folded piece of paper with some very basic instructions on how to open and close the unit, how to charge it, what accessories it comes with, and how to use the &#34;buddy system&#34;.  Really, though, this thing is so self-explanatory and easy to use that an instruction manual isn't necessary at all.  As for the &#34;buddy plug system,&#34; although I don't own a second Xboom, I did plug in my crappy old speaker and it sounded fine (well, not really fine - it sounded like a good speaker playing at the same time as a crappy speaker, but you get my point).  Of course if you wanted to do this, it'd be better to have two Xbooms so there'd be some volume consistency (I couldn't get my old speaker to the same volume since it doesn't have its own external volume control).  I don't really see a whole lot of use for this system since anyone who wants a portable speaker probably doesn't want to lug around multiples of them just to get louder sound, but it's nice that the option is there.  Plus it would be hilarious to link 160 of these together and hold a rave party!  I seriously hope someone does that and puts the video on youtube...Well, if it's not apparent by now, I can say that I'm thoroughly pleased with this speaker.  I can't think of any real cons to it - except maybe to integrate the charger into the base along with the audio cable, and make those cables a bit longer.  Really, though, those are just nitpicks -  this unit has no serious flaws of any kind.  Even the enhanced bass they advertise is pretty good.  I'm really impressed with the sound quality for the price!  Even though the Xboom was more expensive than that crappy seven dollar speaker of mine, sixteen bucks (the price at the time) isn't exactly going to break the bank and it was entirely worth it for the difference in quality.  If you need a tiny portable speaker, then I highly recommend the Xboom Mini Portable Speaker.

$REVIEW.: I have had a radar detector for years, and pay close attention both while driving, and to enforcement changes.  I usually drive in excess of the limit from +10 -> +15 mph, because in my state, state law doesn't put points on your licence until 15+ over.  So while local municipalities enforce to about +10, out in the county, You can drive past Deputies at 69 in a 55 and they won't pull you.Recently, my wife started driving a lot more, and while I have a Bell vector 995, I was tired of loaning it to her, but of course she had her complaints about it, specifically the 'tech' display (displays the frequency detected to the 100th of a mhz), and the voice alert.  So I searched for a detector that was more her speed.  I found this guy, with reviews almost as good as my Vector (radartest.com), and as good as the Whister Pro 78se & Pro 695 (same electronics detection package).  It basically is a unit w/ the same core detection package (antenna & detection software), but has all the 'extras' (like compass, LED alphanumeric display, etc) taken out.  And happens to be $50-100 less for it.  As far as I can tell, the reviews are dead on, it's incredibly sensitive for the price, though not quite at the upper units threshold.Whatev! she loves it, and I don't have to switch radar detectors when I switch cars anymore.  I am very confident about it's performance, and detection threshold, though it isn't nearly as good as the 995 about false alerts. (driving behind somebody with a Cobra makes you reach for the mute!)  But for the cost, it works, and works well!

$REVIEW.: For those of you still searching for a basic battery operated MP3 player you can't go wrong with this
I have about eight different basic MP3 players like this and this is one of my favorites

It comes close to my Creative Muvo TX FM (as far as options, clarity, battery life, portability) which costs three times more than this as a used item with less than half the storage space.This Player by far is the lightest and cheapest feeling of them all but don't let that fool you

It might actually be lighter then an empty bic lighter.I have ordered three of these already (I misplaced one after the first week and its a gonner) because I listen to mostly talk audio I download from the internet like interviews, lectures, dissertations, sermons, radio shows etc..
Rarely do I listen to music


 I listen between three and four hours every day on my mp3 players
I have eight different players because I load each one up with different topics so I can just grab the one I want knowing whats on it just buy looking at it

This way I don't have to constantly load and unload data.The sound is awesome.I would say the battery life is the best I have seen in all my players

I can be down to Zero power bars and still get many hours of use from it

I think you get more hours then what is advertised.The functionality options and settings are excellent although I don't really use them much.The display text is very cheesy

Text could be darker and thicker or bigger


Looks like dotmatrix print.I understand why people seem frustrated about what they call button delay or non responsive buttons but after using it I understand the logic in this
When listening for a while the buttons (not the player) go into a sleep mode so the first time you hit a button it will not do it's function


It will automatically come out of sleep and turn on the back light so you can see


The second time you hit the same button it will work
Got used to it pretty quick once I figured this out!I only had a small problem with one of these Coby players

It had a constant low ticking sound in the background and I noticed the display text seemed to flicker in unison with the ticking sound

I don't think you would notice it if you are listening to most music but because I listen to mostly talk lectures there is lots of silence (pauses) between spoken words making the ticking sound noticeable

This only happened to one of the players out of the three


Didn't bother contacting the company.All in all a good buy
There are a few cheap generic players from china you can still find for even half the price of this one with same memory that are another option
I just bought two different ones and am very happy with them.

$REVIEW.: The Logitech K810 bluetooth illuminated keyboard is a treat to use.  Weighing in at around 1 pound, it is very portable.## Features:  The keyboard is made of plastic with a brushed aluminum finish around the keys.  Comparing the size of the keyboard and the keys itself, it is comparable to my 14" Asus laptop -- the distance from the keys on one end of the keyboard to the other is almost exactly the same.  The physical size of the keyboard is approximately 11.5" x 5" x 0.5" thickness.The keyboard comes pre-charged so you can use it right out of the box.  Included is a micro-USB charger, allowing you to plug into any USB charger.  When you turn on the keyboard, a light at the top right of the keyboard will flash -- green denotes adequate charge while red means you should charge it up.  It should take between 1-3 hrs for a full charge.Keys:  The top row of function keys doubles as a shortcut to switching between which device you want to be connected to (F1, F2, F3 keys are dedicated to one device each, allowing you to pair upto 3 devices at once).  F4 allows you to cycle through open applications.  There are two keys for decreasing (F5) and increasing (F6) the keyboard backlight intensity.  For your media, F7 is for play/pause, F8 Mute, F9 Volume Down, F10 Volume Up.  F11 is a Home Key while F12 is a multifunction key (Calculator on Windows, Show/hide virtual keyboard for iOS).## Setup:  If you've ever set up any bluetooth device, you should have no problems connecting to this keyboard.  I tested this keyboard by pairing it to my Motorola Droid 4 android smartphone running Ice Cream Sandwich.  I turned the bluetooth on my phone on, flipped the on switch for the keyboard, made sure my phone was searching for bluetooth devices, and held the Connect button on the keyboard.  Instantly, my phone instructed me to input a string of numbers into the keyboard.  I was up and running in less than a minute from taking it out of the box!## Performance:  The keyboard worked well as expected.  The keys are well spaced for my long fingers, and should be fine for those accustomed to 13+" laptop keyboards.  I turned off the lights in my room to try and type with the illuminated keys -- the illumination was more than adequate.  The keyboard features a proximity sensor.  When you move your hands close to the keyboard, if the illumination is enabled, it will light up.All in all this seems like a great device.  I could see how this device could come handy in meetings, or for those that type in class.  Instead of bringing in a laptop, you can now bring this very portable keyboard, pair it with your tablet or smartphone.  I would highly recommend this device for those in market of a bluetooth keyboard for their HTPC, smartphone, tablet, or other portable device.

$review_text.: The cover does the job, in that it covers the iPad.  The magnetic auto wake feature works well, and the fitment is pretty good.The main drawback on this case is that it cannot support the iPad at any of the viewing angles during use.  It'll stand up fine, just as long as you don't touch it.  This pretty much defeats the purpose of the case if you got it to keep  your iPad at specific angles during use.I returned this one and got the Devicewear Detour, which is the same type of case as this.  The Devicewear is built much better and has no issues with keeping the iPad at the different viewing angles.

$review_text.: I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 3 after both batteries died and charger is refusing to charge them. Looks like I'm not the only one with the problem, looking up battery only on amazon for replacement, other people have same complaint. I just purchased Bosch instead of buying another battery and risking it die again. The driver still works great, batteries die. Driver served well for couple years, too bad batteries have a short life.

$REVIEW.: they hit pretty good for how much they weigh...I have them in a sealed box (two twelves) being pushed by an amp (not in my car but my brothers) with the same specs for it, same ohms and RMS voltages....if you are new to this kind of thing...always match up the RMS power range with the amp you are pairing it up with...this has a peak rms of 150...so find an amp with an rms of 150, no more or you will blow your sub...anything less would depend on your budget or mounting (amps come in different sizes)....soooo....two of these would be able to handle an RMS of 150 EACH...so find an amp that can put out a RMS of 150 in two channels...also the ohms come into play with this but most of the time you can change the OHMs to 2 or 4, or even 6 on the amp itself....just make sure...granted, getting a kicker sub and pairing it up with a kicker amp would be ideal...but not everything can be like that...getting the specs if more than good enough if you already have the amp or the subs...I know this is a really simplified version of what to buy...but I am also kind of new to this and from what I have been reading and hearing from people (my family and friends about subs that have worked on them alot) is that most of this stuff is interchangable and works fine as long as you dont' try to give too much power to the subs from the amp or have the subs trying to take more than the amp can provide...

 It was between this one and another that was close in price

 I chose this one because it had an option to be able to zoom in a little, and i do mean a little instead of the other one that obviously couldnt
 I thought she would like the zoom option a little more


 She loves it, was really excited when she opened it
 Has used it pretty much ever opportunity she has gotten.

The foam piece is always hard to get on the first time, but that's how it stays on when you remove the headset from your ear each time.  Depending on your amount of usage (or how clean your ear is??) each one could last a few months.  So this 3-pack could be a year's supply.  Or at least 6 months, I would guess for most people.

Perfect for someone like me that carries the phone in their pocket.  Only reason I deducted 1 star is because of the tight fit - snug beyond necessary.  I was worried I would scratch the beautiful finish on my SIII while pushing it on to install it.  I think its fine now that its installed but if you are going to need to remove the case often, stay away from this.

$REVIEW.: Well after reading so many excellent reviews, let me add a brief to-the-point review.  This is a great product and a great value.  I have used it for several months including in Mexico.  It connects to WiFi very easily (even on the beach).  It boots quickly, and the 160 gb hard drive accommodates all the software you desire.  I can easily transfer photos from my digital camera card to the eee using the flash card shot.  I actually get 4 hours of battery life with internet access which I consider good.  The small size and light weight allows it to fit easily into my briefcase and into hotel safes.  I also use it for Powerpoint presentations using LCD projectors.  There are two negatives as far as I am concern.  First, the lack of an optical drive, means that you need to add software some other way.  I used an external CD drive.  After the initial software installation, I really didn't need it again, and I used flash drives to transfer information.  Second, and more important, the only real flaw from my perspective is the the small keyboard. Typing is slow even after you attempt to get used to it, but then I do not expect to type a thesis on it.  I might opt for a slightly wider unit with a more standard size keyboard, but I would not give up hotel safe compatibility.

$REVIEW.: I am trying to protect the iPad investment - 2 kids in middle school now have iPad 4s. I could complain about this as a misguided waste of education resources, but instead I want to focus on reviewing the CoverBot case. After a few weeks of ownership, both kids gave me their thumbs up. Mind you, it is still summer time and we have not tested the case in the day-to-day school routine.The kids like that the cases (one pink, one white) are stylish and practical and seem to do a fine job in protecting the device. We do use a screen protector as well.The mechanical construction of the slide-and-rotate iPad part does seem like it will not last a whole school year to me, be it remains to be seen. They keyboard feels well-made and I can type fluently on in. We have only charged it once so far after unboxing, so the battery seems to last for a while.So far I think this case is worth the money.

$review_text.: The Duet is very cool. It allows you to wirelessly link to all the mp3 files on your computer and play them over your stereo. You do this with with a hand held unit that is similar to a cell phone. I really like it and recommend it, but it setting it up can get a little technical. I go over setup and usage issues below:I've had my complete CD collection of close to 500 CDs on our PCs hard drive for a few years now. We mainly use it to fill our MP3 players. There wasn't a good way to listen to it. Now with the Duet we can play all of our music over the stereo easily. I can find a song and start it playing within seconds. Finding the CD on the book shelf and getting it into the CD player can take minutes longer unless it's misfiled or in the car then longer yet! I really love this system. It puts my complete music collection at my finger tips and merges the computer with our stereo system.Setup:The duet hooks into your network wirelessly. There is a way to plug the player into a wired port and use adhoc mode to connect the controller to the player, but I didn't use that mode. Setup is straight forward, but not "easy". I'm a computer geek, so I didn't have too hard of time. You'll need to know your WEP key/password so the duet and player can access your network. If you are using a MAC address filter as well, the player and remote have their Mac addresses on them so that helps.The remote:The remote is very cool. If you can operate an ipod, the remote will be pretty intuitive. The color screen is great. You can even link to a Flickr account and have it use your own pictures for screen savers. I have the album artwork in the tags of all my MP3s so the now playing screen shows you that picture. The remote comes with a charging cradle that it sits in. Both the remote and player have updateable software that you can update by selecting an option on the remote.Notes:- You need to run the Squeeze Center software on one pc in your house. It's the server software that the Duet uses to access your music. There is a website that you can get help and submit bugs if you find one. The player setup didn't find this machine by name when I set mine up, so I had to type in the IP address. Then it found it by name.- Playlists: You can create and use playlists. This lets you have all sorts of mixes.- Searches: You can search your library from the remote. This is fast and very cool. Know just part of the song name or the artist, no problem. It will list all matching songs.- New Music: Under the tab for your music library, there is a New Music section. This shows in chronological order the music you last added to your library.- Updates: The remote has a headphone jack. I thought it would be cool to be able to listen to music with just the remote and earphones. You can't now, but I called tech support and they said they are working on it.- You can have multiple players. The Duet comes with one controller and one player. You can add another player (and I think up to 5) in another room and it can play different music than the first. The controller will control them both. I'm thinking of getting one for my basement stereo system.- Two delivery guys from a big box store were installing our new dishwasher while I was playing with the Duet. When I explained to them what it was, they both got every excited. They get a discount on their purchases and both wanted to get one.- My wife who has an ipod has no problems using the Duet.
$SUMMARY.: The Duet is Awesome!!!

$REVIEW.: While this is called a large case I would probably call it a medium plus compared to other bags I've owned.I was looking for a case to hold a Canon 1d series camera with a 24-105 lens and hood, a 580ex flash, a 50mm f/1.4 and the necessary extra accessories such as an extra battery, lens cloth, etc


 This bag had great reviews and a very affordable price so I took the plunge

Everything I wanted to have in the bag fits and I think I could even get my 70-200 f/4 and another small lens in the bag yet but it would be crowded


 I have an RRS L bracket on my 1D Mk II and it is a tight fit in this case due to the cameras wide width

 If I took off the bracket I'm sure it would fit with no problems
 This is not a fault of the bag but is mentioned for information only.Overall I'm impressed with the bag


 The side and front pockets could be a little bigger and possibly better designed but for the price what do you want
 Some have complained about the shoulder strap and while it could be padded a little better it's better than a few I've had in the past


 The yellow interior makes it very easy to see what you have in the bag and the rubber "feet" on the bottom of the bag add a little extra durability to the bottom.The bag seems well made and comes with several dividers, I just wish they were a little sturdier but they are adequate
 If there was more Velcro on the inside of the bag it would be even more configurable but I was able to get it laid out like I wanted


 I'm sure you can buy a better bag for 3 or 4 times the price (I have) but this is a great knock-around case and would work even better with a non-pro model camera.If they make a larger shoulder bag in the future I would buy it.

$REVIEW.: This is not a professional tripod for small cameras.  It is a good, cheap, light weight tripod for small cameras.It is stable, but not rock solid. It is VERY light and portable!  It is surprisingly versatile and well built for the price.The rubber feet are made of a rubber that is a bit too hard and slips on hardwood floors.  I added 3M bumpons to the bottoms of the feet to fix this, and it seems to work.The third axis lock has a lot of give in the third axis even when locked and a sticky pan, so I'm not clear why they advertise it for video.I keep the smallest leg sections closed unless I need the extra height, and this eliminates vibration with 1 to 2 pound cameras.I sometimes "drop" the camera by releasing the handle when the trigger lock is not locked.  This lets the camera flop over.  With just the weight of the camera, it flops a short distance toward me and hits a rubbery stop.  I wouldn't use this tripod with a telephoto lens, until I get used to the trigger lock and stop doing that.  I wish the trigger lock had a spring to apply a little pressure if it is released but not locked.  Something about the shape gives me a reflexive expectation that it will lock when I take my hand off the trigger.

$REVIEW.: I'm putting emphases on ENTHUSIAST because this is what this camera is made for. this camera included top quality parts, in a small frame, even though for me its a little smaller than my liking but it is still very useable and i like to use it. the ergonomics are superb for anyone, pro or noob.this is my first sony camera but i have always been a follower of sony, knowing that sony is a major supplier for nikon and making big bang censors like the 24mp for the d3x and the nikon d3200 and others i felt that getting this was a smart decision. but enough of thatThis camera embodies features from much higher priced competitors, DSLR'S like the d300(S),d3, d7000, you name it you can pull out shots and video that will rival there outcomes. but the best thing is sony's lens set up, yes they dont have a lot of "STOCK" lenses but this NEX line has probably the most adapter styles for any of your previous lenses, no matter what camera you previously had this camera can probably use it, i have a couple of nikon lenses from my old set up. So i bought a cheap adapter and the lenses work perfectly.there are a lot of good things to list about the camera but i just want to state the fact that this is a high quality enthusiast camera. It works, it has potential to last a long time and its future proofed if output resolution continues to increase on a mass level. people complain about the little things like to much pixel density and  a low battery life but both things should be known before purchasing this camera. it as a small battery and a freaking 24meg censor. if you buy a second battery with it (as most pro photographers should do) then there shouldn't be a problem. i dont have any problems with this camera.this camera ranks over all of its competitors( fuji x-1 , x100, olympus, nikon v1) they are all inferior to this in every way.what i am most impressed with is the stereo sound quality. these are very good mics, i would rank them higher then the more expensive dlsr (pro) video cams(d3s, d300s, d7000, 5d) they will work for you if you dont have or dont want to buy external mics.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT

I thought the iMacs 20" screens were beautiful and looked much larger than their stated size would seem.  The new larger 24" screens are amazing!  I sound like a commercial BUT anyone who is running Windows (s-l-o-w-l-y) and is sick & tired of the virus and trojan horse attacks; it is time to leave the PC swamp or to add a Mac!

$REVIEW.: This is a pretty standard digital camera; for those of you who want something simple and easy to use, without many advanced/special features, this is a good camera for you.Pros:-Easy to use; the buttons are pretty much right in front of you.-6 different modes; an auto for general use, one for objects in motion, one for dark scenes, one for landscapes, and one for close-ups. It also has a video option.-It's not incredibly small, but it'll fit in your pocket.-If you turn the live view off (where you see the image on the screen before taking the photo), the battery life is pretty good (just don't take many videos). A few days ago, I took about 60 pictures and about 10 videos that were about 20 seconds each.Cons:-It can't take pictures in the dark. Or, for that matter, anything without a big, visible light source. When in auto mode, the pictures become waay to dark and undefined, but the shutter speed for the night mode is ridiculously long, so no matter how still your subject/hand is, it'll be too blurry.-The batteries fall out easily. Twice during concerts, I've lost batteries because I rubbed against the bottom of the camera.-The zoom isn't terrific. In fact, it doesn't really 'zoom in' at all; the closest you can get on any mode except for close-up is the same as you'd see through your naked eye. But that's where the close-up feature comes in handy. (It's only if you want great detail on objects near you, such as flowers; any further and it's just a big blur)-Without a tripod and a still subject, it's hard to get clear photos on the night and close-up mode.You can get decent photos with this camera under the right conditions, but this is just a simple camera for unprofessional images. Probably good if you're on a family vacation to Disneyland, or on an outing with friends. In broad daylight, that is. It's not necessarily a bad camera, but it was insufficient for my needs. And yes, this is a horrible camera to take to concerts.

There have been two occasions where the speakers would begin clicking whenever they made sound, but I'm not sure if it was the speakers, the receiver, or just feedback from something else.  The clicks did not last very long and have happened very infrequently so I haven't thought much of it.  Like I said, I'm no pro, but they work and sound good.  Low or no maintenance is my favorite and these have satisfied that as well so 5/5.

$REVIEW.: After 2 weeks in Alaska, my admittedly  amateur observations:- Pics are noticeably darker than other cameras I have used. Pros say always take the pic 1 f-stop lower because it's easier to clean up than washed-out photos. But they are dark..- Took many pics in Denali with big vista. Noticeable spots on the picture, at first I thought it was dirt on lenses but two separate lenses, completely cleaned, still spots. More with the telephoto than with the 18-55. However I did not bring the hoods, I assume they would have helped.. but these lenses do have refraction in them.  No amount of Photoshop after the fact can really capture the deep blue marble that the sky was up there at that time.- The batteries are a JOKE!!! Two of them, they couldn't let me through a whole day! About 100 pics and they start losing power.Still I managed to get about 10 really good pics that have office salivating to go... when it works, the resolution is simply the best I've ever had.

$REVIEW.: I have used a lot of mice over the time, all microsoft and logitech in brand, notebook, optical, laser, and old school ball style
This has to be my favorite mouse of all time

Its small enough for small hands, while comfortable enough for people with big hands like myself.The only two downsides of the mouse is the lack of a forward button, that be used for other things


The last thing is it does not carry profiles, so you can't link it with two devices, ex laptop and desktop computers


It will forget the previous connection

(Solution buy a second like me!)I am a hardcore gamer and the response time is excellent for fps style, along with regular games


When I say hardcore gamer, I mean 10+ hours a day on average, with more on the weekends
I have had the mouse for nearly 2 months and the batteries are still going.

$review_text.: First off, I did not buy this item here on Amazon.  Had I read these reviews beforehand it would have raised a red flag.  As a wireless set they work poorly unless you are in the same room.  If you happen to lose the wireless signal (a regular occurrence if you move about) it is very hard to get it back even if you re-power both the headset and the wireless unit.  Mine either start blasting static or the local FM Christian radio station when it loses signal.On the plus side, the wireless unit is slim enough to fit in a coat pocket.  You can input your mp3 player to the wireless unit, wear it, and eliminate the cord to the headphone (but you then also go to Mono).  The best use for this product is to just use the the headset for the built-in FM radio or as a spare corded headphone.  At least both are then in stereo.  The headset is comfortable; light, with an adjustable band and nicely padded ear-cups.  The sound is decent but not worth purchasing this item for the headset alone.

$REVIEW.: I got the card today and I was so excited. I took it out of the box and two screws on the bottom of the card, that hold down the heatsink are missing. I thought I can just get some screws and fix that myself. After installing the video card and the drivers for it I am noticing that the manual fan control doesn't work, at this point I am getting suspicious but I thought when the card is under load maybe it will automatically increase the fan speed. Well, that didn't happen either. I was playing Crysis 3 beta for about 15min and the card Temperature reached 100C!!!! The control panel was showing 100% fan speed but they were barely spinning. I am requesting a return as we speak. Clearly this one is defective.Crysis 3 ran really smooth-this card is a beast and will handle the games just fine,as long as the cooling works. Will add stars if replacement is operational.I have received my replacement yesterday and I tested it right away! No issues! I am happy! Everything runs on max settings on 1920x1080 with no lag whatsoever! I am in love with this card now. I ran Crysis 3 Beta, The Withcer 2 Enhanced Edition and Dead Space 3 and the card didn't go above 72C on automatic fan settings.

$REVIEW.: I installed this in my 2001 nissan altima even though I had an after-market CD player there. I wanted something that will not start skipping, like the CD player does, and that will be able to handle a large amount of music in one place. This player has great capabilities and the price is right. After connecting it, the radio worked great. I went to try a 32GB usb drive in it, but it gave me the USB error code. I searched other reviews who had the same problem. Most people had this problem if they tried to connect their ipods through the usb, and I guess you can only use the ipod or iphone (or any mp3 player) with the AUX cable. Anyway, I found out what my problem was thanks to technical support who had answered to other customers. This will only read from a USB no bigger than 4GB. I went back to my car and tested it with a 2GB usb as I didn't have a 4GB one. It worked perfect. All other features turned my old car into a power machine. First off, the sound can get extremely loud. I was only able to up to level 40 because I couldn't handle it anymore. I assume it goes to 50. The bass feature, pop and rock mode make a big difference, unlike my old player, where it didn't really matter. Overall, sound is great, no problems with using a 4GB usb drive. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
$SUMMARY.: Works perfect! USB has to be no bigger than 4GB to work!

$REVIEW.: I've owned my Lytro since last spring - it is an amazing camera as I indicated in my review of that product
This tripod adapter works well: it slips over the body of the camera and is locked in place by the tripod mounting screw
 In my opinion a tripod mount should have been built into the camera from the outset.I see two problems with this:1

It is not clear where on the camera it should be placed
 My Lytro now has small scratches in the finish from this adapter - might not have happened if the adapter was placed on the rubber grip, but this would have been a tight fit (if it was even possible)
 No instruction sheet to suggest placement.2


I am concerned about possibly damaging the internals of the camera when I tighten the tripod mounting screw
 Again, some instructions - suggesting either where to place the adapter or assuring me that damage would not occur - would have been welcome.Considering that this is the only way to use the Lytro with a tripod, it is hard not to rate it highly.

$SUMMARY.: Needed - should have been there from the outset

$REVIEW.: While visiting California, I had the opportunity to listen to the Sony SRSBTX500. It was a little more expensive then I was willing to spend. I checked out the SRSBTX300 at a local electronics store and found it to sound nearly as good as the more expensive SRSBTX500. After returning home from my trip, I found this Sony online through Amazon and purchased it. I use it for my Laptop when I travel. Shortly after Purchasing the SRSBTX300, I was able to find a reasonably price SRSBTX500. So, now I use the BTX500 at home and because the BTX300 is smaller, I keep it with my laptop for travel. I highly recommend the Sony SRSBTX300.

Plus there's really a lot more to consider when gaming like your HDD and CPU. I also got a SSD for this same computer and the game boots in like 10 seconds flat--not the 10 minutes that it used to take. I also upgraded from some unknown CPU to a quad core, so there's that too.

$REVIEW.: I use this keyboard for an HTPC at home and a standing conference room at work


It's really nice when you don't need to do much mouse moving, you can just use your thumb on the trackpad and type away on the keyboard


I would not recommend getting this for a conference room that can accommodate having a mouse as a mouse is definitely a little easier and more folks are comfortable using that for a long period of time


Plugin the USB receiver and you're up and running!Lost your receiver? Have a spare? No need to buy another K400 if so - pair your K400 with the other receiver


First download the Unify software from Logitech here: [...] install it and then you can configure the receiver to connect to your K400 that you lost the receiver for


It really works with any of Logitech's unify products as they share the same wireless technology.I would highly recommend this keyboard/touchpad

If you are considering it for a conference room, be kind to your employees and get them a standalone mouse if your setup accommodates that


If it doesn't, this is the keyboard/trackpad for you!

Them I got XMBC installed, and that was neat. But I already had the Roku, TiVO, Apple TV, and a TV with apps, so I really didn't need a home theater PC.Then one day my friend told me about PBX In a Flash. He explained to me what he was doing with his and it sounded like a fun project. So I downloaded the image, flashed it to the SD card, and started to have fun with IRVs, VM systems, and extensions.Before Google voice ended their XMPP protocol, I used it to make and receive free phone calls with the PBX system. I also set up conference bridges and made my very own part lines.Now I use a trunk provider and make and receive phone calls for very cheap. I put $30.00 on my account in August 13' and I still have $15.00 left.

They get the gunk out of the corners and sides because the soft part of the pad is wrapped around the edge of the leather so you can actually tilt and bend into the corners and sides of the iPad with soft firmness without damaging the unit.  Highly recommend.  I bought these because a friend of mine had one and I was able to try them out ahead of time.  I gave one to another friend of mine (you get three in a package - great deal for the price).

$review_text.: I got this memory for my MacBook Pro 15" (Early 2011) Intel i7 2.2GHz laptop.  The chips arrived quick (bought from Amazon), however, this is an error on manufacture packaging, they were packaged in a very loose holding container with a small plastic groove to hold them in place, one chip was in place, however the other had popped out and was shuffling around in the packaging.  However, the chip seemed to work fine in the computer, and did not have any signs of trauma (scratches or dings).I opened up the MacBook Pro using a small precision screw driver, and lifted the case away.  You could easily see the old chips and I pulled the side hinge and the fist one popped up, I removed it and then went to get the one underneath it, which was kind of tight and required some leverage and pressure (without damaging anything), to pull it out.  I then matched the grooved to the grooves on the MacBook and placed the bottom one in, you do not have much room and it seems to be tight, so it required a little bit or pressure (without damaging anything), the top one a bit easier, but still required a bit of pressure to get it in.  I closed the MacBook and put the screws back in (remember where screws go, since some are long the rest are short (very short)).  I turned on the MacBook Pro and the Grey screens with the Apple came up, the computer log in screen appeared, and when I looked in System Properties I could see 8GB of 1333MHz DDR3 memory.  The computer runs perfectly (it has been about a day now, if anything changed I will let you know).  The computer is super fast!  I use VMware Fusion 4 for running Windows 7 Applications in Lion, and use to Windows 7 would slow the Mac OS X down (System Memory said about 20MB free memory), after the upgrade to 8GB of RAM, when Windows 7's Visual Studio is running with Safari and Mail and Microsoft Access 2010 I still have 3.5 to 4 GB of Free Memory!  -- I gave Windows 7 2GB of Memory and 2 Cores of Processor.In the end this RAM makes the computer super fast and allows virtualization to be super instant (Visual Studio opens nearly instantly 2 seconds of splash screen, and that is in VMware!).  I cannot guarantee RAM will work in your computer (you have to check the Specs), but I can say that it worked in mine with no problem and doubled the speed!!!To help anyone out (please do not go by reviews or others specs, you must check your requirements with Apple (or computer manufacture or Motherboard requirements) to see if this will work in your MacBook or computer), I am using a MacBook Pro (Early 2011) 15" Quad Core i7 2.2GHz laptop, and the NEW (purchased here) memory shows up as (in Computer Information): (Memory Slots:ECC: DisabledBANK 0/DIMM0:Size: 4 GBType: DDR3Speed: 1333 MHzStatus: OKManufacturer: 0x80CEBank 0 and 1 show the same information just different Serial Numbers, so I just listed Bank 0, and on the back of the chips that had a Samsung Sticker, the front had the Crucial Sticker) -- Just FYI
$SUMMARY.: Easy to Install and works perfectly in my MacBook Pro (Early 2011)

I was at Beast Buy yesterday, and didn't see this model, so it is probably on its way out. I had to surf around to check whether it had any power conditioning features, because the product description just has a generic blurb about Monster Power. Yes, it does have their Stage 1 filter. For the wall mount, they cheaped out a bit. You must supply your own mollys. This is my 3rd Monster Power product, and I am happy with all of them. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is my first tripod and I actually felt a little overwhelmed trying to use it for the first time. There are a lot of knobs and latches and clamps! It gives you way more flexibility than I needed or expected. Right now I'm not using this to its full potential but it's nice to know I could. Surprisingly strong, holds a 200m lens if I don't extend the bottommost portions of the legs just fine. Stability does seem to suffer when those bottom legs are extended, but until you do that, it's really nice and sturdy. Folds up easily and fits back into the bag it came in. I haven't taken the tag off yet, so when I forget how to work something I can refer to the instructions.... (doh)

$REVIEW.: I keep saying it in my other iPod Touch case reviews, but I mean it every time- so far, the best case I've had is the Amazon Basics silicon case. Other silicone ones I've used have either been too thin, didn't offer enough protection, or were too sticky to get in and out of my pocket easily. Belkin managed to make a decent set of cases that will definitely protect your iPod, and they slip into your pocket without any problems too.Both cases are identical except for the color. I'm not a big fan of cases in bright colors, but you know what? It sure beats another standard black case since you'll be able to find your iPod quickly thanks to the bold color making it stand out. The holes for the camera on the back and on the bottom are just the right size too. I liked that the Home button is covered by the case- that's something I don't see a lot of from other brands. The covering for the Home and volume buttons isn't too thick either, so you won't have any issues with pressing them too hard and breaking something. And as I mentioned earlier, the case has a good texture and pulling it out of your pocket is as easy as can be. I've dropped my iPod a few times while this case was on it, and it was perfectly fine. Since it's a little thick, it prevents the screen from hitting the floor by just a tiny bit, saving it from doom.But...there are a few issues. The main one being that the top of the case doesn't exactly fit perfectly over the iPod. Mine's constantly pushing up the screen protector and has made it peel back even further in the few days I've been using this. I don't get why they couldn't have made the top of it come down more, going over the front camera with a small hole for it just like on the back. It also feels weird holding the iPod sideways for games because of this. The last problem is that the quality of the case doesn't seem that great. I've noticed a lot of small bits of the silicone peeling off around where the Home button is.As it is, this is still a good deal. When one case goes kaput, you'll have another on standby. I still recommend the Amazon Basics silicone case above all others, so give that a shot if you're looking for something to last you a while.
$SUMMARY.: 2 decent cases for a good price.

$review_text.: I'm a pilot in the Navy and often find myself in situations where a wall charger is either unavailable or else I don't have the time in one place to give my phone an effective charge.  I bought this so that I could still keep my phone and other electronics charged even while I was on the move.  I could not be more impressed with the product!  I received it with 3 &#34;dots&#34; of charge on it and began immediately to use it to charge every electronic device I could plug into it. It works great!  With the included adapters I was able to charge my Droid 4 (less time than a wall charger), Nexus 7 (impressive, since these are a bit picky about their power sources), iPod touch, and PSP.  Additionally I was able to charge my Sony Walkman and digital camera using their proprietary charging cables with no problems.  The most impressive part of the experience is the email I received from Anker Direct about a week after the device came asking how my experience was so far and making sure that I had all the contact information, should I have any concerns or questions.  That's impressive for something that came at such a bargain price.One note: if you purchase the Astro3E, I highly recommend that you also buy a high-speed USB wall adapter (something that puts out &#62;1.5 amps).  I have an entire drawer full of USB wall mounts from various electronics that I own and it wasn't until I began looking for one to use for this charger that I found out they all are low-capacity (&#60;1 amp).  These will charge the Astro3E, but it will take a very, very long time (which makes sense given the size of the battery pack).  I bought a 2.1 amp wall adapter (advertised for tablets) and it charges the Astro3E in a very reasonable time now.

$REVIEW.: The device was smaller than I expected but works just fine.  I've tried it with both a USB thumb drive localling connected and using a thumb drive connected to my wireless router's Readyshare port.  It works fine with either.  I have it connected to my slide show TV via a HDMI cable - no issues there either.  Would be five stars if the processor were a bit faster.  I find I have to wait a little at the beginning of a function.  That said, I use it to present select photographs from my collection of the last 16 years as a continuous slide show and it works fine for that.

$review_text.: I originally bought this particular wireless router after deliberating a couple weeks looking at CNET's review sections.  I took it out of the package, plugged it in, and my laptop instantly recognized the network and I was good to go.  However, once the router had to be disconnected for a few minutes, everything was shot.  It took me about 3 hours to get it back up.  This was the only issue, and it was quickly forgotten because, oddly enough, the internet IN port is taking a cable from an OUT port coming from another router that is receiving the internet signal. In my haste I set it up this way figuring that it should work.  I can't access the wireless router but I can log into the main router. It's basically acting as an access point, and is giving me good range (it's in my basement, and I brought my computer out of my house and into my car, about 75 feet away from the house before the signal died. Most people are concerned about range with wireless routers and access points, and I can tell you that it is dependent on many things, like the construction of the house and strength of signal.  I typically use my laptop 2 floors up from the router at a distance of about 40 feet.  There I get "Low" signal strength, but can get a rate of about 250 Kbps. The case is plastic, but then again wireless technology is not going to be in any pretty packaging anytime soon.  It will mount on the provided stand and has 2 moveable antennas which should ALWAYS be pointed up, not at your supposed position in the house.  Overall I would recommend this product because of good performance and easy setup.  Read the directions!

$REVIEW.: This product is without a doubt, one of the BEST screen protectors I've ever used.  And I've used everything from Steinheil to Power Support to Zagg.  amFilm might have convinced me that I don't need to spend a fortune to get excellent results.  I originally tried a different brand that costs more than twice the price of these protectors.  Despite purchasing and trying that product twice, it failed miserably both times.  I searched for another brand and was tempted to go with another expensive brand again until I saw pretty good reviews for the amFilm.  Figuring I had nothing to lose at that price, I ordered the amFilm.  Well, I can personally tell you that those 5-star ratings were well deserved.  After preparing the device and installing this film in the exact same environment as the first (and more expensive) film, I ended up with no air bubbles, no raised edges (from improperly sized films), no defects (glue marks, scratches, or other visual artifacts), and it even has a perfectly cut hole for that little mysterious sensor thing in the upper left corner of the Kindle screen.  No loss of touch sensitivity, no rainbow effect, no excess friction when swiping...  just a crystal clear appearance with no loss of clarity.  I never got results this perfect from the more expensive film that I tried first.  I can't believe how perfect this protector fits and looks on the device.  Not one single air bubble or speck of dust.  Now, granted, you still have to have a relatively low-dust installation environment.  I installed in the bathroom after running the shower on full hot for five minutes and steaming the dust out of the air.  That's a trick I've used for years for other devices.  I also cleaned the screen very well with a non-abrasive alcohol based cleaner and used a can of compressed air to blast any remaining dust particles off the screen just before applying film.  Problem is, if a film isn't cut properly, (as was the case with the previous films I tried), you have to keep lifting and reapplying to get it to line up decently.  Eventually, some dust particles are going to make their way back into the area and onto the screen during one of those reapplications.  This film went on perfect on first try.  I simply lined up the top edges and the sensor hole.  The rest just glided down to a perfect fit on the Kindle. Success on one try.  I added a picture of the Kindle with the film installed above.  amFilm is THE best choice for your Kindle Fire.  Take it from someone who has already researched and tried the more expensive options.
$review_summary.: Finally, a very good film

In the 3 months my Galaxy S3 has been in the Ballistic case it has experienced all of those drops without a scratch and working perfectly. This is the perfect case for a phone dropper.  The rubber protects both when dropped face down and on the edge without being super bulky.  YES...I've done both.  Don't ask me how because the case is really grippable.  It did interfer with my first screen protector, which was somewhat flimsy with questionable adhesive.  Switched protectors and now I imagine I'll be using this phone until I'm embarrassed to still be carrying it.

This setup did not interfere with the trackball operation.Update: I have removed one star from my earlier review due to the following. I have noticed that using Shift+I will intermittently result in no response from keyboard. I have to toggle cap-lock on in order to create a capital "I". Strange and minor issue but since capitalizing the letter I is so common, it becomes annoying. Also there is no toggle light for cap-lock or number-lock. So theres no visual way of knowing whether they are toggled on or off. Again, minor but not deserving of 5 stars.

 The install is very straight forward, and was complete in 5-10 minutes.This drive is very quite, almost silent even when at full operating speed (writing a 40-60gb video file, etc)I like having everything organized, and this drive really helped with that, since I can keep everything on it until I know what to do with it...or get time to work with it

$review_text.: I bought this unit as a replacement for one of my Back-UPS 1500 (not Pro) units. My only beef with this unit is the outlet configuration. The old units had 8 outlets, 6 with battery protection and 2 surge only, which I never used anyway. The new unit has 10 outlets, 5 battery protected and 5 surge. So effectively it has one fewer usable outlets. Since I am powering 2 computers, monitors, speakers and networking equipment, this means I am short one outlet. Plus only a couple outlets have ample space to attach bulky DC adapters. Other than that I love the new unit much better. I am glad they ditched the single multi-function button of the old units in favor of a three-button configuration. On the old units I was afraid to mute the alarm for fear of accidentally powering off. On the new unit, the mute button is separate, plus powering off requires the power button to be held down 2 seconds, and it's recessed, making an accidental power-off unlikely. I like the LCD display function plus the ability to manage UPS configuration settings without having to install Power-Chute, which doesn't run on Linux anyway.

$review_text.: Still getting used to typing on this. It's s different feel. It feels like the cover doesn't fit exactly right over the keys. I can feel it wrinkling under my fingers. Also, the print ("enter", "delete", etc.) on some of the keys doesn't line up and this is more obvious the more you depend on the backlight. It is really cute, and solves my loose E key problem, so I guess it's okay.

$REVIEW.: I read articles every day from CNET or other tech websites that beg people not to pay ridiculous prices for HDMI cables.  This one works great and it is 10ft!!  Most cables are 6ft which is plenty long...if it were 1995.  But I like having options so that extra 4ft of cable is great so one does not have to hang their smaller device from their tv which might be hanging on a wall...6ft off the ground.  Know what I mean?Would have given it 5 stars but yesterday I plugged it into my ASUS Transformer tablet to watch a movie on my hdtv and there was some &#34;static&#34; present on the screen...not sure how to describe it...like whenever you would try to watch a cable channel back in the 80's and it did not come in quite 100% clear.  I figure it must be my tablet because I have used this cable on other devices with Mini HDMI ports and it works perfect.Good buy.

$REVIEW.: We got it for the Panasonic GF5 Camera, and another set for Panasonic GX1.  12V charger cable will become handy one day.  Everything seems to be in decent quality.  Batteries seem to hold charges well so far, but haven't really put it through heavy load yet.The charger supports 100/110VAC, 220VAC, 12VDC.  The charging base seems to be shared among other kits for different batteries.  just a different plate is offered in each kit.  I only wish I could get BLD10(for GX1 camera) charging plate, so I wouldn't have to buy a whole another it for that camera too.Bottom line - works well, hold charges well, and as far as I can tell, the in-camera charging indicator works.

$review_text.: Souls have been out for quite sometime now.  With all the hype surrounding the beats product line, these have pretty much flown under the radar.  I decided to give these a try after owning a set of SMS Street by 50, and a pair of Beats earbuds.  Both broke on me as this is what caused me to turn my attention to the souls.  I came across the souls and decided to give them a shot.  After a few weeks of listening, I fell in love with them. The sound quality is superb.  Better than those of the Beats and SMS.  Bass response is there and sufficient as I have a few Lil Jon songs in my playlist, and the bass just booms and bangs with out distorting the mids and highs.  These are the best ones to pick up as the SL300s only sound good while the headphones are still battery powered.  Out of all three rapper headphones these are hands down the best.  They are the cheapest(bought mine when amazon had them for $120) and well worth the money.  The souls have loud crisp highs and booming bass quality as where the SMS have really weak bass, but good highs.  The beats studios just have an unnecessary amount of bass that drowns out the mids and highs and are highly overpriced for the sub par sound they emit.  Reason why I compare these to the studios is because they blow the solo's out the water with sound quality.  These are just that good!!!!!The Good: Loud crisp highs, Good and responsive bass, Sound quality is great, Cheapest out of all three rapper headphones, Stylish, light weight, headband is well constructed and comfortable.The bad: Sound leaks but not as bad as the Beats Studio, ear cups are on ear which can be uncomfortable for different sets of ears, only two colors available.All in all, these are some terrific headphones.  After owning a pair of both beats and SMS headphones, I can say that the Soul SL150's are the best of the best!  With sound close to those of the audio Technicas, these are a must have if you love sound quality.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty Good Headphones.  Definitely the best out of all three rapper headphones.  Highly underrated.

$review_text.: These were my first experience buying Grados. When I plugged them in and listened to some music, I realized right then and there that I could never go back. The sound is PRESENT in an exciting way, unlike the pricier cans that claim natural reproduction but sound dull as paint. Grados accentuate midrange, so vocals and horn instruments come to life -- you feel the music in your gut. The bass is not muddy, not overpowering, but boy do you feel it! I think sound is really subjective, and the Grado sound appeals to a certain group of people, myself included, who don't find the sound emanating from Boses, AKGs, Sennheisers,etc., to be all that great.Ah, yes, but then there's the comfort factor, or lack thereof. Folks, there's no way of putting a smiley face on this -- these cans are uncomfortable to use for long periods... even short periods. I never TRULY adjusted to this, despite the sublime sound. Which is why I sold the 325is on eBay and proceeded to purchase the Grado gs1000i headphones at the gulp-inducing price of $995 -- and these are VERY comfortable because the ear pads cup your ears and don't press against them. As you might guess, the sound of the gs1000i cans is spectacular. In closing, though, I'll reiterate that the 325is are great headphones, and by all means get them, but be ready for some hurt.

$REVIEW.: I'm giving this Four Stars on the basis of the quick loading time and nice HD quality if offers compared to my original Roku and the XD. It would be five (love my ROKU's) except that there were some bad mis-steps on the Netflix and some of the other UI designs. It's hard to explain w/out visuals, but basically now when you're browsing titles it needs to display an unnecessarily large image of the miiv, almost like and ad, and there is no way to turn it off. I would rather have more space to see the other icons and I really don;t want to be browsing for titles for my kids and have to go through big photos of zombies and vampires and whatever else is popular in moves these days just to find Thomas or whatever. I seriously might switch to amazon-only at this point. Other than that this new ROKU is 5 stars.

$review_text.: Like so many have said before.  DO NOT ever consider paying more for HDMI cables.  I got a 25 foot length.  Absolutely no trouble.  Pulled it through a ceiling as well.  No issues.  Nice and flexible.  I have a 20 ft length of cable I purchased that is a 22 or 24 gauge wire.  It cost 3-4x what this cost.  It looks and feels much tougher than this one from Bluerigger but as long as you are reasonably careful you shouldn't have any trouble.Addendum... (I have decreased my rating to account for the problem described below)I upgraded my Panasonic AE-900u projector to a 3-D capable Optoma HD33.  Took we a week of on-and-off tinkering to figure out why I couldn't get the Optoma to recognize ANY signal across the cable.  I hadn't moved it or stressed it.  It won't pass a readable signal from my Onkyo SR-605.  I knew the amp was not 3-D capable but I figured the Optoma could take a HDMI 1.3 signal and it can...with the right cable.  I double checked by connecting my sony blu ray and then my xbox directly to the HD33.  The blueRigger failed to supply a signal for either.  My other, higher quality cable passed the signal fine.  I'm not sure if I should as for a refund or not, since originally it worked with the other projector.  Just be aware.  If you have a Optoma HD33 purchase at your own risk.

$review_text.: Started taking the train to work when we moved our office which includes a great 0.6 mile uphill walk from the station (Walk all the time, so I'm really enjoying this new mode of travel in lieu of sitting in my car on the freeway). PC is a HP EliteBook 8760w with two HDD's which is an awesome machine, but a bit of a monster in terms of size and weight and not too comfortable hanging from my shoulder. Even with the additional sleeve I use to protect the PC finish this case fits great. A little snug, but it fits and zips up with very little effort, just have to keep the fabric flaps out of the way. There's plenty of space for the power brick and peripherals and the additional space for files and other necessities works for my needs. For a 17.3&#34; Laptop you can go with either a vertical style, or one of the few horizontal styles like this. Using the train I opted for this style to fit under the seat and couldn't be happier with this purchase including the price I paid.

$review_text.: We just got back from a shoot. The crane works magnificently. Very smooth. You just have to add things like a crane jib stand. Having read the reviews the stand doesn't pan and the panning bearing sold by proam doesn't fit the stand that they sell. My plan is to use my heavy Ravelli tripod with a manfrotto half 75mm bowl and mount the panning bearing and then mount the crane to the panning bearing.For this shoot I mounted the crane to a heavy duty tripod and head. But the issue with this, is the plate... in my opinion, the tilt doesn't lock because the crane is too heavy for it to hold.

$REVIEW.: I've had this amp for over a year now and it is still going...that doesn't mean it's perfect. It cuts out when I turn the volume up to a certain level.  I've had it connected in two different formats.  Also, I'm no pro and I installed it all with no help, so my findings may be the result of my own shortcomings.  First, I had it connected to a single Pioneer 10&#34; subwoofer (800W)  and two rear 6.5 inch speakers (150W X 2).  I had to adjust the gain to low on the sub and even lower on the rear speakers and also lower the subwoofer level on the Pioneer head unit in order to keep the thing from cutting out when I turned the volume up past thirty (0-50).  I figured I was putting too much of a load on the unit, so I disconnected the rear speakers, ran them back through the head unit and ran the unit with only the single subwoofer in mono.  This gave me a much richer, deeper and louder bass.  However, the problem with cutting out still remains.  I'm considering inserting a capacitor into the system to see if that solves the problem. Also, since I have had this unit for so long, I'm not sure if I received a faulty product or if I am expecting too much from the product.

This is important bc I have seen cases that don't have that velcro and people have ended up having their ipad slip out of the case causing dents and cracks.  All the holes seems to be cut in the right places.  It stands up pretty well.  The flap has magnetic closures to keep it in place when closed.It does smell bad but description does say it is PU Leather (not real).  It got a little better w/ time after airing it out, but it doesn't knock me out.  The smell was offensive when first removed from the plastic bag, but only then.

$REVIEW.: I've owned the SR80i for over a year, but recently decided to try a few different headphones.  These included:Martin Logan Mikros 90 - Great smooth headphone at current prices, especially if you need a closed designLogitech UE4000 - Big disappointment, bass heavy, sounded muffledAudio Technica M50 - Bass heavy, otherwise okay, doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion.My reference headphone I kept coming back to was the Grado.  It had wonderfully crisp highs with low tight accurate bass (not boomy and exaggerated like so many other headphones out there today).  The only downside is that these are an open design so sound &#34;leaks&#34; out.  The Grado is well built and sounds beautiful.  If you find the high too high, use your equalizer to lower them a bit, if you want more bass, use the eq to boost it.  In my opinion a good headphone should faithfully reproduce the source material and the Grados do an excellent job at their pricepoint.

A bit red in some scenes,but no complaints about it, specially for the money spent.My main problem is no vertical keystone correction. Projectorh have to be positioned in them middle of the picture, in most cases that means rather low.Other thing is 75 inch distance. Short.Basically that means it's very hard to seat in the middle of the picture,because you end up with projector in the line of sight.Another thing is that you can't charge it and use it if battery is empty.But enough with criticism, it is nice machine for the money and it will be used for alot of other things.So no regrets from me, just few things to consider before buying.

No issues here, this cable is solid, very high quality, packaged in a nice BlueRigger box instead of a typical bag, and I'm very, *very* pleased. Oh, and it works great, no issues @ 1920x1200, even audio is sent to my monitor.

$review_text.: As others have stated, it comes with an external, two prong, powerblock.  The adapter part that attached to the hard drive has 3 connections, one for SATA (at the smaller end), one for your conventional (E)IDE drives (3.5 inch) and one for the 2.5 inch laptop drives.  The 2.5 inch connection connects to a laptop HDD and doesn't require the external powerblock.I've tried this in Win8 and used it on a few HDD.What I encountered is that the first drive is detected and mounted.  Disconnecting the drive and mounting another drive is where things got tricky.  I actually had to disconnect the drive, go into my device manager, uninstall the removed drive, connect the new drive and scan for new hardware,  The system prompted me to reboot but that was not needed.  Then in the properties of the new drive, I clicked on volumes and 'populate'.  That actually mounted the new drive and after refreshing explorer it was visible and accessible.  My steps may have been overkill, but they worked for me.
$review_summary.: Works with 2.5 and 3.5 internal HDD

$review_text.: Very Nice sound, Bluetooth sounds great,I send the bluetooth music to my BueAnt M1 speaker or my Insignia bluetooth headphones. FM radio works well on wired headphones only because you need the wire for an antenna. Now this product would of gotten 5 starts except that it does not accept the latest playlists. It only accepts .pla playlists and they are only used on old windows players. Maybe there is a firmware upgrade, but I don not know. So since it has a Micro SD slot, I own a couple Micro SD's (they are cheap now) and I transfer my hard rock songs on one, classic guitar on another etc. And then I play the Micro SD card I want. Or you can do what the other reviewer suggests, retag your songs with MP3 tag software and this insignia will load them in a certain folder.

$review_text.: I've only had this a few days, but have used it quite a bit. My wife and I have it on in the morning while we breakfast and read/play with our iPads. I'd like to give it 5 stars because, except for the one flaw, which is that it's VERY slippery to hold (almost dropped it the first time I handled it), it has no flaws and works superbly. Why not 5 stars? It's because this is an audio device and while the sound is perfectly fine--open with good bass and a balance between instrumentals and voice--for what it is (wireless, small form factor, lowish price), it is not GREAT sound for the price; it is quite good sound. We particularly like that it can be anywhere in the room (range is at least 35 feet; haven't tested it's max distance yet) and that we can play music on it from so many devices. Usually it's a tablet or MP3 player for us. I would buy this again in a heartbeat, and I have no disappointments with it.

$REVIEW.: My Network is a Sonicwall T120, a DLing POE switch (10/100 mbps) and a WG102 and WG103 access point doing the wireless. I currently use the WG103 as an AP to provide redundancy for the WG102 in case one fails but that has not happened. I had one of the MIMO rangemax APs from netgear but it became unreliable and required weekly reboots so I replaced it. This thing used to be a bridge from the garage to the house and it worked flawlessly.I have several Laptops using various chipsets and operating systems and they all work well. (Atheros, broadcom)  (WinXP, Win7, Linux).  My WiFi Nook, Samsung LED TV, Apple iPod Touch all work well without issue. The GUI is a little slow but that is only an issue when you first configure the device.If you have a small business that can be covered by 6 APs or less I would definitely recommend this product. The additional cost of a WLAN controller is just not worth it for small business. And Lifetime warranty can not be beat.Pros:POE supportLifetime Warranty54M or 108M support (if you have the correct NIC or use same models for bridging)

$REVIEW.: What can I say about this product that hasn't already been said? Extremely well engineered. I've dealt with so many tech products that have not lived up to their promises. This one goes above and beyond. It is a bit pricey but well worth it.. you get what you pay for.My only complaint with the ZP90 in particular (and this may be a shortcoming of my Pioneer home theater receiver or possibly improper receiver configuration) is that it is lacking in rich, deep bass response. I'm using the coax digital connection into the receiver and have a 350 watt subwoofer that performs well with other sources (e.g. DVR, Bluray, etc). But the bass response is lacking when I play music sources from the ZP90. Not sure if streaming Internet media can support this kind of dynamic range?Great product. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is not a super quick charger. I would say that when putting in new/recycled batteries it would take about 5 hours to charge. Not a big deal for me as I always have a spare set of batteries ready just incase.One thing that does bugs me is the battery level indicator. When the batteries are fully charged I take them out and put them back in again the reading says that it was only half charged and it would take another hour or so of charging to be fully charged again. I don't know if it's because I need to recyle the batteries again because they're still new or if the indicators are not very accurate.The batteries do get a little hot so make sure you let them cool down for a few minutes before using them.One feature that I do like is the recycle mode. Very useful imo. to just hit recycle and let the charger drain the battery then automatically recharge again without me having to physically do it.Overall I'm happy. The batteries last a long time when using it in my camera flash. Beats the hell out of wasting money on Alkalines.So I give it 3 stars I took 1 off for the battery indicator and 1 for the not so quick charge as claimed.

$review_text.: I have a lot of different ear buds and headphones. I'm not an audiophile, but I am a bit picky about the sound quality and comfort of things I'm wearing on my ears. While these are nowhere near the quality of high-priced buds, they're adequate replacements for the stock buds that come with most consumer electronics.Audio quality is decent, but not awesome. The bass is a little limited unless you cover the little holes on the outside end of the buds. I didn't notice these do much more than my other mid-quality earbuds in terms of noice-canceling, though. For music, videos, and standard functions these are fine if you're not an audiophile. They're certainly better than the cheap "style over substance" Skull Candy buds I'm seeing everywhere. The range on these is better, and frankly, I think they look a little less cheesy, too. The metallic look is polished and clean. In fact, when it comes to looks I'd say the photos don't do these earbuds justice. They're kind of nice-looking.However, I do notice there is nothing in the way of labeling which bud is right channel, and which is left channel. Some of us listen to music or videos that use stereo effects a specific way, and without knowing which bud to put in which ear, it's all trial-and-error. A little "R" on one of them would have been nice. This is kind of a no-brainer for audio equipment!The little case they come with is really nice. It's good for keeping them around, but out of the way.The packaging was, as described, frustration free. There is a lot of cardboard involved, but that's better than a terrible hard polymer case that will only get cut open and trashed. I appreciate this option in products, and I hope more suppliers take advantage of the Amazon Frustration Free packaging. Kudos also go to Amazon for shipping it in a sane way.  The last Frustration Free item I got was a small item shipped in a giant box filled with lots of packing materials. Amazon has listened to our complaints about shipping with reasonable packaging.All in all, for ten bucks these are a good buy. I wouldn't have recommended them at the "regular" price, but at a discount? Sure! They're a heck of a lot better than the earbuds included with the iPod, Zune, or most other MP4 players and portable media players. If you're trying to decide between these and Skull Candy, get these... Unless style is more important to you. If, however, you're REALLY picky about sound and don't mind spending a little more money, you might consider moving up to something in the near-audiophile range.As with anything that is designed to interface with human senses, your mileage may vary.

$REVIEW.: I was most worried that the sound on this set might be inferior so I also ordered a sound bar, but in fact the sound quality is so good that I don't need the sound bar

There are more connections than almost anyone would ever need

The controls are placed very subtly on the front lower frame instead of on the side as so many sets have
They are much like a classic iPod's buttons--perfectly accessible yet hardly noticeable
The controls are extensive and you can even turn off the standby light if you like


The remote seems quite solid and complete, but with Dish Network I needed it only for the setup


The picture is perfectly sharp and clear from almost any angle, though I have no other set nearby to directly compare to

My only comment on picture quality is that film looks a bit like video during fast moving scenes
It isn't too noticeable and I'll quickly get accustomed to it
Overall I would highly recommend this set for quality at such a good price.

$review_text.: We have multiple sound and video systems throughout the house and upgrade every few years to keep current
Frankly I had been convinced that I needed gold plated connectors, heavy duty wire etc etc, but decided to try these out as I was just tired of paying the high price for premium cables
So I used them to wire up a new Yamaha 675 AV receiver for my home theater

 I didn't put a meter on them but I swapped in a pair of premium cables from another system to compare them and I can't hear any difference at any volume
 So bottom line, As I replace/upgrade in the future and have to get additional cables I'll be using Amazon Basics cables


Great value for the money and no discernible difference in performance.

$review_text.: UPDATE:  Dropped by another star...  Tried using a rubber-tipped stylus for handwriting and drawing.  Way too much drag.  Handwriting was slow, jumpy, and frustrating.  Had to remove this screen protector to be able to use my notetaking apps in handwriiting mode.---The back protector has a great texture.  I like it better than Zagg and Ghost Armor.  It was a challenge getting a clean install however.  I found it easiest to start on the edge with the volume button.  Even then, I had to remove the cover and start again.  Alignment was a challenge.  Once on, it fit well.  I did end up with a spot with wrinkles, however.  I pulled the cover up a bit to remove them, but they were set.  The front, as usual, was a lot more challenging.  3M provides an alignment strip (it is supposed to help hold down the front cover in proper alignment.  You place the cover on top of the iPad (before removing the adhesive on the cover), and essentially tape the cover in position. You then peel from the bottom and push the application along with the alignment tool ( a piece of cardboard provided with the kit).  I ran into trouble when the alignment strip would not stay put as I started to peel the the cover to apply it.  I had to realign once, and then the second time the alignment strip gave way, the right bottom corner picked up some dust. In my opinion, the alignment strip turned out to be more trouble.  But what IS  different, is that the bubbles not associated with dust take on a micro-bubble look and do dissolve out.  So while my application looked terrible at first, now it looks decent except for a couple of pesky dust particles.  Still, 3M really should provide two kits in a package.  It's just too expensive of a mistake, especially if you want a perfect install.  If you really want perfection, I think you will still need to go to a mall kiosk (Zagg and Ghost), or buy a kit at an Apple Store and have them do the install.The feel of the front cover once installed is pretty good, but maybe just a touch sticky feeling.  I do like it better than the naked screen, however.  Colors look fine, and the retina display on the iPad3 still looks super sharp.  So in summary, a decent product, but be prepared for a challenging install.  If you happen to be good at the installation based on past experience, this is a good, quality kit.

$REVIEW.: I brought this gps because many of my other gps's have outdated maps which can't update or have problems acquiring a satellite signal.  This gps is excellent because maps are relatively recent and acquires a signal fairly quickly for a reasonable price.  This gps doesn't have the bells and whistles of other gps with its elaborate features, but just enough to get you going.One thing that I am annoyed about this gps is the confusing documentation.  First of all, the gps doesn't say that it is an 255wt, but it is an 255w.  The manual have references of an 205w but references many other models.  In fact, the only thing that references this gps as an 255wt is the box itself.  I am guessing that since Garmin sells so many different models, they have an one-size fits all mentality in their manuals.  Another thing is that you have to connect your gps to your computer and register in order to able to get traffic updates.

The flip around to front for access is handy and smooth. I need to get more accustomed to the top zipper...it's quite secure...which makes it a tad cumbersome (this is minor).In the top and side pockets there is room for extra batteries, other like-size accessories.

$REVIEW.: Computer networks and securing them is my 9-5 job


When a personal friend with a personal business needed a replacement wireless router, I re-visited the consumer wireless router scene and have some recommendations.Brand: Linksys is out, Netgear is in

Take your old Linksys router and turn it into a repeater with dd-wrt


And I'm a long time Linksys and Cisco guy
Netgear just has the better features - secure and convenient.Feature 1: Guest wifi! Set up 1 or 2 separate wifi hotspots in your house


Great for guests, visitors, gadgets that don't support PSA-PSK security

Importantly, keeps people away from your business computers.Feature 2: Optionally isolate each wireless person from each other
Definitely do this on guest networks!Feature 3: This router has 2 antennas, run 1 or 2 wifi networks (2.4GHz=b/g/n and 5.4GHz=a/n ranges) _and_ 1 or 2 guest wifi hotspots
This is great for a busy house! This did not give me any better than average range (distance), however

For the business I ended up with a repeater (reprogrammed the old Linksys!) to extend one of the networks in an old Victorian house.Feature 4: 100Mb wired network ports

If you want want your wired devices to communicate faster, move up to the WNDR3700 which has 1000Mb (gigabit) wired network ports.Feature 5: USB port for sharing a USB flash stick or hard drive, even over the Internet (web and http, alternate port numbers optional, password protected)

Need to access only a few files from the office from any computer (e.g., client PC)? Want to back up your computers or share a music collection? 1 year warranty, typical.Missing Feature: The USB port doesn't support printers

That would really have made me an evangelist


In the meantime, either 1) buy a wireless printer or 2) connect the printer to a computer that is left on all the time and share it.Other Features: The web filtering is very weaksauce
If you have kids, go with the free K9 Web protection from Blue Coat

I'm not a gamer, so I can't review how it performs there
I can't accurately say how easy it is to set up, I am very technical

Seems easy to me


It has a traffic meter if you have a cap on your Internet connection


It can be a repeater, too, even splitting the 2 radios different ways

The "go green" power switch /power off wireless features are overrated


At least you can turn off the bright blinking blue lights once they start annoying you.Result: My friend and I *both* now have this device and are very happy with it.

Getting two of them was a bonus as not only will it keep the camera and LCD screen buoyant but also  attached extender pole.I have tested both options and can confirm that ONE float will keep the GOPRO (with LCD bacpac attached) afloat but is not enough to keep it afloat with the pole attachedBut with TWO Floats attached, no issues...the full kit of GOPRO, LCD Bacpac and Extender Pole all stayed afloat.Mission accomplished!!

$REVIEW.: These CD/DVD sleeves are a great idea - I love the fact that they are made in the USA from 100% recycled materials (85% post-consumer) and are themselves completely recyclable.  I even like the appearance - flecks of slightly different shades of brown in the cardboard, and the logo on the back embossed rather than printed with ink.I have to knock off a point for the construction and cost.  The back panel is solid, and is attached via 3/4" flaps on either side.  But, rather than gluing these flaps to the outside of the sleeve which would have given a 100% smooth, protecting surface inside, the flaps  are glued to the inside of the sleeve.  The sleeve is more attractive with this design, but its main function should be to protect the inserted media I think.  The cost at the time of this writing is double that of plastic jewel cases, and six times the cost of plastic sleeves.  That seems too high of a price premium for being "green".Kudos to ReBinder for this environmentally friendly made-in-the-USA product.

$REVIEW.: Check out the savings at Electronics expo! Used coupon code WS901X5750 and got the Denon for under $400.00.This is a great receiver
The 1910 powers my Paradigm monitors and sound far better then my Onkyo did

Love the way the Denon sets it self and even dolby pro logic on my old VHS tapes sound great
If your looking for a great receiver yo really need to check out the 1910.

$review_text.: The only fast thing about this laptop is the mouse cursor area... Way to fast as written by others, almost uncontrollable!I repair PC's, reformat and know my homework. So when reading the spec on this win 8 laptop you would think I knew what I was getting into. I love windows 8 so that is not the problem. It is this Laptop! I felt like I went back in time to the slow delays of windows 2000. This is the slowest laptop of the post windows7. Also, battery life is nothing like mentioned. I got 1.5hour continuous use at best. Now I just read the specs again and I still think this think should Rock The Bells. But mine didn't! Another issue I had and reported was that the screws on the bottom looked like the heads had been messed with. That was my main concern, then to have it not preform not even close to what they claim???? Makes one wonder. Did I have a rebuilt or is this a bad Laptop????

$REVIEW.: After over 100 hours of use, I think these compact speakers is decent and nothing spectacular like other reviewers stated. Let go over the sound on these speakers, for the low = Does not seem to exist (even though klipsch rated 92db), mid = Fair, high = good. For movies these speakers produces good sound, but music listen I rated them fair nothing great about them. In 5.1 setup combo deals they are build for home theater rather than music so don't expect these to sound like retired B&W; or Martin logan like other reviewer stated cause I own the Logan Vista.Overall listed suggested price $700 is just way to high and even though price came down to $500, for what these speakers can produces. I rated 3 star been a good decent speakers.

$review_text.: I read great things about this player on CNet and it largely lives up to expectations.  Sound is great, and it has a lot of fun features and a beautiful screen for video (even if small).  My only complaint is that battery life is not what I had hoped - expected less than the 20+ hours advertised but I am actually getting less than 10 hours per charge.  Not much warning when it goes - started a gym workout with one bar on the battery indicator and it was completely dead within 20 minutes.The click interface takes some getting used to and you may have to use the hold button to avoid accidental clicks when in use, but I like it better than a scroll wheel.Other than the battery and some minor irks, this is a very high quality player and I am happy with my purchase.

$REVIEW.: I own a few external hard drives.  For the price, this one is just fine.  I have some that are of the same capacity, which are much, much smaller.  This one is about the size of a hard cover book (Say, Grapes Of Wrath sized).  I have some drives that are of this same capacity which are about the size of one of those old dime store paperpack pocket novels.BUT - for the price - this is a good deal.  It comes with a power cable (I wish more of these were USB powered) and a USB cable.  I transfered 15,000+ files from my computer to this drive and it took just over one hour.  That seemed slow to me.  I had this plugged into my &#34;fastest&#34; USB Port (meaning the USB 2 port on my laptop), and so I expected it to be quicker.  Of course, the speed of the source file plays a factor in the transfer rate.It's a plain black box - no bells or whistles here (big lights, a stand to set it vertically).  I actually had a hard time seeing the transfer light on this one.I don't mean any disrespect by giving it 3 stars.  It's a good drive.  I recommend it.  I just was not blown away by it.

$review_text.: Outwardly the housing appears to be of good quality and sturdily made in use however things are not quite so straight forward.Assembly/setup removal of the foot and bay is straight forward enough, five screws and the job is done
The instructions state to insert the drive label side up, however,if you are installing a SATA drive be warned the connectors are L shaped and and you will have to invert the drive to be able to connect them, the SATA cable is short and fairly rigid, therefore you cannot lay the drive flat and close the enclosure

I tried with both 3.5 and a 2.5 inch drives, the result is the same
The signal and power cables on the control card are short and run over the top of the SATA plug, I only just managed to connect the SATA cable without damaging the other cables.The power supply cable is short, 800 mm so you either need a power extension cord or to be sitting on top of a power outlet, this cannot be compensated for using the USB cable as it is also less than a meter long.Reading some of the other reviews I wonder if I got the "lemon" the casing appears robust and well made, it is a pity that corners appear to have been cut on the details and for that reason I would not recommend this unit.

$review_text.: I bought this system because like everyone else, my TV sound was pretty weak.  I didn't want to deal with running speaker wires all over so I went with the sound bar.  Its definitely easy to set up with my Sony TV and the sound is better than the TV.  But it isn't as good as I was expecting from reading all the other reviews.  I wish I could use the sound bar along with the TV speakers but using the pass-through the sound is off just slightly and creates a slight echo.  Seems like I need to adjust the volume quite a bit more when switching channels or playing a DVD than I did with just the TV sound.  Some channels are good at 14 and some I have to crank up to 40.

$review_text.: Lets face it--Beats headphones are more fashion accessories than an audio equipment and as such they function exquisitely. They are stylish, instantly recognizable, and at least this particular pair is very well made. The build quality of these headphones is first rate. Supple leather, attractive metal. No doubt they'll last quite some time. They come with an iPod and airline cable and a carrying case to protect them.Now for the downside, as audio gear these headphones are poor performers. The sound reproduction lacks clarity, balance, is bass heavy, and has a peculiar coarseness. If you are the sort of person who listens to pop music, this may be just fine for you. I tested them for about a month. 4 - 6 hours/day. I found these headphones enjoyable for electronic music, trip hop et. all (Pepe Deluxe, Zero 7, Shpongle). They were tolerable for folk and indie (Fleet Foxes & Andrew Bird and the like)-- although the vocalist in each was muddy. We really started to run into trouble with Jazz--My Miles Davis and Art Blakey were lifeless, by the time we got to Ravel, Dvorak and Holst-- all was lost.The noise-cancellation feature is quite nice although it does add a bit of hiss. I wish you were able to turn this feature off. I used these headphones in a construction zone-- (this was in fact my motivation for reviewing them), and I am happy to report they work very well against hammers, drills of all varieties, carpet installation, furniture assembly etc.All in all-- you're going to need to ask yourself are you buying headphones or fashion accessories-- if you want fashion accessories with moderate to poor audio performance (or you don't care because you only listen to pop) then by all means, get these headphones. They look great, are comfortable and are well made. If you are looking for audio quality then you would be much better served looking elsewhere.

Also a source of major irritation is that if you miss your turn it does not say make a U-turn instead it will reroute you sometimes miles to have you turn back. It assumes you missed the turn due to an obstruction such as road repair.I've never owned a different brand GPS so I cant compare it to other units.

$review_text.: Amazing response rate! This is the current top of the line for fast gaming . 144hz mode is great, but the real advantage is using 120hz mode with the lightboost trick. This trick eliminates basically ALL motion blur by syncing the backlight with pixel updates (so only correct images are displayed). This is at 120hz - so you get amazing response, no input lag, and no motion blur. Not sure how it can get any better than this as far as performance is concerned.One drawback is the color gamut. It is not top of the line, and probably worse than the average LCD panel in this price range. But that is the price to pay for its amazing performance specifications. Using the lightboost trick removes almost any calibration you can make to the monitor, so unfortunately there's not way to get both a great picture and great performance.The adjustable stand is great - lots of vertical movement, rotation (of the stand and monitor), and tilt. Not much downward tilt, so you'll have to make sure your eyes are at least at the middle of the monitor in a natural position, but the monitor collapses to that it's about 1 in off the the desk, so this shouldn't be problem in most situations.Haven't  used 3D on it yet (but the 3D features are required to do the lightboost trick). There's a new technology coming out, Gsync,  from nvidia that is the successor to the lightboost trick (since this isn't officially recognized by nvidia), but requires a hardware upgrade.  So far, this is the only monitor that supports Gsync (with the upgrade), though i'm guessing more monitors will come out with it built in.For the price, you cannot get a better gaming monitor.
$SUMMARY.: Best gaming monitor for pure performance

$review_text.: The description is a little confusing, since it says it has High-level inputs.  I can tell you it does not, at least not in the traditional sense where a speaker output from a car radio get connected to the amp. I purchased this to use with my Harley, which does not have RCA outputs. Given that this amp does not have the high-level inputs I needed, I had to send it back.

$REVIEW.: Purchased this cable modem to replace my 6 year old Motorola SB5121 that I have rented from Comcrapstic the whole time
Doing the math on the total rental fees I have paid over the years yields an amount of OVER $500!!! No more rental fees

The other modem I was considering was the Mot SB6141...everyone knows about Motorola though


I chose the Arris based on the CM820A being a "3 star certified" modem per Comcrapstic's rating scale on their approved devices page


The second reason would be on the fact that Arris is a great manu of telephony/cable modems, this is mainly what they are known for.Checking my speeds I am getting a solid and consistent 25 mbps down and 3.5 mbps up

This is phenomenal based on the fact that I am on the Performance tier

My power down is between 1.5-3 db with a 37-38 SNR on all 8 channels, awesome
My power up is 38 db, great


The intersting thing about that is that I split the signal twice before it goes to the modem, go figure


I am using PCT 2-way splitters on my setup.***ALWAYS snug up ALL of you coax connections with a wrench***Highly recommend the CM820A modem!!!

$REVIEW.: The fact that the producers of this product took the time to include the capacity of this battery puts it well ahead of others.  I have ordered batteries and have received batteries with no indication of their capacity.  For example the battery that came with my Olympus Camera was rated at 925 mili ampere hours.  This one is rated at nearly twice that.  I have high hopes for this battery (have not field tested yet).  It is the same size and fits in the camera and charger.  They also cared enough about their customers and product to supply some guidance with the product.  In the future I will not purchase batteries if the capacity is not noted.

$review_text.: After much testing, I have found a way to get good lightscribe results. Most advice given is to burn twice, which darkens the image, but leaves unsightly concentric light/dark circles on the disk. Lightscribe officially does not recommend burning twice for this reason.I have tried burning on best and reburning on draft, burning twice on normal, burning twice on best, and lastly burning on best and reburn normal. Burning the first round on best and the second on normal, gave the least visible dark/light circles, and darkened the image acceptably although I did notice a slight amount of softening. I am using Verbatim DVD+R discs.Update: I have burned several LightScribe discs now with "Best" then "Normal", and they all look really good and dark with no circular lines visible.

It should be noted that stranded wires are not comparable with this style of connector

If you are working with stranded wire try the Wago lever connectors
As for these all you need to do is insure that the stripped portion of you wire is relatively straight, and not too long


Insert the wire, give it a tug to insure it is completely seated
I've found that wires can be removed from the connector by twisting as you pull.

$REVIEW.: I received a gift certificate for Amazon and mentally spent it several ways before settling onJBuds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones with Travel Case (Jet Black) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]


 I read all the reviews for these and some other earphones before making my choice

 When they arrived, the first good thing was the new easy-to-open packaging

 (Thanks, Amazon!)  After the burn-in period, I experienced better sound than I had with my previous earbud-type earphones

 One feature that is a definite improvement for me is the almost tangle-free cords
 They are resilient and resist tangling


I've used them every day for the two weeks I've had them
 I followed the advice of some other reviewers and tried a different size from the ones that were on them, and I find the smallest size the most comfortable and effective
 Now, if my cat just hadn't chewed on one of them!  Must see about a replacement!

$REVIEW.: I have 4 of this general type of IR camera for my paranormal investigations group in Portland, OR which I have connected to a DVR. With this model you get what you pay for. It works but the entire camera body is made of plastic. I paid over $80 for one of my cameras and it is made of all metal.This model also has an extremely flimsy base. If you are mounting it to a wall you may have good results but if using the base alone it's not very sturdy and feels like it would be very easy to strip the threads. The image it displays is also very bright and washed out a little compared to my other cameras. The IR isn't as crisp so if it's detail you are looking for this may not be the camera for you. You will be able to see a person on the camera and if they are relatively close you will be able to ID them but if they are a little ways off you will have a hard time identifying exactly who it is.The depth of field is also zoomed in pretty tight. If I point this camera and my more expensive camera at the same object, the other camera shows the object at a distance and a lot of the surrounding area. This camera will have almost the entire screen filled with the object being viewed.For the price it's a pretty good deal. I may get another one to connect stand-alone to my laptop for a 5th camera to record with.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this case for my wife's new 5G iPod Nano


 This case is really fantastic

 The fit and finish on this is really impressive


 The iPod fits into it *perfectly* and all of the holes line up *perfectly*
 The clear case is great because it shows off the color of the iPod
 I was a little worried when I noticed that the case extends beyond the bottom of the case


 My fear was that accessories that connect to the dock connector and headphone jack wouldn't seat properly

 I'm happy to say that this has proven to not be an issue at all!  Which is good since the case isn't designed to be taken on and off a lot.Like others, I had an issue with the included screen protector film where glue residue was left behind when removing the tab


 It turns out that there is no need to remove this tab because it is attached to another piece of plastic film that is supposed to be removed.I contacted minisuit about this and they were very helpful in explaining this
 They are also sending me a replacement screen protector because I ended up ruining mine


 They informed me that they are working on some instructions to include in the package to prevent others from having this issue.All-in-all, a great product and product support organization!  I couldn't be happier

 I highly recommend this case.

$review_text.: I bought a refurbished XD for a second Roku. I'm so pleased with these units that it's becoming clear I might be able to dispense with a cable subscription. The first refurb unit I got was perfect. I bought a second, but it was defective. However, I was able to return it for a refund--inconvenient but that's what happens with refurbs. Not all of them are truly refurbed when you get them.The unit comes with an HDMI cable, which is convenient; the new units often do not include this and the HDMI cable is what you need to connect to a digital HD tv. It carries both the audio and the video signal. If you have an older analog TV, you need a RCA cable, which is the one with three plugs on one end, one on the other.It supports both 720p and 1080p speeds. You can use a Bluetooth remote with it, but it only comes with a regular IR remote.It doesn't have an ethernet port. So no way to connect wired to your internet. WiFi only.Some channels are free (Pandora) but many require subscription (like Netflix or Amazon Prime.) I found many channels that I liked that are completely free. If you have a kitchen TV (which is where this went) you can sign up for various food channels and see video recipes. Great for the cook--I found some Indian, Thai and vegetarian channels as well as All Recipes that would come in handy. (Before, I'd bring a laptop to the kitchen. This is easy to see.)I was able to load Facebook (you can see your photos and videos) and you can also load Flickr or Picasa, so if you want to do home "slide shows" of your vacation pictures, you can set that up. Lately, Roku has added YouTube, which was previously available only via a workaround.As to sports, you can purchase live sports packages such as the NBA League Pass, NHL GameCenter Live, MLS Matchday, UFC, and MLB.TV.For the price, this works really well.

$REVIEW.: I bought these due to size and heat constraints in a home theater PC. Also, low latency is really important in such a setting, especially for jitter-free music playback - much more so than higher frequencies.These sticks are running without a problem at 1.35V and 8-8-8-24 1T timings at 1600 MHz, a little better than advertised (the 1T timings, specifically). They have passed every Prime95 torture test and memtest86 run I've performed. Even with my wide CPU cooler, the low profile allows for no issues in installation.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Zagg is my usual go to screen protector so i was hesitant when i saw ArmorSuits MilitaryShield screen protector mainly because i had never heard of them prior to searching for screen protectors for my Nexus 7.generally Zagg can be a bit pricey but the quality is well worth the price. which, again, made me hesitant to by this screen protector from ArmorSuits. but i wanted to shop around and see what alternatives there were in quality and pricing. that's when i came across ArmorSuit.the price was amazing! it boasts the same quality and guarantee that Zagg offers and most importantly it was a &#34;Wet&#34; install (a bit more on that later). those features sold me on trying out the ArmorSuit screen protector.my requirements were simple but important when searching for a screen protector. 1. it needed to be relatively inexpensive 2. great quality since im protecting a pricey investment and 3. it has to be easy to install.we all hate installing screen protectors. it's meticulous and nerve racking. you want to make sure all dust and little hairs are off the screen. you need to make sure the protector is perfectly in line with the screen and you want to eliminate all air bubbles that might surface. it's work and it's annoying and that's just for phones. the same process for tablets are magnified.that's why i loved the ArmorSuit screen protector because it is a &#34;wet&#34; installation. you use the spray solution that comes with the protector, you spray it on the protector and lay it on your screen. what gives you peace of mind is that you dont need to lay it down perfect the first time. the moister from the solution allows you to adjust the protector to the optimal position of your screen. when you are perfectly aligned you use the squeegee that comes with it to remove any remaining moister from under the protector and flatten out any air bubbles that have formed.  it's as simple as that.so i would highly recommend purchasing this for any one of your devices. with the price point, quality and ease of use, it's a no brainer.also, unlike Zagg, it doesnt have any branding on the protector itself so you dont have to worry about seeing a distracting little watermark logo on your device screen.all in all definitely purchase this.

$review_text.: For the most part, I'm quite happy with my Coolpix 800 (bought at Amazon.com).  It certainly gets the job done, and the images are as good as what I've gotten with my 35mm SLR, if not better.  My main beefs are the ones that are well known about this camera:  the flash and zoom are both very limited (to the point where I pretty much consider this an outdoor camera - the one time that I did use it indoors extensively,  I set the sensitivity to ISO-400 and shot by available light), and I wish it were possible to manipulate the f-stop and shutter speed directly.  And I've got a new beef:  Due to the small size of the camera,  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the LCD screen.  But these notwithstanding, it is a great camera that takes good, well exposed crisp pictures, and that's the bottom line.

With the 720 TV, I get a nice image of the Home screen, good resolution.  But when I try to run an APP, such as Netflix or NBC News, I get the message that the resolution is too low for the APP.  The TV seems to reset the Surface resolution too low for the APPs.  There doesn't seem to be a good solution to this.  Others have suggested that I would need the $40 cable to make this work.  But I have my doubts.  Digital is digital, as they say.  I imagine I could be just as disappointed at $40 as I am at under $10.

$REVIEW.: This is a basic plastic strap that works by putting the metal ends over the terminals (no way to 'short' the battery through the plastic) and when the heavy battery is picked up by the terminals the metal is wedged to them

Make sure the metal ends are all of the way seated or it can drop, and make sure that the terminals are secure

The dropping battery could easily break a foot

It still requires some strength to pick up and some time and skill to position it, but it works well when used right


I would probably have gotten the metal type with a handle if I did this a lot, but all of my other batteries come with a built-in strap


This was for an OEM replacement for a defective battery within the warranty period

Hope this helps someone.

$REVIEW.: The Kodak EasyShare DX7590 is truly a very nice camera. This is my first digital camera and I was somewhat hesitant about what kind of digital camera to purchase.  However, after a lot of research and reviews, I decided on the DX7590, because for me, it is a middle of the road type of digital camera.  It is has enough pixels (5MP) to take great pictures, as well as a zoom (10x) that will allow me to capture moments from a distance.  Basically, the DX7590 allows me to take quality photos, even when I am not trying.  I purchased the extra memory, the 512 MG card, and I am able to take up to 315 shots.The camera dock is very nice and although I purchased the printer dock plus, I usually leave the camera sitting on the camera dock to charge.  It's small and convenient, that I have it sitting on my dresser corner...it's definitely a space saver.  I would also recommend purchasing the Kodak Printer Dock Plus.  So far, with the pictures I have printed, I have been very satisfied.  No jams, no lines, no bends...just good quality photos.  I wouldn't recommend however if a person has a lot of pictures to print to use the photo printer, it would probably be more beneficial to print them through an online retailer or take it to store as CVS or Target to print them out.  But for a few prints here and there, it's a great in home system.The two together, with me...makes a great team for photography....you can be the same!

 My only note is that the instructions provided are very simple and do not go into much detail on how to customize the delivered remote for devices or how to work with macros

 Can be figured out with some trial and error, but would be nice to have this spelled out more
 Would also be great to be able to search for codes by number - I had a few devices where I was unable to find a working code, but had the code from another universal remote
 Finding that code to apply was difficult since I had to basically manually search through the various devices until I found the code I knew to be working...



$review_summary.: Easy to use for most components - could benefit from more detailed instructions

$REVIEW.: I was gong to add this to a good signal strength line to improve it but instead it degraded the signal.  I did use it with the factory amp that came with it as well as the amp I have already.  Both performances were equally bad.  I have gone back to my original setup which will suffice with just the Db4e antennas direct antenna and a 15 db gain amp.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love my new Samsung LN32B360 720p LCD HDTV!!!!I knew I would like this t.v. the moment I took it out of the box. Although I was somewhat disappointed with this flat panel t.v having only 2 HDMI ports, I quickly got over it once turned it on. The picture quality this t.v. is amazing and the sound coming from it's speakers definitely impressed me to say the least. The t.v screen looks good from almost any angle. I'm happy with my purchase and I would definitely recommend this t.v to any who's in the market for buying a new lcd hdtv under 40" and won't put a huge whole in their wallet. I think 720p is sufficient for flat panel televisions under 40 inches. I think getting a 1080p flat panel t.v. under 40" would be a waste of many if you're buying it for the sole purpose of watching 1080p (1920x1080) resolution.I want to share my calibrated picture settings for this model t.v. with anyone who's looking to optimize their viewing pleasure. I'm content with these settings and I hope you find theses settings satisfying as well. Give Me Feedback on these settings.

$REVIEW.: I have used: a Garmin (2 different kinds), a Magellan, and the built-in navigation system that comes with some Ford cars.  Out of those three, the Garmin is my favorite, the Magellan is second, and the built-in car one is third (I won't even go into that one, since I assume you don't have navigation in your car if you're shopping for this).The main difference I found with the Magellan is that I found it to be slightly less intuitive to use than the Garmin (however, not by much -- they are different, but similarly easy systems to learn).  Both are somewhat annoying to set up initially (just set an evening aside!)Both have equal amounts of errors as far as routes go (I live in the Chicago area) -- but they are almost a "tie" in that area; they just make different errors.  Personally, I do like the initial (normal) display on the Magellan better, but the Garmin has a better 'lane' view or whatever it's called (i.e., which lane to be in for a particular exit -- important in the city).The Lifetime maps are just great -- no more annoying fees, which you'd probably never pay for anyway, since buying a new unit is usually cheaper!Only things missing from this unit?  Some have a bigger display, and others have Canadian maps as well -- this one does not.  Not a big deal for me, but think about it if you ever plan to travel north of the border (you don't want to pay for a unit and then pay for Canadian maps later -- you'd do much better to pay for the US/Canada one up front).----------Oh, and a quick note on iPhone/smartphone navigation -- at first, when I FINALLY got an iPhone 5, I thought, "It has turn-by-turn navigation!  I'll never use my GPS again!"  WRONG!  Here's why I found that my iPhone adds to, but by no mean replaces, my GPS:1.  First of all, most of the time, the iPhone is using a cellular and/or data signal to transmit your location -- as you know, those signals go down...a LOT.  Which means you lose your route mid-way (some paid GPS apps for the iPhone may be different, I'm told).2.  Second, it runs down your iPhone battery like crazy (a car charger may fix that), and you often can't do other things while the GPS is going (or you won't hear your next turn if you're on the phone)3.  If you wear polarized glasses, iPhone/iPad screens are very hard to see.  GPS screens aren't.4.  Cold climate?  You can push a GPS screen with a gloved finger (or even a pen cap, or anything that can create pressure)...not true with an iPhone!

Minus 1 star for this...Front panel audio has a common problem with noise


I still have to fix it, but the common solution is to use a different internal cable to connect it, or do a DIY solution on shielding it to stop the noise.In short, I'm really happy with it, so far is the best gaming ITX/DTX case you can find.

I've also charged the IMP50D from one of the USB ports on my 2011 MacBook Air 13".My only recommendation for improvement would be the ability to plug the IMP50D into my MacBook Air, plug my iPad and iPhone into the IMP50D and have everything be fully charged in the morning. I talked to the manufacturer and they explained that this wasn't possible. I couldn't think of a product that does do this, so I'll take that as fact.Still, that would be amazingly great.

$review_text.: I'd like to write a helpful review about the drivers disc, the nice tech support response, or the ease of editing the parameters to get it to function. But I can't.I plugged this unit into a Linux box (Ubuntu 11.04), powered up, and It Just Works (TM); no driver loading, no setup settings, none of that. Well, it works pretty good, too. Before, I was using a spendy Belkin USB wireless adapter on a short extender cable and saw two wireless networks. With the TP-Link on its included 5-foot cable I saw 7 networks, including a fire station over a mile away. My box's network icon now shows only two bars where the Belkin often reported three, so I'm guessing the Belkin had a high opinion of itself, whereas the TP-Link reported that it could handle more. But the number of signals tells the true story.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I am thoroughly impressed with the range and depth of this sub-woofer. I am not a "shake the walls"(even though this subwoofer is fully capable of doing so) kind of guy, but I do like a strong solid base when listening to my music. I played with the settings on my reciever and sub-woofer for the better part of an hour trying to find the sound I liked the most. It blew me away when I finally sat back and relaxed to listen to my music. I have always been apprehensive about buying subwoofers because 95% percent of the reviews I have read have to do with movies and not music. The other 5% usually say that "so and so subwoofer" is good with movies but not music. This is amazing with both. I am very happy with this purchase. You really can't go wrong with the price.As for a sub-woofer interconnect, you will have to buy it separately because the subwoofer does not come with one. I bought the "Monster Cable THXI100-SW16NF Thx Certified Sub Woofer Interconnect". It is long and decently priced(THX certified to boot).Note: (Read the Instructions that come with the Sub-woofer) Instructions state that the subwoofer should NOT be plugged into the accessory type AC outlets on the rear of your reciever. Also, there is a break-in period(as with all speakers) that I strongly suggest you adhere to if you want your subwoofer to last longer and produce a consistent quality sound.

$REVIEW.: I originally was pretty excited about this cover.  It is the "official" Amazon lit cover, and I thought it was very smart.The light pulls out from the corner and it feeds off of the power from your Kindle so you don't need to buy an external reading light that uses heavy batteries. As for light distribution, I was suspicious at first because in the pictures that Amazon provides, it shows that only the top right corner is lit - the rest of the Kindle has light, but not much. While the light favors the top half of the screen more than the rest, specifically the top right corner, it is not something you notice, and its convenience is worth something very slight.However, the light uses up a lot of the Kindle's battery. I read for about five hours on an airplane using it. When I boarded the airplane, I had 100% battery life. After five hours, because of the immense amount of battery the light used, I had only 10%. Let me add that I had wireless off, so the significant decrease was all the light.It's a smart light, but I would go with an external reading light.

$review_text.: I have been using this product for the past few years. The typical life-cycle of this product is about two years. It worked quite well for me as I like the convenience of not needing to worry about losing the passwords to access the sensitive data.  It also works pretty well on windows XP and windows 7 OS.A word of caution in using this device. The device is partitioned into both public and private partitions. The private partition is where it stores the finger-print protected data. The device came with a default of 100%l public partition but zero private partition. If you move your data to the device without repartitioning, the data will be stored in the public partition which everyone can access even though the fingerprint protection is enabled. You would have to manually create the private data partition and then put your sensitive data there. The other area of caution is that once you have the device plugged in and unlocked with the fingerprint validation, the data is still accessible even after you power off and reboot the PC without the need to go through the fingerprint validation again. I believe this applies to PC with USB ports which power stays on when the PC is powered off. This leaves a security risk if you forgot to unplug the device.By the way, unlike what one other reviewer stated, there is no way other unauthorized users can access the USB's private data once the fingerprint protection is set. You have to unlock the device with a valid fingerprint before you can reset the password and/or creating a new account to access the data.

$REVIEW.: I may be among the minority who actually prefers the "click-clacky" sound of this keyboard to Apple's chicklet alternative, but regardless of how you feel about the keys themselves, the solar capabilities and device-switching functionality will win you over in no time (I honestly didn't care much about the device switching, but I have to admit it's amazingly seamless). My ONLY nit is that the caps lock light does not remain lit when on (a design decision that I'm not sure I agree with), so occasionally, you may find yourself YELLING IN ALL CAPS WHEN YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO DO SO. I guess it's to save battery life, but as I so rarely use caps lock in the first place, I'd sure like a head's up when it's on -- seems like a setting option would have been a nice touch.Regardless, I love this thing.(BTW, if you're on a mac, the free CapSee app helps overcome the hidden capslock light).

$REVIEW.: I am not a sound engineer or professional musician
I do have these monitors, and they do offer very good value for their price


They are good,flat sounding monitors and are very powerful(the gain is set very low).But there are some minor drawbacks


These monitors do not quite have the weight I was expecting from them

The case is a bit thinner plastic and not molded evenly (tolerances seem a bit off)

This seems to color the sound a bit and there is a bit of uneven output from each side

The output can be changed and tweaked at the source to compensate, but that seems to defeat their purpose.I did laugh as other reviewers have stated, the emblems on the speaker grills were crooked and easily removed.The power LED does not bother me

In fact it reminds me to turn them off when I am done.I would use different speaker wire than is supplied.The upside: Powerful, clean amplification and good value.The downside: Casing adds colored sound, a bit uneven output.These are good active monitors for the price
Just not over the top crazy 5 star rating worthy.UPDATE:I was moving these monitors and "GASP" dropped the passive speaker about 2 1/2 feet onto a cement floor
Needless to say it did not like that too much

There were a few chips off the cabinet and a rattle (of course) that I had to address so I had to take the speaker apart


Once I got a look at the guts of the speaker, I became a bit less impressed with this unit

It has very cheap foam insulation only lining the sides and not the back, the tweeter capacitor is glued and appears very inexpensive

With the face off, the cabinet has considerable flex to it.With the rattle fixed, I am now toying with the idea of tweaking this unit
I am playing with the idea of replacing the capacitors, improving insulation and finding someway to brace the plastic case without increasing flex problems.These are definitively MONITORS and are VERY directional and placement is very critical for optimal listening


You will not fill a room with great sound with these but can enjoy them at ear level and positioned appropriately.After the "break in" period (bad pun intended) I would now rate these as a 3 star value.If one is looking for inexpensive, compact very good sounding computer/dorm room/apartment 2.0 SPEAKERS, I am very, very happy with the following:Lepai Tripath TA2020 amplifier (very small, clean amplifier) $29Dayton Audio Bookshelf Speakers B652 $39.50Speaker wire (your choice)3.5mm to RCA cable (to connect computer/MP3 player) $1.91An alternative set of speakers that are very nice sounding and if you wish to spend a little more are MTX 5I bookshelf monitors for $59.95.You can have a lot of fun with spending between $70-90 dollars for a set up less than these monitors


That is if you are looking for speakers, not monitors.Cheers!

$REVIEW.: The mouse function is too hard to use, especially for left-to-right motion.There are also no function keys.It is Win-centric, with special keys for Windows, making it less favorable for a XBMC/MythTV Linux HTPC, although the keys can be remapped.
$SUMMARY.: Mouse function useless
